"(CNN) -- Defending champions Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova moved into quarterfinals of their respective tournaments in Barcelona and Stuttgart Thursday as the build-up to next month's French Open gathers pace. Nadal is coming off a shock loss at the Monte Carlo Masters -- losing there for only the third time in 11 years -- but has showed little sign of an adverse reaction in his two matches to date on home clay. The world number one duly beat Ivan Dodig of Croatia 6-3 6-3 to earn a last eight clash against fellow Nicolas Almagro. Fellow Spaniard Almagro lost to Nadal in last year's final but earned his passage with a 6-3 6-3 success over Fernando Verdasco in another domestic clash. Nadal has won the title eight years out of nine in Barcelona and his passage to a ninth title has been eased by the shock exit of David Ferrer Wednesday to Teymeraz Gabashvili. It was second seed Ferrer who scored a rare win over his compatriot in Monte Carlo but he was unable to repeat this form against Gabashvili, who then secured his place in the last eight with a straight sets win over Inigo Cervantes. In other third round matches, 12th seed Marin Cilic of Croatia beat Spanish fifth seed Tommy Robredo 7-5 6-7 7-6, while Colombia's Santiago Giraldo saw off Dominic Thiem of Austria in another three-setter. Sharapova, who is returning to her best after injury, is the two-time defending champion on the red clay of Stuttgart and showed evidence of that class with a 6-4 6-3 over fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in one hour 32 minutes. Sharapova, who needs to reach the last four in the WTA Premier Level event to retain her top 10 status, must next play top seed Agnieszka Radwanska, a tough task as she acknowledged. ""Well, Agnieszka is number three in the world and obviously someone who's been playing extremely well to be in that position,"" Sharapova told the official WTA website. ""And I love these kinds of challenges. We've played each other many times, and there are certainly no secrets about each other's games,"" she added. Radwanska eased into the last eight with a 6-3 6-2 win over Italian Roberta Vinci. Former world number one Jelena Jankovic also beat Italian opposition in Flavia Pennetta, 3-6 6-2 6-3, while Serbian ninth seed Ana Ivanovic overcame Germany's Julia Goerges 1-6 6-2 6-3.","Rafael Nadal into quarterfinals of Barcelona Open .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- It was just before 8am on March 11, 2004 and I was making breakfast at home, listening to Spain's leading radio network. Suddenly there was a report of explosions at the Atocha train station downtown. The terrifying damage, we would later learn, had occurred about 20 minutes earlier: coordinated bomb explosions on four rush-hour trains that would leave 191 people dead and more than 1,800 wounded. But those initial hours were filled with confusion. I called CNN's main news desk in Atlanta -- it was just before 2am there -- and said that a major tragedy appeared to be unfolding in Madrid. Soon after I was on air, and very quickly our camera crew was outside Atocha station, close to my home. Across town, in a neighborhood by the Santa Eugenia station -- where one of the trains exploded -- nine-year-old Vera de Benito watched her mother behaving as never before. Her father, a telephone installer, had boarded a train for Atocha station that day. He never returned home. ""The first image was my mother, hysterical, trying to call on the phone. I imagine she was trying to locate my father,"" says De Benito, who's now 19 and studying journalism. ""I miss him so much. He's the first person I think of in the morning and the last person I think of at night."" The Madrid train bombings were the deadliest terror attack in western Europe since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people. The terrorists in Madrid, the authorities later determined, carried bombs in sports bags and backpacks onto four commuter trains serving the east of the Spanish capital. And then they got off, leaving their deadly devices to explode onboard. De Benito says that she always tried to think of her father and look to the future when she was growing up. ""I'd rather focus on him being proud, seeing me achieve my goals,"" she says. ""That's why I am always setting higher targets."" She's already an intern in the newsroom of SER radio, the same station I was listening to on that fateful morning. The attacks proved highly political in Spain. General elections had already been scheduled for just three days later and, in a surprise result, the ruling conservatives lost to the opposition socialists. The Spanish courts later convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the bombings, along with four Spaniards for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. A further seven key Islamic suspects blew themselves up three weeks after the train attacks as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb. Initial theories that the Basque terrorist group ETA had carried out the attack were later discredited by the police and international terrorism experts who blamed Islamic militants. But the alleged ETA role in the bombings has become an ongoing conspiracy theory still heard in some quarters in Spain, adding to the polarization seen on the anniversaries of the attacks. This week the main victim groups are expected to take part at the same event for the first time in years. In the past political differences have sometimes divided the organizations -- but they will unite for a Roman Catholic mass at Almudena Cathedral, to be attended by King Juan Carlos and prime minister Mariano Rajoy. As usual the victim groups will also observe their own, separate commemorations. Vera de Benito didn't ride public transportation for years after her father's death -- until she got fed up. ""Why is a terrorist group going to keep me from riding a train, after they've already taken away a fundamental pillar of my life?"" she asks. ""All the bad things already happened to me. Nothing worse could occur. And if it does, I will get through it,"" she added. ""I have to look happily toward the future, because if not, I'd go crazy.""","On March 11, 2004, bombs on four trains in Madrid left hundreds dead and wounded .

"(CNN) -- First came the revelations, then the anger, then the resounding victory. After an emotional few days, the Los Angeles Clippers emerged from a dark cloud with a much-needed playoff win Tuesday night. Fans cheered and chanted ""We are One"" as the team defeated the Golden State Warriors, 113-103. Hours before, Clippers owner Donald Sterling had been banned for life from the NBA for racist remarks revealed over the weekend. The focus now turns to whether Sterling will sell the team, something he indicated he would not do -- but that was before he was banned. With the Clippers' win, an ugly situation turned into a rebirth. The team lived up to the impromptu ""We are One"" slogan, printed in stark, black-and-white letters on its website. ""You think it's just the players; it's the fans, too. Everybody was going through this,"" Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said after the game. ""It was almost like everybody wanted to exhale tonight, and it was good."" Audio of Sterling's conversation with a female friend was released Friday night, triggering a firestorm that led to his lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver detailed Sterling's punishment at a news conference eight hours before the Clippers' fifth game of the playoff series with the Warriors. NBA owners, players and others had called for swift, firm punishment since TMZ posted the audio featuring the incendiary comments. ""I hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to Mr. Sterling and recognizes that if he can fall, so can you,"" said Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a former NBA All-Star. Johnson led the players union's efforts on this matter. Under the lifetime ban, Sterling is prohibited from NBA games or practices, stepping foot inside any Clippers facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions, or having a role in league activities such as attending NBA Board of Governors meetings. Silver said he'd do anything in his power to compel the NBA Board of Governors to force Sterling to sell the Clippers. He said he was hopeful he'd get the needed three-quarters of the league's owners -- meaning at least 23 -- to back the move. Sterling could fight any such move in court. Before the punishment was announced, Jim Gray of Fox News reported that he spoke with Sterling and that the owner told him the team is not for sale. At the time, Sterling did not know what his fate would be. Silver did not lay out a detailed timetable for action but said the league would start using its advisory finance committee to bring the issue before the owners ""immediately."" If Sterling does sell the team, he'd profit considerably: He bought the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, and the team is now worth $575 million, according to Forbes magazine. 'Now the healing process begins' Sterling's inflammatory sentiments came packaged in a 10-minute recording that TMZ said occurred during an April 9 conversation with his girlfriend V. Stiviano. On the recording, a man and woman argue about photos posted to Instagram in which she appears with African-Americans. The man says he doesn't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her. The sports website Deadspin on Sunday posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording. Neither website has said how it obtained the recordings; the law firm representing Stiviano said she didn't release them to TMZ. Clippers President Andy Roeser suggested Saturday that the audio was aimed at ""getting even"" with Sterling over a lawsuit. Last month, Rochelle Sterling filed a lawsuit against Stiviano, who she said was having an affair with her husband. She accused her of going after extremely wealthy older men. Roeser said that the offensive comments are ""not consistent with, nor does it reflect (Sterling's) views, beliefs or feelings."" At the time, he cast doubt on whether Sterling made the comments. Silver expressed no such doubts Tuesday, saying the Clippers owner ""acknowledged it was his voice on the tape."" Asked whether he expressed any remorse, the commissioner said, ""Mr. Sterling has not expressed those views directly to me."" The Clippers applauded Silver's decision. ""Now the healing process begins,"" the team said. CNN's Jill Martin and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Fans cheer and chant ""We are One"" as the team defeats the Golden State Warriors .

"(CNN) -- Two European football heavyweights will collide in the UEFA Champions League semifinals after Bayern Munich and Real Madrid were drawn together in Switzerland on Friday. Bayern, winners of the competition last season, and nine-time champions Real will both be looking to book a place in the final, which will take place in Lisbon on May 24. The other semifinal paired Real's city rivals Atletico Madrid with Chelsea, who lifted the trophy for the first time in their history in 2012. The semifinal first leg matches will take place on April 22-23, with the ties concluding with the second legs on April 28-29. German champions Bayern are looking to become the first team to defend the European Cup in the post-1992 Champions League era. Led by former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola, Bayern fought from behind to defeat Manchester United on Tuesday. Real will appear in the semifinals of Europe's premier club competition for the 25th time in their illustrious history, with Cristiano Ronaldo and co. out to secure Los Blancos a record 10th triumph. Carlo Ancelotti's team survived a spirited comeback from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday to reach the last four with a 3-2 aggregate win. The two teams met at the same stage of the competition in 2012, with Bayern prevailing after a nerve-shredding penalty shootout. Bayern went on to lose to Chelsea in the final two years ago. The London club's manager Jose Mourinho is bidding to win the tournament with a third different club after previous successes with Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010. Chelsea needed a late goal from striker Demba Ba to register an away-goals win over Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight. Atletico Madrid could be without the services of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who is on-loan at the Vicente Calderon stadium from Chelsea. Rumors surfaced on Thursday that an agreement between the two teams meant Courtois would only be able to play in both matches against his parent club if Atletico pay Chelsea â‚¬6 million ($8.3 million.) European football's governing body UEFA announced Friday that any such agreement would be ""null, void and unenforceable."" ""Furthermore, any attempt to enforce such a provision would be a clear violation of both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations and would therefore be sanctioned accordingly,"" read a statement from the organization. While Chelsea are appearing in the semifinals for the seventh time in the last 11 seasons, Atletico haven't reached this stage since 1974. Atletico's coach Diego Simeone has led something of a renaissance at the club, leading them to the top of the Spanish league table with just six games left of the campaign. A goal from talented playmaker Koke was enough to see off four-time European champions Barcelona in Tuesday's quarterfinal second leg.","Real Madrid and Bayern Munich paired together in the European Champions League semifinals .

"(CNN) -- Rescue efforts were starting Tuesday night at a mine in northern Mexico where 14 workers were trapped after an explosion, authorities said. A local civil protection official said toxic gases had dissipated enough to allow rescuers to begin exploring the mine's tunnels, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Rescuers will work all night at the mine, and Chilean experts will visit the site Wednesday to help, Mexican Labor Secretary Javier Lozano Alarcon said in a post on his Twitter account. An explosion occurred Tuesday morning at the mine, located just outside Sabinas, Mexico, Mayor Jesus Montemayor Garza said. By Tuesday night, authorities had not determined whether the miners inside were alive. A 15-year-old worker was seriously injured in the blast. He was transported to a hospital and had both arms amputated, Mexico's attorney general's office said in a statement. Lozano took a critical tone in another Twitter post, as rescue operations began, saying ""having a minor working here"" was a ""fault of the owner of this 'mine.'"" Lozano said the mine had only been operating for 20 days and had 25 workers who were not unionized. The owner of the mine is a company known as Binsa, the statement from Mexico's attorney general's office said. ""It's very painful for us,"" Montemayor said. ""At this time we don't know if the 14 miners trapped are dead or alive. It's going to be a complicated operation because of the way the mine shaft was built."" The shaft at the mine is 60 meters (197 feet) deep, he said. Sixteen rescuers from the Coahuila state civil protection agency were working at the site, and 20 other rescuers were in the area ready to relieve the first group, the mayor said. Federal authorities are investigating what caused the explosion, the attorney general's office said. Sabinas is in the coal production center of Mexico and has a museum dedicated to the history of coal mining. Several chapters of that history, however, have been tragic. In 2006, in the nearby town of San Juan de Sabinas, 65 miners perished after an explosion in the mine where they were working. Explosive gas inside the mine hindered the rescue of the miners at the Pasta de Conchos mine, which the government eventually abandoned. Cristina Auerbach, a representative of an association representing families of miners who were killed in 2006, said the army had surrounded the area of Tuesday's blast. Mexican President Felipe Calderon said federal authorities were working with state officials to coordinate the rescue effort. ""We are praying that they are alive, and we are working and doing everything possible that is within our reach to rescue them,"" he said, according to Notimex.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York retains her position firmly at the front of the pack of Democratic presidential candidates, with a poll Thursday giving her 44 percent of the vote, nearly double the 24 percent garnered by the next-closest candidate, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois. Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina was favored by 16 percent of the 458 registered voters who described themselves as Democrats or as independents who lean Democratic. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson followed with 5 percent, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware attracted 3 percent and Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio won 2 percent. Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and former Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska each attracted less than one half of one percent. While Clinton appear to be firmly entrenched as the front-runner, there is one important warning sign for the Clinton campaign. Among Democrats who did not graduate from college, she leads Obama by 26 points, but among Democrats with a college degree, Clinton has only a three-point edge. Turnout is much higher among college graduates, particularly in the primary season, so the Clinton camp may have to work harder to turn her lead in the polls into victory at the ballot box. A Washington Post/ABC News poll of Iowa voters released on August 3 had Clinton, Obama and Edwards in a virtual tie in that key early caucus state. Obama led with 27 percent, while Clinton and Edwards both had 26 percent. The CNN/Opinion Research poll, which had a sampling error of plus-or-minus 4.5 points, was conducted August 6-8 and involved telephone interviews with 1,029 adults. Since June, no candidate's support has changed by more than one point.  E-mail to a friend . CNN Polling Director Keating Holland contributed to this report.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- The underwater search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane will effectively be put on hold this week, and may not resume until August at the very earliest, according to Australia's top transport safety official. The new timeline means that once Bluefin-21, the American underwater drone operated by a team on board the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield, wraps up its work in a couple of days, it will be up to two months, if not longer, until new underwater vehicles are contracted and deployed in the hunt for MH370. According to Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the Australian government will post its request for tenders for the next phase of the search in the next week or so. ""The aim would be to have to negotiate and agree to contract with a successful tender within two months of the release of the tender documentation,"" Dolan said. The ATSB Chief would not comment on what role his Malaysian and Chinese counterparts have played in the process so far. Australian officials had previously suggested that new underwater assets could be in place in the southern Indian Ocean much earlier. Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston, who heads up the umbrella organization coordinating the search for MH370, told Sky News Australia in early May that he hoped that new equipment be starting its work in the search zone off Western Australia sometime in June. Bluefin finishing up its search . The current phase of the underwater search will officially wrap up on Wednesday, when the Bluefin-21 is expected to finish its last of more than 20 missions, some 1,600 kilometers off Western Australia, in waters than can exceed depths of 4,500 meters. Dolan says the ATSB expects that the Bluefin will have finished searching the areas around the four pings detected by the Ocean Shield on April 5 and April 8. The acoustic signals are believed to have been from at least one of MH370's black boxes, but to date, no trace of the missing Boeing 777 has been found. Officials have publicly said they would prefer the next phase of the underwater search, which could take up to a year, to be led by a single private contractor who will operate several underwater assets in the search zone. Appearing alongside Chinese and Malaysian officials at a news conference in Canberra on May 5, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said search coordinators were specifically looking at side-scan sonar equipment that would be towed by a ship. Some towed sonar devices, such as the U.S. Navy's Orion, can transmit data to the surface in real-time. They also have the capability of scanning a larger area than the Bluefin, which has been limited to some 40 square kilometers during each mission. Australia has estimated that the next phase of the underwater search will cost some $60 million. The breakdown of who pays for what still hasn't been made public, but Malaysia and China are both expected to make significant contributions. Mapping the ocean floor . Meanwhile, the Chinese survey ship, Zhu Kezhen, arrived in the search area on Saturday and has started its bathymetric survey, or underwater mapping of the ocean floor, according to Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Committee. The ship will work toward mapping some 60,000 square kilometers, roughly the area where authorities believe MH370 may have gone down. The ATSB says it will be joined by a contracted commercial survey vessel in early June. The data will be transferred once a week to Fremantle by another Chinese ship, the Haixun 01, and then flown to Canberra for processing by Geoscience Australia, a government agency. The ATSB estimates it will take about three months to map the area in question. But search authorities are still considering the possibility that the MH370 search area could shift or be further refined in coming weeks, as it has several times since the flight vanished more than 11 weeks ago. Review of satellite data . According to the ATSB's Martin Dolan, the international group of experts continues to review satellite communications data from Inmarsat to determine the most likely area where the Boeing 777-200ER may have entered the water. Dolan said he expects the team, which is now meeting via teleconference, won't finish their review for at least another two to three weeks. ""It's important for us to be sure that we have correctly defined the search area for this phase of the search, and it takes time to be sure,"" he said. Analysis of a series of ""handshakes"" between MH370 and an Inmarsat satellite combined with analysis of aircraft performance led search teams to their current location in the southern Indian Ocean. Family members of those on board the missing Malaysia Airlines flight have been pushing for the raw Inmarsat satellite data to be made public, so that it can be subject to independent review. Many do not believe authorities are searching in the correct place. Malaysian authorities have indicated they will make that data public on Tuesday, along with an explanation of how the team of experts arrived at its conclusion. Malaysia's acting transport minister said Monday he is still confident in the team's analysis. MH370 departed Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early on the morning of March 8, carrying 239 passengers and crew. On March 24, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that the flight had ended in the southern Indian Ocean. READ MORE: MH370: Raw satellite data to be released .

"(CNN) -- It was in the cave of Hira that the prophet Muhammad received the first revelation of the Quran. For rugby's original wild child Sonny Bill Williams, meeting a Tunisian family who lived with their five children in a one-bedroom flat in the south of France proved pivotal to his conversion to Islam. The New Zealander's unshakeable belief in the Almighty has proved to be the making of one of the island nation's most gifted -- and controversial -- sports stars. ""I was real close with them, and I saw how happy and content they were. And to see how they lived their lives, it was just simple,"" Sonny Bill Williams, a prodigious rugby talent, professional boxer and tattooed poster boy, tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""One thing I've learned over my career is that simplicity is the key. On the field, off as well."" ""I've become a true Muslim,"" added Williams. ""It's giving me happiness. It's made me become content as a man, and helped me to grow. I've just got faith in it and it has definitely helped me become the man I am today."" The Williams of today does not visibly bear the scars of the 15-year-old who was thrust into the unrelenting drinking culture of one of Australia's top rugby league clubs and shamed by national media after being caught in a compromising position with a model. A man who quit that scene, walking out on his contract to take up a lucrative offer to switch codes and join a French rugby union club -- requiring a substantial compensation payout. A man who rejected a reported record $5 million deal to stay with Toulon and returned to Aotearoa -- ""the land of the long white cloud"" -- to follow his dream of playing for the prestigious All Blacks, but found himself a fringe figure for 2011's long-awaited World Cup triumph on home soil. He's been battered in a boxing ring, criticized for landing another big-money deal in Japan, and is now back in the sport where he's most at home. And still controversy follows him. World Cup mission . Williams failed in his bid to become the first player to win the World Cup in both union and league this month, as the Kiwis suffered a crushing defeat against Australia in the final to relinquish the title won four years ago. His mere presence in the squad for the tournament caused a storm, as he only made himself available the day after it was named -- reversing his earlier decision. It meant one unlucky player had to make way. ""I thought I was doing a good thing, you know, staying true to myself,"" says the 28-year-old, who had just completed a triumphant return to Australia's National Rugby League competition, winning his second title and subsequently deciding to extend what had initially been planned as a one-year stint with the Sydney Roosters club. ""Then obviously there was a bit of a falling out, because one of the players was taken out of the squad, one of the young boys, and I just got absolutely hammered. ""And it just made me think, you can't please everyone, you know? If you go about trying to please everyone, there's going to be endless struggles. ""As long as you are happy with the man you see in the mirror, it's all that counts I guess."" The battle within . When Williams, who stands at 6 foot 4 inches and weighs in at 17 stone (108 kg), looks at himself in the mirror, it is surprising to hear him admit to vulnerability. ""My toughest opponent is probably myself, I guess, mentally,"" Williams says in his quiet voice, a gentle contrast to his powerful physique. Stripped to his trunks in the boxing ring, you can see the rippling muscles and elaborate tattoos that have made him a pinup. ""Overcoming the mental struggles that you have out on the field, it's been probably the biggest one for me. The reason I feel so mentally strong now is because of boxing and going through those tough times,"" he adds. ""I've always had battles inside my head where I had to think where I was going to go."" Fighting fit . Williams is close friends with fellow Muslim Anthony Mundine, a former Australian rugby league star who became a boxing champion and has helped the Kiwi fulfill his ring ambitions. Williams' last fight, back in February, earned him the little-known WBA International Heavyweight title -- and some punishing blows from South African journeyman Francois Botha in a reduced 10-round bout. ""Every sport has helped me excel in another. Boxing has given me the mental strength to know that I can face anything on the field, without a doubt,"" he reflects. That sixth fight is likely to be his last for a while, as he focuses on his rugby goals. Rugby is a de facto religion in New Zealand, a country where the gods play with an oval ball and where institutionalized faith is losing ground with its general populace -- just over 50% said they were Christian at the last completed census. He is back playing the sport that is perhaps closest to his heart -- his dad played it, and his mum's father was a renowned coach in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, where he grew up. Family means everything to him. His parents are separated, but he brought his father to Sydney with him and sees his mum when he can. He has bought both of them houses. ""My mother and my father were really big on manners,"" Williams recalls. ""Almost to the point, you know, that when I got a bit older it made me a bit too shy, I never said anything out of turn. But they've molded me to the person that I've become."" He's always been competitive -- even if it meant finding a short cut to finally beat his older brother (""the biggest influence on my sporting career"") in their regular childhood running races -- and he had been pegged as a future athletics champion before choosing rugby league. ""I've always loved sport. It's funny, it's all I ever thought I was good at. Whatever sport was there, whatever ball I could pick up, whatever bat I could try, I'd give it a crack."" Finding simplicity . Williams became the youngest player to be signed by an NRL team, winning his first Grand Final as an 18-year-old with the Canterbury Bulldogs in 2004, and was the youngest to represent New Zealand's Kiwis league side. ""I grew up as a Christian, like many Polynesians do, and moving to Australia suddenly when I was 15, I learned a lot about Muslim faith,"" he says. It was in Toulon where, having fled Australia under threats of lawsuits from his jilted employer, his conversion to Islam was realized. Having to adhere to the rule of Ramadan fasting has given him a new perspective on some of the things we take for granted. ""When you do Ramadan and you go for the whole month, you're that much more appreciative of being able to eat food and drink water -- that's what it's designed to do,"" he says. But faith in the divine can only do so much, he says -- the rest is up to you. ""To be the best you definitely have to have some God-given talents, but you also have to have the drive and the will and the dedication,"" Williams explains. ""Simplicity is the key and I just try to keep things as simple as I can. But I never lose that one thing that's got me there -- that's drive, working hard, doing all the little things, ticking all the boxes."" The next challenge . Having switched allegiances so often, Williams finds himself having to work hard to earn acceptance -- which means trying to break some of his own habits. ""I'd like to be a bit more trusting, letting my guard down a little bit more. I'm too serious sometimes, bro, as you can tell,"" he acknowledges, before breaking into a big grin. ""And in a team environment sometimes I'm too intense, you know, sometimes I've got to sit back and just relax. Just chill out. But it's just how I'm made. I've always been competitive."" Williams admits he would be tempted to try another of rugby's formats, Sevens, which will make its Olympic debut at Rio 2016. ""That would be a dream come true. If I had the opportunity to give it a crack, I definitely would,"" he says. ""But there's so much talent in New Zealand that it's probably almost a distant dream at this stage."" Whatever he decides to do after his new Roosters deal ends next year -- he has hinted he will return to union ahead of the 2015 World Cup -- it's a fair bet that Williams will succeed. He has won titles almost everywhere he has been, and that has been driven by something deep inside him. ""I just don't want to fail, to be honest. I don't want to let my family down, I don't want to let myself down,"" Williams admits, falling back into his earnest, serious tone. ""That's probably the biggest thing I fear. I'm confident as a man, these days, and I know what I can achieve if I put my mind to it.""","Sonny Bill Williams is hoping to be first player to win World Cups in both rugby codes .

"(CNN) -- The head of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families resigned Tuesday following the deaths of three children the agency was charged with protecting. The resignation of Olga Roche, who has more than three decades in child welfare, comes after state lawmakers and the public called for the embattled commissioner to step down after the deaths of 5-year-old Jeremiah Oliver, 4-week-old Aliana Lavigne, and 2-week-old Bailey Irish. ""For DCF to move on ... there must be accountability for the tragedies,"" Gov. Deval Patrick told reporters Tuesday. ""That's the only way the agency earns the public's confidence."" Patrick, who named Roche acting commissioner in April 2013 and permanently appointed her in October 2013, expressed faith in Roche, but said the controversy over the recent deaths of the two infants and the disappearance of a toddler whose body was later found made it impossible for her to stay. The deaths have sparked outrage. On Monday, House Speaker Robert DeLeo, Senate President Therese Murray and Attorney General Martha Coakley all demanded Roche's resignation. ""The vast majority of the time, DCF gets it right,"" Health and Human Services Secretary John Polanowicz told reporters. ""Sometimes, no matter how diligent or carefully a family is supervised, a tragedy can happen."" Polanowicz said he accepted Roche's resignation ""because I believe it is not possible for the agency to move forward in this environment with her at the helm."" In a statement, the Massachusetts Human Service Workers Union, SEIU Local 509, said the change at the helm represented a ""critical opportunity"" to institute reforms and investments in the agency. Members of the union, which represents social workers, investigators, supervisors and more than 17,000 other human service workers and educators throughout the commonwealth, took to the streets last week in a protest demanding the hiring of more social workers. ""At DCF, we face a caseload crisis that worsens each day,"" chapter President Peter MacKinnon said in a statement. ""Policy changes and accountability measures are desperately needed. Communication barriers and outdated technology continue to slow our efforts in the field."" Erin Deveney, former chief of staff at the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, was named interim commissioner. Roche, who did not attend Tuesday's press conference, was not immediately available for comment. Patrick said Roche, despite her experience, ""can no longer command the trust of the public or the confidence of her line staff."" A day earlier, a visibly angry Patrick described the death of Aliana Lavigne as ""intolerable"" after learning that social workers misplaced a police officer's faxed complaint about the suspected neglect of the infant, according to CNN affiliate WCVB. Aliana was dead by the time a social worker investigated. ""I'm upset as anyone about the loss of these children,"" Patrick said. ""My confidence in the whole organization has been rattled."" Police told WCVB that officers filed a written report of suspected abuse or neglect -- known as a 51A -- after a visit to the home of Andrea Lavigne on April 3. But DCF officials said the officers did not follow up with a phone call as required by law. The fax was discovered days later. Police officials insisted officers did what they were supposed to do. Lavigne stopped breathing April 11 while sleeping in her mother's bed, WCVB reported. The case was assigned to a social worker one day before the child's death. Earlier this month, the body of 5-year-old Jeremiah Oliver was found off a highway in central Massachusetts after a seven month search, WCVB reported. His family was under DCF supervision at the time of his disappearance. Authorities said 16-day-old Bailey Irish was brought to the hospital on Saturday morning by her parents, who were under DCF supervision. She was pronounced dead a short time later.","Massachusetts' top child welfare official resigns amid controversy .

"(CNN) -- Many Californians were startled awake Monday night and early Tuesday morning by Amber Alerts that made screeching noises on their cell phones. Some people even took to Twitter to complain. They better get used to it. The alerts about a blue Nissan -- possibly carrying Ethan Anderson, 8, and sister Hannah Anderson, 16 -- were the first sent statewide in California under a new program that sends Amber Alerts about abducted children via text messages to millions of mobile phones. The texts are accompanied by a high-pitched squealing sound to get the phone owner's attention. Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was kidnapped from her California home in 1993 and later found dead, was an unlikely critic of Monday's statewide alerts, telling CNN that while the messages were well intended, their rollout was ""pretty abysmal."" He feared residents might be put off by the harsh noise and opt out of the program. Cell phones have been receiving Amber Alerts since 2005 under a partnership between the wireless industry, the U.S. Justice Department and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. But people had to sign up to receive the alerts -- only about 700,000 did -- and then designate the areas they wanted to get alerts for. They would then only receive alerts for those chosen areas, regardless of where they were physically located. So you could be from Nebraska but vacationing in Florida, for example, and not get an Amber Alert about an abduction a dozen miles from your Tampa hotel. That system was replaced on December 31, 2012, by the Wireless Emergency Alert program, run by FEMA, which sends free, automatic notifications to almost every phone in the surrounding area or even the state. Cellphone owners now receive Amber Alerts, as well as emergency weather alerts, based on their proximity to the emergency, not the location of their phone number. And people must opt out if they prefer not to get the alerts. HLN: What you should know about mobile Amber Alerts . The messages are sent over a special wireless carrier channel called Cell Broadcast and aren't affected by congestion that might disrupt regular calls and text messages, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. About 100 Amber Alerts, sent simultaneously to all compatible mobile devices within range of the cellular towers in the affected area, have been sent nationwide so far under the Wireless Emergency Alert program. The program was credited with locating an abducted 8-month-old boy in Minnesota in February. A Minneapolis teenager saw an Amber Alert on his phone and called police about a neighbor whose Kia matched the description in the alert. The neighbor was arrested, and the infant was recovered unharmed. Carriers representing 98% of all U.S. wireless subscribers are on the new program, and more than 200 models of phones support the alerts, said Brian Josef, an assistant vice president for regulatory affairs at CTIA, the wireless industry trade association. The alerts ""are absolutely saving lives,"" Josef said. ""We have stressed that these alerts have been used judiciously, sparingly,"" he added, when asked about irritated reactions to Monday's Amber Alerts in California. Once phone users understand what it is, ""they appreciate the information,"" he said. Some older phones, including the iPhone 4, will not receive the alerts. People can choose not to hear Amber Alerts by adjusting the notification settings on their phones. Monday's alert was the third Amber Alert in California in 2013 to use the new system, although the first two were only broadcast to phones in specific counties. A massive manhunt was under way Tuesday and Wednesday in California for James DiMaggio, 40, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the children's mother, Christina Anderson. Launched in Texas in 1996, Amber Alerts were originally sent out via radio, TV and electronic highway signs as part of the national emergency-alert system that includes warnings about extreme weather such as tornadoes and hurricanes. Some critics of Monday's alert said it was too vague, offering only a description of the wanted vehicle without further context. But Californians should appreciate that such a notification system exists in times of crisis, wrote columnist Jon Healey in the Los Angeles Times. ""The fact that the alerts were broadcast indiscriminately to San Diego-area cellphones (and later, to all California phones capable of receiving text messages, as the alert went statewide) clearly annoyed a lot of wireless customers,"" he wrote. ""But the alerts can't really be targeted if police don't know where the kidnapper is, and it's impossible to predict who might be in a position to help. So AMBER has to cast a wide net to have any hope of succeeding. ""Yes, it might have helped if the message had been less cryptic. But now that we've all seen one, we should be able to recognize what such alerts are trying to tell us.""","Californians were startled awake this week by Amber Alerts on their phones .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A federal judge tentatively overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman accused of using MySpace to deceive a teenage girl who eventually committed suicide, a U.S. attorney's spokesman told CNN. A jury convicted Lori Drew in November for accessing protected computers without authorization. A jury convicted Lori Drew, 49, of O'Fallon, Missouri, in November on three misdemeanor counts of accessing protected computers without authorization. Prosecutors argued that Drew illegally used the social networking site to humiliate a 13-year-old girl, who authorities said killed herself after receiving derogatory messages. Drew was to be sentenced Thursday, but California U.S. District Judge George Wu -- who heard the case because MySpace is based in Los Angeles -- instead decided to not uphold the jury's finding. Prosecutors based their case on a federal computer crimes statute that Wu is now challenging. Using the statute, prosecutors accused Drew of violating the social networking site's terms of service, which prohibits creating fraudulent registration information, using accounts to obtain personal information about juvenile members and using MySpace to ""harass, abuse or harm other members."" Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, told CNN that Wu said in court if Drew is convicted of illegally accessing computers, the guilty verdict would set a precedent and anyone who has ever violated MySpace's terms of service could also be found guilty of a misdemeanor. ""It appears that the judge is basing his decision on his conclusion that the misdemeanor statute is constitutionally vague,"" Mrozek wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Wu said his decision will become final once he files a written ruling, according to Mrozek. The misdemeanor charges -- which Drew is tentatively cleared of with Wu's action -- stemmed from an elaborate hoax played out on MySpace. The prosecution accused Drew of using the site to inflict emotional distress on Megan Meier. Prosecutors alleged during the trial that Drew -- worried that Meier had spread malicious rumors about her daughter -- used MySpace to pose as a 16-year-old boy, ""Josh Evans,"" who feigned romantic interest in Meier. Meier killed herself after the ""boy"" spurned her and at one point told her via the Internet that the world would be a better place without her, according to prosecutors. Jurors declared a mistrial on a more serious conspiracy charge. Prosecutors sought the maximum three-year sentence for Drew on the misdemeanor convictions. The U.S. Justice Department plans to explore other legal options against Drew, Mrozek said. Prosecutors might appeal the case's dismissal and consider refilling the conspiracy charge, he said.","California U.S. District Judge George Wu decided to not uphold the jury's finding .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- One of Francis Williams' favorite stories to tell is about the time he was pulled over for speeding. As countries and companies plan to go to the moon, a debate heats up on lunar property rights. Williams, who had been in London on business, was driving home through the English countryside when a police officer stopped him and wanted to know two things: Was Williams aware of how fast he was driving? And, what was his profession? It turned out the response to the second question would help Williams resolve the first: ""I said, 'I sell land on the moon,'"" said Williams. ""And [the police officer] said, 'Do you know, my wife has bought some of that.'"" The answer to the first question was subsequently forgotten. Williams, who describes himself as the ""Lunar Ambassador to the United Kingdom,"" is the owner of MoonEstates. He claims to have sold around 300,000 acres of moon land since he and his wife, Sue, founded the Cornwall-based company eight years ago. One-acre plots of lunar turf go for about $40. As proof of purchase, new property owners receive a silver tin containing a personalized ""Lunar Deed"" and a moon map with a tiny black X marking their tract's approximate location. Most of the land Williams sells is in the northwest, in an area known as Oceanus Procellarum, or Ocean of Storms -- a desolate lava plain formed by volcanoes billions of years ago. ""I know the Japanese are [selling] further east,"" he said. Williams received his license to sell lunar land in the UK from Dennis Hope. In 1980, the Nevada-based entrepreneur claimed ownership of the moon after finding what he calls a loophole in the 1967 United Nations Outer Space Treaty, which forbids countries from owning the moon but, according to Hope, does not forbid individuals from owning it. Hope, who estimates he has sold over 500 million acres of moon land, said he immediately filed a ""declaration of ownership"" with the U.N. along with the United States and Russian governments. After 28 years, the moon mogul still has not received a reply. ""I have never heard from them on that note ever,"" Hope told CNN in a phone interview. While the U.N. may have ignored Hope's lunar land claims for almost three decades, it is unlikely the organization will be able ignore what could soon become a question of increasing international importance: Who, exactly, does own the moon? ""At some point the world community needs to come together and draft some new convention or treaty,"" said Paul Dempsey, director of the Institute of Air and Space Law and McGill University in Montreal. ""It is an open wound that needs to be healed."" Dempsey pointed out that at the time the U.N. drafted the Outer Space Treaty, there were only two spacefaring nations -- the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Now there are over a dozen. And many of them, including China, Russia, the U.S., India and Japan, want to go to the moon. NASA, for example, recently announced plans to return by 2020, eventually building a permanent base on the lunar surface. The Russian space agency, Roskosmos, has confirmed similar intentions. The burgeoning commercial space sector is also casting its gaze towards Earth's only natural satellite with companies considering everything from mining the lunar surface to building extraterrestrial resorts on it. ""It is quite a complicated issue because it is international law we are dealing with,"" said Niklas Hedman, chief of the Committee Services and Research Section of the U.N.'s Office for Outer Space Affairs in Vienna. There are five treaties that govern international affairs in space, said Hedman.  Two of them -- the Outerspace Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement -- deal with lunar law. The Outer Space Treaty provides a legal framework for the international use of space for peaceful purposes, including the moon and other celestial bodies.  Widely considered the ""Magna Carta of space law,"" this treaty lays down the fundamental principle of non-appropriation and that the exploration and use of space shall be the province of all mankind. According to the treaty, states bear international responsibility for national activities in space, including by non-governmental entities.  The Outer Space Treaty says governments cannot claim ownership of the lunar surface and that stations and installations on the moon shall be open to others, said Hedman. The Moon Agreement builds upon the Outer Space Treaty but also says that any natural resources found on the moon are part of ""the common heritage of mankind"" - in other words, they must be shared. While 98 nations, including all the major spacefaring ones, have ratified the Outerspace Treaty, only 13 countries have approved the Moon Agreement -- Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Uruguay and Mexico, to name four. But Hedman said this does not mean the other 179 countries that have not ratified the Moon Agreement are free to make a lunar land rush. ""They are still bound by the fundamental provisions [of the Outer Space Treaty],"" he said, adding that ""when enough states of the world have ratified a treaty, and it becomes binding, then certain fundamental provisions become binding even on states that have not ratified it."" Henry Hertzfeld, a space analyst at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said he is not so sure the U.N.'s treaties provide an adequate answer to the question of lunar property rights. ""These treaties don't really have any teeth to them in terms of enforcement,"" said Hertzfeld. ""They are agreements on principle."" Instead of  focusing on who owns the moon, the international community needs find ways to incentivize future business activity on the moon by guaranteeing that rights to land and resources will not be preempted by competing interests, said Hertzfeld. ""Owning property is not the issue, the issue is finding a mechanism for businesses to make a fair return on their investment,"" he said. ""Otherwise there is no point in investing."" But first, Hertzfeld said, there also needs to be a guarantee that there is something on the moon worth investing in at all. ""My feeling is until we know what is there, we shouldn't mess with it,"" he said. ........................... Have you bought land on the moon? Would you consider purchasing lunar property?

"(CNN) -- Imagine for a moment that instead of just the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 16 federal agencies were responsible for administering the federal food stamp program. Also imagine that each of these agencies had unchecked taxpayer resources and no public oversight. Neither the taxpayer nor anyone in Congress would stand for it. But that is exactly what is happening with America's intelligence programs. In August of last year, Edward Snowden leaked documents that gave taxpayers and most legislators a first-ever glimpse at the amount of money spent on intelligence activities by 16 federal agencies. What did the documents reveal? Among other things, we learned that, over the past 10 years, the budget for the Central Intelligence Agency ballooned by 56% and the National Security Agency budget jumped by 54%. And what do we know about where that taxpayer money went? Virtually nothing, because intelligence spending is considered top secret and legislative oversight is done behind closed doors. The reality is that most lawmakers -- and, therefore, the taxpayers we represent -- don't gain access to intelligence spending information. Those who do are sworn to secrecy. With the exception of the budget snapshot revealed by Edward Snowden, this top-line agency information remains buried in the so-called ""black budget"" that makes up the National Intelligence Program. And unless Congress acts, it will remain buried and unavailable to public scrutiny. The biggest threat to successfully implementing any federal program is the combination of unchecked funding and limited oversight, which is precisely the situation with America's intelligence programs. Revelations about the NSA's intelligence-gathering programs have Americans on edge and justifiably demanding transparency and oversight. But this oversight is not possible without knowing how much money each of these agencies is spending. Intelligence-gathering plays a vital role in the safety and freedom of all Americans. The importance of intelligence activities should not, however, exclude them from budget accountability. To the contrary, the critical nature of these programs is exactly why intelligence agencies should meet basic budget accountability requirements. We are joined by 60 of our colleagues -- from liberal to conservative -- in sponsoring legislation that will take a simple first step toward long-overdue oversight of intelligence programs. Our bill, the Intelligence Budget Transparency Act, will require the President to disclose in his annual budget the top-line intelligence budgets of 16 intelligence agencies. To be clear, we do not propose exposing intelligence program details, or sources and methods. Doing so could compromise operations and the safety of intelligence personnel. We are simply insisting that the total amount spent on intelligence at each agency be made public. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, informally known as the 9/11 Commission, recommended the disclosure of this basic information. Lee Hamilton, the commission's widely respected vice chairman and former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has endorsed our legislation. ""America needs competent and effective intelligence-gathering agencies,"" Hamilton said. ""And Congress must exercise prudent and diligent oversight to assure the American taxpayer is getting what it's paying for. The first step toward accountability and oversight is public disclosure of the top-line budget numbers of all our intelligence-gathering agencies."" Simply put, the taxpayer has a right to know the price tag for intelligence spending by agency. Disclosing this basic information will help Congress and the public compare spending trends over time and measure intelligence needs against other budget priorities. The debate over secrecy in the name of national security is more relevant now than ever before. Shining a light on the intelligence budget is an important and practical step in ensuring an accountable and effective intelligence program and restoring the confidence of the American people in their government's intelligence activities.","Writers: 16 federal agencies responsible for U.S. intelligence, with unchecked budgets .

"(CNN) -- A southwestern Missouri man has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of 10-year-old Hailey Owens. Craig Michael Wood, 45, of Springfield, was also charged with armed criminal action and child kidnapping, Greene County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson told reporters Wednesday. He praised the community's response to the case. ""It is a tragedy that it was not quick enough to save Hailey,"" Patterson said. Wood is being held without bond. Hailey's body was found earlier at a home where Wood's been living, police said. She was allegedly abducted Tuesday afternoon. An Amber Alert was issued after two witnesses told police that a man pulled Hailey, of Springfield, into a gold Ford Ranger, while she was walking about a block from her home, according to a probable cause document. The man pulled up next to the girl and asked her for directions, one of the witnesses said. Hailey turned away from the car. The man opened his driver's-side door and motioned for her to come back, according to the witness. She took a couple of steps closer, and the man ""lunged out of the vehicle, grabbed the girl with his left hand and threw her into the truck 'like a rag doll,'"" the probable cause document said. Both witnesses gave the same description of the man and his vehicle, and one of them was able to get the license plate number. Police traced the plates back to Wood's parents, who told them that their son drove the car. Police went to Wood's home on Tuesday night and, after he drove up to the residence, took him in for questioning. Officers who did an initial search of the house for Hailey could smell bleach in the basement, and the floor was wet. After getting a search warrant, investigators found Hailey's body in a storage bin. She had suffered what appeared to be a gunshot to her head, according to police. It wasn't immediately clear whether Hailey knew Wood. Since 1998, Wood has been employed by Springfield Public Schools, working as a paraprofessional and athletic coach at Pleasant View K-8 School, according to a statement from the schools. He has since been suspended. Hailey was a student at Westport Elementary School. She attended Bowerman Elementary School last year. ""Last night we learned the terrible news that one of our students had been abducted near her home. This morning, our sadness is compounded by the recent developments in the case of Hailey Owens' abduction,"" said Superintendent Norm Ridder. He added: ""Students and staff at three of our schools are coping with this situation.

Bdaiwi was on his way to his office, near the residence of Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, when he was shot by a military guard after an argument between them, the radio station reported. According to his media outlet, Bdaiwi was driving his car through the guarded gate at the compound that houses his bureau as well as the presidential residence when he got in an argument with a guard. The guard shot the journalist and fled inside the compound. The guard was eventually handed over to police once Iraq's prime minister made a surprise appearance to demand that he be taken into custody, the station reported. In addition to being a journalist, Bdaiwi was also an author and professor at a university in Baghdad. Iraq has been beset by violence over the last year.

"(CNN) -- Nina Davuluri changed the face of the American girl next door after she became the first Miss America of Indian descent. Her historic win introduced Bollywood dance into the talent portion of the contest that, up until 60 years ago, required contestants to be in ""good health and of the white race."" But not everyone appreciated the history she was making. Negative responses on social media made headlines after her win. Davuluri says she expected some of that reaction. After all, she faced that when she won Miss New York, too. ""[F]or every negative comment or post or tweet that I received, I received hundreds and thousands of words of encouragement and support,"" said Davuluri, a graduate of the University of Michigan. ""And that's still very true, even in my interactions in this past month on the road with various people, just so many positive, positive remarks."" Growing up in a predominantly white Midwest town, she had become accustomed to answering questions about arranged marriages, cow worship and the meaning of ""red dots on foreheads."" ""I was raised in a very Indian household,"" she said. ""And so for my parents it was really difficult for them to assimilate with the American culture. And that's what I encourage -- assimilation has to happen from both sides, it can't be one-sided."" Opinion: Miss America, Julie Chen and the beauty of choice . She has learned that lesson in her personal life, like when she introduced her traditional parents, whose marriage was arranged, to the boyfriend she had been dating for more than a year. ""I mean, I'm 24 years old. I'm a grown woman,"" she said. ""It came down to the point where I said you can either accept this and be a part of it and ... take the opportunity to get to know him, or we can just pretend that it's not happening. The choice is yours."" She says she is proud of how her own parents have adapted. Now she logs 20,000 airline miles per month traveling around the country sharing her platform on how to celebrate diversity through cultural competency by asking questions and learning about other cultures, and also to promote awareness of STEM education. In this edited conversation, she took some time to speak with CNN about why medical school seemed less risky than competing for Miss America, and how she was challenged to live her platform in her own household. CNN: The programs you've worked with have focused on children in kindergarten through junior high about to address diversity through cultural competency. Is all hope lost for adults? What have you found, particularly in the aftermath of the negative reaction to your being crowned, is the best way to address the topic with adults? Davuluri: I certainly hope that not all hope is lost, and I don't think it is, because my parents are a living example of that. One of the hardest things that I experienced was really living the platform in my own home. And I say that because, my parents -- you know -- I come from a very Indian household, and the reality of the situation is that you simply cannot raise your children in America and expect them to be 100% Indian. That's not possible. And it shouldn't have to be, because we're so influenced by our peers and our community and people around us. Personally, my parents had an arranged marriage. And so, the idea of dating is difficult for any parent, but especially more so for mine, because they never experienced it themselves. I've been dating a gentleman for a little while ... and it wasn't until I had been seeing him for a year-and-a-half that I didn't even tell my parents! And I really, really wish that I'd opened that conversation sooner than I did, because it really made -- I mean, it sounds really cheesy, but it really made us have a stronger relationship. I'm not saying that it was any walk in the park, because it was a very difficult conversation to have. But at the end of the day, your parents want you to be happy. And so I'm really thankful that I did it, but it's still a constant struggle in my own home as well. CNN: When you say constant struggle, how did that manifest? Was there a ""rule"" to not date, or was there just an expectation? Davuluri: It was just an expectation. We'd never talked about it ... For me, med school was almost the easy path, I suppose. It was expected. It was something that was expected of me. I was just supposed to do it. But becoming Miss America, entering this organization, was something that gave me a sense of validity that I had never had, because it was solely my own, and I put my own name on it. And I'm really proud to say that it's OK to not fit the mold, or break the stereotype or whatever it is, and stick to your gut. CNN: What do you think was difficult about it for your parents? Davuluri: I think it was more of the fact that in my parents' mind, well, first you have to go to school, and then you have to go to med school and then you get married. And in my mind, I'm like, well Prince Charming doesn't just show up on my doorstep whenever I'm ready to meet him! CNN: So would you consider your boyfriend Prince Charming? Davuluri, laughing: Well, I didn't go that far. He's a great guy. CNN: In the South Asian community, there was pride about your win. There was also discussion about the notion that due to your skin tone, it's unlikely you would win a beauty contest in India. How do you respond to that? Was that something you heard? Davuluri: I totally get it. When I was little it was always, ""Don't go out into the sun, cause you're going to get too dark."" I'd go to India on average every year growing up and (some of my family) would say, ""Oh, you'd be so much more beautiful if you were fair"" or lighter. So I get it from that standpoint. But I also experienced both sides of it, because when I was in school, ... everyone was like, ""Oh my goodness, you have such beautiful skin, you're so tan, you're so beautiful."" So, it's just the idea of wanting what we can't have. Just these standards of beauty that society says that they should be or thinks that they should be. I guess another silver lining is that these little girls in India can see (you don't only have to be fair-skinned) to be beautiful. I hope that that can be some sort of symbol in that sense. CNN: How do you define beauty? Davuluri: Is it cheesy if I say from the inside? It is so true and I think that the biggest thing for me, being in this role is, regardless of the physical beauty, is that I want it to come from the inside. When I meet someone, I want it to be that genuine, interested person and having a genuine conversation. ... A smile goes a long way and being interested in that person you're speaking with is what true beauty is. And just showing that you care about someone is what I hope to accomplish this year.","Nina Davuluri is the first Miss America winner of Indian descent .

"Teterboro, New Jersey (CNN) -- Pop star Justin Bieber was granted re-entry Friday into the United States following a search of his private airplane by federal officials who said they detected an odor of marijuana after it landed in New Jersey, a law enforcement official told CNN. The plane carrying Bieber and others -- presumably his entourage -- was clearing customs after touching down at Teterboro Airport when U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers said they detected the odor, law enforcement sources said. Drug-sniffing dogs were used to search the plane, according to one of the sources. But no sign of drugs were detected and no illegal substances were found, the source said. Bieber's interview was described by another law enforcement source as one that is carried out for anyone entering the United States, and that it can take 10 minutes or 10 hours. The interview is routinely conducted to ensure people entering the country are in compliance with U.S. law, the source said. Bieber was interviewed for several hours before being cleared to enter the United States. The plane sat on the airport tarmac for at least four hours, and CNN saw law enforcement officers getting off the plane. Customs and Border Protection officials did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. It's the latest headache for the embattled singer, who has made a number of headlines in recent weeks. Bieber's plane was en route from Canada, where on Wednesday he surrendered to Toronto police, who booked him on an assault charge. He was accused of hitting a limousine driver a month ago. That same day, Florida authorities released police documents that accused Bieber of being under the influence of alcohol, pot and Xanax when police stopped him for allegedly street racing in Miami Beach last week. Bieber was booked on charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. He was briefly jailed, and his attorney has entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. The two arrests come on the heels of allegations that he egged a neighbor's house in Calabasas, California, causing thousands of dollars in damage in the process. When authorities searched the singer's home as part of the investigation into the alleged egg-throwing, a sheriff's deputy found suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of Bieber house guest Lil Za, who now faces a felony drug charge. A prosecutor is expected to decide as early as next week whether Bieber will be charged with felony vandalism in connection with the case. Since being discovered in 2008 performing cover songs in clips posted on YouTube, Bieber shot into the superstar stratosphere with a legion of young fans known as Beliebers. But his onstage persona, once so appealing to parents of his 'tween fans, started taking hits. From being accused of public urination to rumors of a visit to a Brazilian brothel and run-ins with police, including a search of his Calabasas home by authorities in connection with the egging case, his once squeaky clean image has all but disappeared. In its place, a bad-boy image that has a number of critics, including some calling for the Canadian-born Bieber's deportation. The petition, titled ""Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card,"" had garnered more than 100,000 signatures. Bieber has a visa allowing him to legally live in the United States because of his ""extraordinary ability"" in the arts. Bieber's musical mentor, Usher Raymond, a former teen star himself, told MTV in December 2013 that his young protege was experiencing the pains of growing up in the spotlight. ""With success comes great responsibility. And being able to grow up in it and unfortunately be analyzed in front of the world for just growing up, I think they will be able to see the truth,"" Usher said. ""And they can make an assessment based off of what his reality looks like."" On Thursday, Bieber took to Twitter to thank supporters in his hometown of Stratford, Canada, where he took refuge before flying to New Jersery. ""Never forget where you come from or those who supported you before anyone else. still the small town kid. thanks,"" he tweeted. Could Justin Bieber be deported?

"(CNN) -- Bradley Edward Manning is no more. A Kansas judge on Wednesday granted the former Army intelligence analyst's request to formally be known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. ""I've been working for months for this change, and waiting for years,"" she said in a statement applauding the order. ""It's worth noting that in both mail and in-person, I've often been asked, 'Why are you changing your name?' The answer couldn't be simpler: because it's a far better, richer, and more honest reflection of who I am and always have been -- a woman named Chelsea."" Manning is currently serving a 35-year sentence at the Army prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. She was convicted in July of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. Manning was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against her, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. George Wright, an Army spokesman, said Wednesday the name change would have little consequence. ""This court action is only a name change and will have no other effect on his current status other than the name in his records. U.S. Disciplinary Barracks is an all-male facility,"" he said. Manning first announced her intent to live as a woman in August. Then, she asked for support and said she wanted to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. ""In August, I requested that the military provide me with a treatment plan consistent with the recognized professional standards of care for trans health. They quickly evaluated me and informed me that they came up with a proposed treatment plan. ""However, I have not yet seen their treatment plan, and in over eight months, I have not received any response as to whether the plan will be approved or disapproved, or whether it follows the guidelines of qualified health professionals,"" Manning said in Wednesday's statement. In August, one Army official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about Manning's case, said the private would remain a man in the eyes of the Army. Another said Manning would be treated like any other prisoner.

"(CNN) -- A second consecutive round of 66 fired Paul Casey to the top of the Memorial Tournament leaderboard in Dublin, Ohio, Friday after overnight leader Rory McIlroy fell away. Casey shot six birdies and an eagle, which more than canceled out bogies on holes nine and 17, to finish the day on 12-under-par. The Englishman now sits three shots ahead of Masters champion Bubba Watson going into the weekend. ""I had very good control of the irons today,"" Casey told the PGA Tour website upon reaching the clubhouse. ""The driving was still good again but I was ecstatic with the way I played. There was a couple of mistakes in there. But that's Muirfield Village. It's a tricky golf course and you don't need to do a lot wrong to make a mistake."" McIlroy had led by three strokes after Thursday's stunning 63 but fell way back to tie for 24th position at the end of day thanks to second round 78 that included three bogeys and three double-bogeys. The 25-year-old Northern Irishman, who picked up the European PGA title at Wentworth last weekend, had complained of a knee problem after his first round but refused to blame injury for his poor showing. ""I felt it a little bit, but didn't really bother me too much,"" he said. ""Hopefully that's the bad run out of the way and I can play some good golf on the weekend and get myself back in with the shots,"" he added. Elsewhere on the course, a 70 for Chris Kirk ensured he kept up the pressure on second-placed Watson, lying one shot back at eight-under-par. Japan's Hideki Matsuyama, meanwhile, carded a five-under par round of 67 to tie for fourth with Martin Flores of the U.S. on seven-under-par. World No. 1 Adam Scott, who won the Colonial tournament last weekend, shot a solid second round of 70 to end the day tied for 10th position at five-under-par.","Paul Casey leads Memorial after second round of 66 .

"(CNN) -- Chris Brown must return to California the same way he got to Washington, D.C. -- in chains on the grueling ""Con Air"" inmate transport system. A Los Angeles judge refused a request to free the singer from custody on Wednesday so he could make his own way back from Washington. Brown, 24, was taken to Washington by U.S. marshals this month for trial on an assault charge, but that has been put on hold until the appeal of his bodyguard's conviction is completed. Brown has been on probation since 2009 when he pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in the beating of his then-girlfriend Rihanna Fenty. He and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were arrested on assault charges in Washington for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last December. The arrest led to a revocation of Brown's probation, but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail. He was ordered to jail last month when he was kicked out of the rehab program for rules violations. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial . Brown is now ""stuck between a rock and a hard spot,"" attorney Robert Kalunian told Judge Victor Greenberg during a brief hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. He has been locked up for 39 days and still has not had a probation revocation hearing, Kalunian said. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray said she ""strenuously"" opposed releasing Brown now, arguing the only change since Brown was jailed in March is that his case has ""gotten worse."" The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was ""the initial aggressor"" in the incident, Murray said. A hearing was set for May 1 in Los Angeles to set a date for another hearing that could determine if Brown's Washington case warranted a probation revocation. It could be several months before his trial in Washington is held. ""I think it's a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard's trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose,"" Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters in Washington earlier Wednesday. ""And you have got the bodyguard who was convicted and who readily admitted he was the one who did the punching.Â So all of this is much ado about nothing."" Chris Brown's freedom at stake with 2 cases . The delay in Brown's Washington trial came after prosecutors refused to grant immunity to Hollosy so he could testify without jeopardizing his own case. On Monday, Hollosy was found guilty of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk before Brown's trial was to begin in the case. The prosecutors cited Hollosy's refusal to talk to them about his testimony as a major reason for the decision not to grant immunity. Their motion also said they suspected he might lie in his testimony to help Brown. ""The cynic in me would say apparently it is not a search for the truth because if they wanted the truth they would give Hollosy immunity and allow him to testify,"" Geragos said Wednesday outside court.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States and Israel are discussing the possible release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard as part of efforts to save fragile Middle East peace negotiations, according to sources familiar with the talks. No decisions have been made about Pollard's release, which the sources cautioned was far from certain and would need to be approved by President Barack Obama. Pollard's possible release was being discussed as part of a broader agreement that had not been finalized. Talk of Pollard's possible release came as Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Israel Monday to try and mediate a dispute between Israel and the Palestinians over the release of Palestinian prisoners. In exchange for Pollard's release, the sources said that Israel would have to make significant concessions to the Palestinians, which could include a settlement freeze, the release of additional prisoners beyond the current group in dispute and an agreement to continue peace negotiations beyond the end of April deadline. Pollard, a former U.S. intelligence analyst arrested and charged with spying for Israel, was convicted in 1987 and is currently serving out a life sentence in the United States. His imprisonment has been a source of tension between the U.S. and Israel. But with peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians faltering, his release is being considered as a possible incentive for Israeli concessions. Israel has in the past tried to link Pollard's release to peace negotiations. Current and former U.S. officials and experts have suggested the United States government might tie his release to a comprehensive peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. Pollard is up for parole consideration in November 2015, and the United States is running out of time to use his possible release as leverage with Israel. At the White House briefing Monday, Press Secretary Jay Carney said it is a ""complicated issue"" and declined to ""get into details"" about the negotiations. ""And with regards to Mr. Pollard, he is a person who was convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence, and I don't have any update on his situation,"" Carney said. But the fact the United States is willing to discuss his release before even a framework agreement has been reached between the parties shows the extraordinary efforts Washington is making to salvage the troubled negotiations. When asked about whether Pollard was a topic in Kerry's talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""Jonathan Pollard was convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence. I do not have any update for you on his status."" Kerry met Monday with Netanyahu and was expected to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Tuesday. The negotiations, which began in July, have hit a snag over whether Israel will agree to release more than two dozen prisoners, including 14 Arab Israelis who Israel considers terrorists. They were scheduled to be freed on March 29 and now Palestinian negotiators are threatening to end the negotiations over the delay. Israel has already released three groups of prisoners, most of whom have served lengthy prison terms for attacks on Israelis, but this final release is especially contentious because it includes convicted murderers. Netanyahu has said he would seek approval for any further releases with his cabinet, which has been critical of the previous releases. Netanyahu has also said he would not release any more prisoners if President Abbas did not agree to continue negotiations and to stop threatening to seek recognition for Palestinians before international bodies.","Jonathan Pollard is serving a life sentence after a 1987 spying conviction .

"(CNN) -- It turned out to be a duel between the young, reigning world champion and a motorcycling racing legend. The former won. Marc Marquez held off Valentino Rossi to claim the opening MotoGP race of the season in Qatar on Sunday, picking up where he left off last year. That despite breaking his leg last month while dirt biking. Marquez took control in his Repsol Honda with nine of the 22 laps remaining but nine-time world champion Rossi caught him with two laps to go in his Yamaha. The lead changed hands a few times until Marquez led entering the final lap -- and Rossi couldn't get close enough to pass him again. Repsol Honda's Dani Pedrosa finished a distant third. ""I enjoyed a lot that race, especially after the injury,"" Marquez told BT Sport. ""I didn't expect that race, honestly. But yesterday I had a good feeling and today the last lap with Valentino, I didn't think about the leg and the injury. ""The last lap I pushed my 100% but not before we overtook each other two or three times. It was so nice, no?"" The 21-year-old, who lost his pole advantage seconds after the start, saved his fastest lap time for the end. But Rossi wasn't too disappointed, especially since he began well behind on the grid. ""I was a little bit not precise in my mind because I said, 'What do I do? Do I attack?'"" Rossi told BT Sport. ""But starting from 10th, second is a great result. ""Marc was strong. I tried, tried and tried but at the end I was unfortunately a little bit too far (away). ""I enjoyed the race very much."" Rossi's teammate, Jorge Lorenzo, didn't. The two-time MotoGP world champion -- and last year's winner in Qatar -- crashed in the first lap after a blistering start that saw him move to the front. He was unhurt. ""Luckily I feel good,"" he told BT Sport. ""I lost the front. I made a junior mistake.""

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho suffered his first ever home defeat in the English Premier League as Chelsea slumped to a 2-1 loss to bottom side Sunderland at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Portuguese manager's remarkable 77-match unbeaten record which covers both his spells at the west London club was ended when former Chelsea player Fabio Borini scored an 82nd-minute winner. The Italian, who is currently on loan to Sunderland from league leaders Liverpool, slotted home from the penalty spot after Cesar Azpilicueta had been adjudged to have fouled Jozy Altidore by referee Mike Dean. The decision incensed Chelsea assistant coach Rui Faria who angrily confronted Dean before being sent to the stands. After squandering two points at Manchester City in midweek, Gus Poyet's side weren't about to make the same mistake twice and gamely held on for the win despite concerted pressure from the home side. The win isn't enough to lift Sunderland off the foot of the table but it does move them to within one point of Cardiff and Fulham who each have 30 points and have played one game extra. Earlier, Samuel Eto'o had put the Blues ahead steering home neatly from a corner in the 12th minute before Conor Wickham scored his third goal in two matches six minutes later -- the 21-year-old firing home after goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer had spilled Marcos Alonso's speculative shot. Despite enjoying almost two thirds of possession, Chelsea failed to find a way through Sunderland's defenses converting just one of their 31 scoring opportunities. The Blues' third league defeat in six matches leaves them two points adrift of leaders Liverpool who can move five points clear if they beat Norwich City on Sunday. Mourinho has been insisting for some time that his team are not favorites for the title and now his pessimistic predictions are perhaps coming true. He wasn't taking questions on that subject or any others following Saturday's loss, choosing instead to issue a brusque statement. ""I just want to say four things, and I'm sorry, because if you make me (answer) more questions, I will repeat in exactly the same way,"" a dejected Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""Congratulations to my players, because they gave what they have and what they don't have. Congratulations to Sunderland, because they won. Congratulations to Mike Dean, because he made a fantastic performance. ""And congratulations to Mike Riley (the man in charge of Premier League referees), because what they did during the season was fantastic for the way the championship is going. ""So congratulations to all of them, and I have nothing more to say. I'm sorry."" When Mourinho has prized his tongue out from his cheek he will have the task of getting his players ready for Tuesday's Champions League semifinal first leg at Atletico Madrid. After that, there is the small matter of a league trip to Liverpool next weekend. In the remaining Premier League matches Tottenham Hotspur beat Fulham 3-1 at White Hart Lane. Back-to-back wins in their last two matches had given the Cottagers hope of avoiding the drop but Saturday's defeat keeps them second-from-bottom, two points from safety with only three games remaining. Spurs, meanwhile, remain sixth with 63 points from 35 games. Fellow strugglers Cardiff City drew 1-1 with Stoke City to move up to 18th in the table while Aston Villa and Southampton played out a goalless draw. Crystal Palace beat West Ham United 1-0 at Upton Park to record a fifth straight win while Swansea City beat Newcastle United 2-1 at St James' Park. Arsenal are away to Hull and Everton take on David Moyes' Manchester United at Goodison Park on Sunday. PSG lift French League Cup . Paris Saint-Germain won the French League Cup for a fourth time defeating Lyon 2-1 at the Stade de France on Saturday night. Two first-half goals from Edinson Cavani -- one from open play in the fourth minute, the other a 32nd-minute penalty -- handed the Ligue 1 leaders the advantage before Alexandre Lacazette 56th-minute goal halved the deficit. Laurent Blanc's side held on against the side they lost to in the league last weekend to clinch what will likely be a cup and league double -- PSG are currently 10 points clear of Monaco in Ligue 1 with five games remaining. Over in Germany, Bayern Munich warmed up for their Champions League semifinal first leg match against Real Madrid with a 2-0 win against bottom-of-the-table Braunschweig. Pep Guardiola's side, who have already been crowned Bundesliga champions, bounced back from back-to-back league defeats with late goals from Claudio Pizarro and Mario Mandzukic. Borussia Dortmund consolidated second place with a 4-2 win over Mainz. Schalke can move back to within three points of Jurgen Klopp's side, who now have 64 points from 31 games, with a win away at Stuttgart on Sunday. Elsewhere there were also wins for Wolfsburg, Frieburg and Werder Bremen. The match between Augsburg and Hertha Berlin ended 0-0. In Italy, Juventus remain on course for third successive Serie A title after a 1-0 against relegation-threatened Bologna kept Antonio Conte's side eight points clear of second-place Roma. Rudi Garcia's men kept their slim chances of overhauling Juve alive with a 1-0 at fourth-place Fiorentina while third place Napoli drew 1-1 at Udinese. At the foot of the table, Catania kept their feint hopes of avoiding relegation alive with a 2-1 win against Sampdoria. Victory moves them to within two points of Livorno who lost 3-0 to AC Milan. The win lifts the Rossoneri to seventh, level on points with sixth-placed Parma who lost 2-0 to Inter. Three matches were played in Spain on Saturday. Real Sociedad moved up to sixth with a 2-1 against Espanyol while the games between Osasuna and Valencia and Levante's match with Getafe ended in draws. Barcelona return to league action on Sunday against Athletic Bilbao after losing 2-1 to arch rivals Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Andy Weir had given up on writing as a career at the age of 26 after agents spurned his novel about a jewel heist involving aliens ""on the Planet Sephalon."" After burning through severance checks from his layoff by AOL, he went back to work as a programmer in Silicon Valley. Ten years later, in 2009, Weir decided to try writing again, but just as a hobby. Keeping his day job at a mobile phone software company, he started posting a new book on a personal website, chapter by chapter as he wrote it. This time, there were no aliens and no imaginary planet. Instead he crafted a story, set a few decades in the future, about an astronaut who mistakenly gets left for dead on Mars when the other members of his crew are forced to make a quick escape from the effects of a devastating sandstorm. This book found an audience. People starting following the story and it attracted scientists, including some who e-mailed Weir and offered suggestions to make the book's excursions into physics, chemistry and biology true to science. Today Weir's ""The Martian"" is on the New York Times hardcover fiction bestseller list and has been optioned by 20th Century Fox for a potential movie, raising the question: How does a space nerd with no track record as a writer craft a compelling work of science fiction? The book's hero, a cheeky astronaut named Mark Watney, possesses a self-reliance that enables him to jerry-rig NASA equipment in a suspenseful battle to eke out enough air, food and water to survive alone on Mars. In an interview with CNN, Weir said that his lead character is ""smarter and braver than I am. The core personality that most people noticed -- that he's a massive smart ass -- that's basically my personality."" Watney finds ways to heal the injury that led his fellow astronauts to abandon him, thinking he was dead; to grow food in the ""hab"" module that is his home on Mars, to turn hydrogen and oxygen into water, to restore communication with NASA, and to drive his rover on the inhospitable Martian landscape far further than it was designed to go. And yet critical life-support components keep failing, mishaps keep setting him back, and he keeps concluding that he's certainly about to die. There's more than enough science and technology for the technically literate, and although he's never worked at NASA, Weir has gotten compliments for the accuracy of his portrait of an enormous bureaucracy's infighting as it struggles to save a man tens of millions of miles away. In the story, Watney's lonely struggle captures the attention of billions on Earth, even spawning a daily half-hour cable news program: ""CNN's Mark Watney Report."" The book builds up the kind of narrative tension captured in the Oscar best-picture contender ""Gravity,"" which Weir liked, even though it may have stretched the science. (""It doesn't have to be perfectly physically accurate to be entertaining. Nobody calls out the physics problems in 'Star Wars.'"") Yet accuracy is one of the things that gets cited in praise for Weir's book. Astronaut Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station, has said the book ""has the very rare combination of a good, original story, interestingly real characters, and fascinating technical accuracy,"" according to Crown, the book's publisher. Now 41, Weir is the son of a particle physicist -- his father double-checked much of the science in ""The Martian"" -- and an engineer. He got hooked on Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein and other classic science fiction writers by plucking their paperbacks from his father's shelf. Predictably, Weir is fascinated by manned spaceflight and intrigued by the idea of a manned mission to Mars. But he's no fan of Mars One, the nonprofit that has gotten 200,000 people to express interest in being selected for a one-way trip to Mars, to take place in 2025. Weir thinks the budget envisioned for the project is far too small and, ""it would be basically a death sentence for the people who are going."" He thinks a government-funded mission to Mars is far more likely but not for a long time. The after-effects suffered by astronauts on the International Space Station show the dangers of long-term space flight, he says. ""There are a lot of pieces of the puzzle that we need to invent"" to make for safe travel to Mars. Near term, he looks forward to a Chinese manned mission to the moon. As for NASA, Weir says he's ""disappointed by the state of our manned spaceflight program,"" especially the lack of a vehicle to replace the space shuttle. Would Weir want to fly on a space mission? ""I am not a brave man ...I do not have the right stuff. Astronauts are really a cut above."" As a computer programmer, the closest Weir got to fame was as a member of the team that worked on the hit game ""WarCraft2."" At his current job in Mountain View, California, Weir's bosses know the score, he says. ""I'm working on a pitch for my next novel right now, and if I get an advance, I'm going to quit and be a full time writer, which is the culmination of my dream coming true. I think I have to go sit in a coffee shop when I do that. And wear a neckerchief.""","Andy Weir finds it hard to break into science fiction, and works as a programmer instead .

"(CNN) -- Summer movie season is Seth Rogen's prime time. Over the past eight years, the writer/actor's been a major player in some of the season's biggest comedies, including 2005's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" 2007's ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad,"" and 2008's ""Pineapple Express."" This year, Rogen is poised to continue his summer streak when ""This Is the End"" opens June 12. The comedy, which Rogen co-wrote and co-directed with Evan Goldberg, boasts a long list of A-list names, including some of Rogen's regular co-stars like James Franco, Jay Baruchel and Jonah Hill. As the trailer humorously illustrates, the plot is basically this: Rogen brings his old friend Baruchel (""Knocked Up""; ""She's Out of My League"") along to a ""giant party"" at Franco's home, where the likes of Mindy Kaling, Jason Segel, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Rihanna and Michael Cera have gathered. Suddenly, in the middle of the revelry, the partygoers step outside to find a world in the midst of an apocalypse. Mayhem ensues, leaving Rogen's team to their own devices in order to make it out alive. (At one point, the terror even includes an ax-wielding Emma Watson.) The conceit is that all of the stars are portraying ""themselves"" in the flick, either playing up the public's perceptions about them or playing against type. ""We wanted ('This Is the End') to feel very real,"" Rogen said. ""We liked the idea of us playing ourselves, because we thought it's cool if the movie really takes place in the same world that the viewers of the movie live in. There's no separation between your world as the audience and our world as the people in the movie."" But overall, especially for the main six at the center of the story -- Rogen, Franco, Hill, Baruchel, Craig Robinson and Danny McBride -- ""no one's anything like how they are in the movie in real life,"" Rogen said. ""They're all very nice, sweet people. In the movie, they're all idiots."" By now an old pro at writing comedies, Rogen feels confident that he and Goldberg have crafted at least an entertaining film. ""I don't know if it will be successful or not, but I'm very proud of it. I think it's funny,"" Rogen said. ""I watched it with a lot of movie theaters full of people, and they genuinely seemed to really really get a kick out of it. It played as well as any of our movies, so I'm like out of the woods in my head.

"(CNN) -- Escaped Michigan convict Michael David Elliot was captured Monday in LaPorte County, Indiana, authorities said. His capture ended a manhunt that kicked into overdrive after a woman abducted by Elliot managed to call 911. Locked in a gas station bathroom, she whispers into her cell phone, as he banged on the door. ""He didn't say where, exactly, he just said somewhere far,"" she says in the 911 call, telling the dispatcher about the escaped convict she says had abducted her some two hours before with a box cutter and a hammer. She slipped away from him when they stopped for gas. ""He's knocking on the bathroom door saying, 'Let's go!' "" the 911 dispatcher says to other emergency workers in recordings released by authorities. The Sunday night call from an Elkhart, Indiana, gas station had been the first sign of Elliot, a convicted murderer, since his escape hours before from Ionia Correctional Facility in central Michigan. On Monday, a homeowner in LaGrange County, Indiana, found the woman's Jeep Liberty in a residential area of the town of Shipshewana, about 20 miles east of Elkhart, sheriff's spokesman Arron Knisley said. Elliot himself remained missing then, however. Details on how he was caught were not immediately available. CNN first learned about his capture on Twitter. Prison authorities discovered Elliot gone about 9:30 p.m. Sunday. He apparently pulled back the bottoms of two fences and crawled underneath to escape, Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Russell L. Marlan said. He was serving five life sentences on a 1994 conviction for killing four people, according to Michigan Department of Corrections records. Authorities warned the public not to mess with him. The kidnapped woman, whose name has not been released by authorities, told a 911 dispatcher from her bathroom stronghold that Elliot forced his way into her red Jeep Liberty as she sat parked on West Main Street in Ionia. He was an escaped convict, he told her. Murder, she said. And he had a box cutter and a hammer. But, she said, he hadn't hurt her. ""He just wants to get someplace far from Ionia,"" she told the dispatcher. Unfortunately for police, by the time they arrived at the Marathon gas station, Elliot had fled in the woman's Jeep. He was seen getting on Interstate 80/90, but authorities don't know which direction he was traveling or where he was heading. The interstate connects Elkhart with Chicago to the west and Toledo, Ohio, to the east. Elliot was known as a good prisoner, according to Corrections Director Daniel Heyens. ""Nothing in this man's history would have indicated a high risk of escape,"" Heyens said. ""He was serving his time."" Prison authorities believe he acted alone, Heyens said. According to court documents, Elliot was convicted in the August 1993 murders of Vickie Currie; her boyfriend, Michael Tufnell; his brother Bruce Tufnell; and Kathy Lane, CNN affiliate WXMI reported. Elliot and three others hatched a plan to steal drug money, WXMI said, and after they didn't find the money, Elliot and another man killed the four victims and set Michael Tufnell's house on fire. CNN's George Howell, Rick Martin, Holly Yan and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","Michael David Elliot was captured in LaPorte County, Indiana .

"(CNN) -- The three-way battle for the Spanish league title took another dramatic twist on Wednesday night as Real Madrid suffered their second defeat in four days. After a humbling by Barcelona in El Clasico on Sunday, Real were sunk 2-1 away at Sevilla thanks to a brace from Colombian striker Carlos Bacca. To add to the misery of Cristiano Ronaldo and company, their two title rivals -- Barcelona and Atletico Madrid -- both triumphed to relegate them to third in the table. Atletico hit the summit after a solitary goal from Diego Costa saw them past Granada, while Barcelona sit just a point back after they eased past Celta Vigo 3-0. Real now trail their city rivals by three points, and have an inferior head-to-head record, which would come into effect if they ended the season level on points. Los Blancos did take the lead on 14 minutes when Cristiano Ronaldo's free kick took a big deflection off the wall to wrong foot Sevilla goalkeeper Beto. But the home side drew level just five minutes later when Bacca finished off a counter attack that started when Xabi Alonso squandered possession. Real missed a host of chances to restore their lead and paid the price when Bacca netted the winner with 20 minutes remaining. It meant Real suffered successive league defeats for the first time since 2009. Earlier in the evening, Barcelona registered a comfortable 3-0 victory over Celta Vigo largely thanks to their potent strike force but lost goalkeeper Victor Valdes to a serious knee injury. Neymar has struggled to find consistency after his move from Brazilian club Santos but he outscored the Spanish club's record all-time scorer Lionel Messi on the night by grabbing two goals. Barcelona were in front after just six minutes, Alexis Sanchez galloping on to Messi's defense-splitting pass, before squaring for Neymar who registered his first goal for the club since the middle of February. Valdes then departed on a stretcher after landing badly when saving a shot on goal, the club confirming he had torn his cruciate ligament and will have to undergo surgery. Argentina striker Messi made it 2-0 on the half hour mark, running onto Andres Iniesta's through ball before firing into the net for his 23rd goal of the season and his eighth in the last four matches. Neymar wrapped up the match in the second half with his 11th league goal of the campaign, finishing smartly from inside the area. In the English Premier League, Liverpool boosted their hopes of landing a first domestic title since 1990 with a 2-1 victory over lowly Sunderland. Captain Steven Gerrard opened the scoring with a fierce free kick from the edge of the penalty area before England striker Daniel Sturridge grabbed his 20th league goal of the season in the second half. Sturridge and the EPL's top scorer Luis Suarez both wasted opportunities before a header from Sunderland's South Korean midfielder Ki Sung-Yueng set up a nervy final 15 minutes. The victory -- Liverpool's seventh in a row in the league -- sent them second in the table, one point behind leaders Chelsea. Elsewhere, West Ham beat ten-man Hull City 2-1 thanks to an own goal from James Chester to move up to 11th in the standings. Hull's goalkeeper Allan McGregor was sent off for a foul on Mohamed Diame early on, Mark Noble converting the penalty. Nikica Jelavic leveled for Hull before Chester's error restored West Ham's lead. In Italy, Juventus restored their lead at the top of Serie A to 14 points after a brace from Argentina striker Carlos Tevez helped them to a 2-1 win over Parma. Two goals from Duvan Zapata helped Napoli to a 4-2 victory away at Catania and stay comfortable in third while AC Milan won 2-0 at Fiorentina thanks to strikes from Philippe Mexes and Mario Balotelli.","Atletico Madrid go top of La Liga after Diego Costa's goal helps them beat Granada .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Where do fighter pilots traveling faster than the speed of sound go when they really need to ""go""? Pilots have struggled for years with the lack of toilet facilities in flight. Until recently, the answer has been: into a bag. But it's not a great solution. ""Piddle packs"" -- heavy-duty bags containing absorbent sponges -- have been blamed for at least two crashes over the years, and they're not always tidy. A few years ago, after enduring years of complaints from pilots, the Air Force let it be known that it was looking for an answer. A small medical equipment development company in Milton, Vermont answered the call. ""The DoD put out a list of projects they needed solutions for,"" said Mark Harvie, president of Omni Medical Solutions. ""Bladder relief for pilots was one of the items on the list and we were looking for a new project,"" he said.  Watch how apparatus makes it possible for pilots to drink up, fly high » . That project turned into the Advanced Mission Extender Device, known in military jargon as the AMXD. After four years of testing by the Vermont Air National Guard and the Air Force and about $5 million in government and private funds, AMXD is spelling relief for pilots aloft. Under the old system, pilots routinely avoid liquids before taking off to prevent the unmentionable. But dehydration can make them more susceptible to the G-forces typically seen in fighter aircraft, Harvie said. When nature's call becomes too pressing to ignore, a pilot has to fly and unbuckle the harness at the same time -- while using both hands to maneuver around in a seat to which he or she is virtually molded. The aerobatic maneuver is even harder for female pilots. On long or cold-weather flights, the amount of gear and clothing made the maneuver nearly impossible, and pilots would sometimes have no choice but to relieve themselves in their flight suits. In the AMXD, a cup for a man and a pad for a woman is strategically placed before the pilot dons a flight suit. An instructional DVD tells pilots: ""When the time comes to urinate, unzip the flight suit, remove the hose.... The control unit will pump the urine from the cup to the collection bag, where it will be chemically gelled.""  See how the system works » . Pilots are free to think about other business. Harvie said the reviews have been positive from pilots of both genders. ""One woman had the device taken away after testing and was quite unhappy about having to return to the old method,"" he said. ""The AMXD worked as advertised. I believe it's a much better system and needs to be fielded ASAP,"" says an unidentified pilot in a testimonial on the instructional DVD. The Air Force recently bought its first 300 systems for U.S. pilots around the world at $2,000 each. There's room for expansion. The air service has more than 4,200 fighter pilots who fly planes that have no bathrooms, planes like the F-16, F-15, A-10 and the most advanced fighter, the F-22. The system has already seen action in combat zones: Female helicopter pilots from the Netherlands used the system in Afghanistan. Harvie said it's too early to know whether the device will become standard issue, but it has attracted plenty of interest. ""The Navy and Army are starting to look at the system for ground troops and carrier pilots, and looking at a version for private-sector uses,"" Harvie said. Harvie said the Belgian Air Force has bought the system for its F-16 pilots.","Fighter pilots used ""Piddle packs,"" heavy-duty bags, when they had to ""go""

"(CNN) -- New York police officer Gilberto Valle conspired to kidnap women, who prosecutors argued he planned to rape, torture, cook and eat, a federal jury decided Tuesday. Valle's lawyers argued the former police officer's e-mails and online postings were just ""fantasy role-play"" and"" dark improv theater,"" but prosecutors said he was ""deadly serious."" Valle, 28, faces life in prison for the kidnap conspiracy conviction. He was also found guilty of illegally accessing a federal law enforcement database. The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a cop, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said. No one was ever kidnapped or eaten, but the jury did see what prosecutors said were detailed plans to carry out Valle's plot. Graphic photos, how-to-kidnap searches found on cop's computer . A document found on his wife's laptop was titled ""Abducting and Cooking Kimberly -- A Blueprint."" It included a photograph of Kimberly Sauer and personal information, including her bra size and shoe size. Sauer's testimony revealed that some of the information -- a different last name, birthplace, birth date and college education -- was inaccurate. The same document listed ""materials needed,"" which included a gag, rope, chloroform and a tarp for the trunk. The FBI never found any of these items in Valle's possession. References to the blueprint were found in chats the FBI deemed ""fantasy role-play,"" along with references to waterboarding and chloroform, terms frequently used in the online conversations. Valle, a six year NYPD veteran, planned to kidnap three women during the week of February 20, 2012, prosecutors said, pointing to some of the e-mails and chats. He communicated online with three co-conspirators, including a man identified as ""Moody Blues"" or ""Chris Collins"" or ""meatmarketman,"" who Valle met on the Dark Fetish Network, prosecutors said. ""Meatmarketman,"" who lives in the United Kingdom, bragged in one conversation about one of his past victims, sending Valle a picture, and saying he ""tried her alive first, actually it wasn't very good, very bloody."" Graphic e-mails read at trial . Court records show that Valle got the addresses of his alleged targets by sending them a police charity card that he claimed would ""get (them) out of a minor traffic violation"" if they are pulled over by police. The police charity card was a ruse, prosecutor Randall Jackson argued. Defense attorney Julia Gatto argued Valle's conduct was ""pure fiction"" and ""make believe."" Gatto tried to show that Valle provided false information about the alleged targets' locations to some people he chatted with online. In one instance, Valle said the woman was at a college four hours away, even though she attended school in New York. In other instances, he said he was watching an alleged target, when she really lived in Ohio. Records indicate Valle never went to Ohio. Gatto told the jury that it was a part of ""crude, stupid, infantile, masturbatory storytelling."" ""I have a world in my mind,"" Valle wrote in an e-mail to one fantasy role-play partner. ""In that world I'm kidnapping women and selling them to people interested in buying them,"" she read aloud from Valle's e-mail conversation. In one online chat, Valle said he was working on a story that featured ""a restaurant that sells women in all varieties, sometimes grilled or roasted as whole, sometimes in steaks or pieces, sometimes a la carte, or in a buffet."" ""His porn consists of dead bodies,"" Assistant U.S Attorney Randall Jackson told jurors. ""That is not normal."" Valle will be sentenced June 19 by U.S. District Court Judge Paul Gardephe. CNN's Mark Norman contributed to this report.","Gilberto Valle faces life in prison for the kidnapping conspiracy .

"(CNN) -- David Moyes has been appointed as the new manager of Manchester United after agreeing a six-year deal. The 50-year-old, who will replace Alex Ferguson on July 1, revealed his desire to leave current club Everton earlier Thursday. Moyes, who has been in charge at Goodison Park since 2002, will take charge of the club's final two Premier League games of the season before making the move to Old Trafford. ""It's a great honor to be asked to be the next manager of Manchester United,"" Moyes told United's official website. ""I am delighted that Sir Alex saw fit to recommend me for the job. I have great respect for everything he has done and for the football club. ""I know how hard it will be to follow the best manager ever, but the opportunity to manage Manchester United isn't something that comes around very often and I'm really looking forward to taking up the post next season. ""I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players. ""Between now and the end of the season, I will do everything in my power to make sure we finish as high as possible in the table. ""Everton's fantastic fans have played a big part in making my years at Goodison so enjoyable and I thank them wholeheartedly for the support they have given me and the players. Everton will be close to me for the rest of my life."" Moyes has been publicly endorsed by Ferguson, who says his fellow Scot is the perfect man to take over at the helm. ""When we discussed the candidates that we felt had the right attributes we unanimously agreed on David Moyes,"" Ferguson told the club's official website. ""David is a man of great integrity with a strong work ethic. I've admired his work for a long time and approached him as far back as 1998 to discuss the position of Assistant Manager here. ""He was a young man then at the start of his career and has since gone on to do a magnificent job at Everton. ""There is no question he has all the qualities we expect of a manager at this Club."" Delighted . The appointment has been met with approval by leading players with defender Rio Ferdinand claiming the squad was ""delighted."" He told the club's televisions station: ""I think it was important that the club made a decision quickly and it all got sorted out. I think the club have acted impeccably in that sense. ""The manager, I'm sure, thought long and hard about his own decision, he made it and then the club acted swiftly and it's great to see the new manager coming in."" ""Another reason I think it's a good appointment is that David Moyes will be very, very open and sympathetic to the traditions of the club and he'll try to continue that and not come in and make changes in terms of the whole characteristics of the club."" Moyes told Everton chairman Bill Kenwright of his desire to join Manchester United and succeed Ferguson on Wednesday. Moyes has never won a major trophy with Everton after more than a decade in the English top flight, but has consistently produced competitive teams on a tight budget. The Liverpool-based side has finished outside the Premier League's top-10 only three times since he took over in 2002, and qualified for the European Champions League in 2005. ""Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the Club at the end of the season,"" the Merseyside club said in a statement. ""The manager met chairman Bill Kenwright on Wednesday May 8 and confirmed his desire to join Manchester United."" The statement added: ""The chairman, on behalf of the club, would like to place on record his thanks to David for the massive contribution he has made to Everton since his arrival in March 2002. He has been an outstanding manager. Moyes took charge of Everton on over 500 occasions with the club qualifying for Europe four times during his time as manager. His final two games as Everton manager will be against West Ham United and Chelsea. ""Everton officials will start the search for a replacement manager immediately,"" added the Everton statement. Everton's Belgian international Marouane Fellaini ‏tweeted: ""Many Thanks Coach."" Moyes will now be in charge of a club that under Ferguson twice won Europe's top competition and lifted the English championship 13 times following the 71-year-old's arrival in 1986. United is one of the world's biggest sporting brands, worth a reported $3.17 billion, with a fan base of more than 650 million worldwide. Moyes arrives with United having sealed a series of lucrative sponsorship deals aimed at maximizing off-pitch revenue in order to be competitive under European football's financial fair play rules. The club has been repaying large amounts of debt since it was bought by the American Glazer family in a highly leveraged £800 million ($1.25 billion) takeover in 2005. This month United reported record third-quarter earnings of £91.7 million ($142 million) but an 18% increase in operating expenses plus payments on a gross debt that has fallen to £367.6 million ($572 million) meant a pre-tax loss of £3.15 million ($4.9 million) for the period. Whether Moyes will be given significant funds to strengthen the squad for United's EPL title defense remains to be seen -- Borussia Dortmund's top scorer Robert Lewandowski has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but the Poland striker would command a hefty fee and wage packet. United did not have to pay Everton compensation for Moyes, as his contract had been due to expire in July. Moyes may need to find a replacement for Wayne Rooney, who has told the club he wants to leave according to British reports Thursday -- but United said he is not for sale. Moyes gave Rooney his debut as a 16-year-old at Everton but they fell out when the England striker left for Old Trafford in 2004. Moyes later sued the player and his publisher over remarks made in his autobiography, but they settled out of court. Rooney handed in a transfer request in late 2010, but was persuaded to stay by Ferguson and rewarded with a lucrative new contract that still has two years to run.","David Moyes will take over at Manchester United on July 1st .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Anti-government protesters in Thailand have stormed the offices of the country's finance ministry, as mass demonstrations raise political tensions to the highest level since the deadly unrest of 2010. Anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister under the previous Democrat-led government, led the group of protesters who entered the ministry compound, in the protesters' boldest act since demonstrations broke out three weeks ago. Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told CNN the compound had been taken over by protesters, pockets of whom had become increasingly hostile to local and foreign media. He said a German photographer had earlier been attacked during a protest at the headquarters of the Royal Thai Police Monday morning, where thousands of demonstrators had called for an audience with police bosses. ""We demand to meet with Police Commissioner-General Adul Saengsingkaew,"" protest leader Puttipong Punnakun told CNN. More than three weeks of anti-government protests led by the opposition Democrat Party rose to a crescendo Sunday as about 100,000 demonstrators turned out in Bangkok, and escalated Monday as leaders vowed to extend their rallies to government offices, TV networks and military installations. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra responded by extending the areas around Bangkok where police are enforcing an internal security law that restricts gatherings by demonstrators. ""What has been going on now is affecting people's livelihoods and orderliness, as well as disrupting services at government offices,"" she said Monday. ""Therefore it is necessary for the government to enforce the law."" The government had imposed the security measures in central Bangkok several weeks ago. But the law hasn't so far been strictly enforced. Thaugsuban told demonstrators gathered Sunday of plans to march on media outlets and government buildings Monday, calling on civil servants to join the cause. ""We will separate into 13 groups to march to 13 locations to express our stance,"" he said. ""Our protest will not stop until Thaksin's regime is wiped out."" Protest leaders are calling for an end to the government of Yingluck, sister of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecommunications tycoon who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Critics of the Thai prime minister accuse her of being a puppet of her older brother Thaksin, a deeply polarizing figure who was removed from power by the military while in New York in 2006. He has since lived in exile, except for a brief return in 2008, and was convicted by Thai courts for corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in jail later that year. The current protests have reanimated the tensions along Thailand's political faultlines -- Thaksin Shinawatra's mostly rural support base on one side, the Bangkok-based elite and middle classes on the other -- that left the country wracked with turbulence for four years after the 2006 coup, culminating in a 2010 army crackdown on Thaksin supporters that left more than 90 dead. An estimated 40,000 pro-government ""red shirts"" -- many from the rural areas -- gathered in a Bangkok stadium Sunday in a show of support for the embattled prime minister, who came to power in a 2011 election. The current round of protests was triggered in response to a government-backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to Thaksin Shinawatra and opened the door for his return to Thailand. The Thai senate rejected the amnesty bill on November 11, but since then demonstrations have only grown, with Suthep calling for the current government to be replaced by a new administration. Yingluck Shinawatra has responded to the escalating situation with a call for unity, reconciliation and respect for law. ""The government has instructed police and all security officers to handle the situation gently, based on international practices, so the demonstration won't be used as a tool by people who want to make changes in a non-democratic way,"" she said in a statement on her official Facebook page. More than a dozen countries have issued travel warnings for citizens to avoid areas near protests in Bangkok.","NEW: The Prime Minister broadens internal security measures .

"(CNN) -- A British betting firm has sparked outrage with a controversial advert which offers punters money back if South African sports star Oscar Pistorius is found not guilty of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Bookmaker Paddy Power began its book on the outcome of the trial last week, prompting widespread criticism on social media, but then updated its offer with the advert to coincide with Monday's start of the trial in Pretoria. It features a photograph of Pistorius mocked up as an Oscar-style Academy Award statuette with the strap line: ""It's Oscar Time. Money Back If He Walks. We will refund all losing bets on Oscar Pistorius if he is found not guilty."" In response, an online petition has been started on change.org, demanding that Paddy Power withdraws its ""offensive betting"" on the outcome of the trial and donates any profits to a women's charity fighting domestic violence. It quickly gathered over 60,000 signatures and counting within a few hours of being promoted. The petition was started by Jean Hatchet, who said on the campaign page she was herself a ""survivor of domestic violence and abuse."" Her statement added: ""I know how many women around the world are suffering right now thinking that they are lucky to be alive when poor Reeva Steenkamp is dead. ""Paddy Power are putting all survivors and the families of those who died through even more pain and anguish and they must stop."" Holly Dustin, director of End Violence Against Women, told the UK's Press Association of her disgust at the ad campaign. ""They are making a game out of murder and the brutal killing of a young woman, which is unacceptable,"" she said. ""It is not just that this is a bit sick -- it also actually contributes to a culture in which violence against women is trivialized or made into a bit of a joke."" There has also been condemnation from lawmakers, with Yvette Cooper, the opposition Labour Party's Shadow Home Secretary, taking to Twitter say it was ""sick and shameful"" to run bets on the trial. Paddy Power, which has its head office in Ireland but is regulated in the UK, told CNN that it would not be withdrawing the offer. ""We are not planning to take down our betting on the Pistorius trial verdict,"" a spokesperson said Monday. ""We have a long history of offering odds on major global news events and the Oscar Pistorius trial is no different. ""The world will be watching this trial on dedicated media channels offering rolling coverage and speculating on the verdict across social media. ""We are simply offering betting on the outcome of the trial -- this is nothing new when it comes to high-profile court cases."" Paddy Power has boosted its profile and profits with a series of irreverent campaigns, using social media to spread its message. When U.S. President Barack Obama visited Dublin in May 2011, the bookmaker renamed some its shops ""O'Bama Power,"" while last July it dressed up four large men in nappies to go around London to publicize its odds on the royal baby ahead of Prince George's birth. But its sponsorship of Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" in North Korea last year was shelved in December after a brutal crackdown by the country's leader Kim Jong-Un on political rivals. Pistorius pleaded not guilty to the murder of Steenkamp and several weapons-related charges on the first day of his trial. He has achieved world wide fame for his track and field feats, winning six Paralympic gold medals as well as becoming the first double amputee to compete in the Olympics, running for South Africa in the Summer Games in London in 2012. Pistorius earned his nickname the ""Blade Runner"" because of the special prostheses he uses while running in events from the 100m to his specialist 400m.","UK betting firm Paddy Power offering odds on the Oscar Pistorius trial .

"Sochi (CNN) -- Amid security anxieties, indignation over Russian politics, the furore over unfinished media accommodation and astronomic costs, one key component of the Winter Olympics has been all but forgotten: the thousands of athletes streaming into Sochi. When not competing, they will spend a large chunk of their time at the Olympic Village -- the traditional home for most of those taking part. Sochi has two to boast: one in the imposing landscape of the Caucasus mountains; the other on the Black Sea's sunny northern banks. These are dwellings that resemble small towns -- you need a lot of rooms to house 6,000 athletes from 85 nations. The coastal destination surely proves an easy sell to any would-be resident for the month of February. If holiday brochures existed for a stay in the Olympic Village, it might read: . ""Upmarket holiday camp, with pleasant residential buildings that come inclusive with very own McDonald's, round-the-clock dining room with flavors from around the world, fully-fitted games room -- boasting table tennis, pool tables and computer games -- free bar and 24-hour gym, in great location just off the beach. ""There are grass lawns to sit out on and enjoy the sun (the climate is so favorable they say there are only three seasons, winter is skipped on the coast), traffic is non-existent and crime is wonderfully low. "" Just as importantly for the athletes, their accommodation is a stone's throw away from some of the best winter sport facilities in the world, making it possible to have your breakfast and walk to the ice rink in under 10 minutes -- a first in Winter Olympic history. But with any holiday accommodation, and especially when you have thousands of happy campers to please, there have been a few teething problems. So the management would like to apologize for the swimming pools not being ready -- they are currently empty of water -- and an inability to fulfil the promise of creating landscapes in and around the athletes' blocks. ""In the brochure the organizers provided to the teams this area was meant to be a bird sanctuary ... but I don't think they were able to plant the trees in time,"" Team GB short-track speed skater Charlotte Gilmartin told CNN . ""But apart from that everything else has been great!"" added Gilmartin as she follows the gravel path which navigates across an area of wasteland separating the dining facilities from her team's apartment building. We'll guess from that she'd give it a four-star rating as she crosses the road and opens the door to a building which, on every floor, has balconies festooned with British flags. Flags which, incidentally, have already become a source of rivalry between athletes from competing nations, if the images posted on Twitter and Instagram are anything to go by -- the bigger the better. For the duration of the Games, Gilmartin will call this home. Once inside, after traveling up four flights in an elevator that still has that freshly-installed smell, we walk down a clean, window-lit passageway to a door that has a Union Jack flag doormat daubed with a ""Welcome"" message. Gilmartin's airy, open-plan room consists of two single beds -- she shares it with a teammate -- with sea views from a decent-sized balcony, a modern bathroom, double-glazed windows, storage cupboards and an ample lounge area with television. Orange bikes . As with all Olympic Games, the organizers provide teams with a fully functional room with basic furniture -- similar in quality to a well-known Swedish brand by the look of it -- and then allow the respective Olympic associations to adorn the rooms as they see fit. In Team GB's case, this entails some patriotic pictures hung on the wall, the provision of ""good luck"" cuddly toys, themed cushions and the aforementioned doormat. Despite reports of pillow shortages in the mountain cluster village, both beds boast two cushions apiece. Each room's crowning glory is surely the uniquely patterned quilt for the beds that can then be taken home afterwards by competitors as a souvenir -- as is traditional for all Games . The 2014 quilts are light-blue with stitched diamonds of colored flowers. Very nice. Very Russian. So if there have been problems with hotels occupied by journalists, it seems the Winter Games athletes are having a very different experience. ""After five days I have no problems,"" says Russian speed skater Ekaterina Lobysheva -- a veteran of three Olympic Games -- speaking to CNN over a lunch of Chinese noodles. ""And the food is very good. I prefer Asian and Italian food, which is good because they have a cook here from Italy too. ""I'm lucky, I don't really have a diet because I use so many calories. This is the first time my country has hosted the Winter Games and I hope these facilities will help popularize my sport."" Finnish ice hockey player Susanna Tapan also gave the accommodation the thumbs up. ""It's very exciting. This is my first Olympics, and I'm enjoying it very much so far. The accommodation has been great."" One of the most striking attractions of the village is the way different nations bring their own distinctive characteristics. Most notably the Dutch, who are pedaling around on orange bikes. There may not be the recording studio that London 2012 laid on for the athletes, but between the gym, the bar, the dining room, the pool tables and the beach, there is plenty to keep them occupied. And if spectators find their hotels are closer to the standard of the athletes' village compared to that of the media accommodation, we might even start to get excited about the great sporting prospect that awaits. Let the Games begin!","Sochi's two Olympic villages house 6,000 athletes from 85 nations.

"(CNN) -- Sponsors of international soccer including Visa, Coca-Cola and Adidas have warned that an ethics scandal at the highest levels of the sport is hurting the sport and needs to be fixed. ""The current situation is clearly not good for the game,"" a Visa spokesman told CNN Tuesday, echoing comments from other companies that pay to have their logos at the World Cup and other major soccer events. The Visa spokesman declined to be named. ""The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA,"" Adidas chief communications officer Jan Runau told CNN Tuesday. FIFA President Sepp Blatter held an extraordinary press conference amid the scandal Monday night, insisting the organization was not in crisis after two top officials were suspended amid ethics concerns. Never mind Saint Sepp, the system is to blame . One of the officials, Mohamed Bin Hammam, was the only person running against Blatter for the presidency in an election scheduled for Wednesday. FIFA says the vote will go ahead on schedule, with Blatter as the only candidate. The powerful English Football Association called on FIFA Tuesday to delay the vote. ""This has been a very damaging time for the reputation of FIFA and therefore the whole of football,"" FA president David Bernstein said. The Scottish Football Association echoed the call. ""The events of the last two days, in particular, have made any election unworkable,"" SFA head Stewart Reagan said in a statement. Sponsor Emirates airlines said it was ""disappointed"" by the ""issues around the administration"" of FIFA, and Coca-Cola said Monday that the ethics allegations were ""distressing and bad for the sport."" The concerns come as Blatter shrugged off allegations of corruption within FIFA Monday and said he would press ahead with his bid to be re-elected as president for the fourth time. Bin Hammam of Qatar was suspended by the FIFA ethics committee Sunday, along with fellow leading official Jack Warner. ""We are not in a crisis, we are only in some difficulties and these can be solved inside our family,"" Blatter told a press conference Monday where he was continually pressed on both his own position and wider allegations of wrongdoing within FIFA. ""FIFA is strong enough to deal with our own problems,"" he asserted when asked if he had considered postponing Wednesday's vote by the 208-member FIFA Congress. FIFA is the body that decides where soccer's quadrennial World Cup will be held, among other responsibilities. Blatter ruled out a new vote on the venue for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after a suggestion that it had won unfairly. ""There is no issue for the World Cup in 2022,"" the 75-year-old Swiss said. ""I believe that the decision taken for the World Cup in 2022 was done exactly in the same pattern and in the same way as the 2018 tournament."" Bin Hamman, who led the Qatar bid, said earlier Monday that he would appeal his suspension. ""I am punished before I am found guilty,"" Bin Hammam said in a statement, saying he would ""not accept"" the decision. Blatter, who was cleared by the ethics committee, did admit that the whole affair had affected FIFA's reputation. ""What has happened in the last few days and week -- it has done great damage to the image of FIFA,"" he said. The press conference was conducted in an acrimonious atmosphere as frustrated journalists shouted out questions. ""We're not in a bazaar here, we are in an important congress,"" retorted Blatter at one point. It rounded off an extraordinary day of accusation and counter accusation, with CONCACAF chief Warner the focal point. ""At the end of the day, Blatter has to be stopped,"" Warner, whose organization covers North and Central America and the Caribbean, told gathered reporters, clearly angered by his expulsion from FIFA's executive committee. Warner also released an e-mail to reporters which implied that FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke believed there was corruption involved in Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. ""He thought he could buy FIFA as they bought the World Cup,"" Warner claims Valcke said of Bin Hammam in the e-mail. Qatar's football association Monday ""categorically denied any wrongdoing"" in connection with its bid, and said it was consulting lawyers and ""urgently seeking clarification from FIFA"" about the alleged Valcke comments. Valcke, who is not accused of ethics violations and is not under any investigation, admitted sending the email, but said his comments had been taken out of context. Warner and Bin Hammam both deny wrongdoing. In a further puzzling development Tuesday, Warner apparently performed a U-turn from his previous position and urged his region's members in an open lettter to vote for Blatter. ""At our last meeting we agreed as a Union to support the incumbent Joseph Sepp Blatter in his quest to regain the Presidency,"" Warner wrote. ""I wish to assure you nothing has changed - our mandate was set then and despite it all we must fulfil it."" CNN's David Wilkinson, Ben Wyatt, James Montague and Aaron Akin contributed to this report.","NEW: Sponsors of international football express concern about a top-level ethics scandal .

"(CNN) -- On a recent January night near the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn, Keri Russell was shooting FX's new Russian spy thriller show, ""The Americans."" She's receiving praise from Margo Martindale about some recent espionage work she's done as they go for a nightly stroll in a secluded park. Planes are flying overhead, along with a few lingering high school kids interrupting her train of thought, but Russell rarely wavers. She's stoic and serious, and her brow often looks slightly furrowed, which is exactly what you'd expect from someone playing a KGB spy. In between takes, she's out of character, talking about her kids, the Sundance Film Festival and how tired she thinks she ought to be. A call of ""action"" rings out, and just like that, she's back in spy mode. '""The Americans,"" which premieres at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on FX, takes place in the early '80s in the Washington area. The show comes from Joe Weisberg (""Falling Skies""), who trained to be a CIA case officer from 1990 to 1994. In 2010, when the arrest of a Russian spy network broke (including Anna Chapman), his bosses at DreamWorks Television were inspired and thought of him and his former undercover life, and ""The Americans"" was born. But right from the start, it wasn't going to be a rehashing of Bond-ian gadgets and crazy-named villains. The creators wanted to tell the story of two Russians who were brought up and trained to be undercover KGB agents and would pose as Americans to gather intelligence during the Cold War. The twist is these two agents, Elizabeth (Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys), would be married. They'd have kids. They'd buy American products, such as high-waisted Guess Jeans. They'd do everything a typical nuclear family of the times would do, except it's all a coy cover. ""I'd just had my second baby and a week later, people called and said, 'We're so awful to do this, but if you were at all interested in doing another series, this is the one,' "" Russell recalls. ""I said no a couple times. I have a baby. ... I can't be playing a spy. But it had so many different elements that were complicated."" That's not to say that ""The Americans"" doesn't employ classic spy techniques. There's a bevy of costumes, people sleep with each other for power and information, and there are a lot of brutal fights. In the pilot episode, Russell kicks a guy's head through a wall, while co-star Rhys stabs a guy in the crotch with a large fork. But Weisberg said he didn't want to make a show that treaded familiar territory. He was more interested in the familial dynamics. ""One of the reasons I wanted to do a show was about the family and not just about a KGB spy who comes to America,"" Weisberg said. ""It's about a couple with kids who don't know what (their parents) do. This is an emotional show about a marriage and raising children. I think my interest in that came from working at the CIA and seeing those people."" Both Russell and Rhys echoed those sentiments. ""The marriage part is the most interesting to me,"" Russell said. ""I love the idea of this arranged marriage, how they are a couple. I love the idea that (Elizabeth) is stunted emotionally, and after all these years, only now, she may be ready to open up and be in a real relationship with him. You get to see her so dominant and adventurous sexually outside of her marriage, but at home she's so reserved and pulled in. I like the complicated aspect of her in that way."" Rhys added, ""That was the great attraction to the pilot, as much as any boy wants to do a spy thriller. The potential for this incredibly layered dynamic ... when you first meet (Philip and Elizabeth), they're in this brittle place. It makes for a great springboard into a series. That's where the journey is over the season -- this roller coaster of them trying to figure out what their path is, what the present is and what the future is."" Russell's last series was the short-lived Fox comedy ""Running Wilde"" in 2010. ""The Americans"" marks her return to dramatic television, with her last big role as Felicity Porter in J.J. Abrams' WB series, ""Felicity."" Russell is older now, with kids of her own, but she still relates to Felicity much more than her new role as Elizabeth. ""(Felicity) is much more like me,"" she said. ""Embarrassed all the time, super-emotional, nerdy, absolutely socially awkward. But in a way, what's great, Elizabeth is socially awkward, too. She does have to be forward and sexual at times, but she's doing it to get something. Her having sex is much more informative about her character; it's not to get intimacy."" ""The Americans"" will likely be compared to Showtime's ""Homeland,"" mainly because both shows' plots center on enemies of the state. But in many ways, the similarities end there. By being set in the early '80s, there's an inherent technological aspect about ""The Americans"" -- or lack there of -- that's very noticeable. ""It's old school,"" Russell says. ""There's no technology; there's no phone. It's all personal intel. It's not like 'I got the text!' "" There is another parallel between the two series, but it's up to viewers' perceptions and how they greet the anti-hero aspects of Russell's and Rhys' characters. ""If you look at 'Homeland,' the way you find yourself feeling about Damian Lewis' character, you catch yourself saying, ""Oh my god!' "" Rhys said about rooting for the bad guy. "" 'Breaking Bad' (is like that) in the same sort of way. Your reaction to those characters will be human."" Weisberg agrees: ""(Viewers) will be rooting for Philip and Elizabeth and hoping they succeed, and all of a sudden, they'll think 'Oh my god,' they just did this horrible thing. How could I have been rooting for them?"" Back in Brooklyn, as the temperature drops, Russell and Martindale continue going through takes. At one point, Russell gets a break because the crew has to readjust the lighting. ""Thank God, there's not a lot of Russian speaking,"" she admits, while walking back to start. ""We're just juggling a lot of things. You're doing sneaky things, but the whole point is to not be sneaky."" Moments later, she demonstrates how to kick someone's head through a wall. Like a true spy, she's able to turn it on and off -- just like that.","Former ""Felicity"" star Keri Russell returns to television in ""The Americans""

"Wilmington, Delaware (CNN) -- Prosecutors across Delaware are dropping charges in scores of drug cases -- and thousands of others remain in limbo -- as an investigation continues into missing evidence at the chief medical examiner's drug lab. Delaware Public Defender Brendan O'Neill told CNN that prosecutors are throwing in the towel on one drug case after another. ""It seems the state is willing to settle on very favorable terms for the defendant or drop the case altogether,"" he said. In February, Delaware State Police announced a joint investigation with the Delaware attorney general's office after drug evidence at the state's controlled-substances lab had gone missing, been tampered with or been substituted. At the time, there were 3,700 pending drug cases, 500 of which were felony cases. ""Access to the drug evidence locker was not restricted to, or monitored by, a single individual and could be accessed by any OCME employee with a passkey and a passcode,"" Deputy Attorney General Caroline Cleary wrote in a letter, dated April 16, to O'Neill's office. Cleary continued, ""The door to the locker was left open at times."" O'Neill said, ""The drug lab failed in its most basic security protocols and undermined the reliability of any evidence it maintains."" Every state and local police agency has been working to complete internal audits of a total of more than 20,000 evidence bags. The drug lab has remained closed, and the state is sending drug evidence to a private lab in Pennsylvania to be analyzed. No one has been arrested in the investigation of the drug lab. The chief medical examiner, Dr. Richard Callery, who makes $198,500 a year, was suspended with pay in late February on another matter involving his alleged moonlighting job performing autopsies for the state of Rhode Island.","Delaware prosecutors are dropping drug cases amid a drug-lab investigation .

"(CNN) -- When art expert Safia Dickersbach cast a dart at a map of Africa, she had no idea it would spark an eight-year love affair with a country she had never seen before. ""It landed in Ghana,"" Dickersbach recalled, ""it was just a playful planning method."" After taking aim at the world's second-largest continent, the dart randomly struck Ghana's Volta Region, in the east of the country bordering neighboring Togo. The exercise was the beginning of Dickersbach's extensive research into Ghana's contemporary art culture and her mission to push Africa onto the global art scene. Read more: Africa's most exciting new photographers . She launched a project called ""The Black Stars of Ghana -- Art District,"" (named for the black star in the center of the Ghanaian flag, and the nickname of Ghana's national football team) in which she interviews some of the country's eminent visual artists and gauges their views on social issues as well as the inspiration behind their work. ""Between 2005 and 2011 I went to Ghana three times,"" she said, ""visiting 45 artists in that period. I went to major cities like Accra, Kumasi and Shama."" Dickersbach -- originally from the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam -- is now based in Berlin and works as a public relations director for Artfacts.Net . CNN's African Voices spoke to Dickersbach about her vision of African art and its place on the global stage. CNN: You've visited 45 artists over the course of your research, what is the objective behind it? Safia Dickersbach: Contemporary art is dominated by a Eurocentric attitude today and it is that attitude that decides what is relevant and what isn't. This prevents artists from regions of the world that are not located in Europe or North America from getting the attention they deserve. Read more: Hollywood classics get African photo remake . It is called the ""international art scene"" but where is Africa on this stage? I hope ""The Black Stars of Ghana -- Art District"" gives viewers a taste of the depth, vibrancy, beauty, vision and diversity of contemporary art produced on the African continent. CNN: Who did you interview for the ""The Black Stars of Ghana - Art District"" project and why? SD: The project includes research and film material about many different artists like Professor Ablade Glover, Kwadwo Ani, Kofi Setordji, Wiz Kudowor and Marigold Akufo-Addo, among others. These are prominent artists in Ghana. Hopefully, a resource like this will provide art professionals, scholars and practitioners as well as art lovers from all over the world the chance to get to know the different artists and protagonists of the Ghanaian contemporary art scene through the Internet. CNN: What inspired you to pursue such a project? SD: This project was inspired by a couple of disappointing events and stories which I observed in my professional career regarding how great and talented artists from outside of Europe were treated by the Western art establishment. It is very important that artists who are based and work in Africa determine and define for themselves the narrative about contemporary African art. Read more: Stunning Congo artwork shows conflict in a different light . In my view, even highly educated intellectuals and experts (in the West) let themselves be influenced by prejudices and stereotypes of the continent such as images of hunger and war in Africa. (They) treat African countries with a mixture of patronizing empathy and intellectual loftiness, and definitely not on a par with themselves. CNN: Why do you believe this is so? SD: Too often artists from the African continent have been confronted with ignorance or condescending attitudes in the West and this is definitely some kind of intellectual conflict caused by a lack of multicultural competence and in some cases just plain arrogance. A simple example is the fact that art from African countries is usually shunted to the anthropological department whereas art from Europe and North America will be dealt with in the ""Arts and Culture Section."" CNN: You're from Tanzania in East Africa and you live in Germany, why was Ghana the best place for your research? SD: I have an African heritage and I specifically chose a country that I didn't know because I wanted to look at that country and its art from an objective perspective. I didn't want to be influenced by friends and relatives who are members of the art scene so I wanted to go somewhere where I didn't know anyone. Read this: Artists' road trip across Africa . CNN: What makes your research different from other art research and documentary projects related to Africa? SD: I think the project explores and reveals the contemporary art scene in Ghana as viewed by local artists and protagonists. This is important because it is independent of what European or American art experts, critics and historians have to say about that scene, while also reiterating the message that Africa is not a country. There are thousands of cultures, sub-cultures and histories in Africa and it is about being sensitive to that. I think the interviews highlight the individual and not the collective. CNN: What is it about Africa that fascinates you? SD: I think the attitude of the people is more dramatic and expressive than we're used to in the developed world. For instance, the market stalls in Lagos, when they barter it looks like they're fighting but that's just how they communicate passionately. There's a fear of Africa, a fascination fear. When western photographers and artists go to Africa, they are mesmerized by the amount of light and shadows in the sky and the atmosphere is very different. But at the same time, I think a colonial attitude exists still, that need to control a fear of the unknowing in Africa. It's very much a love-fear relationship and that's what fascinates us.","'The Black Stars of Ghana - Art District' interviews some of Ghana's biggest artists .

"(EW.com) -- The threesome of Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann, and Kate Upton proved to be too much for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" Fox's raunchy girlfriends comedy, about two mistresses who team up with a man's insecure wife to ruin his life and rediscover theirs, earned $24.7 million to bump the Marvel superhero from his three-week box office run at No. 1. It was a surprisingly high number for ""The Other Woman,"" given that some analysts speculated the movie would do about half that by appealing strictly to female moviegoers. Given Diaz's comedy track record with everything from There's Something About Mary to Bad Teacher, those concerns didn't really hold ""The Other Woman"" back. Also, when you cast Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Upton as a scantily clad character referred to as ""the boobs"" in a movie's trailer, it's not exactly bro-repellent. Still, Fox tells EW its own tracking showed 75 percent of ticket-buyers were female, which is slightly higher than even the studio expected. The strong overall tally came from underestimating just how large that audience would be, and Fox now hopes word-of-mouth will help it draw in a more diverse crowd in the weeks ahead, much as Universal's ""Bridesmaids"" did in 2011. EW: Review of 'The Other Woman' ""Captain America"" sank to a respectable No. 2, still going strong in its fourth weekend, for a weekend yield of $16 million and a domestic total of $225 million (and roughly $645 million globally). The first ""Captain America"" ended at $177 million domestically, and a mere $370 million worldwide. Dropping only 37 percent from last week, the action/adventure is showing remarkable resilience, and sets a very high bar for upcoming superhero flicks, such as next week's ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (which has already opened in some international markets and has earned a robust $132 million) and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" which debuts May 23 but is currently reeling from the underage, forced sex allegations recently leveled at filmmaker Bryan Singer. Sony's spiritual melodrama ""Heaven Is For Real"" came in third for the weekend with $13.8 million, also showing strength with only a 39 percent drop in its second week. EW review of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' Among new releases, the No. 5 spot went to the late Paul Walker's ""Brick Mansions,"" a wall-climbing, face-slamming, parkour-based action movie about a cop seeking revenge against the crime lord who killed his father. The Relativity release, a remake of the French crime thriller ""District 13,"" earned $9.6 million. It was initially in the fourth spot on Friday night, but family matinee moviegoers gave the animated ""Rio 2"" a Saturday boost. The Lionsgate horror flick ""The Quiet Ones"" lived up to its name â€” it came in seventh place with a lame $7 million, behind even the Johnny Depp box-office catastrophe ""Transcendence,"" which was No. 6 with $7.1 million. Here are estimate of the weekend's top five, with final numbers due Monday: . 1. The Other Woman -- $24.7 million . 2. Captain America: The Winter Soldier -- $16 million . 3.

"(CNN) -- Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 drastically changed course then soared to near its peak altitude, a senior Malaysian aviation source said -- adding yet another wrinkle to the enigma of the plane's last flight. Before disappearing from radar screens on March 8, the commercial airliner deviated from its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing by turning leftward over water while it was still inside Vietnamese airspace, the Malaysian aviation source told CNN's Nic Robertson. The aircraft then climbed to 39,000 feet, just short of the Boeing 777-200ER's 41,000-foot safe operating limit, and maintained that altitude for about 20 minutes over the Malaysian Peninsula before beginning to descend, the source said. Why? That and so much else -- including where the plane is now -- remains a mystery. Investigators have been trying for weeks to piece together bits of information trying to get the answers being demanded by relatives of the 239 people aboard the plane, not to mention millions more around the world who have been captivated by this ordeal. In addition to this newly revealed development, investigators have determined that the missing jet was equipped with four emergency locator transmitters, or ELTs, which are designed to transmit a plane's location to an emergency satellite when triggered by a crash or by contact with water, the source added. The ELTs were at the plane's front door, its rear door, in the fuselage and in the cockpit, said the source, who was puzzled over why they appear either not to have activated or, if they did activate, why they were not picked up by the satellite. Relatives of the 239 passengers and crew have raised questions about the ELTs with Malaysian authorities, suggesting there were at least three aboard the plane, including two portable units and one fixed device. No comment from Malaysia Airlines . Malaysia Airlines has declined to answer CNN's questions about the ELTs and other matters pertaining to the flight, which vanished six weeks ago after taking off shortly after midnight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The airline said it could not comment on ""any questions that relate to information held by other authorities and/or fall under the jurisdiction of the ongoing investigation. ..."" Besides this probe, the plight has spurred an expansive, expensive search to find the aircraft. That includes the dispatching of up to 11 military aircraft and 12 ships Saturday across three areas off Perth, Australia. They will cover about 20,000 square miles (50,000 square kilometers) and brave isolated showers, according to Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre. There may not be much more of this, however. Officials have said searches from air and ships are probably nearing an end. That doesn't surprise former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Managing Director Peter Goelz, given the results so far. ""There's a lot of resources being expended there; it's turned up nothing,"" he said. But Goelz predicts the underwater phase of the search will continue for the six to eight weeks needed to cover the current search zone. If that turns up nothing, he predicted, towed array sonar probably would be used to search a wider zone. ""This is a very complex operation,"" ocean search specialist Rob McCallum said. ""It's going to be a game of patience now."" As of early Saturday, the underwater drone scouring the bottom of the Indian Ocean had taken six trips looking for the missing jetliner with a seventh mission then underway. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre said the Bluefin-21 search has covered about 50 square miles. While the information gleamed from the sixth trip was still being analyzed, the first five didn't yield any breakthroughs. Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein tweeted Friday that authorities are looking at deploying more unmanned underwater probes. Officials might consider searching along a large portion of sea highlighted by a partial digital ""handshake"" between the jetliner and an Inmarsat PLC satellite, said Martin Dolan, Australia's top transport official. That arc of sea is more than 370 miles long and 30 miles wide. A prolonged undersea search by private contractors could cost a ""ballpark rough estimate"" of $234 million, said Dolan. Passengers' kin list questions . The continuing search efforts came as relatives of the people who were aboard the jetliner pressed for answers. They have drawn up 26 questions that they want addressed by Malaysian officials, who are to meet with them next week in Beijing. Most of the Flight 370 passengers and crew were Chinese. Among their questions: What's in the flight's log book? Can they review the jet's maintenance records? Can they listen to recordings of the Boeing 777 pilot's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost? Hishammuddin has defended his government's handling of the operation and accused members of the news media of focusing on the Chinese families. He said relatives of passengers and crew from other nations represented have not had problems. ""The most difficult part of any investigation of this nature is having to deal with the families,"" he said. CNN's Greg Botelho, Pamela Boykoff, Mitra Mobasherat, Ivan Watson, Brian Todd, Elizabeth Joseph and Erin Burnett contributed to this report.","NEW: 6th underwater drone mission finishes; 7th such trip is underway .

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- The man charged with shooting at motorists on Kansas City highways apparently fired a .380 pistol from his own car before speeding away, documents released on Friday said. Authorities identified the suspect as Mohammed Pedro Whitaker. He is 27 and lives in Grandview, south of Kansas City, reported CNN affiliate KCTV-TV. He was charged with 18 felony counts covering nine incidents and is being held under $1 million cash bond. Probable cause statements show police connected the shootings through .380 bullets found in the vehicles. Starting in early March, motorists told police of being shot at in the I-435/I-470/Highway 71 interchanges. In several cases, the drivers reported seeing a dark green car near them driven by a man wearing sunglasses, a dark hoodie and sometimes a black ski mask. One break came when a witness looking for a lost cell phone beside a road found a Walmart bag containing .380 ammunition, the documents showed. Prints on the ammunition boxes matched Whitaker's. After police started shadowing Whitaker, he was observed trying to buy a .380 handgun with a laser sight from a man in a Bass Pro Shop parking lot, the statements said. When police questioned the second man, he told officers he advertised the pistol online but refused to sell when Whitaker couldn't provide identification, the statement said. Police served search warrants at Whitaker's residence on Monday and Thursday and found a .380 pistol, ammunition, sunglasses and three black hoodie sweatshirts, the statements show. When questioned by police, Whitaker said he was one of the ""highway shooter's"" victims and claimed not to own a firearm, the probable cause statements say. Jackson County, Missouri, prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, speaking at a press briefing, said Whitaker acted alone. She said he is being held on $1 million cash bond. Baker wouldn't reveal much background on Whitaker but said he has ""very little criminal record."" Whitaker is accused of shooting at nine vehicles, with two charges in each incident, Baker said. Baker said surveillance, ballistics, more than 100 tips from citizens and witness statements helped authorities with their case. ""It wasn't built on one thing,"" she said. ""It was built on a series of things."" Earlier, police said someone had fired a gun at as many as 20 motorists on major roads and highways. Baker didn't say if investigators suspected Whitaker in the other cases but that more charges may be filed. Three people in vehicles were reported shot, none with life-threatening injuries. Whitaker was charged in two of those cases, Baker said. Whitaker was arrested Thursday. Kevin Cooksey, who lives across an alley from the suspect, said he saw police take him into custody. ""He couldn't go nowhere because he was surrounded. Completely surrounded,"" Cooksey told affiliate KSHB-TV. ""They were on him. As soon as it happened, they were on him."" The shootings began March 8. Some motorists weren't even aware shots had been fired at their vehicles. Jennie Baugher was driving along U.S. 71 when she heard something strike her car. ""I thought a big rock hit us,"" said the married mother of two from Roeland Park, Kansas. ""My husband saw it the next day. Immediately when he told me that there was a hole in my car, I realized a bullet hit my car."" Mechanic found bullet holes . Tom McFarlin said he thinks shots at his vehicle came from a moving car on one of the ramps or overpasses. ""It was exactly where the highway splits,"" he said. McFarlin was headed home to Lee's Summit, Missouri, on Interstate 470 south after watching his son's basketball game. Like Baugher, his car was shot in the evening, around 8:30. When he took his car to mechanics a few days later, they discovered not one, but two bullets. The second one was lodged in the undercarriage. Both cars were hit in the rear on the passenger side. The bullets lodged in metal and did not make it inside. In McFarlin's case, had the bullet made its way through the metal, anyone sitting in the passenger seat would have been hit.

"(CNN) -- What Kanye West wants, he gets. After all, he wanted Kim Kardashian for years, and is now set to marry her in May. (They already welcomed their first child together, North, last June.) So should we be surprised that the rapper, who's previously campaigned for his bride-to-be to appear on the cover of Vogue magazine, can place a checkmark next to that goal? It's true. Kardashian and West are appearing on the April issue of Vogue magazine. And this, soon after West proclaimed on Ryan Seacrest's radio show that it was preposterous it had not yet happened. ""There's no way Kim Kardashian shouldn't be on the cover of Vogue,"" West told Seacrest back in October. ""She's like the most intriguing woman right now. ... and collectively, we're the most influential in clothing."" ""No one is looking at what Obama is wearing. Michelle Obama can't Instagram a (bathing suit) pic like what my girl Instagrammed the other day."" The cover is vaguely reminiscent of Kardashian's other high-profile appearance on the front of People magazine in 2011, when she posed with her then-fiancÃ©, basketball player Kris Humphries. Except this time, she's traded in the contemporary clothing for sumptuous luxury wares. Calling Kardashian and West #theworldsmosttalkedaboutcouple, Vogue is promising a firsthand look inside the pair's ""fashionable life and surreal times,"" including a glimpse of how they interact as parents. The pair's daughter, North, appears with them in a behind-the-scenes video of the Vogue photo shoot. The unveiling of the issue, which arrives on newsstands March 31 and digitally March 24, was met with a mix of reactions, from stunned to supportive to upset. ""Somewhere, Victoria Beckham is flipping a table,"" joked one observer. ""Vogue negotiates with terrorists,"" quipped another. Vogue isn't a stranger to controversy -- earlier this year it was criticized by some for its treatment of ""Girls"" star Lena Dunham -- but the vitriol directed toward Vogue editor Anna Wintour regarding the April issue has been visceral. ""If someone could start a petition to have Anna Wintour fired over this, society would appreciate it,"" said @RunBritRun. ""Anna Wintour RETIRE NOW. You're mentally unstable,"" chimed in @Jenovia. ""I just wonder what went through Anna Wintour's mind. Has she gone mad?"" asked another onlooker. Given the timing of the issue, a handful wondered if Vogue was pulling some sort of elaborate (not to mention expensive) April Fool's Day prank. Fans of the couple were just as breathless as Kardashian tweeted she was when they spotted the pair's glossy cover shot. ""If you're actually mad at Kim and Kanye's Vogue cover,"" tweeted @Kia_Mak, ""go outside, start walking and don't stop until you reach the horizon."" Added @PatrickSandberg, ""Kim and Kanye refuse to accept the limitations people try to put on them and it's inspiring. They win."" Mostly, though, it looks some are just confused by the #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple hashtag Vogue is trying to promote. ""Wait,"" said @NikiBlasina. ""That doesn't look like Jay-Z and Beyonce.""","Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are on the cover of Vogue magazine's April issue .

"(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o doesn't like the question -- instead, he points to a picture. It is of a hospital in Cameroon -- ""I want to give a chance to each child,"" he says. When Eto'o, a four time African Player of the Year, signed for Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala in August 2011, he became the highest paid player in the world. Here was a man who had already won the Champions League on three occasions, starred for Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter Milan and led Cameroon to Africa Cup of Nations glory -- twice. It was a move which raised plenty of eyebrows considering Anzhi's standing on the European stage and gave credence to the argument that Eto'o was more interested in Russian rubles than ramming home goals in one of the continent's top divisions. Such accusations rile the 32-year-old, who is adamant that he made the move to an unheralded team in Dagestan for the challenge rather than the financial rewards provided by the club's oil tycoon chairman Suleiman Kerimov. Money . ""It's not a question of money because when you look at my career, I've won everything except for the World Cup,"" Eto'o told CNN World Sport. ""It's also a problem of motivation too. I had the opportunity this window to go play again at Inter and other teams in Italy. ""At Inter, I was the best paid player in the world. But it's not a question of money because when I go out onto the pitch, I only have one thing in mind -- winning. ""And I don't think about having money in my bank account or not, I only think about winning, having fun and entertaining the fans -- these are the only things I have in my head. ""Of course, it's normal for people to say, 'yeah, this player changed teams because of the money.' ""That could be the case sometimes, but after a certain level of success? No."" That money has given him a life he may never have dreamed of while growing up as a young boy in Cameroon -- but it has also helped hundreds of disadvantaged children in his home country. Charity . The ""Fundacion Privada Samuel Eto'o,"" which was established in 2006, helps provide basic healthcare and works on improving social inclusion. So while Eto'o is aware of the exorbitant wages he has received, he is equally aware of just how vital that money has been in helping those chasing the dream of becoming Africa's next superstar football player. ""We've done quite a few things with ambulances, operation centers...we've built hospitals in the interior of the country.,"" he points out. ""I have a lot of boys who play in Barcelona's youth academy -- I have another named Unlinga who plays also for Malaga -- all of these come from my foundation. ""I have a lad who's a good forward, he's doing quite well, named Odongu. I have a kid named Abanya who's a center back. ""All of them come from my foundation and it's the joy that I try to share -- the opportunity -- that I want to give to each child. ""They themselves have to fight for their place, but the first opportunity is what I try to give them."" Eto'o, now at Chelsea following his move to London last month, has reportedly taken a huge pay cut from the estimated $26.8 million a year he was earning at Anzhi. Instead, he has signed a one-year deal at Stamford Bridge thought to be worth around $11 million with Anzhi keen to offload the forward and ease pressure on its wage bill. The move to the west London club came as something of a surprise, not least because of the striker's former disdain for a club which he said, ""I'd rather sell groundnuts in my village than to play for a pathetic team like Chelsea."" That comment came following Chelsea's Champions League victory over Barcelona in 2005 where Eto'o was left seething at the tactics of a certain Jose Mourinho - now in his second spell as manager of the London club. After the tie, which Chelsea won, Eto'o told a Spanish media outlet: ""Chelsea going through is a disaster for football. ""If this team wins the Champions League, it would make you want to retire."" Mourinho . Little did Eto'o know then that five years later he would be exchanging love letters and text messages with Mourinho as Inter Milan embarked on an astonishing run of success which culminated with victory in the 2010 Champions League final. In July 2009, the Cameroon striker was sent packing by Barcelona as the Catalan club secured the services of the enigmatic Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Eto'o, was seen as surplus to requirements and moved to Serie A to team up with Mourinho -- a partnership which flourished even after the two parted ways. While he is reticent when it comes to talking about former Barca boss Pep Guardiola, ""I don't talk about him,"" he says, Eto'o is unyielding in his praise for Mourinho. ""There is only one Jose Mourinho,' Eto'o once said about the Portuguese coach. ""I have played under a lot of great coaches but there is no other character in the game like Jose."" The two men helped Inter win the treble during their time together at the San Siro and Eto'o even revealed that he attempted to persuade Mourinho to move to Anzhi with him. ""Since we met at Inter, he has always been in my life,"" he said. ""We talk almost all the time -- he sent me a good luck message before a match and I'd send him something, he can ask me something or I can do the same. ""And I'm going to tell you a secret. You know that I spoke with the boss about coming with me to Anzhi? Because I thought he was the right man for the job and situation. Yes, I said this to him."" Champions . Mourinho, now back at Chelsea following his departure from Real Madrid, will hope the two can combine again with the club aiming to challenge for both the Premier League and Champions League titles. Eto'o sees similarities between this Chelsea side and the Inter team which conquered Europe in 2010 -- and believes another Champions League title could be on the horizon. ""When I got to Inter, they didn't expect anything from us,"" he said. ""People would say, 'they're old, they're this, they're that' and we ended up winning everything. ""In football, it's not a question of saying, 'do we have a squad?' ""The first thing for victory is believing. Believing that you can achieve. When you believe that you can achieve something, I'm sure that you're 60% on the path to victory. ""Chelsea has won before and it can win again. We're going to work hard to be able to do it.""","Samuel Eto'o insists he did not move to Anzhi Makhachkala for the money .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- New York Gov. David Paterson said Monday ""Saturday Night Live"" went too far in its portrayal of the legally blind governor over the weekend. Fred Armisen, right, appears as New York Gov. David Paterson on ""Saturday Night Live"" with Seth Meyers. ""SNL,"" famous for mocking politicians and newsmakers, portrayed the governor in a four-minute ""Weekend Update"" segment as confused and disoriented -- often looking in the wrong direction and mistakenly walking in front of the camera when it was not his turn to speak. The ""SNL"" skit featured cast member Fred Armisen as the governor. It referred to cocaine use, with Armisen saying he became governor because of a ""sex scandal I was miraculously not at the center of."" ""Come on, I'm a blind man who loves cocaine who was suddenly appointed governor of New York. My life is an actual plot from a Richard Pryor movie,"" Armisen said in the skit.  Watch Paterson say he can take a joke » . Paterson became governor last spring after then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer was forced to resign amid a sex scandal. ""Now that [Alaska Gov. Sarah] Palin's not around, they seem to have run out of material,"" Paterson told reporters Monday. ""The idea of a person rolling around the stage in a chair, being disoriented, can't find anything, bumbling, in a sense looking like a clown is a way disabled people are portrayed all the time. ""The perception that disability equals inability to be responsible is totally wrong,"" he added . On Sunday, a spokeswoman for Paterson suggested the skit was offensive to all people with physical disabilities.  Watch more on the ""SNL"" skit » . ""The governor engages in humor all the time, and he can certainly take a joke,"" said Risa Heller, Paterson's communications director. ""However, this particular 'Saturday Night Live' skit unfortunately chose to ridicule people with physical disabilities and imply that disabled people are incapable of having jobs with serious responsibilities. ""The governor is sure that 'Saturday Night Live' with all of its talent can find a way to be funny without being offensive."" The National Federation of the Blind also criticized the skit, calling it ""absolutely wrong"" and an attack on all blind Americans. Paterson has said he is blind in his left eye and has limited vision in his right eye. He is the first legally blind man to be governor. The governor addressed the controversy Sunday night when reporters asked him about the skit, making a reference to a ""third-grade depiction,"" according to The New York Times. ""There is only one way that people could have an unemployment rate that's six times the national average -- it's attitude,"" he said. ""And I'm afraid that the kind of third-grade depiction of individuals and the way they look and the way they move add to that negative environment."" But speaking to reporters Monday, the governor, who is known for his self-deprecating sense of humor, said he is more concerned with how other Americans with disabilities may view the skit. ""I don't mind that they make fun of me, but I thought it was important to speak up for those who don't have a voice and don't have a job,"" he said. ""SNL"" has not responded to CNN's request for comment. But the late-night sketch comedy show has a history of skewering politicians, sometimes with such precision that the show's catch phrases have become more closely associated with politicians than the politicians' own words. In the same episode Saturday night, a skit portrayed embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in a cursed-filled testimony before a Senate panel, offering to sell senators Abraham Lincoln's wedding ring. Earlier this year, the show saw some of its biggest ratings in recent seasons with Tina Fey's portrayal of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and cast member Amy Poehler's impersonation of Sen. Hillary Clinton. The show also has made light of Sen. John McCain's age and Barack Obama's association with controversial Chicago figures, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and former Weather Underground member Bill Ayers.","""Saturday Night Live"" skit portrays Gov. David Paterson as confused, disoriented .

"Washington (CNN) -- On Tuesday, for the second time this month, the Republican field will debate foreign policy, a topic that hasn't seen much attention in the race until now. The candidates will be fighting an uphill battle against the president's strong record on national security. President Obama has racked up an impressive series of foreign policy victories and promises kept: He ordered a daring raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden and has taken out scores of top al Qaeda leaders, including lead recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki. He brought the Iraq war to a close, as promised, and has started a responsible withdrawal from Afghanistan. Without putting a single American soldier on the ground and for only about a thousandth of the cost of the Iraq war, the president helped the Libyan people oust Moammar Gadhafi, a ruthless dictator who supported terrorists. Obama has also led the international community in putting the squeeze on Iran's leaders through tough sanctions and ratified the new START treaty negotiated with Russia. The list goes on. Voters have recognized these successes. Polls show the public backs Obama's pragmatic, results-based approach to foreign policy. Fulfilling his promise to end the Iraq war is the president's most popular move: More than three in four Americans -- 77% -- approve of Obama's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year, according to CBS News polling. In addition, 63% approve of the president's terrorism policies, turning what was expected to be a weakness into a strength. The Republican field has responded to the president's successful efforts abroad with what the New York Times editorial board called ""bad analysis and worse solutions, nothing that suggests real understanding or new ideas."" Instead of taking seriously the need for the commander in chief to have at least a basic knowledge of the world, Republicans have embraced their lack of experience on the issue. Herman Cain made a telling gaffe last week when he insisted that he is ""not supposed to know anything about foreign policy."" The Republicans running to lead the country don't seem to understand that the president can't plead ignorance. International crises especially require quick, effective decision-making -- presidents don't have time to study up on Foreign Policy 101. The lack of knowledge or experience hasn't stopped Republicans from falling into a familiar habit: opposition for the sake of opposition. If Obama favors something, Republicans almost certainly oppose it. Mitt Romney originally built his argument against Obama's foreign policy by attacking the new START treaty -- an agreement supported by every living Republican secretary of state and our entire current military leadership. Now Romney, along with others, is calling for bombing Iran, an action that former CENTCOM commander four-star Gen. Anthony Zinni has said would ""drag us into a conflict."" Obama has effectively rallied other nations for the strongest sanctions ever against Iran's nuclear program. Republicans have lots of ideas about starting new wars, but few about how to keep meaningful pressure on Tehran. Regarding Israel, the GOP field has routinely condemned Obama's leadership in trying to avert a crisis over the Palestinian request for statehood at the U.N. Obama's policies have made Israel safer. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Obama for his handling of the rescue of the Israeli diplomats in Cairo in September. The candidates continue to take any position that will distance them from the president and allow them to sound tough -- but it's putting them out of step with military leaders and nonpartisan national security experts. Much of the field has endorsed waterboarding -- widely considered torture -- and many have argued for cutting off all foreign aid. Both of those positions are opposed by generals such as David Petraeus and James Cartwright as well as fellow Republicans, including former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Sen. John McCain. Abandoning our values and ""soft power"" means abandoning leadership in the world. In addition, the field has tried to turn the phrase ""leading from behind"" into an overarching criticism of Obama's foreign policy. That rather inaccurate term was coined to explain Obama's response to the situation in Libya. It's funny that Republicans would latch onto the phrase, because they've shown a distinct lack of judgment and resolve on the issue. Jake Tapper of ABC News documented that Mitt Romney has held five different positions on the Libya operation. It is probably Newt Gingrich's most blatant flip-flop; the former House speaker first endorsed intervention, then said he wouldn't have acted. The Republican field just can't admit that Obama got this right. Even more telling than the issues candidates have talked about are the issues that have been downplayed. The last debate included little or no mention of post-war Iraq, ignored the security implications of China's rise, and only at the last minute began to explore candidates' thinking on the European financial crisis. Twenty-first-century problems require 21st-century thinking. The Republicans have displayed stunningly little of such thinking so far. Expect lots of bluster and loose talk at Tuesday's debate, the sort that brought us the Iraq war earlier this century while the search for Osama bin Laden was essentially called off. Then compare it to the pragmatic, effective approach of Obama and his list of accomplishments. It's clear who should be on the receiving end of the 3 a.m. phone call. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: GOP presidential candidates can't beat Obama's record on national security .
Three-quarters of Americans approve of his decision to pull troops from Iraq, Brazile says .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from an Ebola outbreak in coastal West Africa has risen to 86, with dozens more ill, aid workers reported Friday. The deaths are among the 137 cases reported by the World Health Organization, which said the outbreak has ""rapidly evolved"" since originating in the forests of southeastern Guinea. The city of Guekedou, near the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia, has seen the majority of the deaths. Five people are believed to have died in Guinea's capital, Conakry, according to WHO. Two of the victims had traveled to the region. It's the first emergence of Ebola in western Africa, and WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the U.N. agency is trying to track people who had encountered the victims and make sure ""that all those who have been in contact with infected people are being checked upon."" ""What is really important is to inform the population of Guinea and Conakry about this disease, as this is the first time they are facing Ebola. They need to know what it is and how they can protect themselves."" In Liberia, seven Ebola deaths have been confirmed out of 14 suspected cases. Sierra Leone is investigating at least two deaths. The aid organization Doctors Without Borders has called the outbreak unprecedented, because previous cases have been limited to a small area. Mali's government reported on its Facebook page on Thursday that biological samples tied to three suspected Ebola cases within its borders are being sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. In the meantime, the three people there suspected of having the disease are being treated in an isolated unit, where their health is improving. Ebola is one of the world's deadliest viruses, causing a hemorrhagic fever that kills up to 90% of those infected. It spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain, often accompanied by bleeding. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. What is Ebola and why does it kill?

"(CNN) -- Amir Khan is a rare thing in sport: A world champion boxer who still lives with his parents and a prominent Muslim who is not afraid to address the image of Islam today. Khan tasted international boxing success when he was just 17, winning a silver medal at the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004. Now 23, he holds the WBA World Light Welterweight title, defended against Pauli Malignaggi in New York in May. But bright lights and big cities haven't distracted the boy from Bolton, an unassuming town in northwest England. He still lives, and for the most part, trains, in his hometown. ""I'm so close with my family ... my Dad never missed an amateur fight or a professional fight, my uncle's the same, they've always been with me that's why I have so much respect for them,"" Khan told CNN. Khan spoke to CNN's Revealed team after his big fight in New York, about his life as a sportsman, British Muslim and role model. CNN: Why do you love boxing? Amir Khan: It feels like home, even when I step in the ring. As soon as I walk into any gym in the world I feel at home. I know everything, I know what to do. It just feels so comfortable. I can do what I want there. It feels even more comfortable than walking into my own house and my own bedroom. That's how much I love boxing. I like to entertain when I'm in the boxing ring; I like to show speed, power and explosiveness. It's an art, people need to see [it as] that, not as a violent sport, and when I go into the ring to hurt someone it's because they're trying to hurt me. That's the only reason I hit them back. CNN: Do you enter a different zone as the fight approaches? AK: I totally enter a different zone. It's like when I'm in the gym I'm 100 percent there ... it's like autopilot, I'm just doing it, man, my body's just making me do whatever. Time starts going slower approaching the fight, maybe four days before the fight, time just stops. CNN: Do you think people look for a race issue when you fight? AK: Being a Muslim and being a Pakistani a lot of people are going to bring that issue up. I'm flying the flag for Britain and Pakistan, I'm proud to be British and British Pakistani, and I think there's a lot of people, Muslim people, just like me. So, when you do get a lot of people [talking about] terrorism and stuff like that, it's only a very small percentage. There's a bigger picture out there and I want people to follow my footsteps and do what I'm doing. CNN: How does your faith help you? AK: My faith keeps me humble and keeps my feet on the ground. I pray and I do things privately. It gives me strength when I go in the ring. I know I'm not on my own, I've got God on my side as well, God's helping me, God's going to give me that inner strength to go in there and win the fight. Boxing in the ring is a lonely place, it's just you and your opponent, no one else, so you know spiritually when you have that help it makes a massive difference. It gives you so much confidence. CNN: Do you sometimes just want to be a boxer without the image? AK: At times I used to think to myself, I've got a lot of pressure on me, but I'm happy with it. People see me as a Pakistani Muslim British fighter. I'm fine with that and being a role model. CNN: What does it mean to you to be seen as a role model? AK: It's nice, I think I'm probably the only Asian Muslim role model in Britain, there's no other Muslim, Pakistani, Indian or whatever role model in the country ... that does put pressure on you but I'm only doing what I love to do. I'm a boxer, I'm a normal guy, I'm never going to change no matter how big I get. I'm never going to be big-headed and I hate those who are. I never look down on anyone and I'll always speak to people, I've got time for my fans ... even if I have to go out of my way to do it, I'll take a picture, and I've been doing that and maybe that's the reason that God gives me so much -- and has given me so much -- success. CNN: Where would you be if it weren't for boxing? AK: I've got a lot of friends who were in school with me and they've taken the wrong path and I think I would've taken the wrong path with them. I would've definitely gone the wrong path or maybe still be with my parents. With the respect I have for them, they would've kept me on the right path, but I wouldn't be anywhere like where I am now.","Amir Khan is a British boxer and WBA World Light Welterweight champion .

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- Heisman Trophy hopeful Jameis Winston did not have consensual sex with a student at Florida State University, despite claims to the contrary by the football player's lawyer, the family of the accuser said Friday. ""To be clear, the victim did not consent. This was rape,"" according to a statement released by the accuser's family. The release of the statement came a day after Winston's attorney, Tim Jansen, told reporters the sex was consensual and that his client's DNA was found on the clothing of the woman, who nearly a year ago said she was raped. ESPN, which first reported the DNA development, said the Florida crime lab determined that the possibility it was someone else's DNA would be one in 2.2 trillion. The case began in December when the woman, a student at the Tallahassee university, reported she had been sexually assaulted. A month later she accused Winston of the alleged rape. Prosecutor to 'get to the bottom' of sex assault case . The story became public when some media outlets put in public records requests for the alleged victim's complaint. Tallahassee police have released a heavily redacted incident report documenting a sexual assault allegation in early December 2012. Tallahassee Police Department Interim Chief Tom Coe told reporters this week that the accuser ""broke off contact"" with them in February and didn't want to go forward with the case. The family of the woman has blasted the police investigation. The woman's family has said a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and her life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Jansen, Winston's attorney, said he believed the case was closed months ago. But Coe has said the case is still open. No one has been charged in the investigation, and state attorney Willie Meggs said his office has yet to interview the woman. He will meet with his staff Friday, he said, to determine their next steps. The family of the accuser has said they never leaked information about the case, a response to Jansen's comment last week that the timing of the media discovering the case -- in the middle of the college football season -- was ""very suspect."" The Heisman Trophy is awarded each December to the player who voters believe is college football's top player for the season. Winston has thrown for 28 touchdowns for the Seminoles, who are 10-0 and with three more wins could play in January for the national championship. Winston didn't play during the 2012 season but came to Florida State as one of the nation's top quarterback recruits, according to recruiting rankings. Florida State has said university officials cannot comment on an open investigation.

"New York (CNN) -- Authorities in Long Island are investigating how shredded confidential police documents ended up as confetti in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City, according to Nassau County Police. Saul Finkelstein, a Manhattan attorney, was watching the renowned parade with his 18-year-old son Ethan, as they do every year, when they noticed a piece of shredded paper that appeared to have a Social Security number on it. ""There were shredded papers all over the place, like snowball size, all over the ground,"" Finkelstein said. ""There were whole sentences, license plate numbers and police reports."" As they looked closer at the confetti, they came to realize the shredded pieces of paper were documents from the Nassau County Police Department. On Sunday, Nassau County Police detectives came to Finkelstein's home as part of an investigation into how the documents made their way from Long Island to Manhattan and ended up in the parade. ""The Nassau County Police Department is very concerned about this situation. We will be conducting an investigation into this matter as well as reviewing our procedures for the disposing of sensitive documents,"" said Inspector Kenneth W. Lack. ""The fact they sent two people on a Sunday night all the way from Nassau County means they must be trying to figure this out,"" Finkelstein said. Most shocking was that on the scraps of paper were pieces of sensitive information, including the names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, banking data, and other personal information about Nassau county police officers and detectives, some of whom are believed to be undercover, according to CNN affiliate WPIX, whom Finkelstein contacted along with the police after finding the pieces of sensitive material on Thursday. Also found were notes about Mitt Romney's motorcade from the final presidential debate, which took place at Hofstra University in Nassau County in October. Orlando Veras, a spokesman for Macy's, says the company has no knowledge of how the shredded documents came to be used as confetti. ""Macy's uses commercially manufactured multi-colored confetti, not shredded, homemade or printed paper of any kind in the parade,"" he said, adding, ""It is not unusual for spectators to bring and throw their own confetti in the direction of parade participants from the sidelines.""","Shredded paper with a Social Security number caught a parade-watcher's eye .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- When security guards arrived at the home of Oscar Pistorius on the night his girlfriend died, the first thing the track star told them was that everything was fine. That's what Pieter Baba, a security guard supervisor, testified Friday in Pistorius' murder trial. The athlete said everything was fine, but he was crying, Baba said, and he knew everything was not fine. Baba and the other guards then witnessed Pistorius descending from the upstairs carrying Reeva Steenkamp to the lower level. ""I was so shocked, I couldn't think for a few moments,"" Baba testified. Pistorius pleaded not guilty Monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing on Valentine's Day 2013 as well as two gun indictments unrelated to her death. Pistorius, 27, nicknamed ""Blade Runner,"" has admitted killing his 29-year-old girlfriend, but says it was a tragic error after he mistook her for an intruder. Of the witnesses called so far, Baba was the earliest to arrive on the scene. He revealed new details and seemed anxious. The trial was adjourned until Monday when the defense will continue cross-examination. The defense said it would show that Pistorius called security that night. Another witness who testified Friday, former Pistorius girlfriend Samantha Taylor, said their relationship ended when he cheated on her with Steenkamp. Taylor also testified that Pistorius slept with a pistol on his bedside table or on the floor beside his prosthetic legs and once became so angry after a traffic stop that he shot a gun through the sunroof of a car. Taylor said she met Pistorius in 2010, when she was 17, and they started dating the following year. She said they broke up twice, the second time on November 4, 2012, after he took Steenkamp to a sports banquet. Defense attorney Barry Roux asked if Taylor admitted in two e-mails to cheating on Pistorius. Taylor says she's never admitted to cheating on him but admits she had a relationship with another man after they broke up the first time. Roux also asked Taylor for details about the time he supposedly shot the gun out of a car sunroof, but Taylor could not remember the name of the highway or the location in South Africa. Taylor testified that Pistorius was angry and irritated after the traffic stop, even though he was not driving. She said he joked around about firing a shot and then laughed after he fired. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel asked Taylor if she was ever at Pistorius' house and he thought there was an intruder. Taylor said yes. Taylor said Pistorius once heard something hit the bathroom window and woke her up to ask if she'd heard it, too. Taylor said Pistorius woke her up other times when he thought he'd heard a noise. Live blog: Latest developments in Pistorius trial . Doctor back on the stand . Friday was the fifth day of the Pistorius murder trial, with the defense trying to chip away at testimony of a neighbor who rushed to the track star's home the night he shot Steenkamp. Roux pointed out that Johan Stipp, a doctor who lived near Pistorius and the first to arrive at the scene, made two statements to police and both times said he heard ""two or three shots."" ""You could not be sure of the number of noises you heard,"" Roux said. ""It would be fair to say that,"" Stipp said on his second day of testimony. Roux also asked Stipp about screams he heard. Stipp said Thursday the man's screaming came from ""much more to the left"" of the initial screams. On Friday, Stipp said the screams came ""slightly from the left."" Pistorius broke down in court Thursday as Stipp said he went to Pistorius' residence after hearing the shots. He said he saw Steenkamp lying on the floor, her brain tissue mixed with blood and Pistorius praying for her to live. ""I remember the first thing he said when I got there was, 'I shot her, I thought she was a burglar and I shot her,' "" Stipp told the court in Pretoria. And although Stipp is a prosecution witness, his testimony may bolster the defense case, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said after Thursday's dramatic testimony. Prosecutors appear to have been trying to demonstrate that Pistorius and Steenkamp had a loud argument before the shooting, suggesting it's the reason he killed her. But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done. Pistorius and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting, allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events. Stipp's version of events appears to coincide with the defense case, said Phelps, who teaches law at the University of Cape Town. Attorney: Steenkamp could not have screamed . Stipp on Thursday described the grisly scenes when he tried to save the athlete's girlfriend after the fatal shooting. He said he had arrived and found Steenkamp's body lying at the bottom of the stairs. Pistorius was bent over her body with his left hand over her right groin and two fingers of his right hand in her mouth as he tried to clear her airway. Stipp tried to assist and said he found no signs of a pulse in her neck, no peripheral pulse and no breathing movements. As the doctor described the details of her injuries to the court, Pistorius broke down with his head in his hands. He was also seen convulsing but then recovered and wiped his face and nose with a handkerchief. Stipp, who said he had trained in the army with assault rifles and 9 mm pistols -- the type of pistol that killed Steenkamp -- said he had been surprised to hear no ambulance had been called when he arrived. He left after one arrived. The doctor was later cross-examined by defense attorney Roux, who said Steenkamp could not have been the one screaming at the time Stipp heard the cries of a woman out of her mind with fear. Roux had consulted three specialists and the autopsy and asked Stipp: ""That person after the shots would not have been able to scream. That person would be nonresponsive; does that make sense to you as a medical doctor?"" ""It does,"" Stipp replied. The prosecution interjected, saying Steenkamp could have screamed after the first shot. Earlier in the week, Nel, the prosecutor, reading a report from an expert, told the court that of the four bullets fired toward Steenkamp ""the fourth bullet hit her in the head. She then died."" Pistorius sat impassively during the exchange between Roux and Stipp. He leaned forward, his head down in his hand, as his attorney asked Stipp if the athlete had wanted Steenkamp to live. ""He definitely wanted her to live, yes,"" Stipp replied. ""He looked sincere to me. He was crying; there were tears on his face."" After the court later adjourned, Pistorius was in tears as his sister consoled him. She wrapped an arm around his shoulders and held him close while the room emptied out Thursday. Trial may last three weeks . The defense only has to show that there is reasonable doubt Pistorius intentionally killed Steenkamp. Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa will decide whether Pistorius is innocent or guilty. South Africa does not have jury trials. Earlier in the week, lawyers briefly detoured into another of the four charges Pistorius faces, related to the discharge of a gun he was holding in a crowded restaurant in Johannesburg about a month before the killing. The trial is expected to take at least three weeks. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge, experts said. Pistorius is not claiming self-defense; he is claiming to have been mistaken about his need for self-defense. He is denying he intentionally, unlawfully killed Steenkamp. He has never denied killing her. Pistorius and Steenkamp were a young, attractive, high-profile couple popular in South Africa's social circles. Pistorius, whose ""Blade Runner"" nickname reflects the special prostheses he uses while running, won six Paralympic gold medals and became the first double-amputee runner to compete in the Olympics, in London in 2012. Cover girl Steenkamp, who was soon to star in a TV reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right at the time of her death.

"(CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates is playing host to a huge corporate party this week. Hotel lobbies and shopping malls are flooded with Chinese guests and the Dubai-Abu Dhabi highway is dotted with long rows of buses branded ""2014 Nu Skin Success Trip"" in English and Arabic. Nu Skin China, the Chinese arm of a U.S.-based marketing skin care marketing company is flying in 16,000 of its employees from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau to the UAE for a corporate trip. It says the jaunt will bring in around $20 million of business to the Gulf state. More than 200 flights were booked for the trip, including two chartered Emirates planes, while more than 39,000 hotel beds in 40 hotels and 409 buses were required, according to Nu Skin and local travel agency Arabian Adventures. The visitors are arriving in overlapping groups of around 2000 people a time. The guests are visiting landmarks such as the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, and the Sheikh Zayed mosque in Abu Dhabi. The company has also booked out the massive Ferrari World theme park for three days and organized three ""workshop dinners"" for 8,000 people a time, according to organizers.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will take another look at an 11-year-old boy's request to have Israel listed as his place of birth on his U.S. passport. The justices announced Monday they would review a federal law giving that special right to those like young Menachem Zivotofsky, who were born in Jerusalem. But that is a disputed region in the eyes of the Obama administration, which said the larger issue should be resolved by bilateral negotiations, not by a 2002 congressional action favoring the family and the more than 50,000 other Americans born in the holy city. Oral arguments by the high court will be held in the fall. At issue is whether the statute interferes with the president's power to recognize an independent sovereign. The case is a classic fight between congressional and executive authority, with foreign policy the source of the current controversy. U.S. policy does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Two years ago, the justices allowed the family's federal lawsuit to proceed. The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky. The couple and their two oldest children were born in the United States, but the family migrated to West Jerusalem more than a dozen years ago, and in 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin, was born. The boy's mother made the ""Israel"" request about two months after his birth, but embassy officials refused. The disputed passport shows his round, innocent face, and ""Jerusalem"" is listed as his place of birth. ""We're very proud of the fact that he was born in Israel and that we live in Israel and it's the modern state of Israel,"" Ari Zivotofsky told CNN in 2012. ""Religiously and historically, that's very significant."" Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the U.S. Congress gave American citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says ""Place of Birth."" President George W. Bush signed the bill but issued an executive ""signing statement"" indicating he would not comply. It is not the first time Congress and the White House have clashed over the region. The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections. The government is thinking of the bigger picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record on a pending case, but President Barack Obama has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions in that region and in the United States. The high court case is Zivotofsky v. Kerry, but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world, and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence: Jerusalem. Its name translates as ""City of Peace"" to some, ""Holy Sanctuary"" to others. Jerusalem is Israel's largest city, and the nation calls it its capital, though that is not recognized by the United Nations and most of the world community. Divided into East Jerusalem (populated mostly by Muslims) and West Jerusalem (populated mostly by Jews), the city spans over 48 square miles (124 square kilometers), with about 775,000 people. The terms ""East"" and ""West"" come layered with political, social, religious and geographic questions -- amorphous, often misleading terms, symbolic of the larger struggle for control and recognition of all that this city represents. Some use the terms ""Jewish"" or ""Arab"" Jerusalem to refer to the sections. The Old City is the heart of the region, a holy symbol to the three major Abrahamic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism. That tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the Temple Mount, Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque. The case is Zivotofsky v. Kerry (13-628). In 2011: High court looks at passports and presidential power .

"(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement . No injuries were reported. ""It was a miracle that no one was injured,"" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. ""We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,"" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005. But before South Sudan gained independence in July of last year, human rights monitors expressed concerns that longstanding grievances could again lead to violence consuming the region. In November, there were several days of bombings near an entry point for refugees at the border, the United Nations reported. It did not specify who launched the bombs.","Rev.

"(CNN) -- There is a consistent message on Russian state media concerning the situation in Ukraine. The revolving ""crisis in Ukraine"" bug on state news channel Rossiya 24 sums it up. It shows the players on the ground on a loop: 1) unmasked, kindly looking pro-Russian separatists against the background of the orange and black ribbon of St. George, the ubiquitous symbol of pro-Russian sentiment and of Soviet military glory, 2) masked, authoritarian-looking Ukrainian state security against the national flag, and 3) a balaclava-clad ultra-nationalist against the red and black flag of Ukraine's Pravvy Sektor (Right Sector) party -- the ultimate bogeyman of the conflict, as far as Russia is concerned. It's all part of the Kremlin narrative that Ukraine is at risk of a fascist takeover. ""Fascist is now being used to designate all things obnoxious and bad in the Kremlin line of argument so you call fascists those who allegedly seek to oppress the Russian speaking population in Ukraine,"" says Moscow based political analyst Mikhail Troitsky. ""And in Russia domestically you have this tendency of anyone who disagrees with the main line to be called a fascist."" Media fates and fortunes . This talk, Troitsky says, is all part of a broader notion of patriotism, carefully honed across state media, which tapped into a swelling of national pride over the Sochi Olympics and kept its momentum through Russia's annexation of Crimea. It is a redefining of boundaries many Russians feel was a historical injustice made right, the return of the peninsula to the motherland. In this climate, some, like the editor in chief of Dozhd TV, feel they face unusually strong hounding if deemed unpatriotic. Dozhd TV -- one of Russia's few independent media outlets -- was dropped by most cable operators a few weeks ago after a poll it ran in a talk show. ""We asked the question, was it necessary to give Leningrad to the Nazis for the sake of the survival of the city,"" says editor in chief Mikhail Zygar. ""Some viewers felt that the question was insulting and in about 10 minutes our editor of our website apologized and we deleted the question. But there was a huge campaign against us, blaming us for insulting all the veterans of the Leningrad siege."" Even as Zygar suspected that the Kremlin was behind the cable operators' decision, President Putin mentioned Dozhd in last week's question and answer session with the nation - promising to do what he could to help. Shortly thereafter, the cable operators said they were prepared to negotiate with Dozhd. A sign of the sway the Kremlin has on media fates and fortunes. Zygar says he's worried about a polarization of Russian society over the Ukraine crisis. ""They really see us as traitors. And that's really worse. Because the new generation is coming, that really believes that there is some kind of 5th column, some group of Western -- as Castro used to say 'mercenarios' -- those people paid by the Western countries who are working just to undermine the greatness of Russia."" Sweep of history . Zygar believes Putin's third term is characterized by a desire to place himself firmly within the grand sweep of history. ""Something like Peter the First or Catherine the Great -- he wants to change the history of this country and be the great statesman and liberator."" In the context of Ukraine, that appears to be working. According to opinion polls around the time of the Crimea referendum, some 70% of Russians approved of Putin's leadership. The notion that President Putin is taking care of the interests of all those associated with the motherland in Russia's near abroad is falling on fertile soil. It's on domestic issues -- such as housing and social welfare -- that Troitsky says people aren't quite so prepared to accept the Kremlin's story, which he believes is telling. ""Domestically I think people are keenly aware of the issues they are facing with their daily lives and I don't think it's easy to mislead them. But internationally I think this nationalist feeling, this feeling of being strong is also quite natural."" How will the crisis end? 5 possible scenarios .

"(CNN) -- With a backdrop of rapidly growing violence, Iraqis voted Wednesday in their first nationwide polls since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. forces. More than 12 million Iraqis braved potential threats and went to the polls, for a voter turnout of 60%, Iraq's election commission said. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is battling for a third term in office, but faces fierce opposition, with sectarian bloodshed at its most intense in more than five years. Polls closed at 6 p.m. local tim (11 a.m. ET), and the ballot-counting process began. Results are expected in 20 to 30 days. At least seven people were killed in attacks targeting polling stations. ""The terrorists warned that the elections will not take place and they threatened the Iraqi people who challenged them back,"" al-Maliki said after casting his vote. ""They launched attacks and many Iraqis were martyred, but our people didn't stop going to cast the ballots."" He urged all voters to cast their ballots to send a message to doubters. ""We expect unprecedented turnout so we can move Iraq ahead in the political and democratic process,"" he said. One of the attacks Wednesday came in Khanaqin, northeast of Baghdad, where three died and dozens were wounded when a suicide bomber targeted a polling station, security sources told CNN. An Iraqi soldier was killed and nine others were injured in an attack by a suicide bomber on a polling station in Baiji, authorities in Tikrit told CNN. A policeman also was killed in a separate incident involving a suicide bomber in Baiji, authorities in Tikrit told Iraqiya TV. And in Diblis, near the northern city of Kirkuk, two women were killed by a roadside bomb while heading to their polling station, according to security sources. A suicide bomber was killed by the Iraqi army as he tried to enter a polling station near Mosul, security forces said. Two police officers were injured. Bombers dressed in uniforms . On Tuesday, the officials charged with protecting polling stations and voters on election day came under attack themselves. Suicide bombers dressed in police and army uniforms placed themselves among the security officials lined up to cast their ballots, then detonated explosives. Dozens of people were killed and injured across the country. Those attacks, as well as a number Monday, were an apparent attempt to derail the balloting process and discourage the rest of Iraq's 21.5 million registered voters from going to the polls. With a surge in car bombings, assassinations and suicide attacks, the vote -- the fourth national election since the fall of longtime leader Saddam Hussein in 2003 -- is being held amid rapidly growing violence reaching levels not seen in more than five years. Deadly year . Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians. Tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the Sunnis, who say they are marginalized by the Shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by heavy-handed security tactics. Sunni anger has made it easier for al Qaeda-linked militants to recruit and operate while eroding the public's cooperation with security forces. Iraq's security forces, trained by the United States at a cost of billions of dollars, have been unable to dislodge the militants and instead are fighting pitched battles. Sunni militants in Iraq have collaborated with their co-religionists who are fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Other endemic problems gripping the country include high unemployment levels, dilapidated infrastructure and services, and chronic corruption. Oil revenues have failed to improve the lives of most Iraqis. The vote . The dire security situation in which the elections are being held is reminiscent of the country's first post-Hussein elections in 2005, when threats from al Qaeda insurgents led to minimal turnouts in most Sunni provinces. The voting has been canceled in parts of Anbar province, controlled by jihadists and tribesmen. Following the last parliamentary election in 2010, it took nearly eight months of intense backdoor negotiations for Iraq's bickering politicians finally to form a government. This time, though, there are no U.S. forces on the ground, and Washington will be watching from afar.

After first noting (more accurately) that $90 billion went to the ""green energy world,"" Romney followed up with ""don't forget... you put $90 billion -- like 50 years worth of breaks -- into solar and wind."" Personally, I wish the president had. But it just isn't true. The actual number was more like $21 billion. I know, because I helped oversee the administration's efforts in this area. The larger number refers to all of the investments in the 2009 stimulus package that the administration designated ""green"" in any way. The number included $6 billion for advanced batteries to make electric cars possible, $29 billion for energy efficiency and home retrofits, $3 billion for job training, and even $18 billion for transit and high speed rail. To pretend that all of that money went to solar and wind companies is ludicrous. Worse, Romney alleged that the administration picked only ""losers."" False. First of all, many of these initiatives began under President George W. Bush, including some of the loan guarantee programs Romney likes to attack. With the exception of Solyndra, the track record for renewable energy investments is strong. In fact, the failure rate is lower than Congress anticipated when they created these programs -- and, while we're on the topic, higher than Romney's 80% success rate at Bain Capital. CNN Fact Check: Are half of green energy firms funded by stimulus out of business? The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that there are 3.1 million green jobs in the United States right now. This is a big success story for Obama. Today, there are 75,000 Americans employed in the wind energy business alone, compared with 81,000 coal miners. Today, the top three clean-tech states each employ more people in green jobs than the coal industry does nationwide. Romney is willing to jeopardize those jobs by arguing for killing the wind energy tax credit -- while refusing to end subsidies and supports for the fossil fuel industry. Opinion: Millenials to candidates: Talk to us . (By the way: Coal employment is still high. Regulations that place more stringent public health standards on coal mining have actually created more jobs in coal mining industry, thanks to EPA. Even if the number of miners goes down at some point, I would blame dynamite, not government regulations. More and more, ""mountaintop removal"" is the standard practice for coal companies, and simply blowing up a mountain to scrape the coal out requires fewer workers. ) Romney is right that Obama has not been willing to open up some public lands for oil drilling and coal mining. That is a good thing. If it were left up to people like Romney, there might be oil rigs in places like the Grand Canyon. That approach not only desecrates our nation's natural beauty, it is an unnecessary and excessive risk. The United States is on its way to being a net oil exporter, without jeopardizing the beauty and integrity of our public lands. Both conservatives and liberals should be happy with Obama's energy policies. Oil, coal and natural gas production is up, which should please the right. But energy efficiency and conservation is also up, which should please the left. Romney -- like his running mate, Paul Ryan -- sounds great when he is spinning his yarns about America under Obama. But he knows precious little about the renewable energy industry and is relying on Tea Party talking points to score cheap points, at the expense of America's clean energy entrepreneurs. There is an upside: This fall, both Ryan and Romney have already created a full employment program -- for fact checkers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: Mitt Romney was wrong to imply adminsitration spent $90 billion on solar, wind .
He says $21 billion spent on solar/wind, the rest on other green energy initiatives .
Jones says Romney was wrong to say investments were failures; success rate was high .
He says it's a good thing Obama is against drilling on some public lands ."
"(CNN) -- U.S. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl -- a former captive, a survivor and a hometown hero to many in Hailey, Idaho -- is being accused by some of his fellow soldiers of deserting his post. This charge of treason will be proven or dismissed in the coming weeks and months. But whether it is true or not, and whether he faces official military charges, he has already been sentenced to life to be haunted by his captivity -- and if the allegations are true, his choices. Survivors of the Hanoi Hilton, POWs during Vietnam such as Sen. John McCain and Medal of Honor winner Adm. James Stockdale, endured the rigors of long days, months and years of surviving captivity. But Bergdahl's experiences were starkly different from those of his military predecessors. He was not held by a nation-state recognized by the United Nations, nor did he have fellow prisoners to commiserate with or rely upon for comfort, aid and solace. The ""hostage"" experience when you are kidnapped by Islamic extremists is like no other imaginable. Every day, you wake believing you might die from a bullet from an AK-47 or a dull knife blade sawing across your throat. Bowe did not have someone to share in his day-to-day misery. His constant fear upon waking up every morning probably was: ""Is this my last day on Earth?"" Most American soldiers captured in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were executed within days or weeks of captivity. How did Bergdahl survive five years with one of the most extreme and militant wings of the Taliban? The U.S. Department of Defense instructs all students at Survival Evasion, Resistance and Escape schools that building rapport with your captors is critical to your survival as a hostage. This is urged to make your kidnappers see you as a human and not an ""object"" that should be exploited or executed. This can be as simple as learning phrases in your captor's language to Bergdahl's extreme case, where he learned Pashtun and possibly even converting to Islam. Every POW from Hanoi has spoken of the importance and power of communications between fellow captives as critical to their survival and sanity. As well as the overwhelming trauma of being held hostage, Bergdahl will have to deal with the accusations of desertion by some of his fellow soldiers. Did he indeed walk off his combat outpost in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, as many soldiers say he did? In his e-mails home before his capture, Bergdahl told his parents he was ""ashamed to be an American,"" and wrote that the U.S. Army is ... ""the army of liars, backstabbers, fools, and bullies. ... I am sorry for everything here. .. The horror of the self-righteous arrogance that they thrive in. It is all revolting."" Yet within days of his capture, the first video proving him alive aired on July 18, 2009. In it, Bergdahl, choking back tears, adopted a different tone. ""Well, I'm scared,"" he said. ""It's very unnerving to be a prisoner."" We have a moral and ethical obligation to bring all Americans, including all members of the military, home from a hostage or prisoner of war situation. It's a relief that Bergdahl's long ordeal is over and he will finally be reunited with his family. He was the longest-held American military prisoner since Vietnam, and the only American soldier who survived any significant length of time in the capture of Islamic militants since the post 9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began. ""Leave No Man Behind"" is the mantra of the Personnel Recovery Mission to bring all POWs and MIAs home from war. The mission says that: ""Preserving the life and well-being of U.S. military personnel placed in danger of isolation, beleaguerment, detention, or capture while participating in a U.S.-sponsored activity or mission is one of the highest priorities of the United States government and the Department of Defense."" Personnel Recovery's other ethos is ""Return with Honor."" The ""Freedom bird"" planes that brought home Stockdale and McCain included POWs who many believed did not live up to the same standard of resistance demonstrated by their peers. Now five years later, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl will be coming home to his family and a very mixed reception by his countrymen. Bergdahl will have many questions to answer as he continues through the repatriation process of medical exams, physiological screenings and debriefs on what his actions were before, during and after his capture and subsequent detainment by the Taliban. One can only speculate about his original intent, but I expect his opinion of the America that sacrificed so much to bring him home is not what it was five years ago. Like all soldiers, Bergdahl made a solemn vow to defend his country and fellow soldiers -- to serve with honor. That he lived up to that oath is very much up for debate. Some members from his former unit, ""his tribe,"" believe that Bowe broke that vow. To be unfaithful to your fellow soldiers in a time of war is the ultimate betrayal. To put your brothers-in-arms at risk, some of whom might have died because of your actions, is an unforgivable sin for members of the military. If the accusations are true, even if he is not tried under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Bergdahl will live with that shame the rest of his life. Bowe Bergdahl still has a long and difficult journey home.","Bowe Bergdahl a ""hometown hero"" in Hailey, Idaho, and a ""deserter"" to some soldiers .
O'Shea: He learned Pashtun; building rapport with captors is critical to survival as a hostage .
He says Bergdahl probably wondered each day if this would be his last .
To break vow to fellow soldiers is terrible: If he indeed deserted, that will haunt him, too ."

"(CNN) -- Hall of Fame former NBA coach John ""Dr. Jack"" Ramsay, who became a basketball TV analyst years after winning a league championship with the Portland Trail Blazers, has died at age 89, his longtime employer ESPN said Monday on Twitter. The cause of death wasn't immediately announced. Ramsay had battled various types of cancer for more than a decade. The Philadelphia native made his mark in the collegiate and professional coaching ranks, taking St. Joseph's College to 10 postseason appearances in the 1950s and 1960s before becoming general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, winning an NBA title in 1967. He later coached the 76ers, Buffalo Braves, Portland Trail Blazers and Indiana Pacers, earning a 864-783 record from 1968 to 1988. His Trail Blazers won the NBA title in 1977, fueled by center Bill Walton, who was named the NBA Finals' Most Valuable Player. It is the Trail Blazers' only NBA championship. Ramsay turned to television after leaving the Pacers, analyzing games for the Miami Heat, ESPN Radio and other ESPN platforms. He was inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. He was known as ""Dr. Jack"" for his doctorate in education, which he earned at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1960s. When the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary during the 1996-1997 season, NBA reporters voted Ramsay to a list of top 10 coaches in NBA history.

"(CNN) -- It might be Brazil. Argentina, perhaps. Maybe Spain will reign again. But it is highly likely it won't be England who lift the World Cup in Rio this July, says their former boss Fabio Capello. The 67-year-old, who is now manager of Russia, thinks his former charges will run out of puff this summer. ""It's really important which physical condition the teams arrive at the World Cup,"" Capello told CNN's World Sport. ""England are always tired because they play too many games."" It's not the first time Capello has asserted his belief that England's international prospects could benefit from a pause in the long Premier League campaign. ""It's like when you're driving a car: if you stop halfway to put fuel in then you'll definitely get where you want to go,"" the Italian said last year. Capello' four-year England reign ended abruptly when he resigned in February 2012. His tenure was marked by his poor grasp of English -- he famously said in 2011 that he only needed a 100-word vocabulary to talk to his players -- and overseeing a humiliating 4-1 defeat against Germany at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Capello raged theatrically at his players from the touchline that day, but now reflects more soberly. ""When you win everything is perfect. When you lose, everything is wrong. This is the history of football. But we didn't play really, really well. Also the big mistake from the referee,"" he says, referring to Frank Lampard's goal that never was as England tumbled out of the 2010 tournament. The English media never holds back in its forensic analysis of England managers and Capello also faced criticism for the stifling security of the team's training camp at Royal Bafokeng Sports Complex. ""The camp was perfect,"" said the Italian in an answer to a question as to whether the criticism surrounding ""Camp Capello"" had been fair. However, Capello is confident he has made the right choice for Russia's base in the town of Itu -- close to Sao Paulo -- for the forthcoming World Cup. ""I went to Brazil looking for a camp and we are lucky because we were the second on their list where we stay now, after Germany. ""If Germany had chosen this place... but they changed because they built a new camp especially for Germany. ""We are really lucky because it's one of the best camps in terms of location, distance from the airport, everything. We are really happy."" Now the veteran coach is relishing the task at hand this coming June and further ahead to 2018 when Russia will host the World Cup for the first time. ""We are back in the World Cup after 12 years, the experience is really important for the players,"" he says. ""The expectation for the World Cup in 2018 is really big. We need to build 12 new stadiums, infrastructure, everything. That will be a really big job."" As it was with England, expectations in Russia are high for this year's tournament, but who are the other teams Capello is backing to do well this summer? ""Brazil is my favorite team because I saw the games they played in the Confederations Cup,"" he says. ""They improved a lot game after game and they are really strong. The quality is not the top like normal Brazilian players, but they are compact and they are really physically strong. ""After Brazil I think in terms of quality comes Argentina. Lionel Messi always makes the difference, as we just saw in the game Barcelona v Real Madrid."" Capello also believes Jose Pekerman's Colombia side or a Uruguay team spurred on by strikers Edison Cavani and Luis Suarez could pose a threat. ""After this in Europe it's Spain, the World Cup champions. And Germany. Always! I don't know why but they always (finish) in the first four.""

"(CNN) -- Pixar turned its table lamp on its voice actors for the upcoming films ""The Good Dinosaur"" and ""Inside Out"" at the Disney fan convention D23 on Friday. Disney animation czar John Lasseter also showed off footage from the films, and revealed that their ""Finding Nemo"" sequel — ""Finding Dory"" — would feature Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton as the parents of Ellen DeGeneres' forgetful fish, while ""Modern Family""'s Ty Burrell will voice a beluga named Bailey. Ranking the top Pixar movies . THE GOOD DINOSAUR . Pixar's 2014 film about a world where dinosaurs never went extinct will feature an Apatosaurus family who work as farmers tilling fields to grow tree crops to feed their herbivore brethren. Poppa and Momma will be voiced by John Lithgow and Frances McDormand, while Bill Hader voices the older brother Forrest. Neil Patrick Harris and Judy Greer will play middle-sibling dinosaurs Cliff and Ivy, and the lead character — baby brother Arlo — will be performed by ""Raising Hope""'s Lucas Neff. Pixar showed off the first footage, tracking a humongous potato-like asteroid as it hurdles through deep space on a collision course with Earth 65 million years ago, and ... Misses. A few prehistoric dinosaurs munching on some midnight snacks look up to see a blue bolt shoot across the sky and disappear. Director Bob Peterson (a veteran story artist with the company, and the voice of Dug the Dog from ""Up"" and growling Roz from ""Monsters Inc."") oversees the film with co-director Pete Sohn (who voiced mama's boy Squishy in ""Monsters University."") ""The modern dinosaurs are farmers,"" Sohn said. ""We actually designed them to function as their own farm equipment."" Triceratops are bulldozers, the stegosauruses ""have spiky tails that mow down acres of crops,"" and the Apatosaurus uses its long neck and tough bill to plow and plant the fields. While working the field one day, Arlo discovers a large beetle rustling around the ground, but there's something strange about it. It's actually a human toddler, in disguise. He's a grunting, savage little boy named Spot — who can't talk like the dinosaurs around him. ""Spot is all alone in the world,"" Sohn said. ""He's not afraid of anyone -- even a dinosaur 20 times taller than him."" The film explores what happens when dinosaurs, the dominant species on Earth, discovers these strange, clever pests we would call humans. No images were immediately released, but for now we have this piece of concept art — featuring an evolved, long-necked dinosaur (most likely Arlo) cutting the clouds while running through a mountainside plain. Is there a Pixar conspiracy theory? INSIDE OUT . When Lasseter revealed this project two years ago at the last D23 event, it was called simply ""Pixar's Untitled Project That Takes You Inside the Mind."" Now it's known as ""Inside Out,"" a comedy from ""Up"" director Pete Docter and producer Jonas Rivera — and D23 finally revealed some plot details for the 2015 movie. The movie zooms in to show the committees of emotions that run the minds of a mother, father, and an 11-year-old daughter going through a rough patch after moving to a new city. Riley, the once happy-go-lucky pre-teen is uprooted from her pleasant life in Minnesota and thrust into a new, unwelcome existence in San Francisco. That's when the emotions take over, much to the chagrin of her baffled parents. Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Fear (Bill Hader), Sadness (""The Office""'s Phyliss Smith) and Joy (Amy Poehler) spar, collaborate, and miscommunicate with one another in an attempt to keep her functioning. ""We get to take you places everyone has thought about but nobody has seen before. Places like 'long-term memory,'"" said Docter. Other places visited include the Disneyland-esque Imaginationland and ""Abstract Thought,"" where emotions become Piccaso-style versions of themselves. There's also Dream Pictures, a movie studio where dreams are produced and ""The Train of Thought,"" which connects all the different worlds and looks like ... well, guess.

"(CNN) -- It's a perennial problem. How do you persuade young, apathetic voters to go to the polls? Enter ""Voteman"" -- Denmark's rather ill-judged and short-lived cartoon solution. The cartoon opens with two apparently politically disaffected young men. The scene switches to Voteman, a muscle-bound, stubble-chinned superhero, answering a call asking him to persuade voters to have their say in the upcoming European Parliament elections. Naked, he leaps up from a bed surrounded by women apparently performing sex acts on him and -- having donned a leather waistcoat and trousers -- sets off from a Bond villain-esque island hideout on his mission, riding a pair of harnessed dolphins as waterskis. An orgy of cartoon violence follows -- one of the original men is decapitated, while other would-be non-voters are punched, slapped and tossed through the windows of a polling station to vote. The cartoon is the unlikely creation of the Danish Parliament's EU information center, originally posted to its official YouTube page. Less surprisingly perhaps, it has now been pulled and an apology made for its graphic sexual and violent content. Mogens Lykketoft, speaker of the Danish Parliament, said in a statement on his Facebook page that many people had perceived the cartoon as ""more serious and offensive than it was intended, and see it as talking down to the youth. ""Reaction in social media is sharply divided between those who see this as unacceptably vulgar, and those who think it is tough but acceptable humor which brings attention to the vote on May 25. ""The latter was the intention. But I acknowledge that Parliament, as an institution, in future has to show more caution in what we put our name to."" The cartoon tells the story of how Voteman, as a young man, once forgot to vote in European Parliament elections. This, the narration says, taught him a painful lesson: ""No influence on climate regulations, agricultural subsidies, chemicals in toys -- and the amount of cinnamon allowed in his cinnamon buns. ""Horrified by this, he decided he would dedicate his life to making everybody vote. So if you're not going to vote, don't try to run, don't try to hide, because he will find you. And he will make you vote."" The European Parliament elections, in which voters in each of the European Union's member states elect representatives to the body, are taking place across Europe next week. May 25 is the day on which Danish voters will go to the polls. Denmark's turnout for the last European elections in 2009 was close to 60%, well above the European average of 43%. CNN's Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","Cartoon uses muscle-bound character called Voteman to persuade people to vote .

"(CNN) -- Can a photo competition change the world? Probably not, but when paired with the brainpower of IBM and the problem-solving capabilities of the world's most advanced artificially intelligent computer systems, it might just stand a chance. Last November, IBM opened its 12th global research lab -- and first on the African continent -- in Nairobi, Kenya. Though the lab employs 25 PhDs from the world's best universities, as well as Watson -- the AI supercomputer that won Jeopardy against human competitors in 2011 -- the company recognized that in order to truly shape innovation in the continent, it had to first hear from the people who live there. ""If we're going to solve the grand challenges of Africa it has to start here in Africa with us identifying and underscoring what they are,"" says Erik Hersman, founder of Nairobi's iHub tech hub and CEO of BRCK, and one of the four photo contest judges. To better understand what areas to invest in, IBM launched its The World is Our Lab photo competition, which invited anyone with a camera (or mobile phone) to contribute images that highlight the continent's grand challenges, city systems and examples of innovation. After three months (and 1,200 submissions), they chose a winner in each of those three categories. The competition even succeeded in offering the judges a few surprises. ""I saw places in Nigeria I didn't even imagine existed,"" says Kenyan Mutua Matheka, official photographer for The World is Our Lab project and another judge in the competition. ""The winners each shared an Africa that most of us didn't know or didn't have access to."" Kenyan TV producer Frank Odwesso won in the City System category with his image of a woman on the back of a ""boda boda,"" or bicycle taxi. The judges felt the picture demonstrated how locals in Western Kenya and Nyanza circumvent an unreliable public transport system to create a more efficient means of getting around. Mainly, though, it was the strength of the image that they were drawn to. ""It had the most vibrant colors, and it really summed up Africa to me,"" admits Matheka. See the best photos from the competition here . Imole ""Tobbie"" Balogun won the Grand Challenges category with ""Baby Sitting,"" which highlights the very adult responsibilities imposed on many of Nigeria's children -- either because poverty forces them into jumpstarting their working lives, or because they have to assume the role of caretaker for their siblings. Visual artist Lawrence ""Shabu"" Mwangi won the Innovation category, and the competition overall, with ""Digital Migration,"" a shot he took of children playing with scrap in Nairobi's Mukuru slum. ""We have these big dumping sites in Mukuru, and though we try to prevent the kids going to them, they find a way and use the scrap to play with,"" says Mwangi, who also grew up in the area. ""These kids were playing a role in the television. None of them have a TV at home, but here they had a chance to be reporters -- they could be anything they wanted to be within that television. I just wanted to capture the happiness in that moment,"" he adds. See more from Inside Africa . The competition is part of IBM's $100 million Project Lucy initiative, which will employ Watson and other cognitive computing technologies to advance development and create business opportunities in Africa over the next 10 years. Matheka, a former architect and one of the continent's most respected photographers, says the competition has also shown him how photography has grown in Africa. ""I feel like a lot of African photographers have observed how those in Europe and the U.S. have photographed in Africa, and many us still use that as a template of how Africa should be captured. I think we're starting to get out of that now,"" he says. ""I think photography is starting to feel more approachable, to include the African public and focus on the textures and people of Africa. We're starting to tell stories for Africans. It's important, because our stories matter, and we need to hear them and to see our heroes so that we can know what is possible.""","IBM photo competition looked at Africa's challenges and opportunities .

"(CNN) -- It makes sense that we're all obsessed with the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370. What I find more mysterious is why we aren't obsessed with other arguably more important stories. The missing Malaysia Airlines plane falls right at the nexus of several gripping story lines in the public narrative. Stories about death inherently hold our attention. The more dark among us -- and HBO producers -- might attribute this to a lust for the gruesome. Freud would simply call it our ""death drive"" — that mix of fear and fascination that our lives must ultimately end. Regardless, as Jack Schaeffer noted in Reuters, media coverage has always hewed toward dark sensationalism to feed the cravings of a hungry audience. There's something about death in sudden, large numbers that grabs our attention. Every year, about 32,000 people are killed by guns in the United States. And yet the routine daily suicides and shootings don't seem to command our attention or even our compassion in quite the same way as mass shootings like Aurora or Sandy Hook. Of course, we also respond to whom the victims are: When they are innocent little children, the dismay is more intense. It's not just about numbers — the idea that suddenly a large group of people are harmed. While the unknown fate of the 239 souls aboard the Malaysia flight is unquestionably looming with tragedy, on the same day the plane went missing around 20,000 people died from cancer worldwide. Around 4,000 people worldwide died from AIDS on the same day. In the 11 days since the plane has been missing, more than 1,000 people have likely died from drug overdoses in the United States alone. Why don't we care about these tales of death? Or perhaps more important, how could we care more? The other gripping story line of the missing Malaysia flight is, of course, the mystery. It's a real whodunnit unfolding live before our very eyes. Adding to the fascination is certainly the fact that, as Farhad Majoo eloquently pointed out in the New York Times, a genuine mystery would seem impossible in our hyper-connected, over-surveilled day and age. Majoo writes: ""The disappearance stands in stark contrast to the hallmark sensation of our time, the certainty that we're all being constantly tracked and that, for better or worse, we're strapped to the grid, never out of touch. It turns out that's not true."" But if that is really the hallmark norm of our era, then why aren't we equally fixated on the fact that in this day and age, 1 million children are exploited by the global commercial sex trade every single year — many disappearing right out from under the eyes of loved ones or government agencies. Shocking, right? But worthy of our 24/7 attention? Apparently not. ""The problem with our always-on culture is that actually, we're not always focused on stuff that matters, just stuff that triggers,"" says Micah Sifry, co-founder of the Personal Democracy Forum. ""The news business has long understood this, but now the rise of social media seems to be making the problem even worse, since it is fragmenting our attention down to the individual level."" Still it raises the question -- what about the things that arguably matter and on some level trigger, just not enough? Is there a way to make the daily scourge of AIDS and child sex trafficking and gun violence as gripping as a missing jumbo jet? No, says Bea Arthur, a licensed therapist and founder of PrettyPaddedRoom.com. Arthur argues its not just the conflation of compelling plot lines that makes the Malaysia plane story so gripping — it's the fact that it's a lot of people, that it happened suddenly, and that we still don't know what happened. What grabs us is the idea that a plane can suddenly, unpredictably drop out of the sky. It ruptures our need for control. ""People want details because they want to know this won't happen to them,"" Arthur says. Arthur suggests our fascination with tragedies like the Malaysia plane is less about the basic facts of death or scale or even mystery but simply the egotistical desire to categorically exempt ourselves from whatever new possibility of bad things happening arise out of the story. ""It's about ego and self-preservation and wanting some sense of control,"" Arthur says. In other words, even though we are more likely to die from cancer (1 in 4 odds for men, 1 in 5 odds for women) than a plane crash (1 in 11,000,000 million odds), cancer feels like a known, even avoidable threat (even if it's not) whereas the missing plane pushes our personal panic button. The media can keep trying to tell the stories of poor people dying from lack of food and shelter, of children in rural communities and inner cities dying from gun violence, of black and Latina woman disproportionately being infected with and dying from HIV/AIDS. These stories are vital, especially when told in careful ways that don't just elicit individual sympathy but illuminate larger structural implications and the need for solutions. But no matter how numerous, no matter how gruesome and no matter how pressing, these and other critical stories may never pierce our consciousness, let alone capture world attention. Then again, Arthur points out, the Malaysia plane story is only interesting until it ends. ""Once there's closure ... we'll go on and forget about it, too,"" she says. ""Strange comfort that, in the end, all stories — important or intriguing or in between — fall victim to our short attention span.","Sally Kohn: We're obsessed with missing Malaysia flight; why not other tragedies?

"(CNN) -- From the red carpet to the White House, a public figure's fashion choices convey intent and state of mind. During Tuesday's presidential debate, the flashbulb-wielding peanut gallery will express more curiosity about health care reform and foreign policy than about who designed Mitt Romney's ensemble. But while what each candidate is wearing certainly isn't ballot-worthy, neither campaign seems to be taking any chances -- even with something as small as an American flag lapel pin. ""The littlest things can throw a campaign so the candidates tend to keep it safe and let the wives be the peacocks of the campaign,"" said Maren Hartman, runway analyst and director of U.S. content for WGSN, a fashion forecasting service. Despite their political leanings, Hartman said both Romney and President Obama tend to lean toward the conservative side when it comes to wardrobe policy. ""When it comes to things like creating brand image where everybody does the same thing or people are consistent, it helps consumers and voters remember who they're looking at,"" said Hartman, calling to mind Steve Jobs' black turtleneck, jeans and New Balance sneakers; Mark Zuckerberg's gray T-shirts; and even Rick Santorum's sweater vests. Romney's campaign-trail uniform of a button-down Oxford shirt with rolled-up sleeves and blue jeans helps disassociate him from the immense personal wealth that has often been a point of contention, said Hartman. Obama, on the other hand, is more likely to appear on the campaign trail in a tailored power suit, rolling his sleeves or taking off his jacket for a more casual look, she said. ""I think he's much better off in a suit,"" iconic American designer Tommy Hilfiger told CNN's Piers Morgan about President Obama. ""He needs to be in a suit and he's really professional and proper in a suit and he's being photographed all the time so he should have his game on."" Meanwhile, Republican vice presidential contender Paul Ryan has been lambasted in heavy-hitting fashion publications like Women's Wear Daily, Esquire and the New York Times Style Section for his poorly tailored suits. Bruce Pask, the men's fashion editor of T: The New York Times Style Magazine, told Cathy Horyn, The New York Times fashion critic: ""I think he suffers from the misconception that the size a guy wears directly correlates with his masculinity. In their minds, being a 42 is more manly than a 40. And yet what actually happens when a guy wears something too big is the obvious: He looks smaller, dwarfed by shoulders that are too big, a shirt collar that is too roomy, lapels that are too wide."" ""I think he looks like an American businessman on a weekend and I think he's trying to portray that -- I think he wants people to think he's the guy next door in his dress, so I think he's accomplishing that,"" said Hilfiger of Ryan. Romney, Ryan love North Face. Founder finds that ironic . Of course, what the candidates' wives wear gets even more scrutiny. ""I think Michelle Obama brought back that focus on fashion and the first lady having a look -- and that trickles over to the men as well,"" said Hartman. Although style mavens generally tend to covet the first lady's ensembles, Michelle Obama did receive heavy criticism when she opted for an Alexander McQueen gown for a 2011 state dinner with Chinese President Hu Jintao, instead of a more diplomatic choice of an Asian-American designer. And long before Big Bird took center stage during the last presidential debate, another yellow bird ruffled a few feathers. In May, Ann Romney faced a backlash after sporting an off-the-rack $990 Reed Krakoff T-shirt with a prominent yellow bird design during an interview on CBS's ""This Morning."" Critics called her choice to wear such an expensive staple item ""out of touch."" According to Emily Barnett, a Parsons School of Design assistant professor, color choice is also powerful visual tool -- whether viewers know it or not. McDonald's is one of the most famous examples of color theory with its branded combination of yellow and red. Red is known to illicit feelings of hunger while yellow tends to convey a sense of rush; a fitting combination for a fast food chain. Barnett said since the late Tim Russert of ""Meet the Press"" popularized the concept of red (Republican) and blue (Democrat) states, who wears what color tie has been a very circumscribed choice. In the most recent debate, Romney opted for a red, diagonally striped tie while Obama opted for a blue tie with a very minimal pattern. Romney's choice of diagonals was smart, said Barnett because diagonals imply ""a strong sense of movement."" Obama's small, muted pattern fell in line with his more laid back performance in the debate, she said. As for the wives, Barnett said both women made smart wardrobe choices for the last debate, including the first lady's choice of a warmer blue suit. ""That kind of color is a symbol to her loyalty,"" said Barnett -- very fitting on debate night, but also the couple's 20th wedding anniversary. Ann, keeping with the patriotic red, white and blue palette, opted for an ivory suit. ""That's a color that in scientific terms reflects all colors and it also references a fresh, new outlook and peace,"" said Barnett. For Tuesday's debate, Barnett predicts the candidates will stick with the same tie colors but opt for hints of the opposing color -- to promote a more bipartisanship, moderate tone in a tight election.

"(CNN) -- The nation's best military fliers have had their wings clipped, thanks to the forced spending cuts imposed on the federal government this year. The U.S. Navy on Tuesday announced it was canceling all the air shows its Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron had scheduled for the rest of the year. The Navy action follows the Air Force's April 1 announcement that its Thunderbirds team would not perform again this year. ""Recognizing budget realities, current Defense policy states that outreach events can only be supported with local assets at no cost to the government,"" said a statement Tuesday from the office of the Commander Naval Air Forces in San Diego. ""This is one of many steps the Navy is taking to ensure resources are in place to support forces operating forward now and those training to relieve them."" The Navy, Air Force and the rest of the federal government must deal with $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, that were mandated by a 2011 agreement by Congress that raised the federal debt ceiling. Obama to propose changes to Medicare and Social Security . The cuts targeted agencies and programs dear to Democrats, such as education, and also went after Republican priorities, including the military. The Air Force had said earlier this year that air shows can cost bases $100,000. More than two dozen Thunderbirds performances scheduled for the rest of this year were cut, including an Asian tour. Air force fighter jets a casualty of budget cuts . The Blue Angels had 32 performances left this year. However, several of those, including one originally scheduled for this coming weekend at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, had been canceled with the expectation that the budget cuts would force the Navy's hand. The Navy team had also canceled a performance set for MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, last weekend. The next performance still on the schedule would have been at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on May 22, part of the graduation festivities at the academy. The Navy said the Blue Angels will continue to train at their base in Pensacola, Florida, for when the budget crunch ends. ""The Navy believes there is value in demonstrating the professionalism and capabilities of our Navy and Marine Corps Naval Aviation team, thus inspiring future generations of Sailors and Marines. The Navy intends to continue aerial demonstrations in the future as the budget situation permits,"" the service's statement said.

"London (CNN) -- High-level talks to defuse the Ukraine crisis, due to be held by the U.S., Russia, the EU and the Kiev government next week, amount to a big personal test for John Kerry after a notably accident-prone first year as U.S. President Barack Obama's secretary of state. Kerry's State Department failed to see the Ukraine crisis coming and may have inadvertently helped to provoke it. They pushed too hard as the EU moved to cement closer ties with the former Soviet republic. Then, when Ukraine's elected, pro-Russia president was forcibly overthrown, the U.S. barely concealed its satisfaction. The conviction that Washington deliberately engineered the Kiev ""coup"" predictably enraged Russian President Vladimir Putin. He decided he would try a bit of direct intervention of his own. The result was last month's annexation of Crimea and the apparent, continuing Russian military threat to eastern Ukraine. Key international issues . There is a bit of a pattern emerging here. Take Egypt for example. In November last year, during a Middle East tour, Kerry gave his backing to the military junta that deposed the country's elected Muslim Brotherhood President, Mohamed Morsy, and brutally repressed thousands of his supporters. Kerry declared that Egypt was following a ""roadmap"" back to democracy and that Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general in charge, enjoyed his confidence. Since then, the repression has only gotten worse, and Egyptian democracy has become a bad joke. Hundreds of Brotherhood supporters were sentenced to death in risibly unfair court trials, amid a widening crackdown on political dissent and independent media. El-Sisi now plans to become president. Kerry has become more critical, but the die is cast. Very soon, Egypt will have a new dictator to replace former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, only younger and potentially more vicious. This dire prospect is not what the Arab Spring was about, and surely not what the Obama administration intended. Kerry's judgment has not proved any more impressive in his handling of several other key international issues. He threw his weight behind the Syrian peace talks process after receiving encouragement, ironically, from Putin, who is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's main external backer. But it seems the wily Russian leader saw Kerry coming from way off. Moscow continued to aid, abet and arm the Assad regime while the U.S.-backed opposition groups squabbled and split and eventually achieved next to nothing in the Geneva talks. Kerry's plan to discuss a transitional government in Damascus never got to first base. Out of touch . Kerry invested a surprising amount of personal capital in reviving peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, making optimistic prognostications about his chances of success where so many others have failed. Perhaps it was a generational thing. Kerry, aged 70, has lived with the Israel-Palestine conflict all of his professional life. When he finally became secretary of state, maybe he thought: ""At last, I have my chance to fix this."" But he hasn't. In fact, following the Palestinian Authority's decision last week to seek U.N.-recognized statehood, and the Israeli government's reaction in breaking off most contacts, the situation is rapidly deteriorating again. Kerry's behavior in all these cases was delusional and out of touch with the realities on the ground, as the Washington Post's Jackson Diehl has argued, saying: ""Egypt is under the thumb of an authoritarian general. The Syrian peace talks imploded soon after they began. The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are hanging by a thread. All along the way, Kerry -- thanks to a profound misreading of the realities on the ground -- was enabling the bad guys."" Now Kerry faces his biggest challenge -- persuading, or forcing, another bad guy (namely Putin) to back off in Ukraine at a time when the Russian leader seems ever more convinced of American weakness. According to Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former Obama state department official speaking Thursday to the BBC, Putin formed that opinion, rightly or wrongly, when the U.S. ducked military action in Syria last year. Now he appears to believe Washington, and therefore NATO, will avoid a physical confrontation over Ukraine at all costs, and that this gives him a clear negotiating advantage. Ahead of next week's talks, Kerry could be misreading the situation again. He evidently did not believe Russia would be so audacious as to annex Crimea. He was wrong. Now, judging by recent statements, he is getting it wrong again. He seems to believe Putin is on the point of ordering similar action in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia separatists have seized government buildings and appealed for Russian armed intervention. Testifying to Congress this week, Kerry blamed the protests on ""special forces and agents"" sent by Moscow in a move he said ""could potentially be a contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea."" While the U.S. favored a diplomatic solution, Washington was ready ""to do what is necessary"" to maintain international order. Putin must chortle at such empty-sounding rhetoric. He believes, with good reason, that the U.S. and its allies will not go to war over Ukraine. He probably also has no intention of sending in his tanks, simply because he does not need to. The direct and indirect pressure on Kiev to bow to Russian demands for ""constitutional reform,"" including some form of federal system and enhanced regional autonomy in the east, is massive and beginning to tell. It is backed up by powerful Russian economic leverage, especially over gas supplies and agricultural exports. Ukraine is broke and divided. Crimea is lost. It has neither an elected government nor president. It is militarily vastly inferior. And it lacks allies it can rely upon, when the chips are down. Like it or not, it has little choice but to seek an accommodation with Russia. Unless Kerry significantly raises his game, the terms will be dictated by Putin.

"Herat, Afghanistan (CNN) -- As we stroll down a dusty back street in Herat, Afghanistan's third-biggest city, a high gate made from sheets of rusted corrugated iron and a door that's bolted shut confronts us. On the other side of this fortress-like barrier we can hear children's voices and playful laughter. When we knock the voices fall silent and a young man comes to the gate. He asks for our names and the purpose of our visit. Satisfied with the answer, the door is unbolted and we're allowed inside. Behind the high wall, four little girls -- the youngest a smiling two-year old with food on her face -- greet us in a concrete-covered courtyard. Garbage is piled up in one corner, while a broken down motorcycle leans against a brick wall. While this scene may appear perfectly normal, their mother's story is anything but. We're led up stairs to a room with carpets and cushions on the floor -- this is where the family eats and sleeps. As the afternoon light streams through the window, Sitara appears. She tries to cover her face with her long beige scarf, but her beautiful brown eyes are visible. So too are the jagged scars -- shocking confirmation of the horrific attack she suffered four months earlier. In December last year, 23-year-old Sitara was asleep on the floor with her daughters when her husband woke her. He needed money for a fix of heroin and crystal meth -- an addiction he'd developed over the course of their marriage. When she was married off to him as a child bride at the age of seven, his drug of choice was hashish. But now this man -- 20 years her senior -- was a full-blown addict. Monster . He wanted to divorce Sitara so he could take their daughters and marry them off for a few thousand dollars for each girl's virginity. But Sitara refused -- this protective mother adamant her children were not going to suffer the same fate as her. She'd reached her limit with his destructive drug use and the monster he'd turned into. But she didn't realize just how much of a monster he'd become. That night he demanded money and a simple ring she was wearing -- the only jewelry she possessed. When Sitara said no, he bashed in her head until part of her brain was protruding from her skull. She was almost unconscious. He then pinned her down, got a knife and cut off her nose and upper lip. ""My head was throbbing and he was on top of me, that's when I saw the knife,"" she recalls. I struggled but then blacked out. When I woke up, I tried to touch my nose and lips but I felt nothing."" Sitara's girls were asleep except for 10-year-old Somia. I ask her what happened, but her elder sister, Parisa, steps in and explains. ""We were all asleep except for my sister Somia. I asked her why didn't she wake me up? She told me our father threatened her that if she screamed, he would cut her just like our mother. ""My father then tripped over me as he was pulling my mother by the hair. I woke up and started screaming at him. Then he ran away and we never saw him again."" Mutilated and unconscious . Neighbors who heard the screaming alerted police who found Sitara mutilated, unconscious and lying in a pool of her own blood. She was taken to hospital where doctors managed to stop the bleeding and stabilize her. However, she'd been disfigured so badly in the attack that Afghan authorities decided to fly her to Turkey for more specialized medical care. That's where surgeons used part of Sitara's forehead to construct a new nose, while taking tissue from her thigh to rebuild her upper lip. ""When I finally woke up and saw my face, I hated it. I hate it every day. It would be better to be injected with poison and die - that's how I feel,"" she says. ""When my children saw me after my face changed, they didn't believe I was their mother."" The Ministry of Women's Affairs in Afghanistan eventually relocated Sitara and her daughters to their current home -- an apartment they share with her mother and three brothers. It's cramped and basic, and they have few belongings, but they feel safe. Police have not caught Sitara's husband -- she believes he's fled into the mountains or crossed the border into Iran. Women for Afghan Women, an organization that supports victimized women, is hoping to send Sitara to the United States for reconstructive surgery but are yet to find a surgeon. ""I just want the surgery to happen soon. I don't want to stay like this,"" Sitara says. ""Will I have the same face as before? Some people tell me I will have a better face. But it's hard to believe that."" Daughter's hope . Sitara's little girls now seem oblivious to her deformities. They love their mother regardless of what she looks like -- though Somia, who witnessed the appalling attack and suffers nightmares most nights, says her mother is sad all the time. ""We just want our mother to get well and smile again. If she works we can go to school and I will become a doctor. Then I can help people like my mother."" According to a United Nations report published in December last year, Afghan authorities registered an increased number of reported acts of violence against women and girls in 2013 but prosecutions and convictions remain low. The report said the authorities showed a tendency towards mediation rather than applying criminal sanctions and legal protections for women, and this often fails to protect women from further violence.","23-year-old Sitara was sleeping when her husband attacked her, asking for money .

"(CNN) -- WhatsApp, the globally popular texting app that Facebook just acquired for a whopping $19 billion, is adding phone calls to its list of services. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum said the voice service will be free and begin rolling out to users within the next few months. Currently, WhatsApp offers unlimited text and voice-mail messages between users. Its service is free for the first year, then costs 99 cents annually. ""We want to make sure people always have the ability to stay in touch with their friends and loved ones really affordably,"" Koum said in a speech at Mobile World Congress. As reported by multiple news outlets, Koum also announced that WhatsApp now has 465 million monthly users and 330 million daily users. The latter is 15 million more than what was made public last week when Facebook announced the purchase. Voice service will come first to Apple devices and Google's Android operating system, with Windows phones and Blackberry to follow. The move puts WhatsApp in competition not only with other messaging apps that offer voice but chat tools such as Skype and even mobile carriers. WhatsApp's unlimited texting has already helped establish it in places where smartphones and fancy data plans are less common. It has 40 million users in India and another 38 million in Brazil, two countries highly coveted by tech companies such as Facebook for their large populations and emerging mobile customer base. WhatsApp hasn't released figures for the United States, where it is less popular. Last week, Facebook shocked the business world when it announced it was buying WhatsApp for up to $19 billion in cash and stock -- by far the social network's largest acquisition to date.","Facebook bought popular texting service WhatsApp last week .

"(CNN) -- Artist Rachel Sussman spent the past decade documenting the world's oldest living things. Working with biologists, she has traveled to deserts and islands, from the Australian Outback to Antarctica, to photograph organisms that are 2,000 years old or older. She has given a TED talk about her project. Her new book of photographs and essays, ""The Oldest Living Things in the World,"" came out on Earth Day, April 22. Follow her on Twitter: @OLTW . CNN asked Sussman about her work in an e-mail interview. How did you get involved with this project? Before I got the idea for ""The Oldest Living Things,"" I was searching for something I could really sink my teeth into. That search was both an intellectual one -- pondering ideas about combining art with science and philosophical concepts like deep time -- as well as a literal one. A visit to Japan in 2004 resulted in a surprising and eye-opening adventure to a supposedly 7,000-year-old tree, which ended up being the ultimate catalyst that brought all these different threads together. Environmentalism also plays a vital role in my work. The ancient survivors I've photographed have weathered thousands of years in some of the harshest environments on Earth, but are now threatened by the climate crisis. Of all the oldest living things that you came across, what moved you the most? It's hard for me to choose, but I was particularly moved by some of the most diminutive organisms. We expect to be awed by the grandeur of Giant Sequoias, and they are indeed moving. But it was the little beings -- the ones that you'd have no idea are old at all -- that I found to be the most compelling. Examples of this include the map lichens in Greenland that grow only 1 centimeter every 100 years, and the spruce tree on the cover of the book, which, despite its spindly appearance, has been growing clonally for 9,950 years. If there's one place in the world that one must see before one dies, where would it be? This is a tough question, as I think we should weigh the environmental impact of our travels against the potential for cultural and personal enrichment. Developing clean energy sources to get us to places should be a global priority. What that in mind, some of my travel experiences -- like visiting South Georgia Island in the Antarctic Convergence -- felt more like traveling back in time than visiting a remote location. It is stunning, and I'd love everyone to be able to see through that window back into deep time. However, some of the last pristine locations on Earth have only remained so because of lack of human contact. I urge everyone to travel responsibly, and remember the Girl Scout motto to always leave a place in better shape than when you found it! What are a few things that one can start doing today to become more environmentally conscious? My suggestion is to get involved with Al Gore's fantastic organization, the Climate Reality Project. Whether you spread some truth to the naysayers about climate change, reflect on the things you love that are made possible by a healthy climate, or choose to apply to become a member of the Climate Realty Leadership Corps, Climate Reality is building community and momentum around the global fight against the climate crisis. Who inspires you? In no particular order some of my favorite people are: David Foster Wallace, Werner Herzog, David Lynch, Ernest Shackleton, the women of art and science that history overlooked or forgot, risk-takers, climate crusaders, makers of eye-opening art, boundary breakers, fighters of injustices, and anyone forging a connection where one didn't previously exist. I believe everyone should follow and cultivate their curiosity -- because you never know where it will lead you. There is so much to see, know and do in the world, and I hope that we can all get out there -- in our own ways -- and do some good.","Artist Rachel Sussman's book, ""The Oldest Living Things,"" comes out on Earth Day .

"Washington (CNN) -- As Gov. Chris Christie continues to fend off accusations of corruption in New Jersey, another Republican with possible designs on the White House, Marco Rubio, spent last week 7,000 miles away from the controversy, burnishing his foreign policy resume with a three-country trip through Asia. The Florida senator made a busy, weeklong visit to the Philippines, Japan and South Korea -- a trip that brought him face to face with top officials from all three countries, the boxer Manny Pacquiao and a pair of DMZ-stationed North Korean soldiers, who took pictures of the man who one day may sit in the White House. The ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, Rubio was making his first jaunt to Asia, a region he called the next big flash point in global affairs. ""All of the emerging major issues of the 21st century over the next 50 years are going to be in Asia, given the population growth, and given the instability that you see in North Korea, given the rise of China,"" Rubio told CNN in a weekend phone interview from Seoul, South Korea. The three countries he visited ""want us here,"" Rubio said. ""And not just engaged militarily, but they want us engaged economically, culturally. They are comfortable with us. They've built these longstanding alliances that they want to build on and improve."" Rubio: Culture keeps U.S.-UK bond strong . Rubio affirmed the importance of America's economic and military interests in Asia and expressed support for the so-called ""rebalance"" -- the Obama administration's effort to re-engage with Asia by forging deeper alliances with friendly nations and pursuing a stable relationship with China. ""In fairness, I think they're doing a lot of the things we need to be doing,"" he said. But America's relationship with its allies in the region must evolve, he said, in the face of China's ever-growing economic might and the ""destabilizing"" threat of a volatile North Korea. ""Our military capacity here has to be adjusted to a new threat,"" Rubio said of the roughly 30,000 American military personnel stationed in South Korea. ""Much of our military standing here is still and was very largely based on the ability to slow down an invasion from the North long enough until reserves and supplements could get here,"" he said. ""And that still remains a threat to some extent. But the bigger threat now is that they've developed long-range missile capabilities, long-range artillery, anti-access, anti-ship weaponry, these are the sort of things. These are a different type of threat that now requires us to reposition a different kind of technology and capacity to the region."" Marco Rubio blasts Obama administration, pushes American leadership abroad . Rubio said simmering tensions between Japan and China, inflamed by recent Chinese efforts to expand its military influence in the East China Sea, are very real -- and shared by leaders in the Philippines. ""The takeaway, if you go to Japan or the Philippines, the takeaway is that China is trying to become dominant, that China is driving the U.S. out,"" Rubio said. ""All of this weighs heavily on the minds of nations in this region, particularly the Philippines and Japan. There is a growing insecurity about some of the claims that China is making with regards to what is in their territory."" The South Korean outlook on China is more nuanced, he said. South Korea's economy depends heavily on exports, and China is far and away the biggest market for its goods. The United States should have a similar approach to the Asian superpower, he said, as long as those economic interests are balanced with a robust military presence in the region to protect America's allies. ""I've never accepted the idea that we wanted to contain China,"" Rubio said. ""We welcome a China that's richer and more prosperous, because that's a potential trading partner, customers for our products and services. What we don't want to see is a China that uses its newfound power to dominate their neighbors."" Rubio was accompanied on his Pacific tour by two close aides from Washington: his chief of staff Cesar Conda, whose family hails from the Philippines, and his foreign policy adviser Jamie Fly, a veteran of George W. Bush's administration and the former executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative, a neoconservative think tank. His aides tweeted out a cascade of pictures of Rubio meeting with top elected and diplomatic officials, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe among them. Rubio also consulted with two officials whose fame extends far beyond political circles: Manny Pacquiao, a member of the Philippine Congress when he isn't wearing boxing gloves, and Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. ambassador to Japan. ""She's very highly regarded in Japan,"" he said of Kennedy. ""She seems to be enjoying the job tremendously. I've got nothing but positive reviews about her."" In a Friday speech to the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, Rubio said American engagement in Asia is crucial to U.S. national security and economic vitality. He chided, ever so gently, unnamed members of Congress who are ""increasingly skeptical about why America needs to remain so active in international affairs."" Asked if the comment was a reference to libertarian-leaning Republicans -- among them Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a potential rival for the 2016 GOP nomination -- Rubio said it was not. ""There's a general debate in our country,"" he said. ""It's understandable. Americans have gone through two bloody, costly, overseas engagements in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, one of which is still going on. Americans have paid a tremendous price to fight the war on terrorism, and it's understandable that they're weary of overseas engagements."" ""But so much of what is going on in our everyday lives is directly impacted by things that are happening halfway around the world,"" Rubio told CNN. ""And that even if we chose to ignore the world, the world's problems are not going to ignore us. So I think it's critically important that we continue to invest in foreign policy and foreign diplomacy and in military capacity, because they are as relevant today as they have ever been.""","Potential 2016 presidential contender Sen.

"Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda (CNN) -- They are the world's largest primates and yet the constant threat of poaching, deforestation and human diseases means that soon the world's mountain gorillas could be completely wiped out. Living in the dense forests of Central Africa -- in the Virunga Mountains spanning Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda -- the critically endangered gorillas face an uncertain future -- there are only 880 mountain gorillas left in the world, according to recent census data. On a mission to protect the primates from extinction is Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka, a leading Ugandan scientist and advocate for species conservation in Bwindi, a World Heritage Site and home to nearly half of the world's mountain gorilla population. One of Africa's premier conservationists, Kalema-Zikusoka has been working tirelessly for some two decades to create an environment where gorillas and people can coexist safely in an area with one of the highest rural human population densities in the continent. Can gorillas catch a cold? When Kalema-Zikusoka first started working in Bwindi back in 1994, gorilla tourism was in its infancy and starting to become a strong financial resource for the local economy. With mountain gorillas sharing over 98% of the same genetic material as humans, Kalema-Zikusoka decided to analyze how increased human interaction could affect the primates. ""I could see what tourism was doing for the gorillas -- both the good and the bad,"" she says. ""And of course I realized how the communities were benefiting a lot because they are really poor and the gorillas tourism is helping to lift them out of poverty,"" adds Kalema-Zikusoka. ""My research at the time was looking at the parasites in the gorilla dam and I found that those actually visited by tourists have a higher parasite load than those that were not,"" she explains. ""We can easily give them diseases and that's always a bad thing."" Fast forward two decades and the leading veterinarian is now the founder and CEO of non-profit group ""Conservation Through Public Health"" (CTPH), continuing her goals of protecting gorillas and other wildlife from disease. ""Our current research is focused on disease transmission between people and the gorillas,"" she says. ""We analyze fecal samples from gorillas regularly, like at least once a month from the habituated groups that we can get close enough to, to try and see if they are picking anything from the livestock or from the people who they interact with. ""And then if they are, then we advise Uganda Wildlife Authority and we sit down and decide what should we do about it."" Helping gorillas, helping humans . Kalema-Zikusoka says it is essential to educate the local communities surrounding the gorillas. ""We also have a parallel program ... where we improve the health of the community,"" she says. ""And so as we're improving the health of the community, we're also looking and saying how is the gorilla health improving."" The CTPH community programs aim to prevent infectious diseases like diarrhea, scabies and tuberculosis which could potentially be passed on to the gorilla population. ""We had a scabies gorilla [in] 1996 when I was the vet for Uganda Wildlife Authority and that was traced to people living around the park who have very little health care,"" explains Kalema-Zikusoka. ""That same gorilla group almost all died if we hadn't treated them. The infant gorilla died and the rest only recovered with treatment."" The power of ecotourism . As part of their efforts, the CTPH is now trying to raise funds to build a larger gorilla clinic, as well as a community education center. ""I really feel that everyone should come out and protect the gorillas,"" says Kalema-Zikusoka. ""Actually the community over here, they love the gorillas -- one is because of the economic benefit they get from them, but I think also they're really gentle giants."" Kalema-Zikusoka admits that gorilla tourism is a financial lifeline for locals -- each gorilla group brings a minimum of $1 million annually to the surrounding communities, in addition to providing employment in the tourism industry, says the scientist. ""It goes down to a certain balance between conservation and economics,"" she says. ""And that is why we try to make as far as ecotourism experience where you limit the number of people who visit the gorilla groups."" Through her continued advocacy and the continued endeavors of the international conservation community, recent figures indicate the mountain gorilla population is increasing. A 2012 census conducted by the Uganda Wildlife Authority identified 400 mountain gorillas now living in Bwindi National Park bringing the overall population estimate up to 880, up from 786 estimated in 2010. ""There's so few of them remaining [so] we are pleased that the numbers are beginning to grow,"" says Kalema-Zikusoka. ""Bwindi is actually a World Heritage Site and we have to do as much as we can to protect them."" READ THIS: Trekking into the mountain gorilla's domain .

"(CNN) -- Nightlife-driven souls looking for Floridian action point their convertibles toward the likes of Fort Lauderdale and Key West. But a certain quieter, off-the-radar destination on the state's Gulf Coast holds a different kind of allure. The cult-fave town of Boca Grande is a throwback, an Old Florida time warp that defies the clichÃ©s of Florida beach towns -- all the sloppy, party-hearty aspects -- while embodying the best of what the state has to offer. In the free and easy days of summer, the quest for a great American beach town like Boca Grande is a national passion. Beach towns are a mainstay of the hot months, a beacon for countless citizens looking for a reprieve from the daily grind. The Great American Beach Town, apart from being idle as all get out, is also resolutely democratic, conscious that the sand belongs to all. These spots serve as emblems of our God-given right to get too much sun and to eat tasty -- if nutritionally unfortunate -- fried food. So get that beach chair and cooler ready -- and prepare for the simple pleasures of summer at one of these classic retreats. Sunset Beach, Hawaii . Sunset Beach is the world capital of surfing. But in summer, all the wave-riding frenzy ebbs, and this town on the North Shore of Oahu becomes resolutely and wonderfully idle. Stay: The oceanfront Ke Iki Beach Bungalows, a quick drive from the commercial district along the Kamehameha Highway, are all about easy atmosphere and the sounds of the North Shore's endless surf. Eat: Ted's Bakery, down the road from the mythical Pipeline, is a casual center of surfer life known for bento-box lunches, garlic shrimp, and mahi mahi sandwiches. Finish it off with a slice of decadent Haupia chocolate pie. See more of America's best little beach towns . Chincoteague, Virginia . This small, serene island just off the Virginia coast is the gateway to the 37-mile-long Assateague Island National Seashore -- a nature refuge that's home to wild ponies, herons, woodpeckers, and foxes. It's accessible to boaters and via car over the Route 175 bridge. Stay: A Victorian-era home has been turned into Miss Molly's Inn, a seven-room B&B that offers high tea in the afternoons. Eat: The Chincoteague Diner is a welcome destination after a long day on the beach. Fill up on baskets of fried seafood (flounder, scallops, shrimp) or barbequed baby back ribs. Boca Grande, Florida . This Edenic escape on the Gulf of Mexico is a real slice of Old Florida, with a much-photographed lighthouse watching over Gasparilla Island State Park, tree-lined streets without traffic lights, and long, quiet beaches touched by gentle surf. Stay: The Gasparilla Inn, a member of the Historic Hotels of America and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, is the classic resort and comes complete with a golf course. It's closed during the hottest months, though; the best alternative is its sister property, the Innlet, which features a waterside restaurant and a relaxed vibe. Eat: A funky Florida spot with character, Temptation -- think murals of leaping tarpon and a neon martini sign -- serves local grouper, pompano, and soft-shell crabs. Lubec, Maine . Lubec is all the way Down East, right near the border with New Brunswick, Canada. Its assets include an elegant Victorian/Greek Revival -- style downtown, 97 miles of shoreline, two lighthouses, and easy access to the former Roosevelt summer home on Campobello Island, which is now an international park. Stay: The Peacock House Bed & Breakfast, installed in an 1860 Federal-style residence, has ocean views, an eclectic library and manicured gardens. Eat: Stop by the Water Street Tavern for hearty bowls of haddock chowder, lobster ""mac n cheese,"" and views of the bay islands. Travel + Leisure: Ten best shelling beaches . Gearhart, Oregon . With its antiques shops and picturesque hiking trails, Gearhart -- just north of the renowned, more-bustling Cannon Beach -- is an in-the-know haven for Portland hipsters like Paige Powell and Gus Van Sant. In the evenings, people drive onto the hard-packed sand for wine and stargazing parties. Stay: The 12 attached cottages of the Gearhart Ocean Inn, constructed in 1941, are an easy walk to the beach and the owners will furnish a ""clam gun"" for scooping up clams from the sand. Eat: The nicely refined Pacific Way Bakery & CafÃ© serves top-notch muffins and coffee in the morning, and later a menu that includes bay shrimp, designer pizzas and flawless crab cakes. Santa Cruz, California . Thrill-seekers flock to the Giant Dipper roller coaster at the Beach Boardwalk amusement park, but Santa Cruz has a surfeit of other attractions: Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, surfers at Pleasure Point (and the Santa Cruz Surfing Museum) and frolicsome seals at Natural Bridges State Beach. Stay: At the Casablanca Inn, most rooms have ocean views (and a handful have fireplaces, for when those NoCal nights get chilly). The restaurant looks out on the awesome expanse of the Pacific. Eat: Center Street Grill is the go-to restaurant for salads, pastas, homemade hollandaise sauce, ahi tuna and freshly squeezed lemonade and orange juice on the outdoor patio. Travel + Leisure: Best affordable beach resorts . Rehoboth, Delaware . An all-American classic -- saltwater taffy and ice cream on the boardwalk, days of baking in the sun on Dewey Beach -- with a lively art gallery scene and such august institutions as the Biggs Museum of American Art within an hour's drive. In the evenings, visitors dance at places like the Rusty Rudder or Shag, or just stroll the boardwalk. Stay: The Hotel Rehoboth, a plush boutique lodging, has a welcoming fireplace and a mod cottage-furnishings store off the lobby. Eat: Eden, a high-end restaurant that often lives up to its name, features such dishes as a lobster and crab tower and a coffee-hazelnut rubbed pork tenderloin. Silver Lake Sand Dunes Area, Michigan . A beach staple of the Midwest, this strip along Lake Michigan -- encompassing the towns of Hart, Mears, and Pentwater -- has no shortage of massive sand dunes, beach buggies, and farmers' markets along with over-the-top July 4th fireworks. Stay: A simple affair overlooking the lake and a spread of sand, Dunes Waterfront Resort is not a bad way to get lost on a summer weekend. Eat: That Place Restaurant, a 1950s and '60s theme joint with posters of James Dean and Elvis, is, well, the place to get a hamburger and shake. Rockport, Texas . This is nature Texas-style, big and ready to roll, with an enormous flock of whooping cranes in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, stunning beaches along nearby Matagorda Island and a 1,000-year-old oak known simply as ""the Big Tree."" Stay: A funky little place with classic beach lodgings, the Fulton Beach Bungalows overlook Aransas Bay. Eat: Steve Lew's BBQ Kitchen will take you way down home, with pulled pork and Texas-style sausage. Gulf Shores, Alabama . Gulf Shores is near miles of splendid beaches along Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge and is a mainstay of the American seafood industry. Apart from the National Shrimp Festival every fall, the beaches are known for the strange occurrence of ""jubilees,"" random nights when crabs, fish and shrimp flop up on the beach and make for easy pickings. Stay: Magnolia Springs Bed and Breakfast is a charmer with stained glass in the den, elaborate woodwork in the great hall and hearty three-course breakfasts. Eat: Set in a circa 1897 building surrounded by Spanish moss and live oak trees, the Wash House Restaurant serves fried oyster lettuce wraps and beef spring rolls. Travel + Leisure: Best secret beaches on earth . Avila Beach, California . If the days seem brighter in this Central Coast town, just north of Pismo Beach -- well, they are. Avila's bay location gives it less fog than its neighboring towns, making it all the better for strolling its boardwalk pier and taking a dip in the waters. You're also a short hop from Paso Robles and wine country. Stay: The nautical-theme Avila Beach Lighthouse Suites may not be old -- the whole pier area was rebuilt after an oil spill in the 1990s -- but it's old-school, with Ping-Pong, putting greens, and a life-size chessboard. Eat: Start your day with churro-style French toast or the Machaca -- eggs with beef barbacoa, queso fresco, beans, and hash browns -- at the local favorite, the Old Custom House.

"(CNN) -- The family of the FedEx worker who police say went on a shooting rampage at his suburban Atlanta workplace before committing suicide has offered its ""deepest sympathies and condolences"" to the victims. Police said Geddy L. Kramer, 19, wounded six people at a FedEx package and delivery facility in Kennesaw, Georgia, on Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself. ""First and foremost, our family would like to express our deepest sympathies and condolences to the victims of ... (the) tragedy and their families,"" Geddy's family wrote in a statement released Tuesday by police in nearby Acworth, where Kramer lived. ""Our prayers are for their complete and speedy recovery. ""Our thoughts are also with all the workers at FedEx who were affected by Geddy's actions. We make no excuses for his actions and are shocked and devastated by them. There really are no adequate words at a time like this. Our family would appreciate our privacy at this very difficult time."" Police said they were alerted to the shooting at the 500,000-square-foot facility at 5:54 a.m. Tuesday. The six wounded workers were taken to a hospital, where one of them, a 28-year-old man, was in critical condition Tuesday evening, the hospital said. Three other patients -- a 52-year-old woman, a 22-year-old man and a 38-year-old man -- were listed in stable condition Tuesday evening.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy said Iran's threat to block the strategically and economically important Strait of Hormuz is unacceptable. ""The free flow of goods and services through the Strait of Hormuz is vital to regional and global prosperity,"" Navy 5th Fleet in Bahrain spokeswoman Cmdr. Amy Derrick Frost told reporters on Wednesday. ""Anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated."" The 34-mile-wide shipping channel leads in and out of the Persian Gulf between Iran and Oman. It is strategically important because tankers carrying oil travel through it. Iran's vice president has warned that the country could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. France, Britain and Germany have proposed sanctions to punish Iran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. Physically closing the strait would require means that likely are not available to Iran, said Professor Jean-Paul Rodrigue of Hofstra University. ""At best, Iran can posture and potentially disrupt traffic for a short duration,"" said Rodrigue, who specializes in global trade and maritime transportation issues. The 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain, and Frost noted that the Navy ""maintains a robust presence in the region to deter or counter destabilizing activities."" ""We conduct maritime security operations under international maritime conventions to ensure security and safety in international waters for all commercial shipping to operate freely while transiting the region,"" she said. Asked whether the fleet would be able to keep the strait open if Iran moved to close it, she said, ""The U.S. Navy is a flexible, multi-capable force committed to regional security and stability, always ready to counter malevolent actions to ensure freedom of navigation."" Frost was also asked whether keeping the strait open is part of the fleet's mandate. She said it is ""committed to protecting maritime freedoms that are the basis for global prosperity. This is one of the main reasons our military forces operate in the region. ""The U.S. Navy, along with our coalition and regional partners, operates under international maritime conventions to maintain a constant state of high vigilance in order to ensure the continued, safe flow of maritime traffic in waterways critical to global commerce."" The French Foreign Ministry stressed that the waterway is an international strait. ""In consequence, all ships, whatever their flag, enjoy the right of passage in transit, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted in 1982, and with the customary international maritime law,"" the ministry said. Iran is holding a 10-day military exercise in an area from the eastern part of the strait out into the Arabian Sea. Western diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of Iran's volatile behavior. Rodrigue told CNN that any move by Iran to close the strait would be ""suicidal"" to the current regime. In 2009, 15 million barrels passed through the strait every day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. ""Keep in mind that countries such as China and Japan are more dependent on Persian Gulf oil than the United States,"" the professor said. About 18% of U.S. net petroleum imports come from the Persian Gulf region, while Canada provides 25%, according to Rodrigue. The scholar, who has written extensively about oil ""chokepoints,"" said there are no other means to move large quantities of oil over long distance than by maritime transportation. Hormuz marks the boundary between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. ""It is thus an international issue where the United States, for strategic and historical reasons, is spearheading its security,"" Rodrigue said. Barbara Starr is CNN Pentagon correspondent.","NEW: China, Japan depend heavily on oil from region, expert says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber's recent arrests and alleged pot-smoking antics on an airplane raise the question: Who's in charge? Can parents stand a chance of keeping their kid in line if he's a highly paid teen celebrity? CNN interviewed two celebrity parents and two professionals who help young stars after they crash about why parenthood is perhaps the toughest role in Hollywood. They point to predators, parasites and parents who don't act like parents as culprits. Parents can't be pals . Justin Bieber and his dad seem to be best buddies. They even have matching tattoos. Jeremy Bieber, 38, was with his son during several of the incidents that have brought him legal trouble in the past weeks. Father and son were partying together in Miami Beach, Florida, before the younger Bieber, 19, was arrested on a drunken driving charge. The elder Bieber was with his son the night he allegedly assaulted a Toronto limousine driver. A U.S. Customs report said Jeremy and Justin Bieber were both flying on a chartered jet when the pilots had to put on oxygen masks after marijuana smoke filled the cabin. ""You have the parents acting as a child with them,"" said Dr. Damon Raskin, a former child actor who helps celebrities detox in rehab. ""This enables their addictions and contributes to their spiral downward, as with Justin Bieber and Lindsay Lohan."" Lindsay Lohan's father, who runs an addiction treatment facility in Florida, said he would never party with his daughter. Michael Lohan has been publicly critical of his ex-wife for doing that. ""You can't socialize with your kids,"" Michael Lohan said. ""You can't attend events and party with them."" Lohan missed out on some of his daughter's childhood when he served prison time in connection with a Wall Street insider trading investigation. He also had his own substance abuse issues, which were addressed in rehab. The parent of another successful young actress -- who at age 20 has never been in trouble -- replied ""Oh, hell no!"" when asked if she would ever party with her daughter. ""You can't party with your kid,"" she said. ""You have to keep your position as a parent."" She asked to remain anonymous so as not to embarrass her daughter. Richard Taite is the founder and CEO of Cliffside Malibu, the rehab facility where Lindsay Lohan was treated last year. He cites a ""truism that never changes."" ""When parents raise their children with a healthy boundary and recognize that they are not to be this child's friend, but to be their parent, what happens is, these children grow up to be well-adjusted,"" Taite said. ""We look at them as stars, but the reality is they are still children, and children crave boundaries. If you're going to be their friend primarily, and you just happen to be a parent, then don't be shocked when your children grow up with social adjustment issues."" Unnatural role reversal . Parents of a young star often leave their own jobs to travel with their children as they make movies or perform on concert tours. ""The parent can no longer work because they run around with them, and sometimes the kids realize that and it's unnatural,"" the previously quoted mother said. ""They let the kid turn wild because they feel guilty, because they are not working."" A mother is needed to do things the manager or agent won't do, such as helping them study scripts and run lines with them between scenes, she said. ""No agent does that."" But even if parents keep their own careers, their child's income can far exceed their own. This role reversal can leave a parent powerless to enforce rules. ""It's hard for the parent to have control when the kid knows they're making more money than them,"" she said. ""If he wants to go to a party, he's going to use that."" This mother shared the story of another parent who put her foot down when her 16-year-old actress daughter refused to clean up her bedroom. The teen suggested the maid could do it. The mom called the producer of her hit TV series and told him the actress would not be showing that day until she cleaned her room. The producer agreed to shoot around the young actress that day. The daughter cleaned the room after that, she said. It's a move many parents are afraid of making, out of fear it could cost their child work in the future. ""Parents afraid to upset the system,"" the mother said. No one to say 'No' ""These kids need structure,"" Raskin said. ""They need boundaries. They need to be told 'no'. Sometimes the parents are missing, emotionally abandoning them, being too involved in their own lives. There is no one to say 'no' if your parent can't say 'no' to you."" Justin Bieber needs ""someone who is willing to piss him off,"" the actress's mother said. ""A good parent has to do that."" It's something she does regularly with her daughter, even though she's now legally an adult. ""It's no secret -- we battle,"" she said. Michael Lohan said it is ""important to steer them into the right direction"" about who they should associate with, but it is ""hard to control that."" It's the ""parasites that come around them"" at night that cause problems, he said. Another problem is that the bodyguards -- who are suppose to protect them -- party with them and help to cover it up, Lohan said. Momagers and predators . When a performer turns 18 in California, he or she is handed the checkbook to the trust fund where 15% of their earnings have been deposited under the state's ""Coogan Act."" The law was written to protect them from the fate of Jackie Coogan, who made a fortune as a child actor in silent films, but his parents spent the money before he became an adult. These 18-year-olds are also given the freedom make their own business decisions. It's almost a ritual for managers, agents, lawyers and publicists to approach them with the advice that they ditch their parents as advisers, the actress's mother said. ""When they are almost 18, they have secret lunches and they tell your kids 'You need to leave your parents,'"" she said. ""The parents have no power then."" Her own daughter only told her a year later that her manager ""took her to lunch and said she needed to get away from mom,"" she said. ""The agents turned because I was putting pressure on them, because they didn't have a plan for her at 17 and 18,"" the mother said. ""When you make them do their job, then you become the enemy."" Michael Lohan told a similar story about his daughter when she was almost 18 and making the movie ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen."" Justin's mom: 'He's just Justin to me' Justin Bieber's mother Pattie Mallette told CNN's Anderson Cooper in a 2012 interview that she ""didn't want him even to know it was an option"" to be in the entertainment industry. However, it was his mother who first put his videos on YouTube, which led to his discovery by manager Scooter Braun. She moved with him from Canada to Atlanta where Braun launched Bieber's remarkable career. ""Parenting him is, I think, like anybody parenting a child,"" Mallette told HLN a year ago. ""We just have a different set of circumstances. It doesn't affect me at all. His lifestyle has different circumstances that we have to work around, but he's just Justin to me."" Mallette told USAToday that she's always been protective of her son. ""You hear all the horror stories about kids and teenagers in this industry, and I didn't want to throw my son to the wolves. I've done my best to protect him and surround him with good people."" Michelle Obama: 'I'd pull him close' First lady Michelle Obama, mother of two girls, was asked by Univision Radio host Enrique Santos on Friday what she would do if Justin Bieber was her son. ""I'd pull him close,"" Obama said. ""I don't know if it would be advice as much as action. I would be very present in his life right now and I would be probably with him a good chunk of the time, just there to talk, to figure out what's going on in his head, to figure out who's in his life and who's not."" Her daughters ""just want me near, they want that advice from a parent,"" she said. ""They want to see you on a daily basis."" Taite's suggestion for Justin Bieber does not involve his parents. He should have a talk with the Justin Bieber of 15 years from now. ""What he has to do is have a moment of truth and sit down and recognize that his 35-year-old self would be bitch-slapping him right now,"" the rehab owner said. Bieber also should find ""the best, top notch therapist he humanely, possibly can in the industry, who is desensitized to who he is,"" Taite said.","Predators, parasites and parents who don't act like parents are culprits .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The death toll from the South Korean ferry capsizing has gone up to 275, with dozens more still missing, the nation's officials said Saturday. ""The two additional male bodies were retrieved overnight,"" the Government Rescue Headquarters said. It said 29 people are listed as missing. Most of the dead and missing are students, all from the same high school, who were taking the ferry to the resort island of Jeju for a field trip. It capsized on April 16. Divers are still searching the submerged vessel for the missing people, braving frigid waters, strong currents and corridors clogged with debris. Last week, one of the divers died while working to recover bodies. South Korean authorities cracked down on the company that operated the Sewol passenger ferry following the disaster that shocked the nation. The chief executive of ferry operator, Cheonghaejin Marine Co., was arrested Thursday and is facing charges including causing death by negligence, said Yang Joong-jin, a senior prosecutor in the investigation. The government is also taking steps to revoke the company's business licenses, the the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said. The planned measures are aimed at taking away the licenses of the company for all its routes, including the one on which the Sewol passenger ferry sank. The stunning loss of life has shaken South Korea, raising troubling questions about safety standards and government oversight of businesses. President Park Geun-hye has apologized over the government's handling of the disaster and pledged to overhaul safety systems.","Most of the dead and missing are students .

"(CNN) -- Seth Meyers had big shoes to fill on Monday night. Meyers took over the ""Late Night"" chair from former ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Jimmy Fallon, who arguably had a great run as that show's host as he crafted now-pop culture favorites like ""Slow-jamming the News"" and ""The History of Rap."" So how did Meyers do with his debut? The reviews are in, and they range from ""meh"" to middling. The Daily Beast, which thought Meyers got ""off to a rocky start on 'Late Night,'"" noted that the newcomer ""had a few missions to accomplish when we ran into him on Monday night."" From 'Saturday Night' to 'Late Night' ""He had to prove that Fallon's reign isn't a fluke, that late night really can be a home for the affable and good-natured,"" the Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon wrote. ""And, most importantly, he had to show that the acute and observant brand of humor he displayed for 12 and a half years on 'Saturday Night Live,' many of those years spent as head writer and host of 'Weekend Update,' translates to the late-night talk show format."" Fallon (we are assuming no relation to Jimmy) said it was ""mission only sort of accomplished."" Jimmy Fallon's debut on ""The Tonight Show"" last week was as big as his personality. It featured a performance by the band U2 and plenty of laughs with guest Will Smith and some of Fallon's famous friends, including Stephen Colbert and Tina Fey. Meyers also got a little help from his friend Amy Poehler, who was one of his first guests along with Vice President Joe Biden. Poehler, and Meyer's former ""SNL"" castmate, Fred Armisen was also part of the show as the leader of ""Late Night's"" band. Meyers even paid homage to Fallon in the form of a letter he wrote to his predecessor, and which he read during the opening of the show.

""But I laughed more at Seth Meyers than I did at Jimmy Fallon.""

Others, too, seem willing to give Meyers some time to find his footing. Michael Starr of the New York Post wrote that Meyers ""eventually found his sea legs and drove his new 12:35 p.m. show to a solid, if unspectacular, debut. ... He's charming with a certain 'aw shucks' demeanor that doesn't seem forced or contrived, and he'll have plenty of time to grow into his new role as a late-night host,"" Starr said.","Seth Meyers took over from Jimmy Fallon on ""Late Night""

"(CNN) -- When it comes to hotel pools, the indoor variety has long played second fiddle to their outdoor -- often rooftop -- counterparts. But these days, striking décor, luxury amenities and stunning settings mean many indoor swimming holes can now challenge even the most glamorous of outdoor pools. And with seasons in tumultuous transition, indoor pools, which are not prey to weather, offer a little bit of an edge. So go ahead and take a dip at these eight luxurious indoor pools. The Water Club at Borgata, Atlantic City . This nongaming hotel, which is part of the large Borgata complex in Atlantic City, has three indoor pools (and two more outdoors) so there's really no reason for things to get crowded at any of them. A two-lane lap pool is in the two-floor Immersion spa on the 32nd floor and is set against full-length windows that look out to the Atlantic Ocean, the perfect setup for a water workout. A stunning top-floor pool surrounded by lounge chairs, cabanas and lush foliage telegraphs a more exotic tropical scene than the property's Jersey Shore location. Rooms from $149/night. www.theborgata.com . And the world's greatest beach is ... Shangri-La Paris . Tucked inside what used to be Napoleon's grandnephew Roland Bonaparte's Parisian home, the 15-by-6-meter, light-bathed pool area (which was previously Bonaparte's stables) extends out to an expansive, plant-lined terrace. All around the pool, which features mosaic tiles inspired to look like Asian carpet, are chic traditional French touches like floral bas relief on the walls and columns surrounding the mezzanine. Rooms from $895/night. www.shangri-la.com . Altira Macau . On the 16th floor of the tallest building on the island of Taipa is the glamorous indoor infinity pool of the impressively massive gaming complex of Altira Macau. It's easy to see why Forbes once named it one of the best hotel pools in the world: One side faces all of the city with crystal-clear floor-to-ceiling windows. Rooms from $235/night. www.altiramacau.com . Hot spots in the world's happiest countries . W Verbier, Switzerland . W's first ski property is in the heart of the Swiss Alps in the tony town of Verbier. The pool's interior vibe is totally in tune with W's urban aesthetic, with tons of black and leather furnishing that would be right at home at any fabulous pool party. From every corner of the pool, you can look out into the Alps, but if you want a closer vantage point, just swim out into the outdoor area -- the pool is heated -- and breathe in the Alpine air. Rooms from about $1,000/night, double occupancy. www.wverbier.com . Tambo del Inka, Peru . Tambo del Inka's wellness space's mostly wood, stone and glass construction perfectly marries the property to its natural surroundings in Peru's Sacred Valley. This synergy was the focus of the designers, who used a lot of the local shihuahuaco wood, which grows in the Peruvian rainforest. From the heated pool, you can get glorious views of the Andes, and like W Verbier's setup, you can swim under the partial wall to go from indoor to outdoor. From $455/night. www.libertador.com.pe/en/ . Fairmont Le Château Montebello, Quebec . Built in 1930 for the exclusive private Seigniory Club (which counts international politicians and business tycoons as its members), Le Château Montebello's 75-foot-long pool has a real masculine feel, especially because of its log-architecture foundation. The coffered ceiling here adds visual depth to the overall rustic vibe with just a touch of whimsy: The handpainted wooden ceiling is treated to a motif of sea horses and scorpions. The pool has a diving tower, the surrounding area of which has water depth of 12 feet. Rooms from about $175/night. www.fairmont.com . The Charles Hotel, Munich . One of the largest pools in Munich, at The Charles Hotel, is also one of the most beautiful. The entire spa is outfitted with marble mosaic tiles, mostly in subdued colors punctuated with red flourishes. At the pool itself, a very pretty mosaic of red coral pays homage to 19th century Bavarian royalty, the Wittelsbach family, known for its collection of red coral paraphernalia, from dining cups to jewelry. Rooms from $375/night. www.roccofortehotels.com . Waldorf Astoria Chicago . The spa at this hotel is done mostly in a stark white, which only further emphasizes the gorgeous rose-design tile-work at the bottom of the pool, giving bathers the feel of swimming over a bed of roses. The 102,600 individually patterned tiles come from Bisazza, an Italian company renowned for its mosaic tile production. Rooms from $345/night. www.waldorfastoriachicagohotel.com .","The Water Club at Borgata in Atlantic City has three indoor pools .

"(CNN) -- If anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Clayton Lockett. He committed a series of vile acts that we as a civilization would condemn under any circumstances. In August 2000, a jury in Oklahoma found Lockett guilty of first-degree murder, rape, forcible oral sodomy, kidnapping and a bevy of other charges -- 19 in all. They stemmed from a robbery-gone-wrong in which victims were tied up at gunpoint; one young woman was raped multiple times, and another, who had just graduated from high school, was shot and buried alive in a ditch. On Tuesday night, Lockett was scheduled to die by lethal injection -- the preferred means for executing criminals in states that allow for the death penalty. During lethal injections, subjects are given a chemical cocktail designed to put them to sleep, render paralysis and then stop the heart. One problem for death-penalty states, such as my state of Florida, is the chemicals used for lethal injection are hard to come by, partly because some companies who produce the chemicals refuse to sell them for the purposes of executions. So in the case of Lockett, the state of Oklahoma tested a new combination of chemicals. Instead of putting Lockett to sleep and stopping his heart, the administration of the lethal injection caused his vein to burst, and about 45 minutes later, he died of a heart attack. It's been dubbed a ""botched execution,"" and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin stayed another execution scheduled for Tuesday evening pending an investigation. This is an absurd problem for states to wrestle with -- this notion of how to kill someone properly. Like I said, if anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Lockett, but the real debate is whether we need to be in the business of trying to find the least cruel and least unusual way to kill anyone voluntarily. It seems clear that the death penalty is a 19th-century relic, and our ridiculous struggle to figure out how to do it properly in the 21st century is a signal that perhaps we should join the rest of the civilized Western world in abolishing executions. Even Russia hasn't had an execution since 1999, and I wouldn't exactly call Vladimir Putin soft on crime. But please understand that I am not some left-wing, dyed-in-the-wool liberal who simply believes all criminal behavior is the fault of a system that fosters deviance. Not at all. I believe that if you take somebody's life with premeditation, and if a jury, after hearing all of the evidence properly presented by competent counsel, finds you guilty, then you should die -- but in prison, at the end of a life sentence. My objection to the death penalty is pragmatic. It's ineffective as a deterrent, and it is an extraordinary burden on our justice system. For a punishment to offer an effective deterrence, it has to be applied swiftly to maintain the logical cause and effect relationship with the crime, that this is a consequence. But we simply cannot, and should not, act quickly. The extended period required to ensure that the death penalty is appropriate -- that all options and appeals have been exhausted before resorting to the ultimate punishment -- is an essential safeguard in a civilized society. In Lockett's case, this process took nearly 14 years. Even with this long process of appeals, our system is far from perfect. Innocence projects around the country have saved 144 death-row inmates since 1973 by presenting new evidence that has proven them not guilty. Think of how many innocent people we have executed, when the number should be zero. We should all be shocked and appalled. Since we know innocent people sometimes get convicted based upon bad identification, faulty witnesses, improper police activities and incompetent counsel, can't we at least agree to avoid killing somebody when we know we have an imperfect system? And the burden of the appeals process on the criminal justice system is huge. A recent report from Amnesty International shows the average cost to carry a death penalty case from prosecution to execution is three to 10 times more than a case with a life sentence. Very often, a life sentence costs the state less than $1 million. Some death penalty cases have cost more than $10 million. The excruciatingly long, and necessary, appeals process in death penalty cases cost taxpayers millions for each case, and it draws resources away from other important prosecutions. Is it worth the price? It would be worth the price, if that was what it took to get justice. But is the death penalty justice? Or is it retribution? Often in a death penalty case, members of the victim's family are the strongest advocates for a death sentence. They say they want justice for their slain loved one, but what they often truly want is retribution. This is both understandable and acceptable. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. But it's never that simple. I've tried death penalty cases, and I've been lucky: None of my clients has ever been sent to death row. But I know many good lawyers who haven't been so lucky. You may be surprised to know that in many death penalty cases, which last for years, defense lawyers get to know victims' families. The families of homicide victims, after an execution, often don't feel the long sought-after sense of relief they expected. Often, they are left, instead, with unresolved emptiness. Two lives are lost when a murder is committed, and two families are irrevocably altered. We should feel the pain as well, and spend more time, effort and money on those who are affected. We should not spend ever-dwindling resources figuring out ways to kill. The death penalty is flawed in every conceivable way, and it should be abolished.","Mark O'Mara acknowledges if anyone deserved death penalty, Clayton Lockett did .

"(CNN) -- Threatening an airline on Twitter is a terrible idea. An airline such as American Airlines -- which was attacked by terrorists on September 11, 2001, and lost two planes filled with passengers and crew -- is likely to take your public threats seriously. It might even get you arrested, as was the case of the 14-year-old Dutch girl who recently wrote, ""@AmericanAir hello my name's Ibrahim and I'm from Afghanistan. I'm part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I'm gonna do something really big bye."" (The teen was arrested Monday afternoon.) Teen arrested for tweeting airline terror threat . Foolishness -- at home or abroad -- rarely yields great results. So please stop doing stupid stuff while traveling. Just stop it. You're making the rest of us polite, culture-seeking, nature-loving and happy-to-practice-our-Spanish (or French or Arabic) tourists look bad. And you could end up in jail. Here are a few stupid examples of things you shouldn't do: . Don't knock over ancient rocks. Never mind that the Boy Scout leaders who knocked over rocks dating back millions of years in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park should have known better. Our nation's national and state parks are not anyone's private playground. Please respect them and leave the ancient wonders intact for everyone to enjoy. (In March, Utah resident Glenn Taylor pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and another Utah man, David Hall, pleaded guilty to attempted criminal mischief. Both men received a year of probation and fines.) Don't parade around naked in inappropriate places. Peruvian officials are getting annoyed by naked tourists converging on Machu Picchu. ""There are places in the world that people can get naked, but not all places are (appropriate) for getting undressed,"" Alfredo Mormontoy Atayupanqui, director of archaeological resources for Peru's Ministry of Culture, told CNN. Perhaps a 15th century Inca treasure and World Heritage Site isn't one of those places. Park rules printed on the back of your admission ticket warn against being nude in public, Mormontoy says. Security around the site is being increased, and we have the naked visitors to thank for it. Please don't disrobe, unless it's allowed by local custom! (See Nice, France, for topless beaches.) Don't write on sacred monuments. Not all of the badly behaving travelers are Americans. Last year, a 15-year-old Chinese tourist defaced a stone sculpture in the 3,500-year-old Luxor Temple with graffiti. The teen carved ""Ding Jinhao was here"" in Chinese on a sculpture. The graffiti was photographed by another Chinese tourist and posted online. When his graffiti went viral, and he was tracked down, his parents apologized in a China Daily report, promising they were taking responsibility for what their son had done. Don't climb them either. Visitors to the pyramids at Giza, Egypt, aren't supposed to climb them. Russian photographer Vadim Makhorov and a group of his friends, in search of glorious photos, apparently didn't think the rules applied to them. While Makhorov apologized for climbing the pyramids,he's made a habit of climbing tall structures. He's since scaled the world's second-tallest building, the unfinished Shanghai Tower in China. Don't pack guns in your carry on. If you've got one, remember to ask yourself: ""Where's my gun?"" Some people actually forget where their guns are located until the Transportation Security Administration finds them. The TSA confiscated 1,813 guns at the airport last year, and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport came in first place with 111 guns seized. If you meant to have your gun in your carry-on bag, know there are legal ways to transport weapons -- but not the way you did it. Many hunters do it properly all the time, and TSA and U.S. Customs officials know how to clear your weapons safely. Have you ever witnessed fellow travelers making really horrendous mistakes while traveling? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below.","Teen arrested for sending out al Qaeda-like tweet threat to American Airlines .

"(CNN) -- As new celebrities line up to buy the Los Angeles Clippers, a group of NBA owners will meet by conference call Thursday to talk about what happens next in the uproar surrounding team owner, Donald Sterling. The 10-member NBA owners' advisory and finance committee may discuss this question: What will happen if Sterling refuses a league directive to sell the Clippers? Sterling's not saying what he'll do next, but he's known for being litigious. Calls to his lawyer were not returned. If he does sell, the billionaire could become richer. The team he bought in 1981 for $12 million is now valued at about $575 million, according to Forbes. CNN's Rachel Nichols said the selling price could hit $1 billion. The uproar over Sterling has overshadowed the NBA playoffs -- you know, the actual games. The Clippers will play in the NBA playoffs Thursday night against the Golden State Warriors. If the Clippers win, they'll move into the next round of the playoffs. Sterling, an 80-year-old lawyer, real estate developer and entrepreneur, won't be there. On Tuesday, the NBA banned him from the league for life because of racist remarks made during conversations with a young female companion, V Stiviano. The remarks were released on the websites TMZ and Deadspin last weekend. Specifically, on the audio, Sterling complains that Stiviano posted Instagram photos of herself with black men, including former NBA superstar Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. Now, in a bit of turnabout, Johnson has emerged as a potential buyer for the Clippers. Another rumored contender is a partnership between Oprah Winfrey, music-film magnate David Geffen and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. Others who have expressed interest include boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., ranked by Forbes as one of the highest-paid athletes in the world; former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya; rapper-producer-entrepreneurs Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and Dr. Dre; rapper Rick Ross; Rick Caruso, real estate developer and Los Angeles civic leader; and actors Matt Damon, Whoppi Goldberg and Frankie Muniz. Sterling could be forced to sell his team if three-quarters of the owners of the 30 NBA teams agree, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. He'd like the issue to come before the owners ""immediately"" but didn't lay down a timetable. Sterling could take the league to court. He's sued the NBA before and prevailed. When he abruptly moved the team from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984 without league permission, the NBA fined him $25 million, but Sterling countersued. The penalty was sharply reduced and he got to keep the Clippers in Los Angeles. He's also fought a number of housing discrimination lawsuits filed against him. Does a lawsuit have a chance? All the NBA owners signed a waiver saying they would not sue the NBA, sports lawyer Jeffrey Kessler said on CNN's The Lead, but that may not stop Sterling. ""He might make an argument that if he has an antitrust claim that waiver would not apply,"" Kessler said. To make that claim, he'd have to show that something in the process was not competitive, Kessler said. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the odds of Sterling winning a case ""seem basically zero."" CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this article.","NBA advisory and finance committee meets Thursday .

"(CNN) -- In her new book ""10-10-10,"" Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years. Suzy Welch, right, developed a decision-making process before marrying former GE CEO Jack Welch. The business writer, whose work appears in BusinessWeek and O: The Oprah Magazine, spoke with CNN about whether her method could have prevented the financial crisis, what Oprah would think of her mistrust of gut reactions and how to avoid becoming a cliché from a Talking Heads song. An excerpted version of that interview is below: . CNN: Could you start off by explaining what 10-10-10 means? Welch: It's a way of infusing intentionality and deliberateness into your decision making so you are living your life instead of your life living you. It impels you to do a values excavation, where you have a very candid conversation about what really matters to you: who you are, who you want to be. Then you take each decision -- each messy decision, each complicated decision; it's not about ""Where do we go to dinner?"" -- and you consider the consequences of your options in the immediate future, 10 minutes, in the foreseeable future -- that's the 10 months -- and then the distant future -- that's the 10 years. CNN: How does that compare with other decision-making methods, say, like, going with your gut reaction or flipping a coin? Welch: Gut's got its moment. There's a story in the book about when gut saved my life. I think gut is no way to live your life. Gut is a not-transparent, relatively inconsistent method for building a life of your own making. Now, the problem with gut is that good decision-makers are made, not born. If you ask a neuroscientist what gut is, [he or she would say] some of our gut reactions are hardwired on the savanna plain at the beginning of humankind. So, paralysis in moments of fear. The sort of selective deafness we have: only listening to people that we like. Not breaking from the group. There are hardwired neurological responses that always the best decision options. So I say, listen to your gut. But do a 10-10-10, and if there's a gap, figure out why.  Watch Suzy Welch talk about decision-making paralysis » . CNN: So if these gut reactions have evolved over time, is this sort of decision-making process then going against what we've evolved to do? Welch: It is a shortcut to wisdom. So, in fact, when you meet somebody who's really, really wise and you ask them how they make decisions, you often hear them describe a form of 10-10-10. It takes a lot of courage to turn to your parents or to turn to your spouse and say, ""Actually, this is not my beautiful life."" I'm just quoting that Talking Heads song, but you can wake up when you're 40 or 35 and say, ""Oh, my God, I lived the last 10 years for someone else."" This is a way to avoid that. CNN: Does this work for everyone? Welch: I've yet to see it not work. I've talked to many, many people now who use it. Here's where it falls apart: It falls apart in the execution of it. Because people will make a great 10-10-10 decision and then not have the courage to live it. CNN: If everyone used 10-10-10, do you think we'd be in the financial crisis we're in? Welch: The reason we're in a financial crisis is because some people did things without integrity. 10-10-10 is so based on having good values. If your values hurt other people for your own financial advancement, a good 10-10-10 decision isn't going to undo that. Had people been playing to their better angels and used 10-10-10 in the financial crisis, yeah, we probably could have avoided some of it. CNN: What's the hardest decision you've ever had to make? Welch: I write about it in the book. It was my divorce ... Just technically speaking, the decision to end a marriage, there's just almost nothing harder. CNN: Are there any decisions you regret? Welch: Oh, I have a billion of them. That's why 10-10-10 came to be, because I was regretting too many decisions. Since I started using 10-10-10, I think that I've gotten my decision making in a great place. I don't want to say that with any kind of hubris, because I make mistakes all the time, because I'm human. I'm all too human, I guess. But, you know, there's no 10-10-10 decision I regret. ... I don't regret the marriage that I ended, because I have four fabulous children because of it, but perhaps I should have ended it earlier. CNN: In the long term, do you think there are bad decisions? Because like with that one, you're saying there are good things that come of it. You learned something. Welch: The great thing about the human condition, OK, is that life goes on. And there are good things that come out of bad. But there are bad decisions that stall you for years. And there are decisions that we make way too late. And if anything what 10-10-10 does is that it expedites good decisions. ... If anything, 10-10-10 encourages us to start living our lives sooner. CNN: You write for O magazine, right? I've heard Oprah talk about gut reactions and trusting yourself. Do you think she would agree with you [on 10-10-10]? Welch: You know, I don't know how she would feel about it. The book says very clearly that gut has its place. Gut is pattern recognition. I'm not going to denigrate gut. Sometimes our gut is our inner voice. And I don't say ""don't listen to it."" What I'm saying is, ""backstop it."" What I'm saying is, ""uncheck it."" What I'm saying is, ""unpick it."" Sometimes gut is great, and sometimes gut is just easy.","Suzy Welch writes about a fast way for people to make smarter decisions .

"(CNN) -- I moved from Turkey to New York right after college and stayed for 10 years. I instantly felt I belonged. No matter how small my apartment was, how little money I had or how bad the streets smelled, I was happy. I went to graduate school, worked, had the time of my life and became an adult. Although I missed my family, friends and having a glass of Raki looking at the Bosphorus, I never wanted to go back. Unfortunately, there was one big hurdle in my New York forever plan: the scholarship that got me to U.S. had a strict rule of returning home for two years after graduating. That rule was to prevent brain drain: the departure of educated or professional people from one country for another, for better living conditions. More than that, my significant other wanted to go back. ""No matter what"" he said, ""I want to build our lives in Turkey."" So we did -- I am writing this from Istanbul, where I have lived for almost two years now. The ""no matter what"" part he was referring to was all the reasons why people leave in the first place: lack of opportunities, political and economic instability, and oppression. But from afar, Turkey did not seem to be such a gloomy option. The buzz was that it had become the 16th biggest economy in the world with a dynamic, young work force. Pundits were quick to praise Turkey as a model country: a secular Muslim democracy with a liberal market. Friends were going back and the ones who stayed in New York were asking if they should follow whenever we got together. I did not see such a model country when I moved back. And things deteriorated over the last two years. I saw Erdogan's unbearable authoritarianism, his denigrating and polarizing stance, a discriminatory attitude towards anyone who is not a Sunni Muslim or an ethnic Turk and no respect to anyone who is not 100% pro his AKP party. Human Rights Watch's 2014 report said that the AKP has demonstrated a ""growing intolerance of political opposition, public protest, and critical media."" Regulation against hate crimes did not recognize ethnicity or sexual orientation as separate categories. Neither were Alevis listed as a distinct faith community or Kurds -- the largest ethnic minority in Turkey, recognized as a separate ethnicity. As violence against women increased, the World Economic Forum ranked Turkey 120 out of 136 countries in its 2013 Global Gender Gap Index. Amnesty International accused Turkey of ""gross human rights violations"" during the Gezi protests. I saw a complete lack of freedom of expression as Turkey became the worst jailor of journalists in the world. As for my beautiful Istanbul, the city I dreamed of whenever I missed home, I saw an utter lack of sustainable urban development. Projects like the world's largest airport, a canal that would split the city's European side, a third bridge and the now infamous Ottoman-era barracks in lieu of Taksim Square were planned without any consideration for the ecological system or the fabric of the city. Large scale real estate projects gentrified neighborhoods and pushed the poor out of the city. It was no surprise then that Istanbul ranked 117th among 221 cities in the EU's urban livability index. The economy was not as good as it looked either: according to the OECD's 2014 statistics, Turkey has the third highest level of income inequality in the OECD area. One in every five Turks is poor. I started asking myself: shall I go back, can I really live here? Then the Gezi protests happened. A cloud of hope surrounded all of us skeptics despite the horrendous police violence we had witnessed. I felt alive and happy to be in Turkey, hopeful for future. Protesting in the streets as long as we did, I thought ""I could not have lived with myself if I was in U.S. at this time."" When the police cracked down the protests, the resistance reconstituted itself as political opposition in different shapes and forms. But the physical and political violence did not stop. Erdogan became more despotic as the recent corruption scandal started threatening his power; he went as far as blocking Twitter and YouTube. A feeling of depression replaced hope. So I started thinking again: shall I leave? For every person who wants and is able to go abroad, there is another who would never dream of leaving his beloved homeland or one that is not fortunate enough to have the opportunity to leave even if he wanted to. It is hard to be trapped between your brain and your heart. As for me, I think I will stay for now. And even if my brain drains to the farthest corner of the world, I know my heart will carry my country with me, wherever I go. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Binnaz Saktanber.","Binnaz Saktanber recently moved back to Turkey after spending a decade abroad .

"(CNN) -- The grief of any parent who loses a child is unimaginable. But that pain is amplified now in South Korea, due to the uncertainty over the fate of hundreds -- many of them children on a school field trip -- on a sunken ferry and how this east Asian nation's culture copes with such heartache. For proof, one need look no further than hospital beds where some parents are hooked up to IVs because their sorrow is so great that they have refused to eat. Some say they don't want to live. Families' frustration: 'Nothing is changing' ""If I don't have my younger child, I want to jump in the sea,"" one woman said. ""Thinking about my child in the sea, how can I, as a parent, eat or drink. I hate myself for this."" In South Korea, suicide is a real threat. It has the highest suicide rate among the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Some point to South Korea's ultra-competitive society or an unwillingness to accept failure as factors that contribute to this reality. Kin give out DNA . It is a culture where shame carries a heavy burden, and where there is simply a societal acceptance of suicide. Officials have made mental health workers available to the families, but despite the enormity of the tragedy, they find themselves not busy. ""No one came to us for counseling. The families don't care about their safety or well-being,"" said Han Kee Rae, a psychology volunteer. Counselors hope more people will come for help, especially in light of the high number of suicides in the country. There are fears that some may follow the example of Kang Min Kyu, the vice principal of Seoul's Ansan Danwon High School. The 52-year-old Kyu was among the first to be rescued from the sinking ship. Then, two days later, he was found hanging from a tree. Police said he used a belt to apparently hang himself from a tree near a gymnasium in Jindo, where the distraught relatives of missing passengers have been camping out. In a note, Kang wrote that the field trip had been his idea and that the deaths of the students were his fault. His suicide is hardly the first, nor the most high-profile, in recent memory in South Korea. Former President Roh Moo Hyun jumped to his death in 2009 in the wake of a financial scandal.

"(CNN) -- There is something magical about animal migrations. Perhaps it's the fact that as more of us move to cities (The U.N. predicts that nearly 70% of the global population will be urban dwellers by 2050), the sight of congregating herds, schools of fish, or flocks of birds is increasingly rare. Or maybe witnessing animals cross great distances to eat, mate, breed and, in essence, survive helps us to take stock of our own lives. Whatever the reason, when animals come together, very often so do humans. Here's our guide to the animal migrations that bring people out in flocks. Butterfly kingdom . Residents of Pacific Grove, California, take their butterflies very seriously. The area offers a warm micro-climate that attracts 20,000 monarch butterflies who travel up to 2,000 miles to winter in the region. In fact, the annual phenomenon has earned Pacific Grove the nickname ""butterfly town"". ""I always hear that the monarchs are coming before I ever see one. I get emails saying, 'I saw my first monarch of the season!' Everyone wants to be the one to herald their return,"" says Lori Mannel, executive director of the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. The season sees an influx of tourists as well. During the winter months, nearly 100,000 visitors come to witness the spectacle. The last few years has seen a drastic decline in their population, a fact some credit with the degradation of milk weed -- the only flora monarchs can lay their eggs on. To help restore the population, many locals have started replanting the stuff, while the local government has instilled a $1,000 fine for disturbing a monarch. Where: California . When: October - February . Read more: World's weirdest food festivals . Run, sardine, run . The east coast of southern Africa bears witness to one of the greatest migrations of all time: the sardine run. From May through July, millions of sardines spawn in the Agulhad Bank and make their way north up the coast. The migration also attracts predators, both of the human and animal variety. Each year, thousands of locals and tourists perch with massive fishing nets to catch the unwitting fish. Joining their ranks are sharks, dolphins and gannets, who also hover nearby in the hopes of snagging an easy dinner. Where: South Africa . When: May - July . Sign of the wildebeest . While tourism isn't always a welcome phenomenon for environmentalists, there are some instances where conservation efforts are abetted by traveler interest. In the Serengeti, for instance, the tens of thousands of visitors that stream in July and August for the Great Migration (so called for the millions of wildebeests that trek from Tanzania to Kenya) actually help to ensure funding goes to conservation. ""You could argue that tourism is one of the major reasons this huge ecosystem still exists today,"" says Craig Sholley, the vice president of philanthropy and marketing at the African Wildlife Foundation. At the peak of the migration, the banks of the Grumeti River are lined with hundreds of vehicles packed with environmental voyeurs all eager to glimpse the beasts make the life-threatening swim across the currents. Where: Tanzania and Kenya . When: July - August . Read more: World's weirdest food festivals . Crab season . Christmas Island is perhaps best known for the swarm of red crabs that pour onto the roads and beaches every winter. ""It looks like someone came along and planted all these crabs overnight,"" explains Linda Cash, the marketing manager at Christmas Island Tourism. When the crabs come out, the atmosphere becomes positively festive, notes Cash. The roads are closed to protect the journeying numbers, and the park builds special bridges to help them cross safely. ""People come down at night with their rakes, move the crabs off the road and share a beer,"" she says. Where: Christmas Island . When: October - November . A whale of a time . As it happens, humpback whales are a species constantly on the move. This is good news for tourists, who have a plethora of choice for where and when they'd like to engage in whale watching activities. In the summer months, Colombia's Pacific Coast becomes a hotbed for roughly 3,000 of the journeying mammals, who use the warm waters as their mating grounds. Australia makes another popular spot to glimpse the majestic creatures, who hug the coast from July onwards. The whales can travel over 5,000 miles, and often, savvy businesses set up cruises and watch towers to help visitors get a peek. Where: Colombia and Australia . When: July - October (Colombia), June - November (Australia)","Animals migrate to breed, feed, mate, and various other essentials to survival.
Sometimes, migrations attract predators, as with the sardine run in South Africa.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In 1842, when Hong Kong became a British crown colony after the first Opium War, it was described by a very unimpressed UK Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, as a barren rock with nary a house on it. He also added, prophetically and spectacularly incorrectly, ""it will never be a mart for trade."" Of course, by 1997, when Hong Kong was handed back by the British to become a Special Administrative Region (S.A.R) of China, it was a modern metropolis of well over six million souls, used to a free economy, a free press and the rule of law. According to the agreement hammered out between Britain and China, the territory would remain that way for at least 50 years. Under Chinese rule, Hong Kong would govern itself, choose its own leaders, control its own economy and maintain its own legal system. But there were many skeptics. Would China really be able to keep its hands off? Fifteen years later, almost a third of the way through those 50 years, are those promises still being kept? How has the territory changed? Christine Loh has a unique perspective. She was a legislator during the last years of the British colony and again in the early years of the Hong Kong S.A.R. A feisty democrat politician, no one would ever accuse her of being in the ""pro-Beijing"" camp. If you look at the people of Hong Kong, she said, their daily lives really haven't changed very much. Indeed, Hong Kong has its own borders and immigration control, even with China. It has its own currency, its own police force and system of law courts. It has freedom of expression and demonstration to a degree unheard of anywhere on the mainland. It's the only place in China, for example, that can commemorate the June 4, 1989 crackdown against the students in Tiananmen Square. The territory also has its own legislature and chief executive. Beijing has always promised to be hands-off, allowing the Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong, but many still feel it has undue influence in local politics and in an electoral system that favors pro-Beijing candidates. China's huge presence is inescapable. ""Our unease in Hong Kong is that the mainland is so big and we are so small. We are a small city of seven million people. It is easy for us to be physically overwhelmed. I think that is our fear,"" Loh said. Since the handover, trade ties between Hong Kong and China have strengthened so much so that Hong Kong is now the mainland's biggest source of foreign investment, state news service Xinhua reported, quoting China's ministry of commerce. Hong Kong is also the top destination for investment from the mainland. Trade between the two surged nearly 600% to US$284 billion from 1996, the year before the handover, and last year, Xinhua said. And ties are only set to strengthen. In the days leading to the 15 year anniversary, China announced a package of policies to further bind the mainland and the island covering trade, finance, education science and technology and tourism. But the prospect of tighter ties with their homeland is not necessarily being welcomed by Hong Kongers, many of whom feel that while Chinese money has boosted business, it has also put pressure on public services. Earlier this year, full page advertisements appeared in the local media, bluntly calling mainlanders ""locusts"" and accusing them of driving up property prices and squeezing Hong Kongers out of their own hospitals and schools. ""We have a love-hate relationship with China,"" said Hong Kong entrepreneur Douglas Young, whose popular chain of stores selling furnishings and knick-knacks celebrates a unique Hong Kong style. He is adamant that Hong Kong should hold onto its differences. ""I disagree that you have to choose between being a Hong Kong person or a Chinese person. I am both. Like a New Yorker, a New Yorker is both a New Yorker and an American, and I am a Hong Konger as well as being a Chinese person,"" Young said. ""So I think there is nothing wrong with Hong Kong being a part of mainland China or being a Chinese city. All I am saying is that Hong Kong should maintain its differences in its regional identity."" CNN asked people on the streets of Hong Kong what the difference was between Hong Kongers and the Chinese. ""Many of us were educated in Western countries and went abroad for a university education so naturally our cultural background is different from those Chinese nationals who were born and raised in China,"" one man said. ""I don't know much about China,"" one woman said in Cantonese. ""The problems in China right now make me think that I should not consider myself Chinese,"" she added. However, one woman who described herself as a Chinese person who was born in Hong Kong said, ""Hong Kong people and Chinese people are basically the same. The only difference between the two is that they are born in different places.""","Hong Kong marks 15 years since the handover from British to Chinese rule .

"(CNN) -- After all the arrests, court appearances, trips to jail and rehab stays, Lindsay Lohan has turned to reality TV. On Sunday night, the 27-year-old made her latest comeback attempt in the OWN network's ""Lindsay,"" a docu-series that came across in its first episode as part ""E! True Hollywood Story"" and part ""Intervention,"" with a dash of ""Hoarders."" (Lohan, apparently, gets rid of nothing.) The premise is to follow Lohan around as she tries to piece her personal and professional life back together after six years of documented turmoil. And so last summer, less than a week after she completed a 90-day stay at a Malibu rehab facility -- a place that actually aired commercials during the show -- Lohan sat down with OWN's Oprah Winfrey for an interview and began filming. The trailer indicated that there would be no glossing over Lohan's flaws and missteps, as crew members and OWN staff openly commented on the ways Lohan was making production difficult. But in its first hour, viewers didn't get any of that. Instead, the show tracked the former child star as she messily packed up and moved from Los Angeles to New York, tried to find her own place, saw her younger sister walk in a fashion show and squeezed in an impromptu shopping trip. Her jewelery needed to be organized, and then she needed to change hotel rooms. Other than a brilliant ""Fetch"" T-shirt being flashed at one point, that was about as exciting as it got. Yet in the midst of all that minutiae, the core of ""Lindsay"" is the star's focus on sobriety. Lohan's numerous low points are tallied throughout the episode, and she's frequently accompanied by a sober coach. If nothing else, OWN's ""Lindsay"" wants to be the portrait of a young artist in recovery. Does it succeed? Maybe for fans of Lohan's (and she does still have them, as ""Lindsay"" proved by chatting up strangers on the street about the actress) or the compassionately voyeuristic. ""I know there r much more important things going on in the world,"" media personality Jacque Reid tweeted Sunday, ""but I am very curious to see if Lindsay can save herself."" In the beginning of the episode, Lohan at least seemed to be on her way there, saying during a one-on-one confessional that ""there's nothing left in having a drink for me."" ""There's no situation that I haven't been exposed to,"" she went on. ""So maybe trying the other way for me, which is living with integrity and living in control of my own self, that's the life I want now."" But when faced with paparazzi, the stress of moving or a lingerie photo shoot that doesn't go as planned, the actress appeared on the brink of breaking down. For The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon, those moments are what makes ""Lindsay"" worth watching. ""What 'Lindsay' succeeds most at is, for the first time in years, convincing us that Lindsay Lohan isn't a name in an Us Weekly headline or a joke in a late-night monologue or a character in a drama so wild it can't possibly be real life,"" Fallon writes. ""She's a human. She's a very fragile, volatile, slightly selfish human. But she's one who's working really hard to find peace in the eye of the very large, very tumultuous storm that surrounds her and is causing those dangerous traits."" As for everyone else, there's little draw outside of the opportunity to sharpen one's snarky barbs. ""A small part of me died when I found out this is more than a one episode show,"" tweeted The Hollywood Reporter's TV critic Tim Goodman, while Entertainment Weekly's Erin Strecker tried to rustle up a silver lining. ""Encouraging sign #1,"" Strecker said. ""She finally got a driver."" Actress Chloe Grace Moretz, meanwhile, couldn't even joke about what she was watching on Sunday: ""this is just genuinely sad,"" she posted on Twitter. ""I feel bad."" Lohan had to know when she signed up for ""Lindsay"" that she was leaving herself wide open to this wide-ranging barrage of reactions, especially to comments like the one she made about a past jail stint. ""The judge at the time that I had kept overruling me getting released even though they were overcrowded,"" Lohan recalled of time spent in solitary confinement. ""She kept making me stay there. What they were doing was punishing me instead of trying to help me."" But, even with the possibility of this docu-series experiment going awry, it seems ""Lindsay"" is worth the risk for the former child star. ""I'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live,"" she said during Sunday's episode. ""(I was) in this bubble where everything was done for me, and now, I'm figuring everything out for myself."" 7 things from Lohan's sit down with Oprah Winfrey in August .","Lindsay Lohan's OWN reality series debuted Sunday .

"(CNN) -- I'm thinking back to when my girls, now 6 and 7, were just a few months old. ""Delicious"" is the word that most immediately comes to mind. As I spent countless hours -- like any new mom -- looking adoringly at each of my daughters' chunky cheeks and dreamy eyes, I often wondered, ""What is going through your mind?"" Turns out, maybe a whole lot more than I realized. According to researchers at Yale University's Infant Cognition Center, also known as ""The Baby Lab,"" babies can actually tell good from evil, even as young as 3 months old. That research is the focus of a three-part series this week on ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" which airs weeknights at 8 p.m. ET. To the skeptics who say, ""Come on, how can an infant tell the difference between a good guy and a bad guy?"" -- I can relate. It certainly runs counter to our notion that children are born as blank slates and learn right from wrong entirely from us. But the research paints a different picture. Puppets are used to demonstrate good and bad behavior. In one case, a puppet is struggling to open a box. Another puppet, the ""good"" puppet, helps it open the box, while another, the ""bad"" puppet, slams the box shut. More than 80% of the times that experiment is conducted, babies will select the ""good"" puppet when presented with both puppets and given the chance to choose either one. ""Humans are born with a hard-wired morality, a sense of good and evil is bred in the bone,"" wrote Paul Bloom, Yale's Brooks and Suzanne Ragen professor of psychology, in an opinion piece for CNN.com. Bloom, author of the new book ""Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil,"" collaborated on the research with his wife, Karen Wynn, a professor of psychology at Yale University. ""We are naturally moral beings, but our environment can enhance -- or sadly, degrade -- this innate moral sense,"" Bloom said. So now I'm wondering if, during those months when I thought my babies had zero clue about the world around them, I did anything I should not have done. Lyz Lenz, a contributor to the parenting site Babble and mom of a nearly 3-year-old daughter and 7-month-old son, wonders the same thing. ""When I was pregnant with my daughter, I read a history of our cultural perceptions of the devil and watched a lot of 'Dexter,'"" said Lenz of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, referring to the Showtime show about a serial killer. PHOTOS: CNN: When they were babies . ""Then, during my maternity leave, I watched all of 'Damages,' a show where Glenn Close plays an evil lawyer. So, what I'm saying is, if my daughter makes it to her 5th birthday without murdering someone, it won't be for lack of trying,"" joked Lenz, who also blogs for the site Baby Zone. Many women I chatted with over e-mail or on Facebook weren't really surprised to learn there's much more going on in the brains of our littlest ones. Jessica McFadden, founder of the blog A Parent in America and mother of three, remembers when her daughter Alice was 4 months old. ""She would babble animatedly and -- I swear -- as if she were 'ticked off' at the large family photo hanging in our home,"" said McFadden of Silver Spring, Maryland. The photo was taken before her daughter was born and included everyone in the family -- except her. ""She truly seemed put out that she was not in the picture, and this was before she was even eating solids! When the photo was replaced with a new one including her, she squealed, smiled, waved her hands and would happily look at it each time she passed it,"" she said. OPINION: Do babies know right from wrong? Beth Engelman, a single mom of an 8-year-old in Chicago, recounts what happened when her soon to be ""ex-mother-in-law"" came to visit when her son was just a few weeks old. ""As soon as she picked him up, he cried and cried and cried. When she handed him over to me, he was fine, giddy, happy,"" said Engelman, co-founder of the blog Mommy on a Shoestring. ""My siblings would say Jackson was an excellent judge of character, even at two weeks!"" The research does show, according to Bloom, that children just a few months old can judge a person's character -- siding with the ""good"" puppet and not with the ""bad"" puppet. But Bloom said the research also shows something else, which gives this parent pause. Babies, Bloom said, are born with an inherent bias, and start off as ""little bigots, eagerly dividing the world into 'us versus them' and strongly favoring their own group over everyone else."" ""They prefer puppets who have the same tastes as them and they actually want the puppets with the different tastes -- they like other puppets who punish them,"" Bloom said during a Google+ hangout. ""So early on, one of the most tragic aspects of humanity is how we split the world into 'us versus them' and we find this from the earliest age we can test."" Knowing this not only gives us more respect for what's going on in our children's minds, but also helps us as parents deal with certain moral issues, such as racism, Bloom said. WATCH: Baby brains: What are they really thinking? While it is important to teach children that humans naturally separate ourselves into groups such as families and friends -- and place more value on these people in our lives -- it is also important to clarify that it's not acceptable to value people according to group traits like skin color, said Bloom, who is the father of two teens. ""So if you realize kids come in a world with their own beliefs and judgments and propensities and expectations, it gives you more respect for them, and it also helps you parent them, helps you know how to make them into more moral people."" On that point, I loved what Lenz, the Babble contributor, said: ""Children know the world is deep and dark and bright and beautiful. We don't have to teach them that. Instead, we have to equip them to slay the monsters and hold fast to what is true and good."" What do you think babies really know?

"(CNN) -- Police in the Philippines have arrested 58 people suspected of using sexual information or images to cyberblackmail hundreds of people in at least six countries, Interpol announced Friday. Among those arrested Wednesday and Thursday are three people accused of blackmailing a Scottish teenager who jumped to his death in 2013, the France-based international police organization said. Daniel Perry was reportedly the victim of blackmailers who recorded his video-chat interactions with a person he thought was an American girl his own age. The blackmailers then threatened to show the footage to his family if he didn't pay up, the British newspaper The Telegraph reported at the time. According to Interpol, the blackmail scheme operated ""on an almost industrial scale from call centre-style offices."" The alleged blackmailers were given training and incentives, including days off, cash and cell phones for reaching financial goals, Interpol said. In addition to Asia-based networks, Interpol said similar networks based in Africa target European victims. They typically demand between $500 and $15,000. ""The scale of these sextortion networks is massive, and run with just one goal in mind: to make money regardless of the terrible emotional damage they inflict on their victims,"" Sanjay Virmani, director of Interpol's Digital Crime Center, said in a statement. The Interpol-coordinated investigation traced victims of the alleged blackmail scheme to Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States and Hong Kong. Investigators found potential victims in Australia, Korea and Malaysia, Interpol said.","Police in Philippines arrest 58 in sexual cyberblackmail case .

"(CNN) -- Humans can see 3-D images with only one eye, according to new research, suggesting a future in which the technology could become cheaper and more accessible. Simply looking through a small hole is enough to experience 3-D, says Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. His research was published in the journal Psychological Science. The 3-D technology that's currently used in movies and other media relies on two visual images, one from each eye, combining in the viewer's brain to produce 3-D's extra layer of depth. But Vishwanath's research suggests that both eyes aren't needed. ""We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole). ""While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed,"" he said in a release from the university. ""Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies."" In recent years, 3-D has become an emerging technology for blockbuster movies, video games, TV and other media. But it also causes headaches, dizziness and even nausea for as many as 10% of the people who watch it. Some experts believe that cumbersome 3-D glasses are a primary reason why the technology hasn't caught on with TV viewers. The St. Andrews researchers say that, with the approach they explored, people with only one eye or those with problems watching 3-D with both eyes could still experience its ""compelling"" effect. ""Many of these people don't know what it means to see in 3D because they have never experienced it,"" Vishwanath said. ""Our findings and preliminary results suggest that our method could be used to allow people with misaligned eyes ... to experience what it is like to actually see in 3D."" He said the study could have implications for movie producers and other industries. Vishwanath suggested that 3-D could one day be produced by dramatically increasing the resolution of images. That method would also decrease eye fatigue and some of the other side effects people report from wearing 3-D glasses. The St. Andrews team is now testing the theory with a larger group of subjects. They plan to release more findings on 3-D this year.","New research says viewing images through a small hole can produce a 3-D effect .

"(CNN) -- The Andaman Islands are at the center of one of the newest theories in the increasingly tangled search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Analysis of radar data revealed Friday by Reuters suggests the plane was flying toward the Indian Ocean archipelago. Reuters cited unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Aviation experts and locals are debating whether it would even be possible for a giant 777 to land -- or even approach -- the islands undetected. An Indian military search operation is being launched from Port Blair, the administrative center for the islands. Here are five things to know about the islands now enveloped in the missing plane mystery: . They're remote and mostly uninhabited . The Andaman Islands are part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory. There are 572 islands in the territory, only three dozen of which are inhabited. The territory has a population of nearly 380,000, according to India's 2011 census. The Andaman group is about 850 miles (1,370 kilometers) east of the Indian subcontinent in the Indian Ocean. Most of the population descends from immigrants from South Asia. India has designated five indigenous tribal groups in the territory as ""particularly vulnerable"" due to the loss of sustaining resources and customs. The airport's runway is long enough for a 777 . The main airport, Veer Savarkar International Airport in Port Blair, is on the east coast of South Andaman Island, one of the three largest islands. Airport officials hope to have night landing equipment this year, but only daytime flights are permitted now. The airport is an Indian navy facility with a civil enclave administered by the Airports Authority of India. Indian authorities own the only four airstrips in the region, according to Denis Giles, editor of the Andaman Chronicle newspaper. The Port Blair airport's runway could accommodate a Boeing 777. The runway is 10,794 feet in length (3,290 meters), a couple of thousand feet longer than Boeing's requirements for landing a fully loaded 777 in poor weather. It's hard to imagine the Boeing 777 landing at any of the remote island chain's mostly military airstrips without anyone noticing. The islands are in a strategically important area for India. It's a highly militarized zone with surveillance capacities covering a large part of the Indian Ocean, which would make it nearly impossible for an unidentified aircraft to enter the zone undetected. ""There is no chance, no such chance, that any aircraft of this size can come toward Andaman and Nicobar Islands and land,"" Giles said. The 2004 tsunami hit the islands hard . Thousands of India's nearly 11,000 deaths in the December 26, 2004, tsunami were on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The tsumani, which was triggered by an undersea earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra, killed more than 283,000 people across a dozen countries. It's a former penal colony . The Andaman Islands were a British penal colony for a short time in the 1790s and then again from 1858 when a new prisoner settlement at Port Blair was established. The penal colony in the Andamans was abolished after the British recaptured the islands from Japanese occupation during World War II. India took over administration of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1947 when it gained independence. Marco Polo a visitor, scene of Sherlock Holmes mystery . Marco Polo is thought to have visited the islands in the 13th century, calling one island ""Angamanain."" The Andaman Islands also star in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novel ""The Sign of the Four.""","Only three dozen of the Andaman and Nicobar islands are inhabited .

"New York (CNN) -- For Luke Foreman, seeing double has always been the norm. Growing up alongside twin Megan, the California-born 16-year-old has never thought twice about the frequency of twins around him. But, late last year, Luke was surprised to learn his school could tie the world record for the most twins in the same academic year at one school. A dramatic rise in multiple-child pregnancies has left many schools with record-smashing numbers of twins and triplets. Luke Foreman's Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut, tied the Guinness World Record this year for most sets of twins in a grade at 16. The high school shares the title with Valley Southwoods Freshman High School in West Des Moines, Iowa. The schools, however, may not hold the record for long. Connecticut's Greenwich High School hopes to beat the world record with 18 pair of twins in its class of 2016. ""I was kind of stunned,"" Nancy Lanzoni, mother of twins Ben and Willy, said when she learned the Greenwich High School boasts a total 62 sets of twins in four grades. The surprising numbers reflect a rise in multiple births in the United States. ""There's no question that the number and rate of multiple births has increased substantially in recent years,"" Joyce Martin, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), explains. In a report published earlier this year, the NCHS found there has been a 76% increase in the incidence of twins from 1980 to 2009. One in every 30 babies born in the United States in 2009 was a twin, compared to 1 in every 53 babies born in 1980. ""The increase of triplets and higher was almost 400%,"" Martin says. ""You don't typically see that kind of change occurring naturally."" The remarkable increase is largely attributed to the increasingly older age of mothers and the increased use of infertility treatments, which gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. ""A lot of it is driven by demographics,"" Martin explains. ""Moms tend to be older. When older women give birth naturally, they are more likely to have twins spontaneously and are more likely to have treatments."" It comes as little surprise that two Connecticut high schools have competed for the top twin-related prize. Connecticut saw the highest twin birth rate in 2009 with nearly 5% of all births in the state being twins. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Rhode Island were not far behind. ""I've noticed there are more twins and triplets,"" John Dodig, principal of Staples High School, says. ""I'm sure (our record) will be very short lived in the Guinness World Record history.""","Connecticut high school ties the Guinness World Record for most sets of twins in a class .

"(CNN) -- Last week, Republicans and Democrats alike chastised U.S. Rep. Todd Akin for coming up with a highly troubling reference to ""legitimate rape,"" implying that not all rapes were unjustified, like say when a married man forces his wife to have sex.

Rape is, by definition, a form of aggravated assault. Opinion: Rape can make you pregnant. Period. What all the very justifiable media hoopla ignores is that Akin's view of rape is far from unique. It follows that the educational agenda we all face is much greater and more challenging than setting straight one congressman who claims that he is suffering from a mild case of foot-in- the-mouth disease. The extent to which young people do not get what rape means has changed little over the years. According to statistics in the 1988 book, ""I Never Called It Rape,"" by Robin Warshaw, 84% of college men who committed rape claimed that what they had done was not, in fact, rape. One in 15 male students reported that they raped someone or attempted to do so in the preceding year. And ""nearly one third of college men said they were likely to have sex with an unwilling partner if they thought they could get away with it."" A more recent study published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology in 1998 asked students to what extent it was acceptable for a man to verbally pressure or force a date to have sexual intercourse. The responses show that 17% of men considered that using force was an acceptable strategy to get their way. Opinion: Wake up, it's not just Akin . We need to use the recent uproar over Akin's remark as a learning opportunity. A good place to start is with young people in high schools and colleges. Assemblies will do as a starter, especially if one can find rape victims who are willing to come forward and tell what it is like to be forced and the psychological scars that remain for years to come. Open discussions among men and women best follow, in smaller groups. Moreover, I highly recommend role playing. I used to scoff at role playing, which I considered a gimmicky approach to education. I changed my mind after seeing it enacted. I saw a husband playing a wife, and the wife acting as if she was the man of the house. She asked her husband: ""What did you do the whole day?"" and ""Why is the baby still fussing and the laundry not done?"" The husband later related that for the first time in his life, he truly felt what it is like to stay home the whole day, doing household work and dealing with children, and then to be treated as if one did not work. iReport: Making my voice public . Asking men -- who after all are 99% of the rapists -- to role play as if they have been raped by a woman is very unlikely to work. However, my colleagues in the psychology department tell me that men, especially young men and those who are not particularly athletic, are very sensitive to the notion that they may be raped by another man. Role playing in which a man is cornered by someone who pretends to be, say, a football coach is likely to evoke in them what women feel when they are cornered. I am not arguing that this, or for that matter any, educational device or program will convince one and all that rape is a shameful violent act (and, of course, a violation of the law). But at least we should use the Akin incident to engender a discussion of what are and what are not acceptable ways for people to proposition each other. Any use of force to gain sex deeply wounds those who are raped and reveals the predator is not much of a man. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni: Todd Akin's comment about ""legitimate rape"" is not uncommon .
Etzioni: The extent to which young people do not get what rape means has changed little .
He says role playing can be an effective tool in teaching people that rape is a violent assault .

"(CNN) -- Not content with climbing Mount Fuji or scaling the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the Google Street View team has once again stretched the limits of their brief, this time with a full tour inside an Emirates Airbus A380. Viewers can have a nose around an empty aircraft, from the escape ropes in the cockpit and the sea of economy seats on the lower deck to the well-stocked Business Class bar and the First Class showers on the top deck. Last week the Dubai-based airline marked five years of flying the A380 and earlier this year opened a dedicated A380 concourse at Dubai airport. First look at Dubai's new A380 concourse . ""Five swift years have gone by since Emirates changed the face of air travel with this remarkable aircraft,"" said Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline in a press statement. ""Its popularity is now firmly rooted across our six continent network."" According to Emirates, since their first A380 flight in August 2008, the airline has loaded 4 million bread rolls onto their superjumbo planes from their Dubai base, along with more than 157,000 fresh flower displays, 538,500 baby food jars, over 1 million toothbrushes and more than 4 million teabags. Emirates has a fleet of 35 A380s flying to 21 destinations, while nine other international airlines have the aircraft in their fleet. British Airways was the latest to join the A380 club last month; the UK flag-carrier will begin using the jet on its high-volume London to Los Angeles and London to Hong Kong routes from October. Ten more airlines have A380 planes on order. How do you pick up a 'superjumbo' A380? With a wingspan of 79.8 meters and length of 72 meters, the A380 is the biggest passenger jet in the sky. It can carry up 517 people and cover 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) in a single journey. Rivals Boeing launched the latest version of its largest jet, the 747-8, last year.

"(CNN) -- A day after Russian lawmakers approved a request from President Vladimir Putin to send military forces across their southern border into Ukraine and ordered forces there to hand over their weapons, leaders in capitals across the West were sharpening their pencils in hopes that the language of diplomacy could dull the tensions and restore the status quo. Ukraine . Some of the most impassioned speech came from Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. ""This is a red alert. This is not a threat. This is actually a declaration of war to my country,"" he told Rada TV. ""And we urge President Putin to pull back his military and stick to the international obligations and bilateral and multilateral agreements that were signed between Ukraine and Russia. ""If President Putin wants to be the president who started the war between two neighboring and friendly countries, between Ukraine and Russia, so he has reached this target within inches. We are on the brink of the disaster. There is no reason for the Russian Federation to invade Ukraine. And we believe that our Western partners and the entire global community will support the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine and will do everything we can to stop the military conflict provoked by the Russian Federation in Europe."" Support he got -- as statements from world leaders quickly clogged reporters' inboxes. But they offered few specifics about how they might twist Putin's arm if he did not heed their warnings. Ukraine mobilizes troops after Russia's 'declaration of war' Britain . ""We have to recognize the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine has been violated and this cannot be the way to conduct international affairs,"" said William Hague, Britain's foreign secretary, before boarding a plane Sunday from London to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. Hague said Britain will join other countries in pulling out of preparatory talks for the next G8 summit of industrialized nations, which is to be held in Sochi, Russia, in June, ""and then we will keep our approach to further G8 meetings under review."" Future decisions ""will depend on what happens over the coming days."" He predicted that Russia will see ""the very strong concerns around the world by many, many nations"" and called on both sides to avoid conflict. Hague expressed confidence that the international response could have an impact. ""It will be a very united diplomatic response -- and not just from the Western world but, I think, from many other countries in the world, and that is something that Russia will have to think hard about,"" he said. Canada . In a statement on Saturday, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper condemned the military intervention as ""a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and in violation of Russia's obligations under international law. In addition to suspending its engagement in preparations for the G8 summit, Canada recalled its ambassador from Moscow for consultations. Canada supports the deployment to Ukraine of international monitors from the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Harper said. ""Should President Putin continue on this course of action, it will lead to ongoing negative consequences for our bilateral relationship."" But again, few specifics. A strange scene, and somewhat polite standoff in Crimea . The Vatican . During his Sunday address to thousands of worshippers in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis chose not to judge, saying only that he hoped for dialogue and understanding in lieu of other options. ""I hope that all of the country's parties will endeavor to overcome misunderstandings and to build together the future of the nation. I make a concerned appeal to the international community to support any initiative in favor of dialogue and understanding."" NATO . A two-hour flight north of Rome, in Belgium, NATO did not hesitate to lay the blame at the feet of the Russians. ""We condemn Russia's military escalation in Crimea,"" Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters, reading from a NATO statement. ""Military action against Ukraine by forces of the Russian Federation is a breach of international law, it contravenes the principles of the NATO-Russia Council and the Partnership for Peace. ""Russia must respect its obligations under the United Nations charter and the spirit and principles of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, on which peace and stability in Europe rests."" He called on Russia to withdraw its forces to its bases and urged both parties to seek a resolution through dialogue, ""through the dispatch of international observers"" under the auspices of the U.N. Security Council or the OSCE. He did not elaborate on what the consequences might be if Russia does not comply. Germany . German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the world was on ""a dangerous path,"" but that ""a new division of Europe can still be prevented."" In a statement, he called on all those responsible to ""desist to take further steps that can only be understood as a provocation. Anything else would lead to an escalation of uncertain, possibly dramatic consequences and could make many years of constructive cooperation for a more secure Europe naught. ""Russia has no right to use its military beyond the rules of the lease on the Russian Black Sea Fleet on Ukrainian territory."" Then, in a nod to Putin's assertion that his forces were trying to protect Russians in Ukraine, he added, ""We are committed to ensuring that the new political leadership in Kiev protects the rights and interests of all Ukrainians. This includes in particular an unequivocal protection of the rights of minorities, including the use of languages."" France . A spokeswoman for French President Francois Hollande said Paris too had suspended its participation in preparatory talks for the G8 summit. Hollande spoke with Putin and ""asked him to avoid any use of force and to seek a solution to the crisis with the international community."" Russia . Moscow's take on the conversation differed. ""At the request of Francois Hollande, Vladimir Putin shared his assessment of the situation in Ukraine, stressing that there exists a real threat to the lives of Russian citizens and our compatriots,"" the Kremlin website said. ""The two presidents exchanged views on possible ways of resolving the situation in Ukraine and agreed to continue contacts.""

"(CNN) -- Egypt's revolution in 2011 gave birth to an explosion of new creativity, especially street art. No longer confined to exhibit their works in galleries, more and more artists are turning humble streets into open-air studios and outdoor museums. Their canvas of choice is a bare, dusty wall on which they spray cheeky graffiti and paint colorful murals. ""Graffiti is a form of art, one of the ways of expression,"" said Ahmed Al-Attar, playwright and artistic director of the Downtown Contemporary Arts Festival. ""It's kind of making a statement, that the public space is for everyone. It's for walking, it's for sitting down, it's for demonstrating. It's for art."" Read more: Sex, lies and lithographs in Iran . Street art has existed in Cairo before the revolution, albeit furtive and hardly visible. Graffiti or posters would pop up on some streets, but they usually soon disappeared, painted over or torn up. Street artists were chased away by police, or worse arrested. During the 2011 uprising, activist artists created graffiti and murals as a form of non-violent protest. Now, in post-revolution Cairo, street art is spreading. Murals and graffiti stencils appear even in an affluent neighborhood like Zamalek, instead of hidden alleyways. Some of the artworks are emotionally charged, expressing social anger, political frustration or paying tribute to fallen protesters. Read more: Could the next Banksy come from Dubai? In a reflection of their newly elevated status, graffiti artists get commissions from art galleries. But they or their works still risk being targeted, especially by the powerful army and its supporters. Ganzeer, possibly Egypt's most famous street artist, was briefly arrested in May 2011, months after the revolution, over a poster criticizing the military's repression of freedom. After the army removed President Mohamed Morsi from power in July 2013, passers-by ripped off many of sculptor Alaa Abdel Hameed's eagle sculptures, inspired by the military's insignia, that were plastered upside down because the artworks were seen as an insult to the armed forces.

Art plays a crucial role in times of political and social change, said Al-Attar, who founded and runs Studio Emad Eddin, a rehearsal space for performing artists in Cairo. ""For me, it's one of the important factors that led to change."" Under the Mubarak regime, the prevalent sense of fear had a paralyzing effect on people's self-expression. But, ""once they realized there's nothing really to fear, they started to go back to their old ways of expressing themselves,"" said Al-Attar, ""drawing on walls, singing in streets, you know, going back to the public space."" The Downtown Contemporary Arts Festival is trying to encourage more creative expression. ""Egypt has a big heritage when it comes to art and culture,"" says Al-Altar. ""And that is one of the reasons that trying to tame that society doesn't really work. It's a society that likes to dance and sing and eat and be outside, and that's part of it.""

"(CNN) -- Every family, even famous ones, have secrets. The Hemingways are no different. ""We were, sort of, the other American family that had this horrible curse,"" says Mariel Hemingway. She compared her family to the Kennedys -- but the Hemingway curse, she said, is mental illness. Hemingway, granddaughter of acclaimed author Ernest Hemingway, explores the troubled history of her family in ""Running from Crazy,"" a documentary that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday. Barbara Kopple is the director; Oprah Winfrey is the executive producer. ""Knowing that there's so much suicide and so much mental illness in my family, I've always kind of been 'running from crazy,' worried that one day I'd wake up and be in the same position,"" Mariel Hemingway, 51, said at a support group for families of suicide, as shown in the film. Hemingway told CNN last week she wanted this documentary to be an unveiling of her family history, and to give people permission to express their own ""stuff,"" to realize they're ""not alone in the world of dysfunction."" The documentary guides the viewer through the turmoil of her parents' marriage and the troubled relationships between her and her siblings. It includes archival footage from when her sister Margaux Hemingway, who took her own life in 1996, had been making a personal family documentary. ""Suicide has no rhyme or reason,"" Hemingway said. ""Some people think about it for years and plan it. Some people, it's 20 dark minutes of their life that they decide to take their life that comes out of the blue. It's very random, it's very frightening."" Whether Hemingway is jumping on a trampoline or submerging herself in a cold stream, with her pointed nose and bouncy blonde hair, her message in the film is one of achieving mental well-being and overcoming one's own problems. These scenes contrast with newspaper clippings, still photos and melancholy video clips from her family's past. Seven members of Hemingway's family have died by taking their own lives, including Ernest and Mariel Hemingway's older sister Margaux, she said. Mariel Hemingway had denied her sister's death was a suicide until an event hosted by the American Association for the Prevention of Suicide in 2003. Ernest Hemingway, who won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature, struggled with depression and killed himself in 1961, just months before Mariel Hemingway was born. But suicide wasn't something that was talked about when she was growing up. ""Nobody spoke about anything,"" she said. ""It was a different generation."" Even her sister's suicide was not talked about, she said. Saving Hemingway's home in Cuba . The film's biggest revelation, which was the most difficult part of her family history for Hemingway to reveal, is that she believes her father, Jack Hemingway, sexually abused her sisters Margaux and Joan, nicknamed ""Muffet."" Hemingway drops this information bomb only briefly in the film -- the first time she has revealed this publicly. Jack Hemingway died in 2000. Hemingway told CNN she does not remember her father abusing her, but notes that she did sleep in the same room as her mother, who had cancer, possibly as protection from her father. She is not sure if her mother knew what was going on. It's possible that her father didn't even remember doing it, she says, because he was drunk. Alcohol abuse also runs in the family, she said. Mariel Hemingway began her screen acting career as the younger sister of a character played by Margaux in the 1976 film ""Lipstick."" Critics praised Mariel and dissed Margaux, which strained their relationship. But Mariel Hemingway said she had been in touch with her sister the week before she died. ""She was seemingly OK,"" she said. ""But you never really know with suicide what's going on in a person's mind."" Prior to the film, Hemingway only saw her sister Joan Hemingway about once a year. Muffet Hemingway lives in Sun Valley, Idaho; Mariel Hemingway lives in Los Angeles. Muffet had experimented with LSD when she was young, and received a diagnosis of manic depression. Mariel Hemingway has discussed her sister's struggles in numerous interviews over the years. ""She represented being, you know, 'crazy,' "" Mariel Hemingway said last week. ""I always feared that I would wake up that way, or that maybe I was that way and I didn't even know it."" But since doing the film, they have seen each other a bit more often, including at Christmas. Making the movie has made Mariel Hemingway get over her fear of seeing her sister, whom she describes as ""such a loving, kind person."" ""My dream is to be able to have enough money to take care of her myself, and really take over her care,"" she said. Attempts by CNN to contact Joan Hemingway were unsuccessful. An April article in the Twin Falls, Idaho, Times-News said her artwork was being featured in a business in Ketchum, the town adjacent to Sun Valley. Business owner Nicola Potts told the newspaper that Joan Hemingway, 61, leads a ""very happy, very private life."" Mariel, too, said she has had depression and suicidal thoughts, and recalls suffering insecurity and being fearful and depressed growing up. When she overcame that, ""I was like, 'I've spent all my life being that way,' "" she said. To move past these feelings, Hemingway says she has ""done everything"" -- psychotherapy, gurus, holistic doctors -- and each of the methods she has tried have given her something of value. On her blog, for instance, she recommends that everyone take a few minutes of silence in the morning and before sleeping to be still and silent, which helps her to be more calm and focused. Practices such as these, in addition to exercise, spending time in nature, and eating right, have all helped her achieve peace, she said. It's only within the last four years that she feels she has completely overcome depression. ""It's amazing to me that I'm not sad anymore, and that I don't worry and that I don't fear,"" she said. These days, Hemingway and her boyfriend Bobby Williams have a lifestyle company called TheWillingWay (""He has the 'will,' I have the 'way,' "" Hemingway said). Health and wellness are her passion. She also advocates for suicide and mental illness awareness. She is open and communicative with her two daughters about their own mental health, too. ""I think people need to talk about it a lot,"" she said of mental illness, ""Making it OK that it's in your family."" She added, ""It doesn't shame anyone, and it doesn't make anybody's family an ugly, bad family."" That is a challenge to which this Sundance film also rises. Hemingway's home gets literary honor .

"Dunedin, Florida (CNN) -- Michael Dupre, his wife and his daughter made it out of their Dunedin, Florida, house after noticing its screened-in room plunging into a pit in the ground. His wedding ring did not. As the family stood outside early Thursday, a firefighter buckled herself up, smashed a window, then snatched the ring from a desk in Dupre's office. ""And a few minutes later, the whole thing collapsed back down there,"" he said. Sinkholes like this one in Dunedin, a city of about 35,000 people just north of Clearwater, are hardly rarities in Florida. Hundreds pop up in the Sunshine State each year, like the one in August that gobbled a condo building in the town of Clermont. Dupre not only knew of the dangers, but he also was doing something about them. After spotting ""a few little hairline cracks,"" he contacted his insurance company and, after a lot of back-and-forth about what to do, had workers come to his western Florida house over the last few days to start stabilizing the ground. Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . ""We were actually planning ..., when the whole repair was done, to put a pool in the backyard,"" he said, noting he'd already gotten estimates. ""That (hope) is over. ""We thought it was going to get fixed. And unfortunately, it's not."" All those plans changed after his daughter came into his bedroom before dawn Thursday, saying, ""Daddy, somebody is trying to get our house!"" Dupre said he first dismissed the thought, thinking it was the wind, but then he heard a loud crack. ""I said, 'There's something wrong.'"" After seeing what had happened to their screened-in room, Dupre told the rest of his family to grab some clothes and get out of the house, then called 911. They haven't been back inside, with Dupre saying he expects only firefighters -- like the one who rescued his wedding ring -- will go in, if it's even safe enough for them. As of Thursday afternoon, the sinkhole that enveloped Dupre's home and badly damaged another was 70 to 75 feet wide, 50 feet deep and growing, according to Dunedin Fire Chief Jeff Parks. Seven homes in total were evacuated. But the hole shouldn't be like that for long. ""The plan now (is) to fill the hole tomorrow,"" Parks said, ""before some rain is expected this weekend (that may) make it a lot worse."" The Dupres won't be able to go back into their home at that point, however. They will be staying at a Holiday Inn Express that graciously put them up for two nights, then asking friends to let them stay over until they figure out what to do next. ""It's all new for us,"" Dupre said. ""... We're trying to do our best."" Opinion: Florida, fix sinkhole policy .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China plans to hold special courses to train government leaders in ways of managing online public opinion, according to a report in state-run media. The report by the Xinhua new agency said China had one billion Internet users ""making the shape of our society more complicated ... managing online public opinion has already become a central fixture of managing our society."" Management of the Internet is now a ""big task for all of our country's leaders, at every level,"" the report added. The six-day course -- to run from March 27 to April 1 -- aims to use ""use case studies, simulations, group discussions"" to train ""government organs and administrative units"" who would be examined and awarded a certificate ranking them either an analyst or manager of ""Internet public opinion."" 'Directing' discussions . According to the course website, the program shows ways of directing online discussions on ""mass incidents"" -- shorthand for civil unrest and rioting that breaks out periodically in Chinese towns and cities -- and even uses discussion on the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s as an example of a contentious social issue. The Chinese government has only just permitted discussion of the tumultuous political period, which was marked by paralyzing social upheaval. Another part of the course discusses the influence of popular bloggers -- called ""Big V"" users on Sina Weibo -- who must maintain a sense of ""social responsibility"" in their posts, according to the program website. ""Big V should proactively conform to state management departments in striking down rumors and purifying the online environment,"" it stated. Spread of rumors . China's President Xi Jinping has tightened controls over the Internet since coming to power in 2012, bringing in tough legislation to control the ""spread of rumors"" online. Last year, the Supreme People's Court issued new guidelines stating that any false defamatory post online that is viewed 5,000 times or forwarded 500 times could be deemed ""severe"" and result in a prison sentence of up to three years for the culprit. Microblogging has exploded in China in recent years, presenting a serious pressure point to a government that has built an industry around restricting comment. Microblogging campaigns have targeted corruption, suspicious lawsuits, kidnapped children and the plight of activist lawyers. Despite this, however, large Internet companies such as Sina Weibo and Renren employ content monitors to make sure their sites do not contravene Chinese information laws. According to Chinese Internet entrepreneur Gang Lu, the banks of censors are often regarded by Internet companies as simply a requirement in China of doing business in a new industry. ""Almost half the team at Sina Weibo are engaged in monitoring content at some level. Even so, Sina is very bold but they are under pressure as well -- they still have to be responsive to the government."" he told CNN. Facebook, Twitter banned . Unrestricted social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are banned on mainland China and only determined or relatively wealthy individuals use virtual private networks (VPN) to get around the Chinese Internet restrictions, which have been dubbed ""The Great Firewall of China."" Even so, cracks have occasionally appeared in the wall. According to a report in Hong Kong's South China Post, Beijing could soon lift a ban on Internet access within the Shanghai Free-trade Zone, allowing access to Facebook, Twitter and newspaper website The New York Times. ""In order to welcome foreign companies to invest and to let foreigners live and work happily in the free-trade zone, we must think about how we can make them feel like at home,"" the report quoted a government source as saying. ""If they can't get onto Facebook or read The New York Times, they may naturally wonder how special the free-trade zone is compared with the rest of China.""","China to hold special courses to train government leaders in ways of managing online opinion .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Not your average great-great grandfather, Fauja Singh has completed nine 26-mile (42-kilometer) marathons since taking up long-distance running just over a decade ago. On Sunday, the 101-year-old Sikh finished his final competitive race in Hong Kong, putting an end to a sporting career that has raised thousands of dollars for charity and been an inspiration to many around the world. Nicknamed ""Turbaned Tornado"" by fans for his distinctive traditional headwear, Singh said he began long-distance running in an attempt to lift the depression that engulfed him after he witnessed the death of his son. ""I suffered a tragic incident in my life, a traumatic experience; I took up running as a new focus in life. And then marathon running developed from there,"" he told CNN at a training session before Sunday's race. He completed the 10-kilometer route that wound its way along Hong Kong's harborfront in one hour 32 minutes and 28 seconds -- four minutes faster than his time last year despite a small stumble. ""Five or six kilometers into the race, I really decided to go for it,"" he said. ""I had lots of power today because I was very happy. "" Singh moved to the UK from India following the death of his son and entered his first marathon in London in 2000 aged 89. In 2011, Singh became the first centenarian on record to complete a marathon after finishing the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 2011 in eight hours and 11 minutes and six seconds. He was also a torchbearer for the 2012 Olympics and was featured in Adidas' ""Impossible is nothing"" advertising campaign. ""He's focused, determined and single minded ... he's never set out to break records,"" said his trainer Harmander Singh, who has been coaching him for 13 years. Although the Hong Kong event was Singh's last competitive race, his coach said the centenarian will still run for pleasure. ""He's my best student, I would say, which is ironic because he's twice my age."" As he hangs up his running shoes, Singh told CNN he had no secret diet or training regimen. He attributed his success to a simple love of the sport. ""It's because of the happiness I get out of it. If something makes you happy, you'll do it well."" CNN's Aloke Devichand, Elizabeth Joseph and Diego Laje contributed reporting in Hong Kong.","Fauja Singh, 101, completes final race in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- Despite Barkhad Abdi's Academy Award nomination, his story has not been quite rags-to-riches. Much is being made over a report from The New Yorker that the the ""Captain Phillips"" actor is having trouble making ends meet. He was paid $65,000 two years ago for the role, which earned him a best supporting actor nomination this season. Abdi told CNN's Poppy Harlow that he didn't have an agent to even negotiate his salary (he does now). ""It was my first film,"" he said. ""I didn't have many options."" Such a small salary for a performer in a multimillion-dollar blockbuster is not rare for a first-time actor. Brad Pitt reportedly received only $6,000 for his breakout role in the 1991 film ""Thelma and Louise."" A few more established actors have chosen to forgo big paychecks in order to participate in a project. Jonah Hill accepted a paycheck of only $60,000 for his recent role in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" ""I would sell my house and give (director Martin Scorsese) all my money to work for him,"" Hill said. ""This isn't what you make money for; you do '22 Jump Street,' you do other things, to pay your rent. But I would do anything in the world. I would do it again in a second."" Abdi's story may be drawing so much attention because of his hardscrabble backstory. The Somali actor left his war-torn country as a youngster with his family and settled in Yemen. Years later, they immigrated to the United States, where they joined a large community of Somalis in Minneapolis. He was driving for his brother's limousine company when he answered a casting call for Somali actors for the ""Captain Phillips"" film. According to The New Yorker, Abdi is planning to move to Los Angeles and pursue his acting career. It reports that when he was in Los Angeles to do publicity for ""Captain Phillips,"" ""His clothes are loaners. Recently Abdi requested that he be allowed to stay at a commuter's hotel near LAX, to be closer to his friend, a Somali cabdriver from Minneapolis, who shuttles him around for free.""

"(CNN) -- As the world celebrates the long-awaited addition to the British royal family, it is worth taking some time to reflect on the women around the world for whom childbirth is not such a joyous, beautiful and celebrated occasion. Every year in sub-Saharan Africa, 162,000 mothers die needlessly because of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. That figure represents a staggering 56% of the global total. For an African woman, one of the most natural of events in a woman's life -- giving birth -- is also one of the most dangerous. As a result, each year close to 1 million African children are left motherless. Many of these deaths are avoidable, but not enough is being done to prevent them. Since the turn of the last century, maternal mortality rates worldwide have been in decline but remain high in developing countries, including many African nations. For these maternal death rates to improve in Africa, governments and international institutions must recognize and introduce policies that tackle the challenges faced by African women in accessing effective reproductive healthcare. Read this: Starting a revolution for teen mothers . Whilst sub-Saharan Africa has seen a decrease in maternal mortality rates over the past 20 years, there is still a long way to go if the region is to meet its Millennium Development Goals. This is largely due to a failure to address political, socio-cultural and financial challenges. There has been slow progress in meeting the 2001 Abuja Declaration, in which countries pledged to assign 15% of their national budgets towards healthcare. This is compounded by deficits within the health ministries for numerous countries resulting in inadequate funding for maternal services. Run down resources . With limited investment in health resources, many women in sub-Saharan Africa cannot access an adequate healthcare unit during pregnancy and childbirth. Many cannot access one at all, and countless women are forced to walk miles to their nearest health center. Without transportation most women give birth at home or on the way to hospital, a journey on which too many will suffer fatal complications. For women in many rural communities, the norm is for a traditional birth attendant (TBA) to assist the delivery instead of making the trip. TBAs often have no formal training and deliver without sterilized equipment, if any, causing yet more risks for mother and baby. Read this: 'Give African women a voice' However, even if a woman does make it to a hospital, she is likely to find herself in one so under-resourced that soon-to-be mothers have to sleep on the floor following delivery because beds are in such short supply. Women often have to arrive armed with basic resources such as paraffin to light lamps in the event that they go into labor at night. Without paraffin and power, midwives such as Uganda's Esther Madudu, who is also the face of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF)'s Stand up for African Mothers global campaign, have to conduct deliveries using the light from their mobile phones and plastic bags over their hands as gloves. ""There is so much work to do"" Esther's health center is located in the Soroti district in rural Uganda and serves a community of 37,000 people. She works tirelessly round the clock to assist mothers in deliveries, as well as trying to offer antenatal and postnatal care. But coping with the demand is tough. She says there are occasions when she must travel long distances to reach mothers-to-be who cannot reach a health center -- sometimes arriving after they have given birth. Her own health center has just two midwives. ""There is so much work to do and yet there are only a few of us. We are forced to work day and night,"" she says. Read this: African midwife, Nobel Peace Prize? And Esther's story is sadly not unique. Many health units are overstretched. With no doctors and few qualified midwives, most hospitals and health units cannot accommodate the women that do manage to reach a healthcare facility. Low pay and difficult working conditions lead to frustration within the existing workforce, which in turn leads to mismanagement of patients. Women testify that they are mistreated in hospitals and this is just one more reality that encourages them to give birth at home. Lack of information . For the majority of Western mums-to-be, the months leading up to the big day are full of scheduled antenatal appointments, classes and ultrasounds. The nine months of waiting and expecting are crammed full of information on how best to care for the growing life. Pregnancy and childbirth becomes the hot topic of discussion. And, it doesn't end when the baby arrives; postnatal care is a core part of midwives' duties in the West. For many women in Africa, an astounding lack of information means they simply do not see or understand the reasons for attending antenatal and postnatal health services, let alone see the value added by giving birth at a health center. Moreover, the absence of information has hampered initiatives designed to prevent mother-to-child infections, as well as immunization. Read this: Flying doctor takes to the skies . It's for all these reasons that AMREF launched its Stand Up for African Mothers Campaign, which aims to train 15,000 midwives by 2015 because, as AMREF asserts, midwives save lives. Increasing the number of trained midwives will mean more than seven million mothers annually will be cared for and informed, which means many more children will be raised in the arms of their mothers. The joyful birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby is a wondrous occasion, an everyday miracle that deserves to be commemorated and honored. But whilst we celebrate the arrival of a royal newborn, perhaps we should also spare a thought for those 440 women across sub-Saharan Africa who will lose their lives today simply giving birth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Murigi.","For many African women, giving birth is a dangerous process .
440 women in sub-Saharan Africa die giving birth every day .
Many African women cannot access adequate care during pregnancy, says campaigner ."
"(EW.com) -- It's a great day to be a Marvel superhero. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" took the No. 1 spot for the third weekend in a row, earning $26.61 million this holiday weekend, allowing it to cross that magical $200 million finish line. For comparison's sake, this sequel — directed by Anthony and Joe Russo — has already out-earned 2011′s ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" which ended its run with $176.65 million. What's the real takeaway from all this? That for all the idle chatter of audience superhero fatigue, no one is going to be putting away the spandex just yet. It will be interesting to see how ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" — already healthily earning overseas — fares when it opens domestically on May 2. Will Christian audiences turn out for 'Heaven Is for Real'? Initially it seemed like this weekend would be a tight race between holdover sequels ""Captain America"" and ""Rio 2,"" but it turned out to be less so, with Fox's animated avians coming in at $22.5 million this weekend, bringing its domestic totals to $75.36 million. How the lure of a blue macaw voiced by Bruno Mars didn't succeed in nabbing the No. 1 spot is hard to say, but keep an eye on this one over the next few weeks to see what kind of staying power it may have. Meanwhile the faith-based ""Heaven Is for Real"" continues to pleasantly surprise during its first weekend in wide release: TriStar's film brought in $21.5 million this weekend, bringing its five-day total to $28.5 million. The demographics for the film broke down to 62 percent female and 38 percent male and, interestingly, 49 percent of the audience under the age of 35. The movie stars Greg Kinnear and Kelly Reilly as real-life couple Todd and Sonja Burpo, whose son claims to have seen Heaven while unconscious. Review: 'Transcendence' Much less happy news is the $11.15 million opening of Warner Bros.' ""Transcendence."" This cyber-thriller starring Johnny Depp opened to lackluster reviews (such as ours by Chris Nashawaty) and a meh Cinemascore of C+. Does this mean, finally, that we can stop with movies about sentient computers? Probably not. And don't expect the stink of this flick to stick to Depp or his co-stars, Rebecca Hall, Morgan Freeman, and Kate Mara — we're guessing they'll be just fine. Hopefully this will not deter longtime Christopher Nolan cinematographer Wally Pfister from getting back in the director's chair either. Another new release this weekend, ""Haunted House 2,"" came in fifth place with $9.1 million. With a reported $4 million budget, this is good news for the Marlon Wayans-led comedy (tagline: ""It'll scare the #2 out of you""), which may not have delighted critics but received a B- Cinemascore. Review: 'Haunted House 2' Here's the final breakdown on this weekend's top five: . 1. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" — $26.61 million . 2. ""Rio 2"" — $22.5 million . 3.

"(CNN) -- The introductions at BlogHer, the largest conference in the world for women in social media, tend to go something like this: . ""WellConnectdMom, so great to meet you,"" I said to a blogger whom I knew only by her Twitter handle. ""KellyWallaceTV, great to meet you too,"" she replied, using my Twitter handle. That type of exchange happens hundreds, maybe thousands, of times at this conference, which opened Friday in Chicago. The chance to meet online connections in person is part of the reason women from all over the world gather for the two-day event. They also come to network, build potential business partnerships and burnish their brands overall. ""Well Connected Mom"" Lori Cunningham expects to meet at least 200 people this year, her third BlogHer conference. She'll contact many of them when she returns home to continue networking and building upon common interests. ""It just is an opportunity to open a door that you wouldn't have if you didn't come to a BlogHer conference,"" said Cunningham, a mother of two from Los Angeles whose blog focuses on simplifying technology for women. For first-time BlogHer attendees like Chicagoan Jamie Jensen, the goal is to build her blog, For Love of Cupcakes, into a full-time job that she can run as a ""work-at-home mom."" ""I'm hoping to just keep growing to where it can be a part-time income or eventually a full-time income,"" said Jensen, the mother of a 2-year-old girl, who works outside the home as a day-care teacher. BlogHer is more than a conference. It's also a major cross-platform business that hosts 3,000 blogs and helps many more expand their reach through education and networking opportunities. The BlogHer publishing network has generated $25 million for about 5,000 female writers over the past four years, said BlogHer co-founder Lisa Stone. Most bloggers use this income to support their work and pay for business expenses; others use it to supplement their household income and support their families, she said. Businesses understand the power of female bloggers, judging by the more than 130 brands -- from Coca-Cola to Samsung -- in attendance. And yet, mainstream media seem to marginalize what these women are doing. Take a Wall Street Journal story this year that depicted blogger conferences as opportunities for women to party away from their husbands and kids. ""The sheer power of women on the Web is so clear statistically, and yet there is some ongoing prevailing effort to belittle that leadership,"" Stone said, citing stats showing women are 41% more likely to use social media than men. ""Good luck trying to put women who blog into a bell jar,"" Stone said. ""They are going to ooze right out over the top and explode right in your face."" Still, among the public, there seems to be a lack of understanding of what a blogger is, says Amanda Rodriguez, a mom of three boys and host of Dude Mom. Rodriguez, who is speaking on a panel this weekend, said she recently attended an event sponsored by the National Football League where no one seemed to understand what she did as a blogger. It's the same response she says she gets when she reveals her profession to people at airports or in the doctor's office. ""I think there's just a misconception about what bloggers do. They all think we're either like Perez Hilton or whatever random mommy blogger that they have read about on Oprah.com,"" the Frederick, Maryland, mom said. ""So I think it's up to us to sort of work really hard to change that perception,"" she said. ""Hopefully other people will start to give the career a little more credence."" The BlogHer Conference, now in its ninth year and profiled recently in USA Today, aims to help by bringing attention to what female bloggers do. Big-name speakers also help. Last year, President Obama gave a keynote via video conference. This year's closing keynote speaker is Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook and author of the much-talked-about book ""Lean In."" Mainstream America may not understand the power and influence of bloggers. But parents who share tips about products or advice for getting kids to behave see the blog community as an extension of those support networks, said Cunningham. There is another power that has nothing to do with educating the public. It has to do with women connecting with other women in ways they can't connect with their friends. First-time conference attendee Sarah Evans hosts the blog It's a Vol, based on her love of the University of Tennessee Volunteers. She suffered from postpartum depression after her daughter was born. The women she met online, many of whom she is meeting for the first time at BlogHer, saved her, she says. ""When I had postpartum depression, there was nobody in my physical life at that point in time who could say 'I know what you went through,' "" Evans said. Through the BlogHer community, she met others who could relate to what she was going through and shared their experiences on their blogs. ""You can say, 'Look at this mother. She's fantastic. She made her way through this,' "" she said. ""I feel like that right now, and I can get through that. I can get to that point, too."" The value of such a connection? Priceless.","Bloggers gather in Chicago for two-day conference for women in social media .

"(CNN) -- Republican nominee Mitt Romney has frequently railed against efforts championed by President Barack Obama steering money to promote ""green energy."" He continued that line of attack Wednesday night, decrying what he described as ""$90 billion in breaks to the green energy world."" ""These businesses, many of them have gone out of business -- I think about half of them -- of the ones that have been invested in have gone out of business,"" the former Massachusetts governor said. So are Romney's assertions correct, both about the size of the ""green energy"" program and what happened to those companies that got money from it? The facts: . The Department of Energy proudly touts that the 2009 stimulus authorized $90 billion ""in government investments and tax incentives to lay the foundation for the clean energy economy of our future."" Fact Check: Is Donald Trump a small business? But not all that money has been spent, and not all of it -- in fact, not even half of it -- is being directed to upstart green businesses. Part of 2009's much larger $787 billion stimulus package, this money went toward things like the weatherization of more than 770,000 homes and cleaning 688 square miles of land formerly used for Cold War-era nuclear testing. Many individual companies did benefit directly. The government website that tracks stimulus spending lists 27,226 individual awards under the ""Energy/Environment"" section, totaling just shy of $34 billion. The Department of Energy this June specified ""33 clean energy projects"" of a larger scale as part of its ""loans program."" Of those, financing had been ""closed"" on 20 of them. The intent was to promote new technologies and approaches, not necessarily old ones. There are also other things such as high speed rail and smart meters -- which are listed elsewhere, under ""Infrastructure,"" as part of the same overarching stimulus legislation. Accounting for things like that, a report from the Brookings Institution non-partisan think tank this April tabbed the total green stimulus spending at $51 billion. Then, there's the matter of whether half of those companies that have gotten money ""have gone out of business."" A few recipients of the government funds have hit hard times. The most well-known of them is solar panel maker Solyndra, which received a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy. Two years later, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Fact Check: Oil and natural gas production under Obama . Still, it is unclear where Romney got his figure that ""half"" those businesses are no longer operating. The Energy Department cites several success stories like one of the world's largest wind farms in eastern Oregon, massive solar power plants in Arizona and grants to Ford to produce fuel-efficient cars. In fact, of the 28 funded projects -- involving 23 companies -- listed in a 2012 congressional report, only four involve businesses that were either sold or are not in operation. Conclusion: . It is fair to say that the 2009 stimulus authorized $90 billion for green energy, as Romney asserted. Whether or not one terms these as ""breaks"" is subjective, and one shouldn't assume that all the funds went to specific businesses like Solyndra. Most of the large projects that benefited from the Department of Energy loan program remain in operation -- contrary to Romney's assertion that ""almost half"" of them had closed. Complete coverage of CNN's Fact Checks . CNN's Julie In and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Mitt Romney decries ""$90 billion in breaks to the green energy world""

"(CNN) -- As tensions escalate on the eastern border of Ukraine, President Barack Obama has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government ""to cease all efforts to undermine and destabilize"" the sovereign nation after the movement of Russian troops into Ukraine and its annexing of Crimea. Meanwhile, our European allies continue round-the-clock conversations as the political leadership in Kiev is seemingly helpless to stave off the next potential military land grab. This is the backdrop to a legislative endeavor in Kiev that, although widely unreported in the West, will fundamentally reshape the world community's dialogue on the Ukrainian crisis. Two of Ukraine's leading political parties, ""Fatherland"" and ""Strike,"" have jointly introduced a bill in Parliament that calls for the rejection of the country's 1994 accession to the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Russia's disregard of international law, its apparent successful theft of Crimea and Ukraine's desperate attempt at self-preservation may result in the end of one of the last century's most important diplomatic milestones, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and with it, the efforts of a generation to walk back the spread of nuclear weapons. Infographic: A divided Ukraine . A new global nuclear arms race may soon begin, and the world will have Putin to thank. In 1994, Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United States and the United Kingdom entered into an agreement to remove former Soviet nuclear weapons from Ukraine, later known as the Budapest Memorandum. Ukraine agreed to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty. In the history of nuclear weapons, only four states have ever walked away from nuclear capabilities: three post-Soviet states (Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan) and South Africa, which had covertly developed a nuclear weapons arsenal. Ukraine's actions were not without significant commitments, however, by the other signatories. Russia, the U.S. and the UK pledged in part ""to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine"" and ""reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine."" Today, Russia's policies and actions toward Ukraine's Crimea region demonstrate complete disregard for this critically important memorandum and international law. As a response, some within the Ukrainian government are looking beyond an immediate call for Western help to a more proactive means of guaranteeing their national security, i.e. regaining nuclear weapons status. Opinion: Goodbye, good luck to Ukraine? The recently introduced legislation is the latest expression of the growing sentiment that a nuclear Ukraine is a protected Ukraine. Mustafa Dzhemilev, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament since 1998, recently said he had spoken directly with Putin and told him that because of Russia's breaking of the Budapest Memorandum, ""such arrangements will not be trusted by anyone anymore, and that each country that has financial capacity to acquire its own nuclear weapons will be aspired to go down that path, and Ukraine is no exception."" In addition, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Vladimir Ogryzko recently said, ""Ukraine needs to announce that it is walking away from the NPT and immediately restart the full nuclear cycle and manufacturing of all the components of the weapons."" Ironically, the notion of reacquiring nuclear weapons as a security guarantee is a position publicly advocated by Putin himself: ""If you cannot count on international law, then you must find other ways to ensure your security. ... This is logical: If you have the bomb, no one will touch you."" These words were written by Putin to the American people in the context of U.S. policy toward Syria in a New York Times opinion piece from September 11. Opinion: U.S. giving Putin green light in Ukraine? Today, less than six months later, Putin's decision to disregard a critical agreement in violation of international law -- and in disregard of his own logic -- has set in motion a discussion that could have dire security implications on the Korean peninsula, in Tehran, in South Asia and anywhere nations are weighing the nuclear option for their security posture. The actions of Russia and Ukraine over the next few weeks have the potential to alter the global nuclear weapons dynamic in a profound and extremely dangerous way. One probable and immediate consequence of a Ukrainian choice to ""go nuclear"" would be that Belarus, a Ukrainian neighbor and close Kremlin ally, would also choose to return to its pre-treaty nuclear weapons status through the development of indigenous weapons or, even more likely, invite the placement of Russian nuclear weapons within its borders. Given Belarus' borders with EU member states Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, this would probably lead to EU and NATO reactions and a reversal of European nuclear stability trends not seen since the Non-Proliferation Treaty entered into force in March 1970. Putin has sent a clear message to the more than 25 non-nuclear states possessing the technical capabilities to join the nuclear weapons club that the stick of nuclear arms and not the carrot of international law is what guarantees national security. In the New York Times, he wrote, ""Preserving law and order in today's complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos. The law is still the law, and we must follow it whether we like it or not."" It should be the hope of every nation that the crisis in Ukraine is quickly and peacefully resolved and that Putin takes his own words to heart, reversing a course that leads to a world where the phrase ""nuclear arms race"" is not relegated only to the past.","Three scholars fear that Russian actions in Ukraine may force new nuclear dynamic .

"(CNN) -- The president of one of the world's most famous football clubs is facing jail after being sentenced for tax evasion. Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness was found guilty by a German court Thursday and sentenced to three years and six months. Hoeness, 62, admitted to evading â‚¬28.4 million ($39.6 million) in taxes on income earned in secret Swiss bank accounts. Hoeness was initially charged with evading â‚¬3.5 million ($4.87 million) but that increased to $39.6 million during the trial. State prosecutor Achim von Engel had called for a prison sentence of five-and-a-half years for Hoeness on seven counts of tax evasion. Former Germany international Hoeness, a member of the 1972 European Championship winners and 1974 World Cup winning side, enjoyed a stellar career with Bayern. He won three Bundesliga titles and three European Cups while playing for the German giant. Hoeness will appeal the verdict, his defense lawyer, Hanns Feigen, told reporters outside the court. The notice of appeal must be handed to the Supreme Court in Karlsruhe (the court that will deal with the case) by March 20.","Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness facing jail for tax evasion .

"(CNN) -- WTH John Travolta? By most estimations, the Oscars show was somewhat staid this year. Some of Ellen DeGeneres' jokes fell flat, no one got bleeped, and at one point whatever was happening on Amy Adams' phone was way more interesting than the actual show. But there were a few things that happened that the Internet has fallen in love with -- other than Ellen's selfie, we mean. Things like: . 1) John Travolta, learn to pronounce Idina Menzel, please . Perhaps he is not a Broadway fan or missed all of the hubbub about ""Frozen."" Whatever the reason, John Travolta butchered singer Idina Menzel's name while introducing her performance of the Oscar-winning song ""Let It Go"" from ""Frozen."" Suddenly ""Uh-deen-a Men-zelle"" became ""the wickedly talented"" ""Adele Dazeem."" Umm, what? Dude, that wasn't even close. We expected better from someone who started his intro with ""There will always be a special place in my heart for the movie musical."" 2) That pizza guy . Yep, that was an honest-to-goodness pizza delivery that happened during the show. Ellen joked about sending out for some pies, and sure enough, a deliveryman from Big Mama's & Papa's Pizzeria appeared. He didn't give his name, but word is his co-workers were cheering for him. ""Who's your favorite movie star? They're here,"" Ellen quipped to him. Of course she passed the hat (Pharrell's, naturally) to take up a collection for his tip, though it looks like he left without collecting it. The chain, which has stores throughout Los Angeles, wasted no time in tweeting about the delivery, as did pregnant actress Kerry Washington, who DeGeneres wanted to make sure got a slice. ""Yes! @TheEllenShow - There IS gluten-free pizza!!!!"" Washington tweeted. 3) '12 Years a Slave' beef? Kudos to John Ridley for winning the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for ""12 Years a Slave."" But he noticeably did not thank the film's director, Steve McQueen. And McQueen's reaction in the audience to Ridley's win didn't look very joyous. Actually, it appeared that at some points McQueen's hands didn't even touch and instead there was a faux-clap. Wow. Hollywood journalist Nikke Finke tweeted that her sources were ""attributing John Ridley-Steve McQueen cold shoulder at Oscars tonight to dispute over screenplay credit."" 4) No love for Leo . Once again Leonardo DiCaprio was passed over for an Academy Award, and once again fans roared. DiCaprio lost the best actor award to Matthew McConaughey, and many were not pleased. It marks the fourth snub by the Oscars for Leo, who was nominated this year for ""Wolf of Wall Street"" but has previously lost with nominations for ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""The Aviator"" and ""Blood Diamond."" ""Poor Leo you could see he is trying to hold back the tears,"" tweeted one fan with a pic of what looked to be a dejected Leo responding to his name not being called. And then there was the ""And this is where I'd put my Oscar ... if I had one"" illustration of the actor. Better luck next year? 5) Pharrell comes up short(s) Yes, it is Los Angeles, where it's sunny and warm, and maybe Pharrell was just overjoyed that the Oscars red carpet was spared the predicted rainstorm. Otherwise, we have no way of understanding why Pharrrell Williams showed up in shorts. The singer-songwriter-producer and his wife appeared on the red carpet with her in a feminized version of a tux, and him in formal wear only from the waist up. He may have been ""Happy"" with his fashion choice, but many weren't. ""No, Pharrell. JUST NO. NEVER. #Oscars,"" said one tweet. ""Pharell is slowly turning into a park ranger,"" tweeted one viewer, who clearly was paying homage to our favorite Pharrell fashion item, his Smokey the Bear-like hat. We would like to think Pharrell made up for it with his rousing performance of his song ""Happy"" from ""Despicable Me 2,"" which got the crowd moving. After all, anyone who can get Meryl Streep to shimmy can't be all bad, right?","John Travolta totally messed up the pronunciation of ""Idina Menzel""

"Washington (CNN) -- The deaths of five infants and more than 70 reports of children nearly falling out of a popular infant recliner have the federal government looking to stop the sales and manufacture of the product. The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced Wednesday it filed an administrative complaint against Baby Matters, LLC, after discussions with the company and its representatives seeking a voluntary recall plan broke down. The recliners, manufactured by Baby Matters, LLC, based in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, include the Nap Nanny and Nap Nanny Chill infant models. The CPSC alleges parents who continue to use the products are putting their infants at significant risk of injury and death. ""My heart goes out to the parents and families of children who are injured or lose their lives in incidents associated with consumer products,"" CPSC Commissioner Nancy Nord said in a statement released in conjunction with the agency's announcement. The complaint seeks a court order requiring the company to notify the public about the defect and offer consumers a full refund. CNN contacted Baby Matters, LLC, but did not receive a response. The administrative complaint, a charging document used by the courts, is the latest in an ongoing dispute between the government and Baby Matters over the safety of the recliners. In July 2010, Baby Matters and the CPSC issued a joint recall and refund of the company's Nap Nanny Generation One recliner. There was one death and 22 reports of infants hanging or falling out over the side of the Nap Nanny regardless of whether parents used the harness as instructed, the CPSC said. ""I joined my colleagues in voting to issue the complaint because I believe that the legal theory described in the complaint concerning the reasonably foreseeable misuse of Baby Matters' products deserves a thorough vetting by an administrative law judge,"" Nord said. Despite design improvements, warnings and instructions to the company's Generation Two model and Nap Nanny Chill recliner, there have been four more fatalities, the CPSC alleged. The Nap Nanny recliner is designed for sleeping, resting and playing and includes a shaped foam base with an inclined indentation for the baby to sit and a fitted fabric cover with a three-point harness, the CPSC said. Five thousand Nap Nanny Generation One and 50,000 Generation Two models were sold between 2009 and early 2012 and have been discontinued. One hundred thousand Chill models have been sold since January 2011, according to the CPSC. All were priced around $130.

Several sculpted actors were nominated for ""best shirtless performance,"" including Chris Hemsworth, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sam Claflin, and the lone female Jennifer Aniston for her strip tease in ""We're the Millers."" But the prize went to a fit Zac Efron for a bedroom scene in ""That Awkward Moment."" Presenters Jessica Alba and Rita Ora warned that the winner better show off the assets and come up onstage sans top. But Efron ignored the mandate and began accepting his award very much covered by his shirt -- that is until Rita snuck up behind him and ripped open the front of his blue button-up. The ""Awkward Moment"" actor played along, pulling his shirt off while blowing kisses to the audience who weren't disappointed with the reveal of the tan and toned 6-pack that won him the prize. No. 4: Seth Rogen shares a smooch with his mom . Dave Franco, Seth Rogen, and Zac Efron took the stage to present the steamy category of ""best kiss."" To kick off the smooching shenanigans they held their own kissing contest, where they announced that three lucky audience members had a golden ticket that won them some lip time with the stars. Two beautiful young women bounded to the stage to claim their kisses with Franco and Efron ... but the third woman looked a little too familiar to Rogen. ""Wait a minute, that's my mom!"" he yelled. ""Mom, no, go back to your seat Mom!"" Yet with all three women onstage, the men delivered and Rogen, not one to back down on his word, completely sucked face with his mother on live national television. Or, at least the woman pretending to be his mother. Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts, and Will Poulter were awarded the golden popcorn for ""best kiss"" for their three-way make out session in ""We're The Millers."" No. 3: Channing Tatum and Mark Wahlberg take home two big prizes . Two of the evening's biggest honors went to leading men Channing Tatum and Mark Wahlberg. Tatum won the Trailblazer Award for his diverse roles in funny, romantic, and action-packed films. As his buddy Jonah Hill said while presenting Tatum the award, ""What's more trailblazing than an attractive man becoming a movie star, eh?"" Tatum danced his way up to the stage to accept the honor, and gave a heartwarming speech of sincere thanks -- until he was silenced -- by Conan O'Brien's picture of his privates. Yes, the comedian found a way to keep chatty celebrities quiet; loading a dirty picture of himself smiling and pantless into the teleprompter. Mark Wahlberg was honored with the ""Generation Award"" for his varied work over the course of his career. During his acceptance speech, the 42-year-old former rapper brought back his bad-boy side by dropping an F-bomb whenever he could. Joking that the ""Generation Award"" meant he was past his prime and too old for a comeback, Wahlberg quipped, ""This is not the Channing Tatum 'You're dancing around, chicks want you' award. This is the 'You're f***g-done award. But look, it was a great run!'"" But his career is not really over yet. The cast of ""Entourage"" presented Wahlberg with his award, and the new ""Entourage"" movie hits theaters in 2015. No. 2: Eminem and Rihanna give a 'Monster' performance . Even though the MTV Movie Awards are all about the silver screen, Rihanna and Eminem's musical performance of their hit ""The Monster"" had viewers and stars alike buzzing. Rihanna kicked off the smash hit backed by a live band, wearing an all-white dress and a FEAR headband. She was soon joined by Eminem, who made his entrance onstage amongst flashing red lights. It was the first time Slim Shady and the Barbados Babe have performed their smash hit on television, offering a sneak peak of their upcoming mini-tour set to hit New York, Los Angeles, and Detroit this summer. Other performances of the night included Ellie Goulding, Zedd, and twenty one pilots. No. 1: 'Catching Fire' takes top prize . The biggest honor at the MTV Movie Awards is the ""Best Movie of the Year,"" and this year the golden popcorn statuette for the prize went to ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."" Johnny Depp presented the award to ""Catching Fire"" stars Sam Claflin and Josh Hutcherson. Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence, who did not attend, also took home Best Male and Female Performances. After winning the top prize of the night, Claflin thanked all the fans of the franchise, while Hutcherson went on to acknowledge the hundreds of people whose hard work went into making the blockbuster. He also acknowledged his fellow cast member, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died of acute mixed drug intoxication in February. ""I know if Philip were here, he'd think this was really cool,"" Hutcherson said. ""He's one of the actors I look up to most in my life, so wherever he is, this goes out to him as well.""","The awards were held Sunday in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- Brrrrr. Much has been said about the Super Bowl's outdoor setting this arctic winter. But no matter what unfolds at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, adjacent New York City will be fired up to host hordes of visitors. If you've snagged tickets to Super Bowl XLVIII, lucky you. Maybe you don't have tickets but will be in town to witness the football frenzy. Or maybe you hate the sport and can only keep your game face on for so long before you seek refuge in everything else the city offers. Spruce Goose's bizarre story . Here's some play-by-play action for fans -- and ideas for nonfans. And yes, there are winter festivals and events planned in New Jersey for the big week, but we're guessing you'll be spending most of your time exploring New York. Hail Mary: There might not be a dome at the Super Bowl, but you can raise the roof at the 15th annual NFL-sanctioned Super Bowl Gospel Celebration at Madison Square Garden on January 31, kicking off Super Bowl weekend with headliner Patti LaBelle. The longest yard: The 50 Yard Lounge food and wine festival will take over Penn Plaza, just outside Madison Square Garden, for Super Bowl week, with a giant tent, heated roof decks and football-related culinary and sports events. Football legends such as Doug Flutie will make appearances. All-day passes begin at $400. Block party: Times Square will be transformed into Super Bowl Boulevard with a free autograph stage, concerts and photo ops with the famed Vince Lombardi Trophy. The blockslong festival, between 33rd and 44th streets, will run from noon to 10 p.m. Wednesday to February 1; events are free with the exception of a toboggan run for $5. Stop by NYC & Company's booth for event and activities info or visit its website. Football at the Met: Even New York's storied museums are getting in on the action. Check out the Metropolitan Museum of Art's ""Gridiron Greats"" exhibit of vintage football cards. Oompah and beer: New York has more beer gardens than you can shake a pretzel at, and the Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden in Astoria, Queens, is one of the oldest. Beginning at 4 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday, an indoor tailgate party will kick off. Chug-a-lug $10 pitchers of frothy beer such as Stella to wash down schnitzel and knackwurst while cheering on your team. Sip and tuck: NFL personalities and legends will be huddled at the legendary Waldorf Astoria, and the hotel's illustrious Peacock Alley will be a see-and-be-scene spot to sip a specialty cocktail themed for the two teams by house mixologist Frank Caiafa. The landmark hotel, which has also had an uptick in reservations from ""football widows"" throughout the football season at its Guerlain Spa, will offer the ""Just the Girls"" spa package on Super Bowl Sunday, which includes a manicure and pedicure, massage or facial, makeup refresh and two cocktails. Booze cruise: Norwegian Cruise Line's Getaway, christened the Bud Light Hotel, will be docked next to the USS Intrepid, offering lodging and entertainment. Note: Rooms at the Bud Light Hotel are not available for purchase; consumers can win hotel rooms through Bud Light promotions. Lodging at the floating hotel will be available Thursday through the morning of February 3. Blood falls and other natural oddities . Football schmootball . Not really into the game? Here are some ideas to intercept the Super Bowl events. Game play: Take advantage of a Broadway Week Winter 2014 two-for-one tickets promotion. You can get a free ticket for the price of one at 26 shows such as ""Pippin"" and ""Waiting for Godot."" Happy New Year: It's the Year of the Horse, and the 15th annual Chinatown Lunar New Year Parade & Festival will kick off at 1 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday at Mott and Hester streets, with colorful floats, dancing lions and dragons and marching bands. Super bowl: Maybe your idea of a super bowl can be found at Bowlmor, one of the city's most popular bowling destinations, with locations in Times Square and Union Square. Beyond a shadow of a doubt: February 2 also happens to be Groundhog Day, and the Staten Island Zoo will open early at 6:30 a.m. so that Chuck the Groundhog, accompanied by a band, can spy on his shadow (fingers crossed he doesn't) at 7 a.m. Kids will want to stick around to have breakfast with Chuck. Bonus: Take the free ferry ride over for mind-bending views of New York's skyline. Baseball: Maybe you do love the Super Bowl for one reason and one reason only -- it marks the end of football season, meaning baseball is on deck. Check out Foleys NY, a pub with enough memorabilia to rival Cooperstown, including 1,800 autographed balls. Make no mistake, though, this popular Irish bar will undoubtedly be a hot spot for the Super Bowl action, too. Get a bye: There's no better day to shop than Super Bowl Sunday; the stores are practically empty. Hit up Macy's (be a sport and check out the custom NFL shop on the fourth floor) or score a deal at Bloomingdale's (Bloomie's windows will display 48 designer, haute couture helmets, part of the NFL Foundation fundraiser). Skate around it: Twirl figure eights at one of the many outdoor rinks, including Rockefeller Center, Central Park and the Standard hotel at the High Line. The artful dodger: Go museum hopping. Take in the ""Charles Marville: Photographer of Paris"" exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the ""American Legends: From Calder to O'Keeffe"" exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

"(CNN) -- It's not news that looks matter. Depending on how attractive people think we are, we may have at times found ourselves dateless or overwhelmed with unwanted attention. Studies have indeed shown that people attribute more intelligence and competence to taller, well-turned-out or otherwise good-looking people. However, a new briefing paper by the Council on Contemporary Families tell us life's uneven distribution of beauty counts in an even more poignant place than we may have considered: in school evaluations of our children by teachers and peers. In a recently releasted briefing report, ""In School, Good Looks Help and Good Looks Hurt (But They Mostly Help)."" sociologists Rachel Gordon and Robert Crosnoe show that in high school, some students -- say, a prom queen and king -- will be rated higher in intelligence, personality and potential for success just because they are considered good-looking. More than that, they will actually get higher grades and be more likely to graduate from college. In fact, the authors, whose the larger study -- published in book form by Wiley -- say that ""the difference in GPA and college graduation rates between youth rated by others as attractive, versus average in looks, is similar to the differences in academic achievement between youth raised in two-parent versus single-parent families."" If the idea that kids get better grades based on ""getting by on looks"" frosts you, wait. This will make you nuts: Based on their findings, Gordon and Crosnoe believe that the effects of beauty (or lack thereof) may last far beyond high school graduation. They say there is a cumulative boost (or loss) of self-esteem about one's own appearance that carries over from high school into college and perhaps over a lifetime. And even though the authors say that beauty has its pitfalls (good-looking men and women, for example, dated more and drank more and some of this had a negative impact on their grades and college success), their conclusion is that, overall, this period of ""lookism"" in high school is important enough to merit the same kind of consciousness-raising discussion given to unfair racial or class stereotypes. If looks translate into higher praise, better grades and even more credit for being warm and sensitive, as the authors found in their research, this is a real boon for the people with the lucky DNA. Each advantage a student has is likely to make that young man or woman feel more self-confident -- and self-confidence is an extraordinary tool to use in adult life. The other side of the coin is what's concerning: There is, as many parents know, the depression and sense of worthlessness a young adult may feel when he or she is not deemed good-looking in high school. It is frightening to think this may lead to a lifetime of feeling awkward, unlovable and inferior. We have all become more sensitive and activist about issues of adolescence we used to ignore. We now know how dangerous bullying is, how destructive depression can be and how important it is to reframe our view of people who have physical or mental disabilities. While we can't mandate that people change their opinion about who is or is not good-looking, we could ask our kids' teachers to be aware of their own tendency to give a higher grade or greater approval to a good-looking kid than to one that is not. We could all bring attention to slang that kids use to assess or denigrate another person's looks. Does this sound too PC? Maybe. But a little sensitivity here wouldn't be a bad thing. Terms such as ""tubby"" or ""skinny"" or ""lame"" or other insult equivalents you may have heard don't need to be leveled at anyone. Young people are acutely aware when they are not the favored ones, and they know that popularity and good looks are usually paired. Moreover, an ambitious student who is attractive might prefer to be complimented on what he or she said or did rather than for appearance. It does them no favor to allow them to think that their looks are their primary and best attribute; it could cause them to be insecure about other aspects of their personality or behavior. Talking openly about this could make it clearer to the people in our children's day-to-day world that their casual remarks can have long-term effects. It can also take some of the sting out of not being in the running for prom king or queen. And here I would suggest that such beauty and popularity contests are a dicey idea for schools in the first place. They have an impact on the impressions and behavior of everyone in the school, even, potentially, teachers. We spend time and energy to make sure our kids are treated fairly in life. Let's help ensure they are not discriminated against -- or given a free ride -- just because of the way they look. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Pepper Schwartz: Study finds edge given attractive people can start in school with teachers .

"(CNN) -- If you were never able to solve a Rubik's Cube without peeling off the stickers or prying it apart with a butter knife, you're really going to hate this robot. Cubestormer 3, a robot built with Legos and powered by a smartphone, shattered its predecessor's record over the weekend, solving the iconic '80s puzzle in just over 3.25 seconds. The lightning-quick feat, pulled off Saturday at the Big Bang Fair in Birmingham, UK, shaved more than two seconds off the former Guinness-recognized world record of 5.27 seconds, accomplished by the same team's Cubestormer 2. That mark narrowly bested the best human time of 5.5 seconds, set by Mats Valk of the Netherlands last year. ""We knew Cubestormer 3 had the potential to beat the existing record, but with the robot performing physical operations quicker than the human eye can see, there's always an element of risk,"" said David Gilday, who built the robots along with co-inventor Mike Dobson. Gilday is an engineer with ARM, the company that makes the souped-up processors in the Samsung Galaxy S4 used to power Cubestormer 3. The phone analyzes the cube and calculates the best sequence of moves to solve it, then instructs the robot's four arms to get to work. Eight Lego Mindstorms EV3 bricks perform motor control and sequencing on the robot. ""In the end, the hours we spent perfecting the robot and ensuring its motor and intelligence functions were properly synchronized paid off,"" Gilday said. ""Our big challenge now is working out if it's possible to make it go even faster."" The cube, originally called the Magic Cube, was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik, a Hungarian architect. It is believed to be the best-selling toy of all time, with more than 350 million cubes sold since it was launched internationally in 1980. According to its makers, any permutation can be solved in 20 moves or fewer. While they were at it, Gilday also set a couple of other Rubik's Cube records over the weekend. Another robot solved a 4-by-4 cube (the regular Rubik's is 3-by-3) in just over 1 minute, 18 seconds, and an intricate 9-by-9 cube became the biggest ever to be solved by a robot, with another machine sorting it in just over 34 minutes.","Smartphone-powered Lego robot sets Rubik's Cube record .

"(CNN) -- The video is as short as it is surprising. A hand tilts a glass bottle containing a red glob of ketchup, which -- instead of oozing out in slow motion or getting stuck -- slides out easily, leaving the bottle nearly spotless. Posted last week, the 20-second clip has been viewed more than 125,000 times on YouTube, prompting dozens of news stories and brightening the spirits of impatient ketchup lovers everywhere. But it's not exactly what Kripa Varanasi had in mind when he and his students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set out to develop a new kind of slippery coating that would help de-ice planes, or keep water droplets from sticking to steam turbines in power plants. ""I never thought a ketchup bottle would make us this famous,"" said Varanasi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. ""We were all focused on [solving] the big problems, like water and energy."" But one of the goals of Varanasi's MIT lab is to develop potential commercial products, not just publish research in academic journals. The coating, which he and his graduate students call LiquiGlide, seemed more immediately viable as a food-packaging product, he said. LiquiGlide is made from a secret cocktail of edible, nontoxic materials that can be sprayed into bottles or other food containers. Videos on the LiquiGlide site show it working its slippery magic on plastic bottles of jelly and mustard, too. ""You could literally scratch it off and eat it,"" Varanasi told CNN in an interview. ""It's that safe."" LiquiGlide first gained attention earlier this month at MIT's $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, an annual forum for launching academic projects into the commercial marketplace, where it won an Audience Award. Now Varanasi and his students are fielding interview requests, talking to bottling companies, filing for patents and planning to launch a startup this summer. An MIT grad student, Dave Smith, will serve as CEO, Varanasi said. As Varanasi sees it, LiquiGlide offers several benefits: It's more convenient for consumers, and it makes recycling easier because the bottles are clean. It also wastes less food, because people won't be tossing out bottles coated with mustard that they can't squeeze out. He also believes LiquiGlide has practical applications beyond condiments, such as high-end cosmetics. Who wants to waste precious drops of $50 hand lotion because they can't get the stuff out of the bottle? ""It works on everything we've tried so far,"" Smith told CNN. Varanasi and his students hope to have their product on supermarket shelves within two years. Right now they have momentum on their side, thanks to a deceptively simple idea, a niche nobody realized needed filling -- and a little video. ""It just went viral,"" Varanasi said. ""The video sold it.""","MIT professor and his students invent nonstick coating that makes ketchup slide out of the bottle .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The man accused of killing an airport security officer last month at Los Angeles International Airport pleaded not guilty Thursday to murdering a federal officer and to 10 other charges. Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, is accused of fatally shooting Transportation Security Administration officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounding two other officers and a passenger on November 1. A Los Angeles police officer shot and wounded Ciancia to end the incident at LAX, the sixth busiest airport in the world, according to authorities. A trial date for Ciancia was set for February 11, but it's unlikely the trial would begin that soon, said U.S. attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek a capital case, which would introduce a possible death penalty in a conviction. ""The decision on whether or not to pursue the death penalty in this case is multi-layered and begins with the trial lawyers in Los Angeles and ends with the U.S. attorney general,"" Mrozek said. A grand jury on December 17 indicted Ciancia on a charge of murdering a federal officer, two counts of attempted murder of a federal officer and eight firearms-related charges. According to the criminal complaint against Ciancia, he allegedly entered Terminal 3 at the Los Angeles airport, pulled out a .223-caliber M&P-15 semiautomatic rifle and fired several shots point-blank at Hernandez. He began to walk up an escalator, but saw Hernandez move and returned to shoot him again, authorities allege in the complaint. Investigators say Ciancia then fired on two other TSA officers and a passenger, all of whom were wounded, before a Los Angeles police officer chased him down and shot him, according to the complaint. Investigators found a handwritten letter among Ciancia's belongings at the airport addressed to TSA employees, saying the shootings were meant to ""instill fear in your traitorous minds."" The note said he had made a ""conscious decision to try to kill"" TSA workers, according to the complaint. Alerted to troubling text messages sent to his family back East, Los Angeles police officers had gone to check on Ciancia the morning of the shooting but didn't arrive in time. They got to his apartment 52 minutes after the shooting and left without realizing his connection to the incident, according to authorities. Obama visits family of slain TSA officer .

"(CNN) -- Assertive and bold, strong and courageous. These are the words we use when we think of our leaders -- the characteristics we look for when we elect politicians, vet CEOs or select captains of sports teams. Yet throughout history, these terms have been primarily applied when men have occupied leadership roles. We expect men to lead and assert themselves, and we encourage and reward these behaviors when young boys exhibit them. So why is it when a young girl exhibits these exact same characteristics, we often resort to a different word to describe her behavior? A word that says to young girls: These are not the behaviors we expect from you. Why do we call her ""bossy""? It seems like a little thing -- it's just a word after all. Plus, shouldn't we be teaching our children that words matter less than actions or deeds? But words have power and meaning, especially during the critical early grade-school years, when boys and girls alike are developing their sense of self and finding their place in the world. According to the Girl Scouts Research Institute Ban Bossy National Youth Poll 2014, more than a third of girls who are called ""bossy"" lose interest in leading and stop making decisions or suggestions. Children begin to establish gender role stereotypes as early as 2 years old and generate an emerging career identity by middle school. As early as the third grade, girls report anxiety about taking leadership roles, become overly concerned about pleasing others and aspire to be perfect. By the time they reach middle school, the damage is done. A 2003 study by Simmons College notes that by the early teen years, more boys than girls report that they aspire to leadership roles in future careers, and millennial women are less likely to say they ""aspire to a leadership role in whatever field I ultimately work."" Whether intentional or not, the message is clear: Society is both actively and passively discouraging girls from exhibiting leadership qualities, and that is translating to a generation of girls afraid to take the reins of leadership for fear of being disliked. And that is a loss for all of us. We can no longer afford to have half the population sidelined, their skills and their insight ignored, because of the messages they received as girls. That is why at Girl Scouts, we have teamed up with Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to launch our ""Ban Bossy"" campaign: a call for society to stop calling girls who exhibit leadership ""bossy"" and instead encourage and reward those behaviors the same way we would for boys. Opinion: Sheryl Sandberg wrong on bossy ban . As the premier leadership organization for girls in the country, the Girl Scouts have been doing this for 102 years. We've found that women's leadership journeys begin as girls, and their future depends on receiving the same kind of encouragement and support boys receive when they demonstrate leadership capacities in life. I know how limiting words can be. As a young Latina growing up in small-town Arizona, I watched as my mother tried to break the conventions of her time and place, running for the local school board when it was unheard of for a female, let alone a Hispanic female, to do so. I watched and listened as people, including family and friends, tried to discourage her from running. But I was fortunate, because I also saw my father support my mom and her ambitions. When he was told he had to make sure his wife knew her place, he responded that her place was to lead. Words can hurt or heal; they can shape our perceptions and either encourage our ambitions or limit our understanding of what we can become. When we refer to a girl who demonstrates leadership qualities as ""bossy,"" she receives a message she is doing something wrong, that somehow, the same behaviors we praise and reward in boys are inappropriate for her, and we are limiting the scope of her potential as a result. So the next time you have the urge to call a little girl ""bossy,"" stop, take a breath and say, ""She's a leader."" It's time to redirect the power of words to girls themselves, so that ""girl"" and ""leader"" mean one and the same. It's time to ""Ban Bossy."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anna Maria Chávez.","Anna Maria Chávez: Leadership traits include being assertive, bold, strong and courageous .

"(CNN) -- They've been spotted and spotted again, those objects in the southern Indian Ocean. Every time a report comes out that something has been seen that may be related to missing Malaysia Flight 370, hopes have risen. And then, they have fallen. It's seemed like a daily exercise. For instance, images taken by a Thai satellite and released Thursday showed about 300 objects ranging in size from 6 feet (2 meters) to 50 feet (15 meters). When photographed Monday, they were about 125 miles (201 kilometers) away from the spot where a French satellite captured images of a floating group of objects Sunday. Could it be? Knowing for sure is a waiting game. It will be at least Friday before planes can try to find the materials because bad weather in the remote spot has again hampered searching. Here's a rundown of how many times we've been through this: . On March 9, Vietnam's navy spotted a floating object about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Vietnam's Tho Chu Island, which is off the country's southwest coast in the Gulf of Thailand, Vietnam National Search and Rescue Committee spokesman Hung Nguyen told CNN. Vietnamese navy rescue aircraft spotted the object in the evening hours local time. Because of the dark, the navy aircraft could not get close enough to identify the floating object and was recalled to base. Three search and rescue boats were deployed to that location. Several days later, a Chinese satellite had a sighting that captured a lot of interest but it was later retracted as a mistake. It was not in the southern Indian ocean. China said it captured a ""suspected floating object"" on March 18. The object the Chinese photographed was 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide (74 feet by 43 feet), officials said. Around March 19, it was reported that witnesses on the ground claimed they saw Flight 370. A man from New Zealand working on an oil rig off Vietnam claimed he saw a burning object in the sky on the morning of March 8, hours after the plane had taken off from Kuala Lumpur on its way to Beijing. Then came reports that had many believing ""This is it!"" and headlines carried the news. But it turned out to be nothing. On March 20, CNN quoted Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott as saying that authorities had spotted two objects in the Indian Ocean that were possibly related to the search for missing Flight 370. Those objects have not been found. During a March 22 search, a civil aircraft reported that it had spotted some small objects floating, including a wooden pallet, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said. These objects were within a radius of about three miles. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion was sent to the area, but only reported seeing bunches of seaweed, AMSA said. On March 24, Australian officials said they saw two objects in the southern Indian Ocean that could be related to the flight. One object was ""a gray or green circular object,"" and the other was ""an orange rectangular object,""according to AMSA. Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, appeared on CNN to explain why those objects seemed intriguing. Read her comments . ""The gray/green is the color of the inside of the aircraft,"" she said. ""A great number of pieces of metal and other things in the aircraft are of gray/green color, everything from the metal in the fuselage and pieces of the mechanical parts..."" Orange and bright yellow ""are the color of the emergency escape slides, the life rafts inside the plane,"" she said. ""The life vests, but they wouldn't be that big. So there are many things that are those colors that could be a signal that it's not something that has fallen off a ship but rather that it's something from out of a plane."" The Australian naval ship HMAS Success didn't turn up the objects when it searched Monday night, AMSA said. There is no word yet if those objects have been found or what they are. Also on Monday, a Chinese military plane said it had seen ""suspicious objects"" in the same area.A U.S. surveillance plane sent to follow up was unable to find them. On Wednesday, a French defense firm provided new satellite images that showed 122 objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean, not far from other satellite sightings that could be related to Flight 370, Malaysia's acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Bin Hussein said. The objects were scattered over 154 square miles (400 square kilometers), he said. Hishammuddin said he wasn't sure if Australian authorities coordinating the search for the plane Wednesday had been able to follow up on the new satellite images, which came from Airbus Defence and Space.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Parents who choose a stroller that seats their baby facing away from them could risk long-term development problems in their children, according to a study published Friday. Parents are less likely to interact with children in forward-facing strollers. The research found that children not facing the person pushing them were significantly less likely to talk, laugh and interact with their parents. Based on a study of 2,722 parents and children, the study by Dundee University's School of Psychology calls into question the designs of many of the world's most popular baby strollers. ""Our experimental study showed that, simply by turning the buggy around, parents' rate of talking to their baby doubled,"" said developmental psychologist Suzanne Zeedyk, who led the research. Zeedyk's study, published by British charity National Literacy Trust, included an experiment in which 20 babies were wheeled in buggies for a mile, spending half the trip facing their parents and the other half facing away, . Parents using face-to-face strollers were more likely to talk to their children, who were less likely to exhibit signs of stress, the study said. ""Our data suggests that for many babies today, life in a buggy is emotionally impoverished and possibly stressful,"" Zeedyk said. ""Stressed babies grow into anxious adults."" The study found that 62 percent of all children observed traveled in forward-facing prams. For children between the ages of one and two, the figure was 86 percent. UK child education campaigners the Sutton Trust say the study highlights the need for manufacturers to rethink the designs of strollers.","University of Dundee study says away-facing buggies can add to baby's stress .

"Liege, Belgium (CNN) -- A grenade and gun attack in this eastern Belgian city left five people dead, including the attacker, and 119 wounded Tuesday, authorities said. A 23-month-old baby died in a hospital late Tuesday after being wounded in the attack near a Christmas market in a city center square, said Katrin Delcourt, a spokeswoman for the Liege provincial governor's office. Others killed in the attack included two teenage boys, aged 15 and 17, and a 75-year-old woman, Liege public prosecutor Danielle Reynders told reporters. Some 52 people were treated for injuries by medics at a field hospital set up near the scene, the prosecutor said, while others went to hospitals in the area. Police fear the death toll will rise overnight, a spokeswoman for Liege police said. The attacker was identified as Nordine Amrani, 33, of Liege, Reynders said. He died in the attack in which he hurled three grenades and fired weapons from a rooftop into the crowded square near a court building, she said. The man acted alone in the attack in Place St. Lambert, and police are not looking for other suspects, she said, adding that he had left his home with a pistol, a semi-automatic rifle and the grenades in his bag. Police had asked the attacker, who had been previously convicted on drugs and weapons offenses, to come in for an interview in an ongoing investigation, the prosecutor said. He had never been charged with terror offenses. Reynders said officials were not yet able to explain the motive for the attack. Delcourt, the spokeswoman for the provincial governor's office, told CNN that Amrani was on conditional parole. She could not give details of the police investigation. It remained unclear whether he had committed suicide or had died when one of the grenades exploded in his face, she said. One of the weapons he had, a light automatic rifle, is a standard-issue weapon in the Belgian army, Delcourt said. A senior Belgian security source, who has been briefed on the investigation but did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that Amrani's police meeting scheduled Tuesday was for suspected rape. Amrani was on an elevated walkway above the square when he began throwing grenades down into the crowd and then firing, before shooting himself in the head with his revolver, the source said. Amrani was previously in prison on drugs and arms racketeering charges, the source said, having been caught cultivating ""several thousand"" cannabis plants. Authorities will carry out an autopsy in part to see if he was under influence of drugs during the attack, which has shocked the country and its security service, the source said. He said that during Amrani's 40 months in jail, he was not diagnosed with any mental disorder or seen to be politicized before being released on conditional parole. The source said authorities have found no ties to Islamist terrorism. Liege resident Kevin Hauzeur told CNN that he ducked for cover as he heard a ""huge explosion and two or three gunshots"" in the city center. A lot of people were in the area at the time to shop at the Christmas market, Hauzeur said. The crowd was ""spinning around, crying -- it was really chaotic,"" he said. He said he had seen what appeared to be the body of an attacker before police cleared everyone from the area. Police told him the man had shot himself, Hauzeur said. A CNN correspondent at the scene Tuesday evening said dozens of police in fluorescent jackets remained in the cordoned-off square but it was otherwise deserted. Municipal cleaning vehicles sprayed the central market area with water, he said, overseen by a large Christmas tree, which remained illuminated. Oliver Moch, a spokesman for the Citadelle hospital, the largest in the Liege area, said 31 people injured in the attack had been admitted for treatment there. The Belgian Red Cross also had a team on site in Liege, operations director Gregory Jones told CNN earlier. It was providing psychological support. King Albert II and Queen Paola went to Liege to meet the mayor, provincial governor and workers with the Red Cross and emergency services following the attack, the Belgian royal palace told CNN. Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo also traveled to Liege, his spokesman said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague issued a statement saying: ""There can be absolutely no place for appalling acts of violence such as this in any society, and I condemn this attack in the strongest terms."" Charles Boisoin, whose apartment overlooks the city center, told CNN shortly after the attack that he and his neighbors had been instructed by police not to leave their homes. The city center was virtually deserted and all he could hear and see were helicopters flying overhead, he said. Television footage and images from the scene showed blood on the sidewalk, as well as police officers and vehicles gathered nearby. The provincial governor's office initially said that police were searching for at least one suspect. Liege is Belgium's third-largest city, after Brussels and Antwerp, the national tourist office says. Dating back centuries, it is an important cultural and industrial center for the country.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Police used lasers to track the path of the bullets that Oscar Pistorius fired through a door, killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, a ballistics expert testified Tuesday. Then they checked his height with and without his prosthetic legs, Police Capt. Christian Mangena said. He was on the verge of revealing his conclusions when time ran out and court adjourned for the day. He had time to say that the height of the four bullet holes in the door ranged from 93.5 cm to 104.3 cm above the floor. Without his prosthetic legs on, the double amputee runner's elbow height is 96 cm, Mangena said as the 12th day of the Pistorius murder trial came to an end. The runner maintains that he was not wearing his prosthetics when he killed Steenkamp, and after suggesting at his bail hearing last year that he was wearing them, the prosecution conceded last week that he was not. The one-time South African national hero admits that he killed Steenkamp on February 14, 2013, but pleaded not guilty to murder, saying the killing was a terrible mistake. He thought she was an intruder in his house in the middle of the night, and mistakenly believed he was defending himself, he maintains. That he was not wearing his prosthetics is a vital part of his defense. He argues he was justified in shooting through a toilet room door because he is particularly vulnerable when he is on the stumps of his legs. Photos of victim's wounds . Pistorius listened to much of Tuesday's testimony impassively, but covered his face with his hands and stuffed his fingers in his ears when Mangena talked about needing to see Steenkamp's dead body as part of his investigation. ""I have to see the position of all the injuries sustained,"" the 20-year police veteran said, before leafing through photos of bullet holes in the black sleeveless top she was wearing, her face, and injuries to her body. Pistorius spent hours throwing up in court last week as Steenkamp's injuries were described by the witness who did her autopsy, and later when pictures of her injuries were briefly accidentally flashed on courtroom monitors. Steenkamp's mother June was in court Tuesday, and appeared to be crying when photos of the bathroom where her daughter died were displayed. A police crime scene photographer was on the witness stand for much of the day Tuesday as defense lawyer Barry Roux tried to show that police photos were not reliable evidence. He got the photographer, Bennie van Staden, to say there was definitely no one else in the bathroom with him when he took pictures of the blood-spattered scene, then produced photographs which he said another police officer took in the same room at the same time. Gory details lend trial a 'CSI' flavor . ""You did not see him in the bathroom?"" Roux demanded. ""I did not see him,"" van Staden replied. ""And how big is this bathroom?"" Roux asked incredulously, prompting laughter. ""About six meters by five meters,"" van Staden replied calmly. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel fought back when questioning the photographer later, producing a photograph taken by the officer whom Roux said was in the same room at the same time. ""Are you in this photograph?"" Nel asked. ""No,"" van Staden replied, eliciting a fresh burst of guffaws. Blood evidence . Roux also introduced a statement from another police officer, blood spatter expert Ian van der Nest, to defend his client. Van der Nest's affidavit said the blood he saw in the house was not only ""consistent"" with Pistorius' version of events, but was the ""most probable explanation."" He is on the list of possible prosecution witnesses but has not testified yet. Mangena is the 16th state witness, out of a potential 107. The trial is currently scheduled to run through April 4, take a break, and resume in mid-April. There's no question that Pistorius shot Steenkamp through a bathroom door in his house early on Valentine's Day last year, hitting her with three hollow-tipped bullets, one of which probably killed her almost instantly. Pistorius says he heard a noise in the middle of the night after getting out of bed, did not realize that she had also gotten out of bed, got his gun and shot her by accident. Pistorius first achieved fame as an outstanding double amputee sprinter who runs with special prostheses that earned him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" The case against Pistorius is largely circumstantial, Nel said in his opening statement on March 3. Pistorius and Steenkamp were the only people in his house when he killed her. Nel has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of police officers, experts, neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night, current and former friends of Pistorius' and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots. Neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired. But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done. And the defense says that the sounds neighbors heard were not the gunshots, but a cricket bat hitting the door as he tried to rescue her. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict with the help of two lay people called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. CNN's Robyn Curnow, Brent Swails, Nicola Goulding and Emily Smith contributed to this report.","Ballistics expert, police crime scene photographer on the stand Tuesday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Will the closure of the Interstate 405 in Los Angeles hurt small businesses? The forecasts of gridlock have been alarming, but as a 10-mile stretch of the 405 closes for 53 hours this weekend, businesses say there is a lot more than a traffic jam at stake. ""They are making it out to be a nuclear event,"" hairdresser Jon Condon said. He said city officials have frightened drivers with dire predictions of 50-mile traffic jams. He is closing his Brentwood Village shop this weekend and believes Los Angeles residents will be hunkered down in their homes. ""It's just too much,"" he said, ""too much of a hassle getting here."" Brentwood Village is a quaint upscale shopping area just off the portion of the 405 that is to be closed. Down the street, Janet Danova says no one knows what to expect. ""Some people say it will be crazy busy, some people say it will be dead,"" Danova said. The manager of the Brentwood Village Market says she is optimistic -- mildly. Across town, Adrineh Khechadorian is already lamenting lost business. She operates a party rental service with lots of customers in the west side of Los Angeles, the area most affected by the planned 405 closure. 'Carmaggedon' begins Friday night in L.A. ""We've had two major parties canceled this week,"" Khechadorian told CNN. The hosts, she said, believed their guests would not be willing to brave the traffic. But, according to the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, some business people are hoping to turn the predicted gridlock into gold. Restaurateur Frank Pezeshki has purchased extra food for his burger joint, located in the shadow of the 405, less than a mile from where the freeway will be closed. ""Drivers will be hungry after sitting in traffic all day,"" Pezeshki said. O'Neil Sportswear in Santa Monica is one of dozens of businesses running special ""405"" sales. ""We are hoping to attract local customers,"" Manager Wendy Harrell said. She has few illusions that customers will be lured from across town this weekend. Even artists are hoping that Carmageddon will lead to more exposure for their work. Composer Ken Elkinson is offering free downloads of his ""Music for Commuting."" It was recorded, he says, to ease the tensions of being stuck in southern California's insufferable traffic. And he anticipates that this will be a high-demand weekend for his work. But motorist Rita Longcore offers her own prescription for beating the Carmageddon blues. ""I'm not getting in my car,"" she says.","The weekend closure of the popular Interstate 405 is dubbed the ""Carmageddon""

"(CNN) -- Few people seem eager to return to the news articles they didn't have time to read during the day, and even fewer are willing to pay for that privilege. So to attract new users, Readability began offering its news-inbox service for free starting Tuesday evening. Previously, people had to pay $5 per month to access the tools for saving articles to their accounts and synchronizing them between computers, e-readers, phones and tablets. Readability is in one of several services, which also includes Instapaper and the venture-capital-backed Read It Later, for bookmarking a lengthy article to revisit when in a more leisurely setting. Some people prefer reading on a Kindle or iPad, rather than on a computer or smartphone, and these services typically allow people to customize fonts, strip out ads and other distractions, and read on a device without an Internet connection on, say, a subway ride. In addition to the free Readability service, the New York software developer will also offer an application that runs on the iPhone and iPad. The app should be available in Apple's App Store, also for free, as early as this week, and people will be able to subscribe through the app, Readability co-founder Richard Ziade said in a phone interview. Readability was spun out of consulting firm Arc90. It first launched its subscription Web service in February, and after a disagreement with Apple over financial terms, the company said in March that it would eschew the App Store in favor of tools that could be accessed exclusively through a Web browser. Beyond the inbox service, Readability also offers website publishers a button so that users can choose to read on the site without distractions from ads. About 4.4 million articles are accessed through Readability's system a month, Ziade said. However, Readability's paid service, which is designed to give most of the revenue to the publishers whose links are being read, has only managed to attract between 2,000 and 10,000 subscribers, he said. ""It's been quite clubbish,"" Ziade said. ""We tell you to get your credit card out after, like, the second click, which is unheard of on the Web."" The free version of Readability will limit users' inboxes to 30 articles each, and they won't be able to access links saved in their archive folders until they pay the $5 monthly fee. Sending an inbox full of articles to a Kindle will also require a subscription. A rival, Read It Later, sells its mobile apps for $3. Another called Instapaper, which says it has about a million subscribers, took an alternate route when the one-man startup announced in April that it would stop offering a free version. Founder Marco Arment said then that the free app brought more users but that they were unhappy with the limits imposed on it. As a result, they were publicly tarnishing the app's reputation with negative reviews. Arment, who has advised Readability in the past, declined to comment for this article. In an interview with CNN in May, he said, ""I think a lot of people are getting a little bit tired of what comes along with being free."" A greater concern for these small software companies is the lion in the room. Starting in the latest Mac operating system called Lion, Apple added a feature called Reading List to its Safari browser allowing users to temporarily save links. The newest iPad and iPhone software then allows users to freely access those same articles and by clicking a button called Reader, removes the ads. Apple's Reader tool happens to be based on the work at Arc90 that eventually became Readability. Arment has said, in his optimistic view, that the recent developments at Apple could introduce more people to the concept of article inboxes, and when they want more powerful features, maybe they'll buy Instapaper. However, Ziade sees Apple's moves as competition, but he said Apple leaves an opening for other apps to flourish because the Safari tools won't work on every platform. Readability is soldiering on, and the company will begin allowing developers to build apps that integrate deeply with its service. It is holding a New York event on Thursday to announce a major partnership with Longform.org. ""There's a real surge of interest in long-form, generally, on the Web,"" said Matthew Howard, a director for the New York Review of Books. ""It's kind of exciting to have these tools coming out that are bringing new readers to this kind of stuff.""","Readability is making its news-inbox free .

"(CNN) -- When Anthony DiSimone and Darleen Cerzosie saw fire engulfing a multifamily home on their densely packed Staten Island street early Thursday, the New Yorkers -- engaged to be married -- sprang into action. They called the fire department and ran to knock on doors to alert everyone to the danger. The situation was grim on the second floor of 203 Chestnut Avenue; a family was trapped. ""The father was upstairs where the fire started, and he was stuck up there,"" DiSimone said. ""He was dangling his son outside, and he couldn't do anything, the black smoke was just billowing out that window."" DiSimone, who said the boy is around 5 years old, said he shouted up to his neighbor: ""I said just throw him out, throw him out!"" And that's what the father did. ""I went underneath and caught his son. He threw him right to me; I caught his son,"" he said. But the father needed to get his daughter -- who DiSimone says is about 3 -- to safety as well. ""I gave (the boy) to another guy, and then (the father) brought out his daughter,"" he said. ""My fiancee, Darleen, she actually caught the daughter."" The father eventually escaped the multifamily home, he said. No one was killed, but 34 people -- 23 of them firefighters -- were injured in the five-alarm blaze, which is now under control, said Frank Dwyer, a Fire Department of New York spokesman. One of those was Cerzosie, who hurt her shoulder catching the little girl. FDNY fire marshals are investigating the cause of the blaze, Dwyer said.

"(EW.com) -- At the annual Nickelodeon upfront presentation last week, Ã¼ber-producer Michael Bay revealed details for Platinum Dunes' upcoming live-action ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie, including a new origin story for the half-shell heroes that is sure to raise the ire of diehard fans. ""When you see this movie, kids are going to believe one day these turtles actually do exist when we are done with this movie,"" said Bay as he took the stage to discuss his new vision for the reptilian reboot. ""These turtles are from an alien race, and they are going to be tough, edgy, funny and completely loveable."" In the original mythology, four baby turtles fall into the sewer and come into contact with glowing radioactive ooze, which mutates them into four bad-a** warriors trained in ninjutsu by astute rodent Splinter. But could the rewriting of the Turtles' origin story dissuade some fans from embracing the newest incarnation? A comic book-to-movie adaptation's worst nightmare is bad pre-publicity, and Bay may have generated that in about 30 words. On the flip side, it might seem outrageous to non-fans of the series that ""Teenage Mutant Ninja"" purists are offended by the new mythos of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo. Truth, we might sound a wee bit ridiculous when we cry out, ""I can't believe Bay says they're aliens when they're obviously derived from radioactive slime!"" But Bay is essentially erasing almost 30 years of love for transmogrified adolescent reptile ninjas by claiming each turtle is less of a fearsome, fighting toxic anomaly and more of a forest green E.T. with nunchucks. What would Shredder think!? How does this new origin story make you feel? Are you a purist for the original backstory, or will you embrace Bay's vision? And who would you cast for this live-action TMNT reboot? Personally, I think Splinter's a toss-up between Morgan Freeman and Kate Upton.

"(CNN) -- The remaining scaffolding around the Washington Monument will begin to come down this week. The monument will officially reopen on May 12, the National Park Service announced Tuesday. One of Washington's most popular sites, the monument was closed on August 23, 2011, after a 5.8 magnitude earthquake caused more than 150 cracks in the structure. The $15 million restoration project took nearly three years to complete. The National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall are planning to host a reopening ceremony at 10 a.m. ET On May 12. Public tours will begin that day at 1 p.m., and tickets will be made available on a first-come, first-served basis that morning at the Washington Monument Lodge. Photos: Cherry blossom time in DC . Starting April 16, tickets for tours on future dates will be available at the park service's reservation page, www.recreation.gov.

"(CNN) -- When Alan Gross reaches his 65th birthday next month, he will tell himself that it will be the last one he spends in a Cuban prison cell, Gross' attorney said Wednesday. ""His hunger strike took a toll on him,"" Gross' attorney Scott Gilbert told CNN during a trip to Havana to visit his client. ""He told me yesterday that his birthday that he marks on May 2 would be the last birthday that he marks in Havana."" Gross is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing satellite communications equipment to Cuba as part of his work as a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was convicted in March 2011. U.S. officials said Gross was merely trying to help Cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on Internet access. But Cuban authorities say Gross was part of a plot to create ""a Cuban spring"" and destabilize the island's single-party communist government. ""He was sent to Cuba five times on a government mission and on a government mission that was blatantly illegal under Cuba law,"" Gilbert said. ""He was arrested, he was convicted, he was sentenced to 15 years in confinement, and to date, our government has done virtually nothing to obtain his release."" Earlier this month, Gross embarked on a nine-day hunger strike after reports surfaced that after his arrest, USAID had tried to create ""a Cuban Twitter"" using cellphone text messaging services on the island. Cuban officials responded angrily, saying the text-messaging program showed that Washington was still trying to subvert the island's government. While USAID and State Department officials defended the now-inactive program as a way to reach the Cuban people, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy said it had put Gross at greater risk. Gross later said he was suspending his hunger strike after his mother pleaded him to begin eating again. Since his arrest, Gross has suffered a slew of health problems, his attorney said, and lost over 100 pounds. ""Alan is confined to one room, 23 hours a day, he spends his day there in pajamas, he's fed meals in his room. He's let out for an hour a day, to exercise an hour a day in a small, walled courtyard where you can barely see the sky."" Cuban officials have said they want to negotiate Gross' case with representatives of the United States in conjunction with the fates of three Cuban intelligence operatives serving lengthy sentences in U.S. prisons. But U.S. officials have called that effort blackmail and said the cases are separate matters because Gross was not working as a spy in Cuba. The diplomatic impasse is taking its toll on Gross, Gilbert said. ""The White House has yet to engage on this issue; we need the president to make this a priority. Without that, Alan will die in Cuba,"" Gilbert said. Other detained Americans .","Alan Gross, jailed in Cuba, says his May 2 birthday will be his last in Havana, lawyer says .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Yoani Sanchez, a Cuban blogger and fierce critic of the governments of Raul and Fidel Castro, embarked on a long-denied trip abroad Sunday. According to Sanchez, she has been repeatedly refused an exit permit for years because of her high-profile opposition to the government. In January, Cuba ended its unpopular policy of requiring citizens to obtain a letter of invitation and an exit permit before leaving the country. Dissidents said the policy was used to punish them for their anti-government advocacy. While other government critics have left the country under the new law, Sanchez is the highest-profile figure in the dissident community to test the easing of restrictions. Flanked by international news media, Sanchez quickly checked in for her flight to Brazil on Sunday and passed through an immigration checkpoint at Havana's Jose Marti Airport. ""In transit in Panama,"" Sanchez tweeted on Sunday night during a layover on her way to Recife, Brazil, to attend a conference on freedom of expression. ""Many impressions."" Sanchez said she planned an 80-day tour of some 10 countries, including Brazil, Mexico and the United States. Much of the funding for her trip, Sanchez said, came from donors and from people offering her a place to stay for free. Sanchez has more than 400,000 followers on Twitter, but with irregular access to the Internet in Cuba, she said had been forced to communicate with the public by sending cell phone text messages that are uploaded to the social messaging service. She said beyond attending technology forums and enjoying easier access to high-speed Internet, she was looking forward to meeting some of the volunteers who translate her writings from Spanish to other languages. MJ Porter, who helps translate Sanchez's blogs into English from her apartment in Seattle, told CNN last year she couldn't wait to meet the Cuban blogger. ""I am a big crier, so I will probably cry for about an hour,"" Porter said. ""Then I will laugh and then cry some more. It's hard for me to imagine."" Sanchez said she was surprised to be able to travel, especially because some Cubans still face restrictions on leaving the country. The government still prohibits the travel of some officials, sports stars and citizens whose travel abroad violates ""public interest."" A handful of other dissidents have reported that they were informed by the government they would be barred from leaving the country. Longtime dissident Gisela Delgado said she was told by officials that even though she has a valid passport, she is on the list of Cubans who aren't permitted to travel. ""The state decides who can leave and who can't,"" Delgado said. ""For 54 years, it's been a way to manipulate us and divide us, the whole Cuban family."" As Sanchez made her way though Havana's airport Sunday, she said no one needed to worry about her staying permanently outside Cuba or if the government could prevent her from returning. ""It won't happen,"" Sanchez said. ""And if it did, all that would change would (be) instead of returning legally through an airport, I would come back on a raft.""","Activist blogger Yoani Sanchez says she's been denied an exit permit for years .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The discovery two years ago of a man's decapitated head near the Hollywood sign began a murder mystery that police now believed is solved. Gabriel Campos-Martinez, 38, was charged Monday in the death of 66-year-old Hervey Medellin, whose head and several other body parts were found by a woman walking her dog in Hollywood's Griffith Park on January 17, 2012, according to the Los Angeles district attorney. Campos-Martinez and Medellin shared a Hollywood apartment for about six months, Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Bobby Grace said. A coroner concluded that Medellin had died as a result of asphyxiation and ruled the death a homicide, Grace said. Investigators have not revealed a motive for the gruesome killing, which police believe occurred around December 27, 2011. A murder charge was filed on Monday against Campos-Martinez, who was arrested in San Antonio, Texas, Sunday. He is being held on $1 million bail and awaiting an extradition hearing. The dog walker whose golden retriever, Ollie, discovered the head near a trail below the Hollywood sign said she at first thought the head was a movie prop. ""Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,"" Lauren Kornberg said in 2012. ""We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head."" Cadaver dogs eventually found several hands and feet -- but no torso -- in the wooded area, which is near the home of actor Brad Pitt.","Gabriel Campos-Martinez is charged with killing his former roommate .

"(CNN) -- Tina Fey and Amy Poehler must be in the business of making dreams come true. According to Showbiz411, the friends and former ""Saturday Night Live"" co-stars may reunite on the big screen in an upcoming comedy called ""The Nest."" Written by Paula Pell, the movie tells the story of two 30-something sisters who decide to throw one last raging party at their parents' home before it's sold, and through the process of bonding and fighting grow up along the way. Fey's involvement in the project was announced in February when it was reported that she's also going to be a producer. ""Pitch Perfect's"" Jason Moore will direct. At this point, Poehler is said to be in final negotiations for the project, but should she make it official she would also be an executive producer, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It goes without saying that the combination of Fey and Poehler generally leads to success.

"(EW.com ) -- NBC's ""The Voice"" switched to live shows for the first time this cycle on Monday night, but a chunk of viewers shrugged off the next phase of the hit reality competition series. ""The Voice"" was down 15 percent from last week's episode in the adult demo to mark its lowest Monday performance ever (chart below), yet still once again charted as the night's top-rated show.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- Cheng Li Ping is afraid to tell her sons their father might never come home. ""My heart can't handle it. I don't want to hurt my children,"" the Chinese woman told CNN Wednesday as she waited in Kuala Lumpur for evidence about what happened to her husband and the 238 others who were aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Cheng says she cannot bring herself to accept that her husband is dead, even after authorities announced there were no survivors. ""I can't trust the Malaysian government. I can't work now because all I can think about is my husband and my children,"" she told CNN's Sara Sidner in Kuala Lumpur. ""I don't have strength. ... My head is a mess."" Malaysian officials say they can tell you how Flight 370 ended. It crashed into the Indian Ocean, they'll say, citing complicated math as proof. They can tell you when it probably happened -- on March 8, sometime between 8:11 and 9:15 a.m. (7:11 to 8:15 p.m. ET March 7), handing you a sheet with extraordinarily technical details about satellite communications technology. What they still can't tell you is why, or precisely where, or show you a piece of the wreckage. All those uncertainties are too much for Cheng and other relatives of people aboard the plane. In Beijing, outraged family members marched to the Malaysian Embassy to denounce the airline, the country and just about everything involved with an investigation that has transfixed the world and vexed experts. Steve Wang, whose mother was aboard the flight, told reporters he felt there was ""no evidence"" that the passenger jet crashed in the Indian Ocean. ""If you find something: OK, we accept,"" he said. ""But nothing -- just from the data, just from analysis."" Where's the proof? Cheng says the authorities' answers to questions don't make sense. ""They have been hiding the truth,"" she said. ""Even though they know the truth, they have been delaying it and missed out on the golden time for the search."" Malaysia Airlines says it is giving the families all the information it can and is sharing it as quickly as possible. And authorities say they know the news is hard to take. But Tuesday, acting Malaysian Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein defended the decision to release the analysis and the heartbreaking conclusions that flowed from it. ""It was released out of a commitment to openness and respect for the relatives, two principles which have guided the investigation,"" he said. That investigation now focuses on an area of the southern Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast, where authorities believe the plane went down after a long, odd, unexplained flight that should have ended hours before in Beijing. Searching there resumed Wednesday after bad weather grounded planes for a day. Hishammuddin said authorities have stopped searching for the plane altogether along a northern arc that stretched from Vietnam to Kazakhstan. Analysis of data by British satellite company Inmarsat and British accident investigators show the Boeing 777-200ER was heading south at last contact, he said. How 'groundbreaking' number crunching found path of Flight 370 . Commercial satellite data from a U.S. company, first analyzed by Australian officials, as well as satellite data from China and France, have turned up evidence of debris bobbing in the general area where authorities believe the plane went down. Australian and Chinese surveillance planes have both reported seeing debris on the water, but so far nothing has been recovered or definitively linked to the missing flight. Authorities cautioned that despite the narrowing the search area, it could still be some time before crews find any sign of the airplane. ""We're not searching for a needle in a haystack,"" Mark Binskin, vice chief of the Australian Defence Force, told reporters. ""We're still trying to define where the haystack is."" Search resumes after weather delay . After bad weather halted the hunt for a day, searching resumed Wednesday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. A Chinese plane took off for the search area in the Indian Ocean at 5 a.m. Wednesday (5 p.m. ET Tuesday), several hours ahead of schedule, the authority said. Gale-force winds, large waves, heavy rain and low clouds lashed the search area Tuesday, making it impossible to dispatch surveillance planes to the scene and making it all but impossible to spot anything from ships. ""It's a pretty remote area and weather conditions can get very, very bad, very, very quickly,"" said Neil Bennett of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. ""At the moment, we're looking at a good day today, but we are expecting conditions to deteriorate again tomorrow."" Wednesday's search is set to include ships and aircraft from six countries: Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, China and South Korea. Twelve aircraft will be part of the search, Australian officials said. Australia's HMAS Success and China's Xue Long polar supply ship are also in the search area, officials said. U.S. equipment to help find the plane's locator beacon arrived in Perth on Wednesday. But even with more searchers and equipment and calmer weather, the effort will still face severe challenges. The area is extraordinarily remote -- some 1,500 miles from Perth, where military surveillance planes capable of searching the site are based. It is also astoundingly large --- some 400,000 to 500,000 square miles of ocean. ""With eight hours of flying to and from the search region, the fleet of P-3 Orion aircraft and other military aircraft have only a precious few hours to scour the search tracks they have been given,"" Australian Defence Minister David Johnston said. To complicate matters, debris that may have been floating days ago, when some of the satellite images were taken, could have sunk by now. Other debris may have drifted hundreds of miles. And time is running out to find the flight data recorder, whose locator beacon is expected to stop working sometime around April 7. More than half a million square kilometers (193,000 square miles) have been searched to date, Australian authorities said. How they're searching for debris . Crash conclusion explained . Hishammuddin spent part of Tuesday's briefing explaining how investigators came to the conclusion that the plane must have gone into the southern Indian Ocean. He said the analysis was based on sophisticated mathematics calculating how long it took signals from a transmitter on the plane to reach an orbiting Inmarsat communications satellite. Much like the horn from a passing car whose pitch rises as it approaches and then falls as it races away, engineers were able examine the satellite's signal and determine it had to be moving south, he said. Engineers checked their calculations against data from other Boeing 777 flights that day and found their technique was sound, he said. One mystery remains in the data: The plane's transmitter and satellite tried to make one final connection at 8:19 a.m. ""At this time this transmission is not understood and is subject to further ongoing work,"" he said. The analysis shows that the plane didn't answer a ping from the satellite ground station at 9:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. ET), leading investigators to conclude the plane's satellite transmitter stopped working sometime between 8:11 and 9:15 a.m. ""This,"" Hishammuddin said, ""is consistent with the maximum endurance of the aircraft."" That partial ping could be a key detail that helps investigators unravel what happened, experts said Tuesday. ""I think it's very significant,"" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. ""This is the last time we hear from the aircraft. You have to wonder what was going on that might have sparked (it)."" Malaysia has convened an international working group to help further narrow the search area. It involves agencies with ""expertise in satellite communications and aircraft performance,"" he said. It will build on the existing analysis of satellite data in hopes of pinpointing a more exact location for the plane's location. What happened to cause the plane to veer off course and presumably crash into the Indian Ocean hours after it was supposed to arrive in Beijing remains unknown. Authorities and analysts have speculated anything from mechanical failure to terrorism to pilot suicide could have played a role. Police have interviewed scores of people, and the Royal Malaysian Air Force is conducting its own inquiry into the disappearance, authorities say. Anguished families react . The Malaysian government's announcement was met with anger by relatives, many of whom said it was premature to declare their loved ones dead before locating any wreckage or bodies. Others accused Malaysian officials of lying or concealing facts. Relatives first learned of the conclusion that the plane had crashed via a text message sent to their cell phones. Malaysian authorities followed up with briefings for families in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""They have told us all lives are lost,"" a missing passenger's relative briefed by the airline in Beijing said Monday. In Beijing, hundreds of friends and family members of missing passengers marched to the Malaysian Embassy to express their anger and frustration. Uniformed police blocked journalists from joining the protesters as they approached the gates of the embassy. One woman in the crowd, overcome by stress and emotion, was carried to a nearby ambulance on a stretcher. Malaysian officials said they are doing all they can. Prime Minister Najib Razak explained Tuesday that he decided to make his official announcement Monday because he did not want the government to be seen as hiding information on purpose from the families of the missing passengers. In an address to Parliament in Kuala Lumpur, he said his statement was based on ""the most conclusive information we have."" Malaysia Airlines said Tuesday it has offered family members financial support of $5,000 for each passenger aboard the ill-fated flight and was preparing to make additional payments as the prolonged search continues. CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told reporters the airline shares in the families' grief. ""We all feel enormous sorrow and pain,"" he said Tuesday. ""Sorrow that all those who boarded Flight MH370 on Saturday 8th March, will not see their families again. And that those families will now have to live on without those they love.""

"(CNN) -- It should have been the proudest moment in his life -- instead Ahmed Abdul Zaher finds himself embroiled in controversy and his career in doubt after scoring the goal that helped his club win this year's African Champions League. The 28-year-old's first reaction -- prior to being wrestled to the floor by his Al Ahly teammates in celebration -- was to hold out four fingers in a gesture that has become synonymous with ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy. Known as 'Rabaa', which means four, the salute is considered the symbol of defiance against military rule and refers to the Rabaa Al-Adawiya mosque where supporters of Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood clashed with the army in August, resulting in hundreds of deaths. Even though Zaher claims his actions had no political meaning, the tense political situation in Egypt was highlighted by the strength of the sanctions meted out to him by Al Ahly's board on Tuesday. The forward has not only been put up for sale but also barred from competing in next month's FIFA Club World Cup -- a tournament that carries special significance in Africa since it affords teams a rare chance to play with the world watching while testing themselves against some of the planet's best players. In a statement that explained the club's ""firm rejection of mixing politics and sport"", Al Ahly also revealed that Abdul Zaher will also miss out on any financial bonus gained from the club's continental triumph. Supporters of the stringent sanctions will argue that Abdul Zaher's actions could have had serious repercussions as Cairo hosted a major football match with fans in attendance for one of the few times since last year's stadium disaster in Port Said. The rampage in February 2012 left 74 people dead and 1,000 injured after the Port Said home team, al-Masry, defeated a visiting Al Ahly side. A majority of the victims in the stadium rampage were Al Ahly fans, with many believing they had been targeted after their role in the revolution had helped topple longstanding President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. ""I did do the sign but did not intend any political incitement for any group or any fan,"" Abdul Zaher said in a statement. ""I meant it in mourning for the Egyptians who died in Rabaa (al-Adawiya square), including citizens, soldiers and policemen."" Zaher's comments come despite his status as one of the few football stars who participated in the Muslim Brotherhood's sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Zaher is not the first Egyptian sportsman to suffer because of his association with the gesture. Last month, an Egyptian kung fu champion who wore a T-shirt with the Rabaa sign was barred from representing his country and stripped of a medal he had won at a tournament in Russia. Zaher's agent said the controversial celebration had its roots in personal tragedy that stemmed from the August actions, when security forces stormed the pro-Morsy camp a month after the military had ousted the Islamist leader. ""What he meant by the sign is that he was mourning one of his friends who died during the events surrounding the clearing of Rabaa al-Adawiya square in August,"" said Mohammed Sheiha. ""Abdul Zaher wrote an apology to the Al Ahly club's board of directors and the Egyptian public for showing the Rabaa sign during the match between Ahly and Orlando Pirates."" Zaher's goal in Cairo, which clinched an aggregate 3-1 victory over the South African side as Al Ahly landed a record eighth continental crown, sealed their place in the Club World Cup. Africa will stage the tournament for the first time when Morocco hosts an event that begins on 11 December, with Al Ahly playing Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande three days later. Champions League winners Bayern Munich and South America's Copa Libertadores holders Atletico Mineiro, who boast Ronaldinho in their number, are among those contesting the seven-team event.","Al Ahly forward Ahmed Abdul Zaher indefinitely suspended after controversial gesture .

"(CNN) -- ""No negotiating with terrorists"" versus ""Leave no soldier behind."" With the long war in Afghanistan winding down, the plight of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has left the U.S. government trying to reconcile those two longstanding credos in a bid to win the freedom of the only American solider held as a captive. Bergdahl has been held by insurgents in Pakistan since 2009. Extremely sensitive discussions are under way with intermediaries overseas to see if there is any ability to gain his release, a U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday. The official declined to be identified due to the nature of the discussions, which are being led by U.S. diplomats, although the Defense Department is also involved. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby declined comment, but Bergdahl's family welcomed the news in a statement on Tuesday. Source: Missing U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl seen in video . ""We applaud the unity of purpose and resolve at the White House and the other U.S. government agencies involved,"" the Bergdahls said. ""We thank all involved for this renewed effort and we hope everyone takes this opportunity seriously. We are cautiously optimistic these discussions will lead to the safe return of our son after more than four and a half years in captivity."" The discussions were first reported by The Daily Beast last week. Home-state Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said Bergdahl's release is ""the highest priority that I have in my office,"" and said he's confident it's at the top of other government officials' lists as well. ""Frankly, a lot of what's going on is confidential and cannot be discussed. And I'm not familiar with exactly what details are going on right now in terms of any negotiations,"" Crapo told CNN. ""What I can assure you is I've met with our military and diplomatic and intelligence authorities, both in the United States and in Afghanistan and Pakistan, about this, and I'm convinced that they are making this a very high priority."" American officials are adamant they have never given up on trying to get Bergdahl back and resist calling the current effort ""renewed"" discussions. But driving the current effort, according to the U.S. official, is Bergdahl's poor health and concern a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan at year's end would essentially close the door an any rescue attempt. The United States has long declared that it won't negotiate with terrorists, which is what it considers the Taliban. However, ""We have a history of being able to dance pretty effectively along the edges of the declaration,"" said retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN military analyst. ""We have had communications with all forms of bad guys, to include the Taliban, in the past,"" Marks said. This time, the planned American pullout means ""the clock is ticking"" on efforts to bring Bergdahl home, he said. One possible obstacle to securing his release is what may be asked in return. The Taliban has long demanded the release of five detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- but another U.S. official said releasing them would be difficult because Congress would have to be notified in advance, and lawmakers have previously resisted releasing them. Bowe Bergdahl: Strong, well-rounded and easy to talk to, friends say . Van Hipp, who served as a deputy assistant Army secretary under former President George H.W. Bush, said that trading Guantanamo inmates for Bergdahl would put at risk ""every American soldier deployed all over the world."" ""We are sending the message to terrorist organizations all over the world that it's OK to capture an American soldier -- that America will deal with you,"" said Hipp, now a defense consultant in Washington. ""I think we need to give the green light to the special ops and let them do their jobs quietly and methodically, as they have done so well in the past,"" he added. In May 2012, the U.S. government acknowledged that it had been engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl, but those talks moved in fits and starts because of U.S. concerns that any Taliban prisoners swapped for the sergeant might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight. But Marks said the possibility of a prisoner swap shouldn't alarm American policymakers. ""The United States has been holding these folks in Guantanamo for quite some time. They have gone through very, very specifically what the charges are, what their activities are,"" Marks said. ""And if the United States figures and if our legal system figures that the release of these individuals will guarantee the release of a soldier ... it's an opportunity and an option we should avail ourselves of."" Bergdahl, of Wood River Valley, Idaho, appeared in diminished health in a video that the U.S. military obtained in January. His family also received a letter from him last year via the Red Cross. The United States believes one route to getting Bergdahl back may be through Qatari officials, who have been talking to the Taliban. But Bergdahl is believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, an insurgent force affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda -- and it was not clear whether Haqqani operatives would abide by any agreement among the United States, Qatar and the Taliban. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said there are no ""active negotiations"" with the Taliban, ""but there should be no doubt that we work every day using our military, our intelligence and our diplomatic tools to see Sergeant Bergdahl returned home safely."" ""Clearly, if negotiations do resume at some point, then we will want to talk with the Taliban about the safe return of Sergeant Bergdahl,"" Carney said. Israel has repeatedly conducted prisoner exchanges with its foes in the Hamas and Hezbollah movements. In 2011, it traded more than 1,000 Palestinians held in its jails for a single Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive by Hamas for five years. The exchanges have been met with some opposition by the Israeli public, but a poll found Israelis overwhelmingly favored the swap that freed Shalit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the Palestinians prisoners he traded ""will not be paying the full price that they deserve to"" but told the families of their victims, ""The state of Israel does not abandon its soldiers and its citizens.""","NEW: Bergdahl's release is ""the highest priority that I have,"" home-state senator says .

"(CNN) -- Vladimir Putin is basking in the glory of territorial conquest, enjoying his highest domestic approval ratings since returning as president two years ago. But he should take time to consider whether the foundations of Russian power are as stable as he would like us to believe. As an act of geopolitical assertiveness, the seizure of Crimea was meant to convey a message of strength. But the negative reaction of financial markets and Western sanctions against Russia have highlighted existing economic vulnerabilities in a way that raises serious doubts about Russia's ability to sustain its new position. The revival of Russia's international standing during Putin's first two terms was, above all, a consequence of the country's rapid economic recovery following the collapse of the immediate post-Soviet years. The resources boom of 2000-2008 produced huge increases in export earnings and average growth rates of 7%. By 2006 Russia had paid off its Paris Club debts and was recording net inflows of capital. Its inclusion as one of the BRICs -- the elite group of large emerging economies -- seemed natural. But the limits of Putin's business model were becoming apparent even before the global financial crisis struck in late 2008. The combination of the war in Georgia and threats made by Putin to the private steel company Mechel led to a resumption of large-scale capital flight and a dip in growth. This turned into a deep recession after the sharp decline in international commodity prices hit the bulk of Russia's export earnings. Although growth returned along with higher oil and gas prices, it has remained well below pre-crisis levels. Last year it reached only 1.3%. Russian stagnation now threatens to turn into a double-dip recession. Growth forecasts are being downgraded as a result of the crisis over Ukraine. Economic data suggests that the Russian economy may have contracted in the first quarter of 2014. Since the start of the year, net capital outflows of up to $70 billion have already exceeded the total for 2013, according to Reuters. To make matters worse, Putin's threat to seize Western assets in the event that sanctions are expanded has turned Russia into a major investment risk at a time when it urgently needs to attract foreign capital and technology to upgrade infrastructure and create a broader base for economic growth. It would be a mistake to see these problems as the short-term effect of the diplomatic turbulence over Ukraine. In reality they are the culmination of serious structural problems that have been ignored and in many case made worse by Putin's lurch towards authoritarian statism. Endemic corruption swallows up around a third of Russia's GDP according to the InDem Foundation, and weakens property rights and investor protection. These deficiencies were highlighted most visibly by the expropriation of Yukos Oil and Hermitage Capital, both involving active government complicity. But the practice of reiderstvo, in which the legal system is misused to seize or extort legitimate businesses, is much more widespread and probably involves thousands of cases every year. The effect is to undermine economic activity by deterring investment and stifling entrepreneurship. Why bother to start a business when a cabal of corrupt politicians, prosecutors and judges could abuse their positions of authority to take it away from you? This explains why small and medium businesses contribute such a low proportion of Russian GDP -- 24% compared to 58% for the EU. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev bemoans the fact that the most ambitious Russian graduates would rather find a sinecure within the state apparatus than go into business, but the message that it's easier to seize wealth than create it comes from the very top of government. Although the Sochi Winter Olympics was meant the showcase the best of Putin's Russia, the thing that will stick longest in the memory is the knowledge that a project projected at $12 billion ended up costing around $50 billion. These predations make the regime vulnerable. After more than a decade of talking about the risks of over-reliance on the extractive industries, particularly oil and gas, Russian leaders have completely failed to diversify their economy. In fact, the non-commodities contribution to exports has shrunk by almost half to 8%. This has happened at a time when the combined impact of corruption, inefficient state intervention and rising budgetary commitments has increased the fiscal break-even price of oil from $20 per barrel to $117. A sustained drop in the oil price could seriously threaten the rentier bargain that enables Putin to sustain popular support. Yet the impact of Ukraine has been to scare Russia's European customers into seeking out alternative suppliers. In the estimation of his admirers, Putin deserves credit for restoring Russia's pride and prosperity after the chaos of the Yeltsin era. The alternative version of history is that he was fortunate to benefit from the delayed effect of reforms carried out by his predecessor and the resources boom that began just as he was taking office. Having been gifted a promising legacy he promptly squandered it by imposing a corrupt and wasteful form of authoritarian governance. Unless he can find new sources of growth and dynamism at time when he is closing down Russian society and cutting it off from the outside world, it is likely to be this second version of history that sticks.

"(CNN) -- The family of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi has applied for a review of his conviction in a Scottish court for the 1988 bombing of PanAm Flight 103. Al Megrahi was found guilty in 2001 of the murders of the 259 passengers and crew on board the flight from London to New York, as well as those of 11 residents of the Scottish town of Lockerbie. He died in 2012 in Libya, having been released from prison in Scotland in 2009 on compassionate grounds because he had terminal cancer. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission confirmed in a statement Thursday that it had received an application to review his conviction in the case. Dr. Jim Swire, whose 23-year-old daughter Fiona was killed in the bombing, attended court to file the application on behalf of the al Megrahi family, the Commission said. He is also one of the applicants. Swire does not believe al Megrahi was responsible for the bombing and is among a number of relatives of the victims who have been fighting for the evidence in the case to be re-examined in court. Al Megrahi previously applied to the commission for a review of his conviction in 2003, and his case was referred to the High Court for a new appeal in 2007, the statement said. However, he subsequently dropped his appeal in 2009. The commission, a body set up to investigate potential miscarriages of justice, will now look at the new application in order to make a decision about whether to accept it or not, a process that could take months. If accepted, the application would then go through a review process in order to be sent either to the High Court or back to the applicant, who can then submit further representation. Chief executive Gerard Sinclair said, ""As it does in every case the Commission will now give careful consideration to this new application. ""I previously indicated last month that there are several important matters which will affect the timescale within which the Commission will be able to deal with this fresh application and subsequently, if there is to be a further review of this conviction, any such review will take some time to complete.""","An application is lodged for a review of Abdelbeset al Megrahi's conviction .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from last month's landslide in rural Washington state has risen to 33, the Snohomish County medical examiner's office said Monday.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama needs to learn a simple lesson: Saying something doesn't make it true. Though the President has claimed victory touting 8 million ""enrollments"" under his health care law, Americans cannot and will not wipe their memories clear of the botched rollout and continual failings of Obamacare. Democrats have sustained their tactic of telling everyone the health care law is working, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Perhaps if they say it enough, their reasoning goes, it will become true. Well, Obama can have his own opinions and he can even assert falsehoods as truth, but he can't conjure fact. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll lays the facts out bare. The President's approval rating has slipped to 41% -- the lowest of his presidency in Post/ABC News polls. And only 37% approve of the President's handling of Obamacare's implementation. Despite the 8 million enrollees vaunted by the administration, a mere 44% of Americans approve of the President's signature law. This negative view of Obamacare persists even upon the assumption, parroted by many in the media, that the 8 million enrollment figure is accurate. However, the administration refuses to tell the American people any details about that number. How many of those ""enrollees"" are insured, having paid their first month's premium? How many were previously uninsured? How many were forced off their former coverage that they liked? What will the quality of coverage be for those who actually receive coverage? These questions have been met with deaf ears and defensive posturing. ""The debate over the repeal of the law is over,"" the President said. ""This law is doing what it's supposed to do -- it's working."" The President has confused reported high enrollment numbers with success, disregarding that while millions may be signed up under threat of penalty, Americans are not sold on the failed law. To provide Americans answers to the unanswered questions, the House passed in January the Exchange Information Disclosure Act, which would require transparency from the administration regarding the Obamacare insurance exchange. Yet U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has blocked the bill in the Senate, unwilling to give the American people access to information they have a right to know. In an attempt to get the data directly from the source, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters in March to every insurance provider participating in the federal exchange requesting enrollment data, including the number of individuals who have paid their first month's premium or were previously uninsured. The results finally came in. As of April 15, only 67% of individuals and families that selected a plan had paid their first month's premium, data provided to the committee by every provider in the Federally Facilitated Marketplace shows. Insurers informed the committee that, by the same date, only 2.45 million had paid their first month's premium for coverage obtained through the FFM. The purpose of Obamacare, if the President remembers, was to insure, not merely to sign up, and it seems the President's enrollment numbers far surpass the number of insured. Of those who have enrolled and paid their premiums, some surely liked their health insurance, were renewing their health insurance and were booted off their health insurance because of Obamacare regulations. This law is not a success. Even before the Energy and Commerce Committee released their findings, Americans still viewed Obamacare unfavorably. In Tuesday's Post/ABC News poll, 47% of Americans reported that the ACA has raised their health care costs and 60% blame Obamacare for increasing costs nationally. Americans -- faced with Obamacare's burdens and disappointed with the president's handling of the economy, foreign policy, and more -- want a Republican-controlled Congress to act as a check on the president's policies by 53 to 39%. The debate is far from over, Mr. President. Instead of taking responsibility for the failed health care law, Obama prefers to call major problems ""glitches"" and forced re-enrollment of millions who were previously insured ""success."" He has claimed victory with a number that includes millions who remain uninsured. The first step toward fixing a problem is admitting the problem exists. Instead of taking responsibility for the disaster they've created and the unnecessary hardships they've imposed on the American people, Obama and the Democrats are trying to rewrite the facts. Unfortunately for them, facts don't work that way. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Rep. Kevin McCarthy: Selling of Obamacare omits the reality that not everyone is paying .

"(CNN) -- The woman at the center of the U.S. Secret Service prostitution scandal embraced her notoriety and spilled colorful details Friday about alcohol flowing like water and Secret Service agents dancing on a bar. Dania Londono Suarez is the escort who unwittingly sparked investigations that have ensnared roughly two dozen members of the Secret Service and U.S. military over reported use of prostitutes in Colombia in the days before President Barack Obama visited last month. She gave a lengthy, wide-ranging interview to Colombia's W Radio on Friday. It attracted international attention, with reporters from as far away as Europe calling in to press for more details. She retold the story of the disagreement in the hallway of the Hotel Caribe, of her fear after the fallout and what she envisions for herself in the future. Her days of selling her body are over, she said, but she is open to appearing nude in men's magazines. ""My life is already ruined by this,"" she said. Suarez said she considers her reputation shattered but is looking for opportunity by voluntarily stepping fully into the limelight that has been chasing her. If a magazine offered the ""right price,"" she would pose nude, she said. The fallout of the scandal has ""left me cured"" of being an escort, she said. ""That part of my life is dead."" In the interview, she also presented a more nuanced view of herself. Amid her fears that the U.S. government might retaliate and do her harm, she is also nervous about what her crush thinks about this. She doesn't have a boyfriend, she said, but ""I'm interested in someone. I don't know how he's taken all this. I wish I could go inside his head."" She also said that she would not have told police about the incident if she had known the men were agents, and that their behavior hypothetically could have put the agency's work at risk. She didn't see any schedules or plans regarding Obama, she said, but if she had been someone wanting to do harm, ""while I was with them, I could have done a thousand things."" Given such an opportunity, a terrorist could have wreaked havoc, she said. Concerns about a security breach, as well as outrage over the salacious nature of the scandal, have motivated multiple investigations by the Secret Service, the military, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general and several congressional committees. On Friday, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, R-New York, said he had more questions about the agency's internal review after meeting with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan. In particular, King noted the Secret Service said it interviewed 10 of the 12 women involved but had been unable to find the other two, including Suarez. Citing the radio interview by Suarez that ""details information vital to the investigation,"" King said he asked the Secret Service ""for an explanation of how they have failed to find this woman when the news media seems to have no trouble doing so."" Nine of 12 Secret Service agents implicated in the scandal have resigned or are being forced out, while three others were cleared of serious misconduct. A separate military investigation of 12 U.S. military members is continuing. Details of what happened on the night Suarez met the Secret Service agent had surfaced before Friday, and she confirmed the narrative in her interview with W Radio. A friend at the bar introduced her to a man who was interested in her, Suarez said. She watched as the man and his friends ordered bottles of vodka. ""They were buying alcohol like it was water,"" she said. She saw them dance on the bar. The man she was with liked to dance in a ""disorderly"" manner in which ""he lifted his shirt to show off his six-pack."" They didn't speak the same language, but when the man mentioned ""sex,"" she answered in her basic English, ""Baby, cash money."" They agreed on $800, she said, and went to his hotel. The next morning, she was awakened by a call from the front desk alerting her that it was time for overnight visitors to leave the hotel, she said. She woke the man up, and he refused to pay, telling her ""just go, bitch."" It was a completely different personality than the night before, when he was very loving, she said. ""When he was drunk, he was a different person than when he had his wits about him,"" Suarez said. The escort walked across the hall to the room of another man, who had brought her friend to the hotel. That couple came out and tried to sort things out with the first man, but he refused to open the door. Now it is known that the two men were Secret Service agents, though at the time she had no idea. The only hint that the man was some sort of official was a uniform inside his room, which led Suarez to presume that he was in the military. Sources with knowledge of the investigation have told CNN that the Secret Service agent at the center of the scandal is Arthur Huntington. Huntington, of Severna Park, Maryland, has now left the Secret Service, but it was not clear under what circumstances. Suarez says she does not recall what name, if any, Huntington gave her that night. But she would recognize him if their paths crossed again. ""I remember his face as if I saw him yesterday,"" she said. Suarez said she spent hours trying to persuade the agent to open the door and pay her, but she finally gave up around 10 a.m. As she was leaving, however, she came across a local police officer who encouraged her to share what was bothering her. More agents wandered into the hallway and pleaded, ""please, please, no police, no police,"" Suarez said. Three agents pooled their resources and gave her $250, she said. She took the money and left the hotel. It was two days before Suarez learned what scandal had been ignited that day. Today, Suarez says she would have let the man off the hook if she had known he was Secret Service. But that sentiment is not out of respect. ""They are idiots,"" she said. ""They were protecting President Obama, and they didn't see the magnitude of the problem."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: N.Y. Rep.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Last week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama's effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%. They had adjusted gross income of $789,674. We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama's secretary, who had about $95,000 of income. Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. We also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don't have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of $21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas. We do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long. First, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts. Most of the Romneys' income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate. Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate. Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do. An analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to $200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households. The Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same. While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986. Second, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code. In addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate. The more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction. For example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents. If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes. Third, all of this is supposed to be a secret. The only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it -- either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett. The IRS statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1% of taxpayers, and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group. Congress decides to enact a tax law, and the president signs the bill. While presidents voluntarily release their tax returns, members of Congress do not. The first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of Congress to release his or her tax return. We can see which tax provisions benefit them, and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own. Achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps. First, tax all forms of income at the same rate. Second, repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax. If a flat tax is good enough for Mitt and Ann Romney, it should be good enough for the rest of us. Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely. That would mean Mitt and Ann Romney's already low 15% effective tax rate would be cut even further. That would be wrong-headed tax reform. Finally, most deductions should be eliminated. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers -- and their accountants and tax lawyers. Whenever Congress enacts a deduction, it creates winners and losers. That must stop. To be sure, every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion. But we outnumber them. I don't think it's fair that the richest Americans pay taxes at a lower rate than most taxpayers and neither should you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorothy Brown.","Dorothy Brown: We live with the myth that we have a progressive tax system .
In fact, she says, people like Mitt Romney, Barack Obama pay at lower rates than secretaries .

"(CNN) -- America loves its outlaws, but few of us actually dare to live the lifestyle. Veteran LIFE photographer Bill Ray got about as close as anyone, riding along with a notorious biker gang. In 1965, the Hells Angels were little known outside the American West. Ray spent several weeks in Southern California, photographing and traveling with the San Bernardino chapter of a gang that would soon become notorious for its hedonistic, lawless swagger. See more of Bill Ray's Hells Angels photos at LIFE.com . The Hells Angels are now a worldwide phenomenon -- incorporated, licensed and branded. But the gang Ray traveled with, two years before the Summer of Love and four years before the deadly violence at a Rolling Stones concert at Altamont speedway made them infamous, truly lived on the fringes of society. In a culture where the Beach Boys and the Beatles fought a squeaky-clean battle for the hearts and minds of America, the Hells Angels were, in the words of Hunter S. Thompson, a ""burst of dirty thunder"" that shocked folks wherever they went. It was a time when the roar of stripped-down Harleys and the sight of long-haired bikers on the freeway -- or riding into a sleepy town -- was still new, alien, and for the average law-abiding citizen, more than a little frightening. Forty-five years after the story and photos were rejected by a LIFE managing editor, they still have some of that shock value, a reminder that outlaws still have a secret sweet spot in the American psyche.","LIFE photographer Bill Ray rode along with the Hells Angels in 1965 .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York City taxi driver is charged with keeping more than $28,000 that should have gone to the Metropolitan Transit Authority in E-Z Pass toll fees over the past two years. Rodolfo Sanchez, 69, of Long Island City has been sneaking through toll plazas on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and Midtown Tunnel by ""piggybacking,"" or tailgating cars directly in front of his cab, and slipping through the toll lane before the barrier came back down, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. The cabbie allegedly crossed two of the city's bridges and tunnels more than 4,000 times from August 2012 to April 2014. Sanchez was arraigned Thursday in Queens County Court. He is charged with grand larceny, theft of services and criminal possession of stolen property. ""This type of behavior is egregiously unfair to the millions of honest motorists who pay tolls every day, and we will continue efforts to root out toll evaders and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Donald Look, MTA bridges and tunnels chief of security. MTA investigators discovered that a certain E-Z Pass tag was regularly crossing the RFK and Midtown Tunnel toll plazas without making payments. The E-Z Pass was tracked on the RFK bridge toll plaza 3,017 times and the Midtown Tunnel toll plaza 1,061 times, costing the MTA $28,242.50 in lost revenue, according to the district attorney. Sanchez told investigators that he knew there was no money on the E-Z Pass, and he dodged the tolls because he needed the money for his family, according to the attorney general. CNN efforts to reach Sanchez were unsuccessful. ""There are cameras and video. We have active eyes on everything. We are actively going to pursue anyone evading paying toll,"" MTA spokeswoman Judy Glave told CNN. If convicted, Sanchez faces up to seven years in prison.

"(CNN) -- Juventus moved to within a two points of a third straight Serie A title after coming from behind to beat lowly Sassuolo 3-1 Monday. The victory re-opened an eight-point cushion over chasing Roma with three rounds of the Scudetto still to be played. Roma have kept doggedly in pursuit of their rivals, with a fine win over Milan Friday. But this latest victory for Juve will allow Antonio Conte's men to place one hand on the trophy. They were given an early fright at the Stadio Citta del Tricolore when the home side took a shock lead as Simone Zaza scored with a low shot past Gianluigi Buffon. Juventus took until the 34th minute to equalize as Carlos Tevez scored from outside the area with a fine shot after an assist by Claudio Marchisio. Andrea Pirlo put Marchisio clear to add the go-ahead goal in the 57th minute and Stephan Lichsteiner crossed for Fernando Llorente's third to seal the three points on 76 minutes. Conte's men are next in action Thursday at their own Juventus Stadium in Turin, looking to overcome a 2-1 deficit from the away leg of their Europa League semifinal with Benfica. He still fielded a strong team against Sassuolo, who were missing a number of players through injury and suspension and are involved in a relegation scrap in the lower reaches of Serie A. Meanwhile, Arsenal cemented a likely fourth place in the English Premier League and Champions League qualification for next season with a 3-0 home win over slumping Newcastle. Visiting manager Alan Pardew was allowed pitch side after his seven-game touchline ban but it made little difference to his under performing side. After an even opening, Arsenal took the lead through Laurent Koscielny after slack marking by the Newcastle defense following a free kick. German star Mesut Ozil added a second from close range just before halftime. Ozil set up Olivier Giroud for a clinching midway through the second half, his 15th league goal of the season and condemning Newcastle to a sixth straight defeat. Arsenal have moved four points clear of fifth-placed Everton with both having just two games left of the season in the EPL.","Juventus win 3-1 at lowly Sassuolo in Serie A .

Based on the ubiquitous lock-block toy and licensed with many of pop-culture's most ubiquitous heroes, ""The LEGO Movie"" is a sly Trojan horse of a movie. ""Using the building-block world of LEGO to parody the creeping conformity of our world, 'The LEGO Movie' proves even more biting than 'WALL-E,' because it has the sauciness to send up its own rise-of-a-hero story line,"" writes EW's Owen Gleiberman.

"(CNN) -- Environmentalists in Vietnam were ebullient this week after remote cameras in a forest reserve snapped pictures of a live saola, one of the rarest large mammals on Earth. At most a few hundred -- and as few as a couple dozen -- of the animals are thought to exist. Because of that rarity and its elusiveness, the saola is dubbed the ""Asian unicorn."" That moniker comes despite the fact it has two closely spaced parallel horns. ""These are the most important wild animal photographs taken in Asia, and perhaps the world, in at least the past decade,"" said William Robichaud, coordinator of the Saola Working Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission, in a World Wildlife Fund press release. Scientists discover new species in Australian rainforest . ""This is an historic moment in Vietnam's efforts to protect our extraordinary biodiversity,"" Dang Dinh Nguyen, deputy head of the country's Quang Nam Forest Protection Department, said in the release. The picture of the animal was taken in September in a reserve in the Central Annamite Mountains and announced by the WWF on Tuesday. 441 species discovered in Amazon since 2010 . Van Ngoc Thinh, WWF-Vietnam's country director, called the picture ""a breath-taking discovery."" ""When our team first looked at the photos we couldn't believe our eyes.

The saola, which is a relative of cattle but looks like an antelope, was first discovered in 1992 in forests along the Vietnam-Laos border. A WWF survey team found a skull of the animal in a hunter's home. In Vietnam, a saola was last seen in the wild in 1998. In Laos, a remote camera snapped a picture of one in the wild in 1999. And in 2010, Laotian villagers captured a saola that died before word got to researchers. Olinguito: The newest rare mammal species . There are no saola in captivity. Environmentalists said Wednesday the pictures show that efforts to save the saola are working.

"(CNN) -- Business partners tend to limit their disagreements to the boardroom. With the happiness of their shareholders in mind, it doesn't pay to air dirty laundry in public. So when two of the world's foremost tycoons began venting anger at each other publicly, it was bound to attract attention. British financier Nat Rothschild joined forces with Indonesia's Bakrie family in 2010 with the ambitious plan to create a blue chip UK-listed mining company. But with coal prices falling and allegations of financial irregularities, the company had lost half its value by 2012. By the time talks started about a possible split, its shares had lost 80% of their value, public reports show. In December, shareholders voted for separation and on Tuesday, the final details were agreed. So while the celebity-focused world watched as Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin announced their ""conscious uncoupling,"" business circles were preoccupied by a very different -- and very public -- ""divorce.""

"(CNN) -- A funny thing happened to ""Mad Men"" on its way to its seventh season. It became just another TV show. The series about a 1960s ad agency that intersects with the American experience spent its sixth season wading through the shocks of 1968 -- the Tet Offensive, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, the presidential race that culminated in the election of Richard Nixon. What the late '60s really looked like . But reviewers found the season flat and disconnected compared to previous seasons, with New York magazine's Matt Zoller Seitz declaring it ""sluggish and lumpy and unfocused"" and Slate's Hanna Rosin describing it as ""a strange season in that it seemed to throw up intriguing plot possibilities and then grow quickly bored with them."" Which is not to say that the show jumped the shark as viewers prepare for Season 7, the show's last, which begins Sunday on AMC. It was still a very good TV show, still rewarded with Emmy nominations and cultural cachet. Viewers and reviewers still parsed its every symbol, from the elevators in protagonist Don Draper's apartment building to the T-shirt worn by his wife, Megan (Jessica Pare). Viewers will want to know if some of the questions raised by Season 6 are answered. Will Don's marriage hold up? After an affair was discovered by his daughter Sally, can he repair the relationship with her? Don (Jon Hamm) also ended the season on the outs with Sterling Cooper -- the agency at the heart of the show -- where he was creative director. Indeed, a lot of figures at Sterling Cooper are coping with uncertainty: Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), who spent Season 6 away from -- and then rejoining -- the agency; Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), whose marriage hit the skids; and Roger Sterling (John Slattery), who keeps staring mortality in the face (and cracking jokes in its shadows). And then, of course, there's the mysterious Bob Benson (James Wolk), the eager salesman who turned out to be a pro at snowing his colleagues. How will he fare with that big General Motors account? For all that, ""Mad Men"" just wasn't the phenomenon it was during its first four years, when the very title ""Mad Men"" became synonymous with the idea of ""Kennedy-era America."" When ""Mad Men"" premiered in 2007, ""there wasn't anything comparable in look,"" said style consultant and beauty expert Rachel Weingarten, whose book ""Hello Gorgeous!"" focuses in part on the ""Mad Men"" era. ""Modern television and especially cable didn't have anything like it -- that stylized look, that way of speaking. Everyone felt sophisticated talking about it."" It didn't hurt that the show addressed issues, such as sexism and image-making, through the prism of an era that seemed even more distant than it was, adds Jerald Podair, a history professor at Wisconsin's Lawrence University. The show quickly became a shorthand for a different kind of America -- one remembered for its hard-drinking men, subordinate women and cigarettes everywhere -- than the one we live in now. It was a different America than the one that existed in the late '60s, for that matter. ""For us, 1962 is much more of a foreign country than 1968, because 1968 is basically who we are now, and 1962 is who we were,"" Podair said. Part of the language . Those early seasons of ""Mad Men"" managed to work themselves into the water-cooler conversation with surprising ease. Any journalist looking to compare our muddled times with the tie-clipped, flouncy-skirted early '60s invoked ""Mad Men."" Handsome, inscrutable types were ""Don Drapers,"" after Jon Hamm's lead character, an ad agency creative director; upscale, quietly desperate housewives were ""Betty Drapers,"" after his eventual ex-wife, played by January Jones. Single career women? Meet Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss). Banana Republic and Brooks Brothers introduced ""Mad Men""-inspired fashion lines, the name ""Betty"" became popular again, and -- since imitation is the sincerest form of television, to borrow Fred Allen's old line -- the show's sleek era was suddenly all over the tube, featured on such programs as ""Pan Am,"" ""The Playboy Club"" and ""Magic City."" Dressing like 'Mad Men' That period of ""Mad Men"" became part of the language. ""It's time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a 'Mad Men' episode,"" said President Obama in his 2014 State of the Union address, and nobody had to ask what he meant. ""It's rare that the name of the show becomes a shorthand for an era,"" said Podair, noting that ""Mad Men"" now represents the early '60s in the way that ""Father Knows Best"" or ""Leave It to Beaver"" represent the 1950s. Where to find ""Mad Men's"" classic cocktails . Indeed, for a show that's never enjoyed the mammoth ratings of AMC stablemate ""The Walking Dead,"" it's had an impact well beyond its audience. ""Mad Men"" averaged less than a million viewers per episode in its first season. It wasn't until the fourth season that it topped 2 million, and last season's ratings, for the show's sixth season, averaged about 2.5 million. Compare that to ""Walking Dead,"" which averaged 13.3 million for its most recent season -- and grabbed 15.7 million for its Season 4 finale. Even the broadcast networks would be thrilled with that. ""Mad Men"" grabbed this attention despite criticism that it had oversimplified a complex era -- and that, in turn, today's news media was doing the same. ""From where I sit, claiming this exasperating show is even remotely representative of the times we lived through would be like trying to show 'Dynasty' on the History Channel!"" exclaimed ad man and art director George Lois in a CNN opinion piece. "" 'Mad Men' is nothing more than the fulfillment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters is glamorous and 'vintage.' "" But that doesn't surprise Weingarten. After all, she points out, TV tends to be aspirational. ""It isn't real life,"" she said. ""It's very stylized."" Paving the way . ""Mad Men"" creator Matt Weiner has tried to make a similar point. ""I know this sounds like a joke,"" he told the Wrap last year, ""but none of it is real."" At the least, all the talk helped ""Mad Men"" make the world safe for the rule of basic cable. ""For a long time it was just HBO,"" Kevin Rahm, who plays Draper's rival Ted Chaough, told CNN. ""When this show came on the air on AMC, no one had heard of AMC other than (it being) American Movie Classics. I think the show led the way for Netflix having their own series, Amazon having their own series. I think it's paved that road."" Even if ""Mad Men"" has lost its place in the zeitgeist -- the Banana Republic partnership is gone and ""Game of Thrones"" is the talked-about show of the moment (for now, anyway) -- it still has a loyal audience. AMC is counting on it. After the final season of ""Breaking Bad"" worked out so well by being split in two, the network announced the same practice would be put in place for ""Mad Men."" So Sunday's premiere introduces Season 7, Part 1. As in the past, Weiner and AMC are asking for a cone of silence to be placed around advance discussion of the premiere. Not even the year can be revealed, though -- based on the publicity photographs showcasing miniskirts and sideburns -- it's probably 1969 or 1970, both of which would present opportunities for the show's characters to intersect thematically with such historical events as the moon landing, the Manson murders, Woodstock, the Kent State shootings and the Miracle Mets. (Well, it is mainly set in New York.) Screenwriter Robert Towne of ""Chinatown"" fame was added to the writing staff, and Milton Glaser, the great graphic artist, was drafted to create this year's poster. If representing the more recognizable late '60s -- with its mixed-up, shook-up, psychedelic world -- means the show is less exotic to us, so be it. ""It's a sign of the show's triumph and also its failure,"" said Podair. ""When we remember the show, we're going to remember the 1962 portion and we're probably not going to remember the '67 and '68 portion because we've been there and we've done that."" Weiner just wants it to be good. ""I always feel pressure about entertaining the audience and keeping the show up to the level that we think it's at and not repeating ourselves,"" he told CNN. But ""Mad Men"" being ""Mad Men"" -- and still having half a season to shoot -- he can't help thinking of the past, as well. It's one thing to wonder about the ebb and flow of the 1960s, another to re-create its world. As the show heads into the sunset, he has visions of the beginning. ""I have been thinking a little bit about sitting in a room, typing the title page and how this all happened,"" he said.","""Mad Men's"" seventh and final season begins Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Personally, we'd rather not have anything obstructing the incredible views from a Maldives resort. We could stare out the window for months -- especially if those windows are underwater. But we have to admit the surreal, sea-themed fantasy art of Viennese artist Andreas Franke looks pretty cool set amid the clear waters of the Indian Ocean. More: World's best underwater attractions . This week, two Maldives resorts launched underwater art exhibitions featuring Franke's new work. Huvafen Fushi and NIYAMA resorts, both owned by Per AQUUM, have installed the artworks outside the windows of their respective LIME Spa and Subsix music club. Both venues are located underwater. Known for his ghostly underwater exhibitions on shipwrecks, the artist turned to fairy tales for his latest theme. Titled ""Phantasy Fairytale,"" the Maldives exhibitions feature characters from fairy tales such as ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""The Snow Queen"" and ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" but with the backdrops changed from gloomy forests to seabeds. In contrast to Franke's previous exhibitions, visitors aren't allowed to dive among the paintings. Setting up the exhibition was no simple task, with divers carefully handling the Plexiglas-encased artworks, valued at $15,000 each. The exhibits will be showing until May 31.

"(CNN) -- When I was a kid I used to write fan letters to the Chicago Cubs. I was young and didn't know any better. But I watched these lovable losers every day on WGN, and was captivated by their famous play-by-play announcer who seemed to get delightfully sauced by the seventh inning. He was old and silly, and I idolized the man. ""Mom, I want to be just like Harry Caray."" ""Oh, dear God."" So, I would sit at the kitchen table and write letters to the players and announcers and, yes, even upper management. I was a weird kid. Someday they'll name a social disorder after me. Anyway, these letters were old-school pen and paper. They were simple, and completely low tech. To be honest, half the fun was waiting weeks on end for a response. This was long before the Internet, back when I actually had an attention span and the ability to form complete sentences. Those days are long gone. Thus, when news spread this week about a little boy in Houston who wrote -- yes WROTE -- an amazing letter to a Major League Baseball player, it sort of blew everyone's mind and went viral. Here's what happened. Back in July, young Lyle Raymond was at Minute Maid Park watching his beloved Astros take on the Seattle Mariners. Both teams had been playing terrible baseball all season, and, really, the only thing mildly interesting about this matchup was the fact that fans were actually sitting right there in the stadium as opposed to doing literally anything else with their time. Like setting themselves on fire. That said, many baseball stat nerds were also enjoying the fact that Kyle Seager of the Mariners was carrying a 15-game hitting streak. So, there was that. Eventually, in the fifth inning, the hot-handed Seager once again stepped up to the plate. Only, instead of extending the streak, he proceeded to launch his bat violently into the stands. Which was easily the most exciting thing to happen for either of these teams in quite some time. ""Diane, wake up. There's flying wood."" Yes, it was all loads of fun. Except that the bat landed on Lyle. Fortunately, he wasn't hurt. And, as an added bonus, he now held the enemy's sword. Remember, this was the very bat that was fueling Seager's 15-game hitting streak. Nevertheless, Lyle politely handed it back over. Of course, Seager promptly finished the game 0-4 because, clearly, just touching something or someone in Houston had plagued his bat with horrible luck. That's what Houston does. It ruins things. Still, it was a nice gesture from the kid. But Lyle didn't stop there. Later, the little boy took a moment from his day and wrote Seager a letter. And then he put it in an envelope. And put a stamp on it. And mailed it off to Seager's address. The United States Postal Service -- it's a real thing. Look it up on Wikipedia after you finish Snapchatting your gonads. Eventually, his note arrived. And that's when Seager's wife Tweeted: . Kyle just got the sweetest letter in the mail from the little boy who got hit by his bat in Houston. Julie Seager included a Twitter photo of the adorable hand-written letter which was made even more adorable by the fact that it was barely legible. Somehow, when a little kid writes like that, it's cute. When I do it I get a restraining order from Katy Perry's lawyer. Odd. Anyway, the letter read (with corrected spelling): . My name is Lyle Raymond. Your bat landed on me. I am OK. Thanks for giving me the thumbs up when you were on first base. I like the Astros but will cheer you on too. I gave back your bat because you had a big hitting streak with that bat. I hope you have more hits with that bat. Your fan, Lyle . Behold! The greatest human being on the planet. Really, there are two things that I love about this story. The first is that this little boy actually wrote a letter. It's so analog! But I'm also inspired that Lyle displayed more class and character than what we can reasonably expect from a child. So, let this be a lesson: Take the time to express kindness with written words. And to take it an important step further, also consider writing letters (or e-mails) not just when you've received crappy service, but ESPECIALLY when somebody has positively impacted your life or the life of others. Don't just fire off a furious e-mail to corporate headquarters when Southwest loses your luggage. Send them a message when the gate agent goes above and beyond to make sure you get on that early flight home to catch your daughter's flute recital. It's going to suck. But you should probably still be there. These things matter. And expressing gratitude and genuine kindness oddly requires far more effort than mindlessly tweeting off some nastygram from the computer in your mom's basement. Be like Lyle. It's so analog!

"(Health.com) -- New FDA rules are helping ensure that we get the protection we pay for, and with skin cancer on the rise (one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in the course of a lifetime), these changes can't come soon enough. Key fixes: Sunscreens will be labeled ""water resistant"" (as opposed to waterproof or sweatproof); they can no longer be called ""sunblocks"" (as it overstates their effectiveness); and they can no longer claim to provide instant sun protection or to last more than two hours without reapplication. On top of that, sunscreens can be labeled ""broad spectrum"" only if they protect equally against UVB (the main culprit of skin cancer) and UVA rays, which cause aging. Unfortunately, the changes won't be on store shelves this summer. Last week the FDA announced it is giving manufacturers six additional months from their original deadline to meet the new requirements. And even with these changes, most of us still have questions. Here are the ones you sent to us, answered by our dermatologists. How much sunscreen do I really need to put on? Anytime you're planning to be outdoors, go with an SPF of at least 30 (45 for a little extra insurance) and put plenty on. The rule of thumb is 1 ounce (the size of a shot glass) on your body, and a teaspoon for your face, but derms advise being even more generous. Reapply every two hours -- more often if you're in and out of the water. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin . Are there any sunscreens good for oily skin? Yes. What you want is an oil-free mineral block in an ultralight gel or liquid. ""Mineral sunscreens help mask redness, and because they reflect UV light, they help keep your skin surface cooler,"" Rodan notes. While you're at it, keep your skin clean by always washing your face after working up a sweat outdoors: Summer breakouts often have more to do with sweating than wearing sunscreen. How do I know if I'm spraying on enough sunscreen? I feel like it all blows away! Spray sunscreens aren't as powerful as lotions, so the trick is to look for one labeled ""continuous spray"" (no need to pump; it keeps spraying as long as your finger stays on the button) and apply two coats -- not one -- every hour, Rodan says. What should I look for in a sunscreen if I have sensitive skin? All the dermatologists we interviewed recommend mineral-based or physical sunscreens made with micronized titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide instead of chemical sunscreens because they're less likely to irritate sensitive skin. Plus, the latest mineral sunscreens give the gentle protection of a physical sunscreen without leaving a white cast.Health.com: Short-and-sweet skin advice . Is sunscreen really necessary for lips? Absolutely. In the past, it wasn't unusual for lip products to come with little or no SPF. Thankfully, many companies have upped the level of protection in lip balms. That's critical because skin cancers on the lower lip, in particular, are especially aggressive. ""These cancers are dangerous, as they're more likely to spread,"" explains Jeremy Green, M.D., a Miami dermatologist. What's the easiest way to stay protected when I'm working out? Dab an SPF (of at least 30) stick or gel on your face, neck, and chest, and on hot spots like shoulders and the backs of your hands. ""The non-tacky sticks are great because they really stay put,"" says Washington, D.C.--based dermatologist Dr. Tina Alster. For the rest of your body, use a sunscreen spray. If you're swimming or perspiring a lot, opt for one of the new formulas that are marked ""water resistant"" for up to 40 or 80 minutes. Health.com: Fun-in-the-sun workout . I hate reapplying! Can I throw on a long-sleeved T-shirt instead at the beach? ""Most cotton shirts are no substitute for sunscreen,"" Rodan says. ""At best, they give you a UPF (ultraviolet protection factor, the equivalent of SPF for clothing) of 8 -- and if they get wet, that devolves to UPF 2."" Instead, invest in a long-sleeved rash guard -- a type of shirt made up of a spandex and nylon mix that was originally used for water sports, but is now popular as a sun protector. Look for one with a UPF rating of 50+. ""Those things are lifesavers -- total protection, even when wet,"" Alster says. Likewise, your sun hat should be floppy, wide-brimmed, and made from a tightly woven material. Will my SPF foundation do the trick for workdays? ""You'd have to slap on a heck of a lot to make it truly effective,"" Green says. A better idea: Layer. Wash your face, swipe on a few drops of antioxidant serum to boost your protection, and apply a tinted moisturizer or foundation with SPF 15 or more. Top it with an ultra fine SPF mineral powder. Green recommends carrying the powder in your bag for touch-ups during the day -- especially if you're lunching alfresco.

"(CNN) -- Three sex abuse lawsuits against the man who once voiced ""Sesame Street's"" Elmo character have been dismissed by a federal appeals court. The 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals made its ruling April 2 in the case of puppeteer Kevin Clash, who resigned from his job after allegations first surfaced in November 2012. The ruling agrees with a lower court's decision that the accusers waited too long to file their suits. The appellate court's decision on the three New York lawsuits does not cover a separate lawsuit, filed in Pennsylvania last year, by Clash's first public accuser. No resolution of the Pennsylvania case has been announced. CNN's attempt to contact Clash's attorney for comment Thursday wasn't immediately successful. A district judge had dismissed the New York suits last July, ruling that the statute of limitations -- which requires a filing within six years of the alleged crime or three years after the plaintiffs turned 18 -- had run out. The plaintiffs -- all adult men who said they were courted and seduced by Clash when they were underage teenagers -- appealed, arguing the six-year rule should have applied from 2012. That, they contended, was the year they realized they'd been harmed. The appellate court ruled that the lower court properly dismissed the suits ""given that the plaintiffs' complaints failed to provide any reason why the plaintiffs were unable to discover their injuries prior to 2012."" Clash provided the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo from 1984 until 2012, when Sheldon Stephens became the first to publicly claim that he had a sexual relationship with Clash as a teen. Stephens called it an ""adult consensual relationship"" in November 2012, but filed the Pennsylvania lawsuit in March 2013 alleging Clash threw a crystal meth sex party for him in 2004, when he was 16. Stephens' attorney was not immediately available for comment Thursday. Clash acknowledged a relationship between ""two consenting adults"" when Stephens' story initially emerged, but he said it otherwise was a ""false and defamatory allegation."" ""I am a gay man,"" Clash, 53, said in a statement in November 2012. ""I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" That month, Clash issued a written statement saying: ""I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart. I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately."" Sesame Workshop is the nonprofit educational organization behind ""Sesame Street.""

"(CNN) -- Like an over-keen online gamer, there appears nothing in Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's post on a flight simulator forum that suggests anything more untoward than exaggerated geekiness. ""Elo guys, zaharie here,"" says the post on a simulator forum. ""Awesome view on 3 panasonic 32 in. LCD HDMI and and 3 touchscreen Dell 21 inches for main (MCP), center pedestal, overhead panel. ""Time to take to the next level of simulation. Motion! looking for buddies to share this passion. ""Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah, BOEING 777 MALAYSIA AIRLINES."" However, Malaysian police this week confiscated the flight simulator and reassembled it at Bukit Aman police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, hoping it could reveal some clues as to the whereabouts of the plane. China shortens list of possible suspects . While police have yet to release any information on its contents, speculation has been rife that its program could reveal anything from a hijacking dry run to practicing how to fly the aircraft undetected. For many in the airline industry, however, the fact that Captain Zaharie had an off-the-shelf -- albeit elaborate -- flight simulator at home is nothing out of the ordinary. ""Realistically speaking, having a simulator means absolutely nothing,"" Julian D'Arcy, the flight operations and training manager at Pacific Simulators, told CNN. ""The only reason I can see that the simulator is under investigation is just to see if he happened to fly that route on his simulator history which might point to where it is. ""It'd be the same if he just had a Nintendo -- it makes no sense."" Could flight have slipped by radar? Operating for fun . He said that while Zaharie's flight simulator might look complex to the uninitiated, its plastic pedals and desktop steering yoke could be bought at any gaming store or electronics shop. ""Most pilots would have some version of a Microsoft flight simulator on their home computers -- you can practice instrument flying and systems knowledge, they're great for that, but you can't teach someone to fly a plane from scratch."" Pilots, he said, often use flight simulators in their spare time, for their own satisfaction, to improve their flight skills and to contribute to an online community of simulation enthusiasts. ""Aviation is one of those things you're born with -- a lot of people do it from when they're little kids. Pilots (operate simulators) for fun and like to the help the community. ""I know a lot of pilots, when they get home will take a remote-control helicopter out of their car boot and fly it around their backyard. It's in the blood -- it's not so much a job as a life."" Satellite signals can confirm a plane's identity . Pilots, passengers probed . Aviation expert Jim Tilmon says the simulator is a useful tool for pilots: ""I didn't read anything into it in the beginning, because some pilots do like to have that to tinker with and if they're going to be flying the next month into an airport they haven't been in before, they can program that and get some experience in doing that and practice. ""But then I rethought it,"" he adds. ""And I wondered if this pilot really had some plan in mind about what it was going to be that was going to deviate from all the things that he had been taught, for example duck under the radar and fly at 500 feet off the ground or whatever else. He would need to practice. And he's got the equipment to do that with."" Malaysia's Transport Ministry said in a statement that police had started their investigation on all the crew of the missing Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, including the pilot and co-pilot, as well as ground staff who had handled the plane. On Monday authorities said Malaysian flight engineer Mohammed Khairul Amri Selamat, 29, who was a passenger on MH370, was being investigated as officials probe anyone on board who had aviation skills. His father, Selamat Bin Omar, told CNN he was confident his son was not involved in the disappearance of the flight. ""They are welcome to investigate me and my family,"" he said. ""He went Beijing to repair a plane and was going to bring it back here."" An airline industry source who regularly flies Boeing aircraft said the flight simulator was unlikely to reveal many clues. ""The idea that he was using a home simulator as a means to train himself to hijack the plane is ludicrous,"" he said. ""Plenty of aviation enthusiasts have 'sims' at home. ""Pilots don't necessarily have them because they fly all the time -- it might be like a journalist writing an article for fun in his spare time -- but I guess if its your passion maybe that's what you'd do."" He said it was unlikely the simulator would be used, as has been speculated, to test run a landing at an undetected airstrip. ""Really, if he is an airline pilot like the rest of us, he already has that skillset -- he doesn't need a simulator to practice. ""His little home sim isn't going to train him to land on a smaller runway.""","MH370 pilot's home flight simulator seized as part of investigation .

"(CNN) -- Dina Lohan, mother of actress Lindsay Lohan, entered a guilty plea to drunken driving and speeding charges in a Long Island, New York, court Tuesday. Lohan, 51, was arrested by New York State Police after a traffic stop last September. She is expected to be sentenced June 3 to perform 100 hours of community service, attend a drunken driver program and a victim impact session, and pay $3,000 in fines and fees, according to Nassau County district attorney spokesman Paul Leonard. Lohan's driver's license will be revoked and her car must have an interlock device -- which tests breath alcohol levels before a car can be started -- installed for a year under the plea agreement, Leonard said. Lohan lawyer Mark Heller told CNN that she can resume driving once the interlock device is installed, even though her license remains officially revoked. ""Considering this is the first day of Passover, we were very pleased to receive an offer which would resolve her criminal case in Nassau County with a commitment of no jail, no probation, and that afforded her the opportunity to resume her driving privileges shortly,"" Heller said. ""She felt this was a great beginning for the Holy week and she was happy with that result."" A test showed Lohan, who lives in Merrick, New York, had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20, which is more than twice the legal limit, Leonard said. The police report said Lohan was driving at 77 mph in a 55 mph zone before she was pulled over. Lohan initially claimed that she had been injured during her arrest, but she recanted her statement after being evaluated by emergency personnel, who found no injuries.","Dina Lohan was charged with DWI, speeding in September .

""There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful,"" Jolie wrote in her op-ed piece for The New York Times. Breast reconstruction is not right for everyone, says CNN contributor Dr. Anthony Youn, a plastic surgeon in Detroit. But studies have shown that women who undergo immediate reconstruction following a mastectomy benefit psychologically. ""To most women, their breasts are really a part of how they see themselves,"" Youn says. ""When you take it away ... it's like you're losing a part of yourself and a part of what you identify with as being a woman."" Infographic: Breast reconstruction options . The majority of patients who want to proceed with reconstruction have options available, says Dr. Colleen McCarthy, a surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. There are two main types to choose from: implants or reconstruction using the patient's own tissue. Some patients have a history of radiation treatments for breast cancer, which may prevent them from receiving implants (radiation can cause scarring, which makes the skin less flexible); others don't have enough donor tissue available on their body to use in a reconstruction. Otherwise the decision is left up to the patient's preference, McCarthy says. Five reasons we love Angelina Jolie . If the patient chooses to have breast implants, there are usually two procedures involved. The first is done to place a tissue expander under the muscle in the breast cavity. Over the next few months, the expander is injected with saline regularly to stretch the muscle. ""If you just put an implant into the breast, it's basically going to sag because there's nothing to hold it up,"" Youn explains. This option allows the patient to decide what size implants she's most comfortable with, McCarthy says. ""Women who choose implant reconstruction will often choose to go slightly smaller or larger (than their original breast size), depending on how much the skin stretches,"" she says. Tough choices in fight against breast cancer gene . The second implant surgery involves placing the permanent implant -- either filled with silicone gel or saline -- in the enlarged cavity. This procedure generally takes between 1.5 and 3 hours, Youn says. ""It's typically easier, less painful and less invasive"" than the second option utilizing the patient's own tissue, he says. Breast implants are not lifelong devices, according to the Food and Drug Administration. A tear in the silicone shell can cause a leak. Saline implants will visibly show the leak by sagging; the FDA recommends silicone gel implant patients get a follow-up MRI every couple of years. The second option is a more complex surgery and has a longer recovery period. Patients generally choose it because it's done in a single procedure and they want a more natural result, McCarthy says. Breasts reconstructed with the patient's tissue are softer and will age like a normal breast. What is the BRCA gene? In this procedure, tissue is taken from the patient -- most often from their abdominal area -- and moved to the breast. This can be done with muscle or without, and there are several ways to keep blood flowing to the tissue, McCarthy says. These decisions depend on how much tissue and/or blood flow is available for the surgeon to work with. ""Other options include (taking) tissue from the back, thigh and buttocks,"" she says. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 ensures all reconstruction services are covered by insurance. That includes any surgery that needs to be done on the opposite breast to make them symmetrical and any nipple reconstruction procedures. Almost 80% of patients have nipple reconstruction done following a breast reconstruction surgery, according to the Mayo Clinic. Youn takes skin from the breast to recreate the nipple. He then sends his patients to a tattoo artist who will fill in the darker color to create the areola. With both types of breast reconstruction the patient will retain some sensation. But numbness is to be expected afterward, Youn says. Why more women are choosing double mastectomies .","Angelina Jolie opted to have breast implants following her double mastectomy .
Another option is to have breasts reconstructed from the patient's own tissue .

"(CNN) -- In the mid-1970s, Gloria Estefan was studying psychology, international law and French at the University of Miami and singing with a local band on the side. She was planning to head to the Sorbonne to further her studies. But then Emilio Estefan swept her off her feet, and their band, the Miami Sound Machine, would soon sweep the nation with its Conga beat. Estefan never made it to the Sorbonne, but she launched an enduring musical career that has made her into a beloved international artist. Thirty-five years later, she remains married to that first and only boyfriend. And the seven-time Grammy winner has now released ""The Standards,"" an album of classic American tunes with a Gloria Estefan twist. It opens with ""Good Morning Heartache,"" and moves on to songs like ""They Can't Take That Away From Me,"" ""What A Difference A Day Makes,"" ""Eu Sei Que Vou Te Amar"" and ""Young at Heart."" The album, she said, brings her career back to some of those first shaky steps onto the national stage. ""It's such a natural thing for me, something that I wanted to do so long and 25 years ago when I danced the conga on 'The Tonight Show.' I sang 'Good Morning Heartache' with my piano player as a second song and this is like full circle,"" Estefan said. ""That's why it starts the record."" Fans know her dance hits like ""Conga,"" ""Hotel Nacional,"" ""Wepa"" and ""Rhythm is Gonna Get You."" But there's something about the ballads -- ""Coming out of the Dark"", ""Higher"" -- that make the heart ache. Behind the big voice, the singer says she's a mom who's missing her daughter, who just left for college. She describes herself as analytical, ""a klutz,"" a boater with a captain's license, a cook of ""killer pancakes,"" a great eyebrow plucker and the go-to diagnoser of maladies for her friends. ""I'm sure I was a doctor in some other life, because I'm a good diagnostician. I listen and they call me and go 'Hey this happened, what do you think? What should I take?'"" she said. "" I'm pretty spot-on on all that stuff. Dr. Glo -- the doctor is in."" She says she's still a student -- a woman who learns and evolves with every new phase in life. In this edited conversation, Estefan tells CNN about why she made this album now, and about the life-threatening accident that helped to shape who she is. CNN: What can you tell your fans about why you did this new album? Estefan: I love this project -- it's very close to my heart because it was music that really started inspiring me in so many ways when I was a kid. I was a kid (who loved music), so I sang since I talked. When I was watching Andy Williams and Dean Martin (and Frank Sinatra) as a little girl, I was really listening to the music. So this ... is what really led the way for me to do my ballads, and to write the music that I wrote. Because most of the stuff I've done really is the ballads. It came from (the heart). CNN: So it sounds like this emotional journey through your life. Estefan: It is very much so. ""What A Difference A Day Makes"" is the first song I sang with Miami Latin Boys on October 25 of 1975, my first professional gig. And we did it in disco, because Viola Wills had just put out that version and it was killer and disco was superhot. But I chose that song for that reason. CNN: You were severely injured when your tour bus was involved in an accident in 1990, and you performed an emotional tribute at the American Music Awards in 1991. How would you describe who you were before and who you were after the accident? Estefan: I'm the same person before and after, but I got to tell you, first of all my knees were knocking that day and I thought, 'People are still going to think I'm still paralyzed and I really can't walk!' What's different is this: I'm very clear on the power of prayer and that fact that it is an energy that connects us. A good thought, not in a religious way, but just in (an) energy way. When you put out good thoughts and good feelings to other human beings, it gets there, and it really does affect you. And I internalized it and it was part of my recuperation. So, I learned that. I learned about a lot of discipline that I didn't know that I had. Patience. Incredible amounts of patience I had to learn. And although I am that way, it grew exponentially. I learned to be a lot more expressive. It made my music more expressive because I realized that could have been it. I was very close to biting it at 32 years old. So I made it a point to really tell people how I feel about them and express -- if I love them, I tell them. My music became a lot more expressive, my way of emoting, 'cause music has always been my way of emoting ... I just let go. I let go a lot. The reason I said that this album couldn't have been made before is because, even beyond that, everything I've experienced until now, I feel so good in my own skin and I'm so much more open and free and just able to let go of a million things that help when you're doing something like these songs. CNN: So how does the diagnostician part of your identity reflect itself in this current album? Estefan: Well, maybe because I'm a control freak in certain things when it comes to work! This is my first production top to bottom, it's been my baby, everything from the idea, the picking of the songs, even the cover, all the photos. CNN: You and your husband, Emilio, have spoken candidly about the political situation in Cuba and your pride in your Cuban-American roots. What are your thoughts on who you are as a Cuban-American woman now, versus when you began? Estefan: I think it's important that we maintain our culture -- all of us, not just Hispanics. You're only stronger if you really know where you came from and you have so much to offer. (If) my parents had not kept alive (our Cuban heritage), our music wouldn't have been the same. What we did never would have come to fruition because it wouldn't have occurred to us to have that vocabulary. That became what made us stand out in the '80s: that ""Conga,"" ""Rhythm is Gonna Get You."" Because we were raised on this stuff. I think it's important to know your roots and to keep them. It only enriches us as human beings, and makes us stronger and better. And you know, little by little, everyone will be more accepting.","Gloria Estefan's new album ""The Standards"" was released September 10 .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea spent the weekend celebrating a first European Champions League triumph after a dramatic defeat of Bayern Munich, but the English club's record signing Fernando Torres was far from happy for the majority of Saturday's historic win. The Spaniard was left out of the starting lineup for the clash at the German team's Allianz Arena, with Chelsea's interim coach Roberto di Matteo deciding to play Ivory Coast forward Didier Drogba alone in attack. Di Matteo's decision paid dividends, as Drogba scored Chelsea's 89th-minute equalizer in the 1-1 draw before converting the winning penalty in a nail-biting shootout. Torres, who has struggled for form since joining Chelsea from Liverpool in a British-record $80 million deal in January 2011, described being on the bench for European club football's most important match as ""perhaps the biggest disappointment in my life."" Munich mourns as Bayern blow big chance . ""I thought I would play in this game and I couldn't imagine not doing so,"" the 28-year-old, who was introduced as an 82nd-minute substitute once Bayern had taken a 1-0 lead through Thomas Muller, told Spanish journalist Guillem Balague. ""But in the end I could participate and offer the team something. I'm really happy."" Torres scored just six league goals last season, although he did enjoy a productive end of the campaign after netting a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers and the decisive goal in Chelsea's Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona. Despite Torres' important contribution at Barca's Camp Nou stadium, Drogba has been Di Matteo's preferred striker in Chelsea's recent important matches. Jubilant Chelsea parade Champions League trophy . Torres was also on the bench for the London club's English FA Cup final win over his former club Liverpool. ""There have been a lot of ups and downs,"" he said. ""There have been many times when I've felt lost, I was not sure what to do. I felt like I didn't know where I belonged. ""This season I have felt things that I never had before. I've felt like they treated me in a way that I didn't expect, not in the way that was spoken of when they signed me. ""We've had a lot of talks and we'll talk about my future at the end of the season because the role I've had this season is not for me, nor is it the one I expected to play when I came here. I'm not comfortable."" The next goal for Torres is to be included in Spain's squad for the forthcoming European Championships in Poland and Ukraine, with coach Vicente del Bosque set to name his 23-man squad on May 27. Torres scored the winning goal as Spain beat Germany in the final of the 2008 tournament in Austria and Switzerland, but his inability to cement a place in Chelsea's team has cast doubt over his international future. The former Atletico Madrid striker has been included in the world champion's squad for the upcoming friendly matches against Serbia and South Korea, along with Chelsea teammate Juan Mata. ""I'll be hoping to be on the list when it is announced,"" he said. ""I feel better than ever, hungrier than ever, but that's what football is like -- often, when you feel you're at your best they don't consider you."" Meanwhile, Saturday's final attracted the attention of some very powerful spectators across the Atlantic. At a G8 summit at Camp David in Maryland, U.S. President Barack Obama took in the action alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It was Cameron who ended the match the happier, but the two European leaders were able to embrace at the climax of a thrilling final.","Fernando Torres disappointed after being on the bench for Champions League final .

"(Wired) -- Apple has sent a clear message to any developers who try to game its iTunes App Store. Software developer Molinker has been kicked out, along with more than 1,000 of its iPhone applications. The Chinese developer had, according to some estimates, 1,000-plus applications in the store, most of which were copycat knockoffs of existing applications. When a friend of writers at the iPhoneography photography blog saw these rather poor applications consistently scoring 5-star reviews, they got suspicious. Some investigation showed that Molinker's applications were getting many top ratings and almost nothing in the 2-to-4-star range. In fact, the only other ratings were often 1-star, and likely the only truthful feedback on the apps' pages. iPhoneography wrote a long letter to Apple's marketing boss, Phil Schiller, and posited that Molinker was giving out promotional codes -- essentially free copies of the applications -- in return for these 5-star reviews. In almost all cases, these reviews were poorly written, and came from customers who almost exclusively reviewed just Molinker applications. This scam was so effective that the applications regularly rose to the tops of charts. One, called ColorMagic, even made it into the Staff Favorites section of the store (which brings some doubt as to whether these are actually staff picks at all). After a week of typical Apple silence, iPhoneography wrote again, and received a reply direct from Schiller: ""Yes, this developer's apps have been removed from the App Store and their ratings no longer appear either."" So what, you say? Some dodgy developer got its entire portfolio chucked down the memory hole, and the App Store continues as if Molinker had never existed. First, the scale of this purging is huge: 1,000 applications represents almost 1 percent of the entire App Store offering. This alone shows that Apple is happy to do whatever it takes to keep its house clean. It also shows the power that Apple has over those that sell in its exclusive marketplace. Sure, Molinker was caught cheating, and punished, but Apple could pull the same trick on any developer, for any reason. We don't think that it would, butiPhone developers are a nervous bunch as it is, rubbing on rabbits' feet and crossing their fingers as their creations make their way through a fickle and seemingly arbitrary approval process. And what about the customers? We doubt that Molinker will be refunding all the money it has made selling the applications (plus 30 percent on top that went to Apple, and is non-returnable). This means that, at best, these customers can keep using their now-banned apps until a future OS update breaks them. Perhaps, though, they should have bought better applications in the first place? This is the key. Because there is no clear way to try-before-you buy, the shareware model that works so well for computers, the ratings are absurdly important to choosing an application. Molinker's scam, then, is almost a symptom of the App Store setup itself. Can Apple actually be blamed for the rise of the ratings scamsters?

"(CNN) -- Radio personality Rush Limbaugh declared himself bewildered by recent papal statements ""about the utter evils of capitalism."" In his broadcast, titled ""It's Sad How Wrong Pope Francis Is (Unless It's a Deliberate Mistranslation by Leftists),"" Limbaugh said the remarks add up to ""just pure Marxism coming out of the mouth of the Pope."" This would indeed be remarkable, if true. Is it? Limbaugh is referring to the new apostolic exhortation, ""Evangelii Gaudium,"" or ""The Joy of the Gospel,"" in which Pope Francis lays out his vision for the church's proclamation of the gospel. For Catholics, enthusiastic about the Pope's unguarded style, the document offers a refreshing departure from the traditional voice: ""There are Christians whose lives seem like Lent without Easter,"" the Pope laments. ""I want to remind priests that the confessional must not be a torture chamber."" He decries a kind of ""spiritual worldliness"" that ""hides behind the appearance of piety,"" warns against ""sourpusses"" who would substitute love of Jesus Christ with a love of the church, and rejects a defeatist ""tomb psychology"" that would transform Christians into ""mummies in a museum."" And yet certainly the press has focused on those several pages -- in a document of 50,000 words -- that offer a vivid critique of the global economic system, what Pope Francis terms ""an economy of exclusion and inequality."" Here, Limbaugh charges, ""The Pope has now gone beyond Catholicism, and this is pure political."" More ""saddened"" than outraged, Limbaugh states that ""it is very clear (the Pope) doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to capitalism and socialism, and so forth."" Actually, the words ""capitalism"" and ""socialism"" do not appear in the document. But it is not difficult to discern the Pope's meaning: ""Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say 'thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills."" As the first pope from the Southern Hemisphere, as one who experienced the financial meltdown of the Argentine economy, as a bishop who encouraged his priests to work in the slums, Pope Francis knows the global economy from the perspective of those at the bottom. Decrying the idolatry of money, he sets himself firmly against a ""deified marketplace"" in which the masses of human beings become powerless spectators, if not disposable ""leftovers."" Limbaugh, who concedes that he is not Catholic, though he says he's ""been tempted a number of times to delve into it,"" nevertheless ""knows enough to know that this would have been unthinkable for a pope to believe or say just a few years ago."" But little distinguishes Pope Francis from the prophetic utterances of his predecessors. What he is offering is not ""Marxism,"" as Limbaugh says, but bedrock Catholic social teaching that goes back more than a century. Both Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI were explicit in their warnings against liberal capitalism and the dictatorship of the marketplace, producing encyclicals which, for their emphasis on social justice and the ""option for the poor,"" would surely qualify for Rush Limbaugh as the very elixir of ""Marxism."" Yet Pope Francis may have touched a particular nerve. In the most often cited paragraph of his document, he notes, ""Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. ""This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naÃ¯ve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting."" Here, you might say he is getting personal, stepping beyond familiar pleas for the poor to confront a central article of faith among the elite beneficiaries of our economy: The notion that whatever benefits the wealthiest -- tax cuts or financial deregulation -- will inevitably benefit those at the bottom. Apart from whether this is confirmed by the facts, Pope Francis attacks the corrosive effects of such an ideology on our capacity for compassion and concern for others. ""The culture of prosperity deadens us; we are thrilled if the market offers us something new to purchase. In the meantime, all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us."" Limbaugh finds this particular statement so bewildering that he repeats it three times. Business commentators may rise to the defense of the marketplace. But Pope Francis is not primarily interested in a debate about ""wealth creation."" He stands in a tradition that goes back to the prophets of Israel, whose moral litmus test was the welfare of society's least and most vulnerable members. Pope Francis has taken it upon himself to speak for those who have no voice, to arouse the conscience of Christians, and to contribute to a culture of solidarity. He longs, he says, for a ""Church which is poor and for the poor."" Perhaps what distinguishes him from his predecessors is simply that he has identified this as a central focus, and that he evidently intends to hold the church accountable to this mission. Of course no one is troubled by a pope who embraces the sick and loves the poor. But when he dares to reflect on the moral and structural causes of poverty, that is a different matter. As Dom Helder Camara, another prophetic archbishop from Latin America, famously observed, ""When I give food to the poor they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist."" Some things never change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Ellsberg.","Rush Limbaugh says Pope Francis sounds Marxist for his statements on poverty .
Pope decries the idolatry of money, extreme materialism and disregard for poor .
Limbaugh says remarks ""would have been unthinkable for a pope"" to say few years ago .
Robert Ellsberg: But concern for the poor above all is not Marxist, it's the core of Catholicism ."
"(CNN) -- As they contemplate military action against Syria, one of many considerations members of Congress and Obama administration officials have to weigh is how a U.S. strike against the regime of Bashar al-Assad might effect the already complicated, even poisonous, state of Sunni-Shia relations in the region. Three of the leading Sunni states, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE, have already offered their military assets if a US strike happens. Last week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that the Shia government of Iran and close Syrian ally Russia would work in ""extensive cooperation"" to protect Syria. An American-led war in Syria with the military backing of some powerful Sunni states against a de facto Shia alliance of Iran, Syria, Iraq and Lebanese Hezbollah would likely greatly exacerbate the already tense relations between Sunni and Shia across the region. In Syria, a popular uprising against a repressive ruler in 2011 has morphed into what is now a largely sectarian civil war pitting the country's Sunni Muslim majority against al-Assad's minority Alawite sect, which is associated with Shia Islam. The Syrian regime is propped up with weapons and funds from Iran's Shia rulers and also benefits significantly from the support on the ground of battle-hardened fighters from Lebanese Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy. As a possible U.S. strike looms in Syria, what had hitherto been a shadowy proxy war, with Sunni countries such as Saudi Arabia quietly supporting the Syrian rebels and Iran supporting al-Assad, could now devolve into a full-blown war that is openly supported by the most powerful Sunni and Shia states. That is a real potential problem that needs to be weighed by Obama national security officials and representatives in Congress as they consider the options in Syria, because across the Muslim world from Lebanon to Pakistan, Sunnis and Shias are increasingly at each other's throats. A further intensification of the already brutal Syrian civil war might further destabilize Syria's fragile neighbors; both Lebanon and Iraq could plunge back into civil wars. Already in July, the United Nations recorded the highest death toll in Iraq since 2008, when the Iraq War was raging. In that month alone, more than 1,057 civilians and security personnel were killed. Many of those deaths were the result of bombings claimed by the Sunni terrorist group al-Qaeda in Iraq and were directed at Shia targets. A splinter organization of al-Qaeda in Iraq is now fighting in Syria and is regarded as the most effective force fighting Assad, who it deems a heretic. It's a very old story. The two dominant sects of Islam, Sunni and Shia, first split over the issue of who was the rightful successor of the Prophet Muhammad following his death in 632. The conflict between the two sects has waxed and waned over the many centuries since, but right now the Syrian conflict could exacerbate the regional split along sectarian lines that we have seen over the past few years. In 2011 the Sunni monarchy of the Gulf state of Bahrain backed by more than a thousand soldiers from Saudi Arabia put down with harsh tactics an uprising by its disadvantaged Shia majority population. The Bahrain government hinted that the uprising was an Iranian plot. The sectarian conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Bahrain have also spilled over into Lebanon and Egypt. On June 23, in Lebanon's port city of Sidon, soldiers clashed with supporters of a hardline Sunni cleric, Sheikh Ahmed al-Assir, who had spoken out vehemently against the Syrian regime as well as the Shia Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah. On the same day, four Egyptian Shia Muslims were stabbed, beaten, and dragged through the streets by members of a hardline Sunni group in the Giza neighborhood of Cairo. The intensifying sectarian tensions in Egypt were partially the fault of the recently-ousted Muslim Brotherhood government. A week before the Giza attack, for example, President Mohamed Morsi had appeared on stage with hardline clerics who called Shias ""filthy."" And in May, Salafist members of Egypt's parliament denounced Shias as ""a danger to Egypt's national security."" Beyond the Middle East, sectarian violence has also soared in South Asia over the past few years. More than 180 members of Pakistan's minority Shi'a Hazara community were killed in two massive bombings in the first two months of 2013 alone. In neighboring Afghanistan, violent attacks on Shia Muslims are less frequent, but in December 2011, two nearly simultaneous suicide bombs in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif killed more than 60 Shia civilians as they celebrated the annual religious festival of Ashura. We can expect sectarian tensions to continue boiling across the Muslim world, as the Syrian conflict grinds on and political and social unrest persist in many countries in the region. Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups will seek to exploit these sectarian divisions to garner support for their own violent agenda, and may well find greater room to operate because of it. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have mobilized their deep coffers to support extremist Sunni groups in the past, and will continue to do so as long as it means they are able to counterbalance Iran and its support for Shia regimes and militant groups. All of these factors must be weighed as the United States weighs military action. They are not an argument for doing nothing in the face of al-Assad's large-scale use of chemical weapons but they are a reason to heed Machiavelli's warning ""Wars begin when you will, but they do not end when you please.""","Peter Bergen: Complicating the Syria picture is regionwide sectarian strife .

"(CNN) -- This is not your typical Super Bowl Sunday. There are things that are down. The temperature, for one. Ticket prices, in some cases, are another. A few things are up. The cost of the ads many people will be tuning in for -- a record $4.5 million. The security presence, even by Super Bowl standards, will be big. So how about some good news? Weather forecasters say that by game time -- note to party hosts, 6:30 p.m. ET --- a clipper system will have moved through New Jersey, leaving just a few inches of new snow behind in East Rutherford.

That's not as nice as past Super Bowl sites like Miami (high of 79 on Sunday), Tampa (81) or next year's host city, Glendale, Arizona (73), but compared with what might have happened this crazy winter, it must be the NFL's best imagined scenario. Not that they haven't planned for other possibilities. ""We feel like we're prepared for every alternative,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told ESPN's ""Mike & Mike in the Morning"" on Monday. That included moving the time of the game if league officials felt like the safety of the fans was in jeopardy. ""We're working with all the officials here. We're pretty comfortable we'll be playing at 6:30 on Sunday night.""

But they won't be the only people guarding the game. ""There's eyes all over the place, whether it's state, local, federal or county assets there,"" he told CNN's Alexandra Field. That also includes 3,000 private security guards on site. And extra security for mass transit options because there will only be 12,000 parking spots at the game for 80,000 fans and 5,000 media members. Live updates from Media Day . ""There is a template within the NFL and there are certain things that we follow with the NFL. But we have to use our own template because every city is different,"" he told CNN. ""Obviously it's different than other Super Bowls because of our proximity to New York City."" The proximity of the stadium to waterways and railways will mean extra Coast Guard boats on game day and more planes from federal agencies in the sky equipped with infrared and night-vision systems. Homeland Security officials said federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, will deploy hundreds of employees to assist New Jersey and New York police secure what's been officially designated ""an event of national significance."" And there is one noticeable difference for fans, a change instituted for this NFL season. In light of the bombings at the Boston Marathon, if fans want to bring a bag bigger than 4 Â½ by 6 Â½ inches, it must be clear plastic. (Even the garbage being taken out has to go in clear bags). An affordable Super Bowl? Well, not quite for many fans. But prices of game day tickets on the secondary market have been sliding since the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks each won their conference championship games. On the NFL's official ticket exchange site, more than 3,300 tickets were available, starting at a little more than $1,600. There were almost 4,800 tickets on StubHub, a popular online ticket reseller. As Bleacher Report points out, with the game in the New York metropolitan area and featuring a top-rated offense versus a top-rated defense, it seemed like prices would have been astronomical. But that hasn't been the case in the past week. SeatGeek, which aggregates listings from ticket resellers, said the Super Bowl might be the least expensive since 2002, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Seat Geek said the prices for all seats has dropped 40% since the two conference championship games about nine days ago. The big drop in prices for the game have been in the end zone and upper deck seats, the paper reported. SeatGeek spokesman Will Flaherty told the Denver Post: ""Strong supply and uncertainty about the weather forecast has helped to keep prospective buyers on the sideline for now, driving prices downward at a record rate."" So now that the weather will be practically balmy for this time of year, back accounts might be emptied after all. Super Bowl XLVIII ticket prices continue to drop as game day approaches . Or just watch on TV . Watching the game on television means seeing all of the famed Super Bowl commercials. That way you'll get to see all 32 minutes and 30 seconds with the other partygoers without having to watch online the next day. Of course you can get a glimpse of some of the ads before the game and not have to slip off to the bathroom during actual game action. For some companies the game is an opportunity to take $4.5 million to say ""hi"" to new potential buyers. ""The Super Bowl for us is a risk. We do a lot of marketing, but it's the first time we'll hit a really mass consumer audience,"" Squarespace CEO Anthony Casalena told the New York Times. Squarespace is among the companies that have posted a commercial on YouTube already. The company's blog said it will also release an extended version of the spot and some of the material that was cut after the game. There will also be one ad from a small company that wins a 30-second commercial paid for by financial software company Intuit. The contest was open to any U.S.-based business with 50 or fewer full-time employees. The commercial will air during the third quarter. This year's Super Bowl will have 43 advertisers, according to CNNMoney. CNN's Chris Welch and Evan Perez contributed to this story.","Forecasters say Super Bowl XLVIII weather should be good .

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- Angry relatives of missing South Korean ferry passengers cursed government and police officials Thursday for failing to do enough to save the lives of their loved ones as hopes dim of finding any survivors. The relatives berated Fisheries Minister Lee Ju-young and two coast guard officials, accusing them of misleading the public about the operation and of wasting time. ""How can you fool us into believing you were out there trying to save our children?"" one mother yelled at the officials. Also, officials at the South Korean headquarters for the task force coordinating the search told CNN that they believe the body of a boy who reportedly made the first emergency call from the ship after it began to list sharply has been recovered. DNA tests will help officially identify the remains, officials said early Friday. The ferry Sewol lurched on its side and capsized April 16 with 476 people aboard, including more than 300 high school students on a field trip to the resort island of Jeju. The number of confirmed dead rose to 181 on Thursday, with 121 still missing, according to the South Korean coast guard. Hopes of finding any survivors in the sunken ferry have all but evaporated following news that divers have found no air pockets on the third and fourth levels of the ship, where many passengers were thought to have been trapped. Authorities do not yet know what caused the sinking, but a widening criminal investigation has ensnared the ship's captain and 14 other crew members and led prosecutors to search the offices of the company that owns the ship. Authorities also searched the offices of 20 affiliated companies and the home of Yoo Byung-un, the man whose family is believed to be behind the company, looking for any evidence of wrongdoing that could have led to the ship's sinking. Among other things, investigators have said they will look into whether modifications to the ship in 2013 could have altered the ship's balance and contributed to what happened. Kim Yong-rok, an opposition lawmaker who represents Jindo, an island near where the ship sank, told CNN that modifications to add 117 more passenger cabins to the ship raised the ferry's center of gravity. Kim said the work on the ferry took place in 2013 after the Sewol was purchased from a Japanese company. The ferry's passenger capacity was expanded from 804 passengers to 921 passengers, he said. South Korean prosecutors were unable to confirm those details for CNN. But they are investigating the private organization responsible for inspecting and certifying ships for the South Korean government, which signed off on the work. Authorities said they don't yet know precisely what caused the ship to list before it eventually capsized and sank into the ocean on a routine journey from Incheon to the island of Jeju. Young crew member hailed as heroine . In recent disasters, captains didn't hang around . They say it didn't appear that the ferry was overloaded, according to figures provided by the company and the South Korean coast guard. But coast guard officials said investigators won't know for sure how much cargo the ship was carrying until it is raised from the waters of the Yellow Sea. A solemn return to school . On Thursday, the return to classes at Danwon High School was steeped in grief. About two-thirds of the passengers on the Sewol were students at the school in Ansan near Seoul. Many of them, from the school's second grade, are dead or missing. Several teachers were also lost in the disaster. On Thursday morning, a series of black hearses drove through the school gates. In each one, a person in the passenger seat held a portrait of a dead student. A bus with tinted windows followed behind carrying relatives and friends. They were making one last symbolic trip to the school. After the visit, the somber convoys drove on to the students' funerals. 'I want to see you' At the school's entrance stood a makeshift shrine of flowers and food treats. Hundreds of notes held messages to the dead and missing students. ""Big brother, you have to live, you have to come back."" implored one. ""I want to see you,"" another said. ""I love you and pray for you."" Many of the messages from other students expressed regret at not being able to help their classmates in their hour of need. Thousands of yellow ribbons were tied to the school gates, as well as nearby trees and posts. The ribbons have become symbols of hope that survivors might still be found in the submerged vessel, picking up a practice used in the United States for soldiers and hostages overseas. The third-grade students, who are in the final year of high school in South Korea, aren't going back to regular classes. The local health service has provided therapists to speak with the teenagers about grief and loss. First-grade students are expected to return next week. It's unclear when the handful of students in the second grade who didn't go on the ill-fated field trip, and those who survived the sinking, will resume classes. The students who arrived at the school Thursday had to pass a throng of journalists. Many of them had hoods or caps covering their faces. Students remember vice principal who took own life . Murky waters cloud the horror facing rescue divers . CNN's Nic Roberston reported from Jindo, South Korea, and CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Will Ripley, K.J. Kwon, Andrew Stevens, Steven Jiang, Kyung Lah, Tim Schwarz, Stella Kim and Judy Kwon also contributed to this report.","Officials think they found the body of a boy who called in the emergency .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Some 80 years after its first launch, the iconic board game of Monopoly has finally released its first African city edition. A Lagos-themed version of the popular real estate game was unveiled earlier this week, making Nigeria's bustling economic capital the first city in the continent to have a dedicated Monopoly edition. ""Lagos is special, it's a megacity, one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa,"" says Nimi Akinkugbe, head of Bestman Games which is distributing the Lagos edition. ""But apart from that, Lagos also holds a very special place for Nigerians all over the world. There are about 15 million Nigerians in the diaspora who are very nostalgic about Lagos; it's not just for Lagosians but for people all over the world,"" she adds. Read related: Lagos of the future . The affluent Banana Island, a man-made waterfront community boasting multi-million dollar mansions and manicured lawns, was revealed as the game's most expensive property, joining Boardwalk in the standard U.S. edition and Mayfair in the London version. Many of the squares for the game's upmarket locations feature sponsorship from banks, radio stations and shopping centers. In contrast, the square dedicated to the floating shantytown of Makoko, which is the cheapest piece of real estate in the Lagos edition of the game, was left unsponsored. Watch video: Monopoly adds first African city . Local officials were heavily involved in bringing Monopoly to the sprawling metropolis of some 15 million people. Their goal was partly to promote the city's rich history and landmark sites but also to encourage responsible behavior and inform citizens about laws that are often overlooked. ""You've been caught driving against traffic. Report for psychiatric evaluation,"" is the message on one Chance card, which issues a fine -- in line with the laws introduced recently by the local government to deal with the city's major traffic problem. Read related: Africa's daily commuting grind . Another card reads: ""For using the overhead pedestrian bridge on Worodu Road, move forward three spaces."" Akinkugbe explains that many lives have been lost as people tend to cross the express highway by running across the road. ""By rewarding the person that uses the overhead bridge by moving forwards three spaces, slowly it begins to sink in,"" she says. And there are also references to Nigeria's corruption problem: ""For attempting to bribe a law enforcement agent, pay a fine,"" says another card. ""This gives us an opportunity to educate the public about those things,"" says Akinkugbe. ""[It's about] penalizing negative behavior and rewarding good behavior but in a fun and enjoyable way. We all know that learning through play is one of the most powerful forms of learning because it is not forced but is done in a relaxed, easy way."" Akinkugbe says that two other African countries -- South Africa and Morocco -- have a version of Monopoly, but Lagos is the only city in the continent to have its own edition. She says that the Lagos game was sold out within 24 hours of its release, as about 4,000 people got their hands on it. ""Thousands of Nigerian families they are going to be playing Monopoly over Christmas, having a good laugh and learning at the same time, and just appreciating the city,"" she says. The first patented version of Monopoly was launched in the United States in 1935 at the height of Great Depression. It has since become arguably the most popular board game in the world, with several localized editions released over the years.","Lagos is the first African city to get its own edition of Monopoly .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Police in India blasted protesters with water cannon and tear gas Saturday as clashes broke out at a rally in New Delhi against rape, leaving scores of people drenched and angry. The demonstration was prompted by wide public outrage over what police said was the gang-rape and beating of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in the capital last Sunday. Her injuries were so severe she spent days in intensive care in a city hospital, battling for her life. Police said Saturday that she had recovered enough to give a statement to a magistrate from her hospital bed the previous evening. Dozens of police, some equipped with bamboo canes, flanked the water cannon as it blasted out on to the thousands of protesters assembled by New Delhi's historic India Gate. Some demonstrators attempted to break through the security barriers blocking access to the country's government district, parliament building and presidential palace. Others chanted, punched the air in defiance and waved banners as the police sought to disperse them from Raisina Hill, the seat of Indian power. ""Hang them till death,"" read the placard of one protester seeking capital punishment for rape suspects. ""Stop this shame,"" read another. A third said, ""Give them the same physical torture."" Shouts of ""We want justice"" also rose above the large and diverse crowd, symbolizing a widely felt anger over attacks against women. Banners proclaiming the same message were marked with a hangman's noose. Surviving rape: iReporters speak out . One young woman protester, who said her leg was injured by a blow from a police baton, lamented what she called a failure of democracy in the country. ""Today, I have seen democracy dying,"" she said. New Delhi's police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said up to 35 protesters and nearly 40 police personnel were injured. Thirty barricades were damaged in the course of the protest, he said, and police fired 125 tear gas shells. A number of vehicles were also damaged, he said. Saturday's furious protest was just the latest held across the country in the past week, where official data show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011. New Delhi alone reported 572 rapes last year and more than 600 in 2012. Bhavyaa Sharma, a 19-year-old student at a leading women's college in the capital, told CNN how she fears for her safety when she leaves the campus. Sexual assaults on women in the city have horrified her and her female friends. ""I feel vulnerable here,"" said Sharma, accompanied by her classmates. ""I am very sure about it. Delhi is not safe for women."" Opinion: Rapes show that Indian society needs a new attitude . Six suspects, including the bus driver and a minor, have now been arrested in connection with Sunday's rape. As fury about the assault gathered pace, some Indian lawmakers even called for treating rape as a capital crime. ""We'll work collectively to see we make a law which is deterrent and preventive,"" said New Delhi's chief minister, Sheila Dikshit. India's Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told reporters Saturday that the government would work toward increasing punishment in ""rarest of the rare"" rape cases. But pressed on whether the administration would agree to demands for death by hanging in such instances, he said: ""We'll have to see in what way it (the rape sentencing) can be enhanced."" Shinde said the government was pushing for a speedy trial for the attack. Authorities are also taking a number of steps to improve security for women in New Delhi, particularly on public transport, he said. ""(The) government shares the widespread concern and support that has been expressed throughout society for the girl who has so suffered. Government also respects the right of legitimate protest,"" he said. ""At the same time, there is need to exercise calm at this juncture and for everyone to work together to improve the safety and security environment."" In the meantime, the victim has been promised the best possible medical care, Shinde said. A physician described the woman's condition Saturday as better than a day earlier, but said there was still a risk of infection. She is receiving psychological as well as medical care, he said. Read more: Indian girl seeks justice after gang rape . Following the brutal assault, the country's human rights body shot off notices to city police and federal authorities, demanding an explanation. ""The incident has raised the issue of declining public confidence in the law and order machinery in the city, especially in its capacity to ensure safety of women, as a number of such incidents have been reported in the national capital in the recent past,"" the National Human Rights Commission said in a statement Tuesday. Home Secretary R. K. Singh announced the suspension of five police officers in the wake of Sunday's rape. Meantime, some observers say anti-women acts in India stem from the country's largely patriarchal social setup. Indians' preference for sons over daughters, for example, has manifested itself in a worrisome population imbalance. The 2011 census of the world's second-most populous nation recorded an alarming drop in the percentage of girls among country's preschoolers. For every 1,000 boys up to 6 years old, the census counted 914 girls, a drop from 927 a decade ago. It's illegal in India to abort a child because of its sex, but such abortions happen, often aided by illegal clinics. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh and Mallika Kapur reported from New Delhi, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","Dozens of people are hurt in protests in New Delhi's government district .

"(CNN) -- Responding to reports that snowy owls were being killed with shotgun blasts, New York airport officials are initiating a program to trap and relocate birds seen as a threat to air safety. The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey said in a statement Monday that it would be work with the state Department of Environmental Conservation to implement the program. Numerous media reports cited sources as saying the Port Authority had the snowy owl on its no-fly list, allowing shotgun-toting specialists to shoot and kill the birds. Concerns were raised that the owls were interfering with planes. ""DEC and the Port Authority are working together closely to quickly develop a process to trap and relocate snowy owls that pose a threat to aircraft,"" the Department of Environmental Conservation said in statement. ""This process will provide a humane alternative for the snowy owls while ensuring passenger safety."" In the last two weeks, five planes in New York airports were struck by snowy owls that have been migrating to the region in ""far higher than typical numbers,"" according to a statement from the Port Authority. The owls have been a concern for decades at Boston's Logan International Airport for decades, where authorities use traps to catch the birds, according to Norman Smith, director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's Blue Hills Trailside Museum, who heads the initiative. ""I think it's up to each individual airport to provide the safety that they need,"" Smith told CNN. ""Logan Airport has been very supportive about capturing these birds and removing them from the airport."" While Smith acknowledged that it takes more time to trap and later release the birds, he said the effort was worth it. ""Is it more difficult to trap a bird than to shoot one with a shotgun?"" Smith asked. ""Probably, but what Logan Airport does is, by capturing the birds, they not only protect the aircraft but the bird as well."" Smith said that while snowy owls are not endangered, their numbers are declining and ""nobody knows the actual population of these birds. It's illegal to possess or release migratory game birds and upland game birds without the proper license from the Department of Environmental Conservation. ""The Port Authority's goal is to strike a balance in humanely controlling bird populations at and around the agency's airports to safeguard passengers on thousands of aircraft each day,"" the agency's statement said.","New York airport officials say they will trap snowy owls seen as threats to air safety .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Call it a love affair so far between Barack Obama and the American people. President-elect Barack Obama is on vacation in Hawaii after appointing his Cabinet in record time. More than eight in 10, or 82 percent, of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Wednesday approve of the way Obama is handling his presidential transition. That approval is up 3 percentage points from when CNN asked the same question at the beginning of December. Fifteen percent of those surveyed disapprove of the way the president-elect is handling his transition, down 3 points from the last poll. Obama's approval is higher than George W. Bush eight years ago. Bush had a 65 percent approval rating during his transition, and Bill Clinton was at 67 percent in 1992. ""Barack Obama is having a better honeymoon with the American public than any incoming president in the past three decades. He's putting up better numbers, usually by double digits, than Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan or either George Bush on every item traditionally measured in transition polls,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. The poll also suggests that the public approves of the president-elect's Cabinet nominees, with 56 percent of those questioned saying his appointments have been outstanding or above average. Thirty-two percent said they feel the picks have been average, and 11 percent said Obama's choices have been below average or poor. That 56 percent figure is 18 percentage points higher than those who said Bush's Cabinet appointments were outstanding or above average and 26 points higher than those who felt the same way about Clinton's nominees.

""Obama walks in with nearly twice the support on the economy that President-elect Clinton had in January 1993, and he beats Ronald Reagan as well,"" Holland adds. A third said that their impression of Obama has gotten better since the election, with 8 percent saying their opinion has gotten worse. ""The bad news for Obama: History shows that presidents usually start to lose support once they assume office and start making the tough decisions. But with eight in 10 currently approving of Obama, he can give away 20 or 30 points and still have a majority of the country on his side. That's a reservoir of good will that may help him get things done in his first few months on the job,"" Holland said.  Watch whether Obama can fix the economy » .

"(CNN) -- The movement to stop a horrific new Taliban-like penal code in Brunei is growing. On Tuesday, I spoke at a rally organized by the Feminist Majority Foundation to demand that the sultan of Brunei immediately rescind the new law that includes the stoning to death of gay men and lesbians and the public flogging of women. These ""kill-a-gay"" laws or laws that allow the brutal whipping of women for abortions violate international law and have no place in civilized society. My husband, Jay Leno, said it clearly at the rally: ""What year is it, 1814 or 2014?"" As a board member of the Feminist Majority Foundation, I fought to stop the Taliban in Afghanistan. When no one else was paying attention, we were there, exposing the Taliban's reign of terror and the special viciousness it reserved for women and girls. We built a strong, diverse, unrelenting movement against the Taliban and helped Afghan women rally against gender apartheid. We fought the Taliban then, and we will fight these Taliban-like laws now. There is no room for compromise. We are talking about people being stoned to death. We are talking about people being flogged. As we saw all too recently in Afghanistan, flogging can lead to death or paralysis. This is cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment for actions that no one should dare call ""crimes."" No one should be killed for who they are or whom they love. Women should not be abused for making their own health decisions. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed deep concern about this new penal code and has stated unequivocally that the Brunei law violates international law and human rights. Now that the sultan of Brunei has announced that the law will begin to be phased in, the United States and the United Nations must condemn the Brunei government. And if Brunei fails to rescind this gruesome law, the U.N. should investigate whether Brunei should be allowed to remain a member of that body, a privilege it has had since 1984. I pledge to do my part. The Feminist Majority Foundation pulled its annual Global Women's Rights Awards, an event that Jay and I co-chair every year, from the Beverly Hills Hotel -- a Dorchester Collection property owned by the Brunei Investment Agency. The agency is managed by the Brunei Ministry of Finance, which is controlled by the sultan. We simply could not hold women's rights event at a hotel whose owner blatantly violates basic human rights. We have also joined with LGBT rights groups and other women's right groups to protest this draconian new penal code. Although the law is being styled as a ""religious"" law, we see here, as we saw in Afghanistan, that religion has little to do with it. This is about a dictatorship using terror tactics to control the population. And we can't stand for that. The sultan announced last week that he would phase in the new penal code over three years -- and the first phase, which includes fines and prison sentences, went into effect May 1. The second phase includes corporal punishment such as amputations and flogging women who have abortions. The stoning to death of gay men and lesbians is slated for the third phase. But we can stop it. We've done it before, and you can help. The Feminist Majority Foundation has launched a massive petition drive and social media campaign using the hashtag #StopTheSultan, calling on the government of Brunei to rescind the code and asking the United Nations to take action. Sign the petition, and then spread the word. We want everyone to know about this outrageous penal code. For human rights and dignity, it must be changed.

"Moscow (CNN) -- A Moscow high school student shot a teacher and a police officer dead and held about 20 other pupils hostage in a classroom Monday before he was disarmed and detained, Russian authorities said, just days before Russia hosts the Winter Olympics. In a rare school shooting in Russia, the attacker entered his school in northern Moscow with a rifle and held students and a teacher hostage in a biology classroom, the Investigative Committee of Russia said. The incident, at School No. 263, happened around noon local time when the armed student forced his way past a security guard, who raised an alarm. ""On his way to the class the shooter injured one of the teachers who died later,"" said the committee, Russia's federal intelligence agency. ""The police officers arrived to the school. When they entered the building the shooter opened a gun fire, injured one and killed another."" All of the hostages were released and the gunman was detained, it added. State media said there were about 20 students in the classroom. The incident comes as Russia prepares to host the Winter Olympic Games, due to start in Sochi this week. Motive unclear . State news agency RIA Novosti said it was unclear what motivated the attack. State news channel Russia 24 said the student is said to have had an issue with a geography teacher. This was not the teacher who was shot or who was among the hostages, it said. He is also said to have been an ""A"" student, state media reported, adding that his apartment is being searched by investigators. Television footage showed the school building surrounded by police and fire emergency vehicles. An Emergencies Ministry helicopter landed near the school and evacuated the injured police officer, Russia 24 said. The media outlets said the student had a small-bore rifle and a hunting carbine, which were registered under his father's name. They reported he is said to have fired 11 times. His father called him and spoke to him for 15 minutes to try to convince him to release his hostages. The father then went to the school and talked to the student in the classroom. Only then did he agree to release his hostages, state media said. CNN could not immediately independently verify this. Olympics are days away . The shooting came as the global spotlight falls on Russia, which will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in four days. Security concerns have been heightened after twin bombings in Volgograd in December. The Olympic Games will begin Friday in Sochi, and a huge security operation is under way around the Black Sea resort city. Russia is pouring resources into ensuring that the Olympic Games, seen as a flagship project of President Vladimir Putin, go off without problems.","NEW: Student said to have had issue with geography teacher, state news channel reports .

"(CNN) -- Flat racing has Royal Ascot; tennis has Wimbledon; football has the FA Cup. But for fans of National Hunt racing -- a grueling form of the sport which combines speed, stamina and accuracy over a course of at least two miles with an array of imposing jumps -- there is no meeting like the Cheltenham Festival. Although jumps racing carries a lower social status than flat racing in the United Kingdom, its following is arguably bigger. What is unarguable is that its fans are as passionate, its jockeys as skilled and its horses as brave as any to be found in the Epsom Derby or Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. This year's meeting had been menaced by inclement weather, which threatened to turn the Gloucestershire course into a mud bath. As if on cue, by the first day of the festival on Tuesday, the flood waters which had engulfed much of the west of England for the past month receded and a distinct flavor of spring was in the air. But despite the blue skies overhead, the event is taking place under a cloud. Racing is emerging from an ""annus horribilis,"" following a doping scandal at one of its largest training operations, Godolphin. Although the glossy version of the sport as practiced by Sheikh Mohammed's flat racing empire may seem like a distant cousin to the earthier winter form, racing's other code has not emerged unscathed. One of the fancied runners in Friday's Gold Cup -- the highlight of the festival and the most prestigious jumps race in the British racing calendar -- is trained by a man who has been charged with possession of anabolic steroids and who is due in court next week. Last Instalment is one of three runners fielded by Philip Fenton, who faces eight charges of possessing banned animal remedies which were found by the Irish Department of Agriculture in 2012. All three of his Cheltenham entries have been cleared to run by the British Horseracing Authority, after blood and hair samples found they have been ""clean"" for at least the past 12 months. But should Last Instalment or any of Fenton's other runners win this week, it will be publicity the sport can scarcely afford. Nevertheless, even these lingering storm clouds could not dampen the famous Cheltenham roar, the battle cry which goes up amid a flurry of fur and tweed to mark the beginning of jumps racing's biggest week. Nor, even, could the injury-enforced absence of two of jumps racing's brightest stars -- the imperious Sprinter Sacre and the plucky Cue Card. Accents from both sides of the Irish Sea can be heard at Cheltenham. National Hunt racing originated in Ireland in the 18th century and the Irish remain devoted to this form of the sport. As such, the Cheltenham Festival is famed for the rivalry between Britain and Ireland. This year, that rivalry is being formally recognized with the newly-commissioned Prestbury Cup, to be awarded to the country with the most winners and named after the first Cheltenham Festival, organized in 1902 at Prestbury Park racecourse. On this occasion it was first blood to Ireland as Vautour and Ruby Walsh teamed up to give trainer Willie Mullins a decisive victory in the opening Supreme Novices' Hurdle. ""We knew he was a good horse but I wasn't quite expecting that,"" Mullins told reporters. ""He was a bit free over the first couple of hurdles but once he relaxed a bit and Ruby had accepted that he wanted to get on with it, he let him gallop and use his stride. Next thing you know, he was on a different set of rails to the other horses!"" The same combination nearly struck gold again moments later with Champagne Fever in the Arkle Challenge Trophy but were pipped on the line by David Pipe's 33-1 shot Western Warhorse, ridden by Tom Scudamore. ""I'm surprised, relieved and very happy to have a winner,"" said Pipe. ""Tom gave him a canny ride. You could sense Tom felt he was more than a 33-1 shot and had a bit of a chance. It's great to have a winner here because it is so hard."" In the day's feature race, the Champion Hurdle, 9-1 shot Jezki led home a memorable one-two for leading owner J P McManus, edging out My Tent Or Yours, ridden by man of the hour AP McCoy. ""It's fantastic and a great to be in this position,"" trainer Jessica Harrington told reporters after watching Barry Geraghty ride her horse home to victory. ""He's a great favorite of mine and Barry has a great record on him."" The race however was marred by a fatal injury to Our Conor, which had to be put down after falling. Owner Barry Connell told reporters: ""It's is very sad, as he was such a young horse at the beginning of his career. ""He had already shown what enormous potential he had. ""It is unusual for him, as jumping has been his forte and it was such a surprise to see him come down."" Meanwhile, former England football star Michael Owen has already made a successful transition to leading racehorse owner -- he has even had a winner at Royal Ascot -- but perhaps his latest reinvention should be as tipster. On the opening day of Cheltenham, Owen tipped three winners in a row -- Holywell in the opening handicap, Jezki in the Champion Hurdle and Quevega, who won the Mares' Hurdle for a sixth successive year, making her the most successful horse in festival history. All eyes will surely be on Owen's tips when the second day of the meeting gets underway on Wednesday.","Cheltenham Festival began in England Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Police in Spain and Morocco arrested seven suspected Islamist militants who recruited and sent fighters for al Qaeda terrorist organizations in Syria and Mali, Spain's Interior Ministry said Friday. The suspects include a Spaniard and two Frenchmen who were arrested in the Spanish enclave of Melilla on Morocco's north coast, a Tunisian arrested in the city of Malaga on the Spanish mainland and three Moroccans detained in Morocco, the ministry said. A ministry statement said it was, to date, ""the most important"" breaking of a cell said to be involved in sending Islamic militant fighters to Syria. The alleged ringleader of the cell, a Spaniard living in Melilla, Mustafa Maya Amaya, was detained. He had met in his home with two French citizens who were preparing to go to Syria to fight with al Qaeda-linked forces. They were also arrested and identified as Paul Cadic and Farik Cheikh, the ministry said. The movement of fighters from Europe and North Africa to war zones such as Syria, and their eventual return to potentially carry out terrorist attacks, has been a prime concern for authorities battling terrorism. Some suspects arrested in the latest operation had in fact returned home after going to conflict zones like Syria, the Interior Ministry said. In January, a suspected Islamist militant returning to Europe from the war in Syria was arrested at the Malaga airport in southern Spain as a potential ""threat to national security,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement at the time. In the latest arrests, the cell is said to have used the Internet to recruit fighters for the Jabhat al-Nusra front, described as an active al Qaeda group in and around Syria, and for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The cell's activities affected Spain, Morocco, Belgium, France, Tunisia, Turkey, Libya, Mali, Indonesia and Syria, the statement said. Police began investigating the cell in 2010 and eventually had the support of the United States FBI, Spain's national intelligence service and Moroccan police, the ministry said. The three suspects arrested in Morocco were identified as Tarik Ahnin, Soufian el Moumni and Mohamed Karraz. In Malaga, a Tunisian man accused of forging documents for the group was arrested and identified as Chafik Jalel Ben Amara Elmedjeri. He had been arrested in 2006 for alleged membership in a terrorist group, the ministry said. Police searched various homes in Melilla, Malaga and Morocco and were expected to seek international arrest warrants for other members of this cell who are in other countries, the ministry said. On Tuesday, Spain marked the 10th anniversary of the Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. The Spanish courts convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the bombings on morning commuter trains, along with four Spaniards who trafficked in explosives used in the attacks. A further seven key Islamist suspects blew themselves up three weeks after the train attacks as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb. Spain has arrested 472 suspected Islamic militants since the train bombings on March 11, 2004. There are more than 1,800 police and security officials dedicated to fighting terrorism, far more than at the time of the attacks, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said this week. Spain is on a level two anti-terrorist alert, unchanged since 2009, on a scale of four terrorist prevention levels. Level two signifies a ""probable risk"" of another attack, the Interior Ministry said.

"(CNN) -- Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick on Thursday was sentenced to 28 years in prison after he was convicted in March of two dozen federal charges. The charges include racketeering, extortion and the filing of false tax returns. He was accused of using the mayor's office to enrich himself and associates. Before he was sentenced, Kilpatrick apologized in court Thursday morning. ""I say with every morsel of my being that I'm sorry to you,"" he said. Judge Nancy G. Edmunds noted the apology and said that he was showing ""more awareness than I have seen along the way."" But she said ""a long prison sentence is necessary to insulate the public from his behavior."" ""That way of business is over. We're done. We're moving forward,"" she said. Ex-Detroit Mayor Kilpatrick convicted in corruption case . Kilpatrick, Detroit's mayor from 2002 until he resigned in 2008, was the biggest target of a years-long Detroit City Hall corruption investigation that led to the convictions of two dozen people, including several of his closest friends and former City Councilwoman Monica Conyers, the wife of U.S. Rep. John Conyers. Federal prosecutors alleged that Kilpatrick ran a criminal enterprise through the mayor's office to enrich himself through bid rigging and extortion, and using nonprofit funds for personal gain. At the heart of the scheme was corruption in municipal contracting, mostly centering on the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, said Barbara McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Edmunds said that in the sentencing, she was not holding Kilpatrick responsible for the city's bankruptcy of this year, saying that was due to wider factors. But then she cited a litany of effects of his crimes, including loss of public trust and honest contractors being turned away.","Judge: Long prison sentence necessary ""to insulate the public from his behavior""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso met with President Barack Obama on Tuesday making him the first head of state to be hosted by the new administration. Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso steps off his Boeing 747 at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland Monday. It was a long trip -- 6,800 miles (11,000 km) -- for a short meeting -- one hour -- and happened as Obama was preparing his first address to a joint session of Congress. Sitting next to Aso in the White House, Obama said: ""The friendship between the United States and Japan is extraordinarily important. ""It is for that reason that the prime minister is the first foreign dignitary to visit me in the Oval Office."" Obama said the U.S.-Japanese alliance would be crucial in solving international problems including climate change. ""We think we have to work together, not only on issues relating to the Pacific Rim, but throughout the world,"" Obama added. Aso said the global economy was also on the agenda at their meeting. ""We are the number 1 and second biggest economies of the world. We will have to work hand in hand. ""I think we are the only two nations which are powerful enough to solve those very critical, vital issue,"" Aso said. Japan's Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said that being the first to visit the Obama White House was an indication of the priority the new president placed on the relationship. Another topic likely to have been on the agenda was Japan's Asian neighbor North Korea, which U.S. intelligence says is preparing to test a long-range missile. Pyongyang has denied the charge, instead saying it is making preparations to launch a satellite. A test-fire by North Korea in 2006 failed 40 seconds after launch. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers), which -- if true -- could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii. Aso's visit to Washington comes, as his approval rating stands at a meager 11 percent, the second lowest ever recorded for a Japanese prime minister. Yoshiro Mori, a former prime minister, resigned after his rate bottomed out at 9 percent. Last week his finance minister Shoichi Nakagawa announced he will step down after coming under fire for appearing intoxicated at a weekend news conference during the G-7 meeting in Rome. CNN's Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report.","Aso's approval rating at 11 percent, the second lowest ever for a Japanese PM .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Much of Atlanta  is underwater. Highways and neighborhoods have been submerged. Creeks are swollen. Several are dead. Prolonged rains led to severe flooding in Atlanta. Sounds like the scene from a tropical storm or hurricane, right? Not this time. Meteorologists told CNN that while the devastation from recent floods in the southeastern city looks like the result of a storm that formed over tropical waters, the floods are actually the result of prolonged and steady rains. Rains have been drenching the city for about eight days because weather conditions have caused storms to stick in place. So that, in part, is what has caused the severe flooding -- not torrential rains or high winds, often associated with stronger tropical storms, which form over oceans instead of land. ""This is something that's really impacting a lot of people and scientifically, it's an event that we don't see too often here in Atlanta -- especially when it's not connected to a tropical system,"" said Laura Griffith, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Georgia. ""When you're getting hit day after day with a couple inches of rainfall, that's where you start to see problems,"" she added. Griffith said a low-pressure storm system moved into Georgia during the middle of last week. When it arrived, it feathered up next to a high-pressure system that was hovering over the East Coast. The result: It got stuck, she said. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the atmosphere over north Georgia is completely saturated with water. A new storm system has moved into place now and, at any disturbance, is ready to drop more water on Atlanta. ""It's just sitting there waiting for someone to wring the washcloth,"" she said. Jeras said the storm that remained stuck over Atlanta on Monday previously had brought needed rain to southern Texas. It sucked its moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, she said.  Watch Jeras explain the strange weather » . That system dissipated late Monday, but another has moved in to take its place, she said. Responding to the rain, creeks and rivers in metro Atlanta are overflowing in some places, setting new records. The Chattahoochee River in northeast Atlanta rose to a height not seen since 1919, Griffith said. Flood warnings have been put in place through Saturday, according to Griffith. Before the storm stalled over Atlanta, the metro area had been in a prolonged drought. Statewide water-use restrictions were eased in June, but the abrupt shift from extremely dry conditions to prolonged and drenching rains may be contributing to the city's current flood conditions, Griffith said. The soils became saturated with water over the eight days of rain, meaning the heavy rains seen in Atlanta on Monday had nowhere to go but straight into creeks and drainage ditches, which quickly overflowed. Jeras, the CNN meteorologist, said the urbanization of Atlanta and its suburban sprawl also contributed to the floods. Instead of hitting soil, much of the rainwater ran straight into concrete, where it runs very fast and can overwhelm rivers and drainage systems. ""There used to be a lot more earth and soil to help absorb this stuff,"" she said. ""But the rain really fell on the concrete jungle.""","Eight days of rain contributed to flooding in Atlanta .
The outcome looks like the result of a tropical storm -- but it's not .
Soils are saturated to the point that water has nowhere to go ."
"(CNN) -- Your own hammam, a personal chef and a chauffeur to smooth your way to the slopes -- they're all part of the package for the ultra upper-crust skier. In fact, the après-ski's so tempting at these sumptuous retreats you might be tempted to skip the skiing altogether. Chalet Bella Coola, Verbier, Switzerland . If you seek your thrills off-piste as much as on, this is the place: goodies include a hammam for rapid defrosting, a 10-meter heated indoor pool and a Champagne bar. The crisp Swiss air should cure any effects of overindulgence -- and the chalet's setting, sandwiched between the Medran and Savoleyres lift stations, puts you on top of the main network of pistes above Verbier. You could plot your entire day's skiing from the floor-to-ceiling windows, the view extending to that toasty pool. Chalet Bella Coola; +41 79 412 7398; from CHF31,700 ($32,650) a week . Chalet Le Coquelicot, Courchevel 1850, France . Britain's Prince Harry, the Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev and assorted Russian oligarchs might, based on reported past attendance, be among your fellow skiers at so-called ""Paris in the snow."" Where to retire from all the paparazzi, gawkers and generally less fortunate people when you've finished skiing for the day? Prime pick is the ski-in/ski-out Chalet Le Coquelicot. The 10-meter private pool, plus steam and massage rooms should soothe any aching limbs. But it's the lavish extras, including butler and private-jet transfer (if needed), that seal its elite status. If you only had your own private mountain to ski on, too, you wouldn't have to mingle with ordinary people at all. Chalet Le Coquelicot; +44 203 465 9130; from $52,945 a week . Chalet One Oak, Megève, France . Megève may have lost out to Courchevel as the premier luxury ski resort but, with lodgings such as Chalet One Oak, it's hardly slumming it. The tiger skin on the black slate floor and the Harley Davidson in the entrance hall make for a décor that's more rap star cool than classic chalet chic, and if Jay-Z hasn't already checked in he should be given a freebie for promotional purposes. Doubtless he'd appreciate the black-granite surrounds of the ""rain shower"" in the master suite, plus Jacuzzi and log fire. And if he considered skiing rather than shooting his next video on site, the chalet's mere minutes from the resort of Megève, with 124 slopes -- or 30 mountain restaurants, depending on your preference. Then again, Chalet One has its own chef. Chalet One Oak; +44 1242 547705; from $24,135 per weekve . Chalet Artemis, St Anton, Austria . Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are among the A-listers to have been papped at St Anton, a destination blessed with good snowfall at low latitudes. The hexagonal Chalet Artemis is plugged as the resort's ""flagship"" chalet -- though with four floors it feels more like an entire boutique hotel. There's a lift to the L-shaped living space on the top floor, but it's on the lower ground level where the fun really begins: the ""wellness area"" there includes a swimming pool, sauna, in- and outdoor hot tubs and a massage room with beauty therapist on call. Plus there's a private 12-seater cinema for when you've toweled off. Step outside and you'll find yourself in the resort suburb of Nasserein, a 10-minute drive from the action. Not that you'll need to walk -- residents get a chauffeured 4x4. Chalet Artemis; +44 (0)208 682 5050; from $3,415 per person, per week, based on 12 sharing . Villa Gella, Pamporovo, Bulgaria . As one of Europe's most southerly resorts -- and among its sunniest skiing spots -- Pamporovo is on the up. The Rhodope Mountains rival the Alps on looks alone -- and that's before you consider the excellent snow falling from December to April. Newcomer Villa Gella might not quite compete with the most exclusive Swiss and French resorts but this is a sweet retreat, nonetheless. Beside the inevitable pool big enough for a neighborhood gym, there are six bedrooms with en suites and piste-view horizontal windows that look like the widest widescreen TVs you can imagine. The wooden dining table stretching along the al fresco terrace -- which overlooks distant Plovdiv, one of the world's oldest cities -- provides a rustic touch but, don't fret, you needn't cook anything. The in-villa manager and chef free guests from lifting ski-tired limbs unnecessarily. Villa Gella; +359 888 566 872; from $11,780 week a week . San Lorenzo Mountain Lodge, Dolomites, Italy ver . Voted Italy's Best Ski Chalet at the last World Ski Awards, this former hunting lodge mingles cozy with chic. Creature comforts at the 16th-century retreat deep in Dolomites forest include a Finnish sauna, Turkish bath and vast stone wine cellar with vintages from South Tyrol and beyond. Snowbirds flock here for the cross-country and alpine skiing around Fanes Nature Park and the Plan de Corones. Hands-on owners Giorgia and Stefano can arrange alternative activities including winter paragliding and Porcini-mushroom hunting -- the top onsite chef will cook your foraged finds. San Lorenzo Mountain Lodge, 39030 San Lorenzo di Sebato; +39 474 404042; from $3,260 per day based on two guests (plus $135 a day per additional adult) Solhyllan Lodge, Björkliden, Sweden . Set in the wilderness of Swedish Lapland, 250 kilometers inside the Arctic Circle, remote Björkliden suits the more intrepid skier. Its 25 pistes include four black and 10 red runs, as well as easier slopes. The Black diamond runs and off-piste trails are for the truly firm-thighed; heli-skiing and snowmobile safaris are also on the menu. But even this testing terrain needn't preclude a little luxury -- or a lot. Solhyllan Lodge, part of the Hotell Fjällby, has the de rigeur sauna and Jacuzzi beneath the stars, as well as a dedicated chef preparing gastronomic five-course meals. Higher levels of luxury -- literally -- are available at the same hotel's Låktatjåkko Mountain Lodge. At 1,228 meters above sea level, it's Sweden's highest-set mountain abode.

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson was fond of quoting his version of the Romans 5:3-5 passage that discusses the positive impact adversity can have on one's life. ""Suffering builds character, character breeds faith, and in the end faith will not disappoint,"" Jackson often said in speeches. He could have been describing Nelson Mandela's 27 years in prison, and lifelong fight for freedom. Since Mandela passed, a narrative has emerged that he entered prison as a violent revolutionary and emerged as a nonviolent peacemaker and reconciler. That is, at best, revisionist history. Prison did not turn Mandela into a pacifist, but it may have turned him into a realist aware of the difficulty of healing the racial wounds in his country. When Mandela was released in 1990, I was in South Africa covering it as a reporter, traveling with Jackson. I recall the throngs of people that awaited Mandela and marveled at the scene. When I spoke to Mandela in a brief interview, he hinted at how his time in prison affected him. ""How do you not hate white people?"" I asked him. His answer surprised me. ""If I had allowed myself to become bitter, I would have died in prison,"" he said. His ideals never changed in prison and never softened his stance against apartheid. ""I am not prepared to sell the birthright of the people to be free,"" he said. Mandela was offered many times to be released from prison if he had been willing to make certain concessions about his anti-government views. But he did not. What I believe did change during Mandela's time in prison was his view of what it would take to move his country forward after the end of apartheid as a free and democratic country for all South Africans. His truth and reconciliation policy allowed the country to heal. It allowed black South Africans to learn what happened to their loved ones who disappeared. It brought closure and opened the door to forgiveness. Beyond the country's healing, it also demonstrated that Mandela would be the president of all South Africa, not just a black South Africa. Mandela and his fellow freedom fighters fought to end the evil of apartheid -- not simply to beat down the perpetrators of it. Keeping his eyes on that prize and not allowing himself to be consumed by hate helped shape him into the leader that a new South Africa needed, and one we can admire. No one can say what Mandela would have been like if he had not gone to prison. But perhaps it is safe to say that without that time in prison, he would have been different: no less charismatic, no less brilliant. Because what prison helped Mandela understand was that even a black president who had been denied full citizenship in his country could not let hate -- even the anger that hate begot -- have the last word. If he did, South Africa could not move forward. And neither can we. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sylvester Monroe.","Sylvester Monroe: Nelson Mandela's leadership was shaped by his 27 years in prison .
Prison didn't turn Mandela into a pacifist but perhaps a realist, Monroe says .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- Sevket Sahintas works the night shift driving his taxi around Istanbul, Turkey, from midnight until dawn. Sevket Sahintas says he didn't know anything about photography when he began snapping photos. His route takes him past symbols of wealth old and new: the ornate carved stone gates of a 19th-century Ottoman sultan's palace, the gleaming high-rises in the city's rapidly growing financial district. Periodically, Sahintas stops his yellow cab not for customers, but for photos. Under a roaring overpass, he steps out of his vehicle and walks across the street to two homeless men who sleep huddled on the concrete under a blanket next to a half-finished plastic bottle of water. Sahintas pauses for a moment and presses a button on his small camera. A flash erupts, then he turns and walks slowly back to the car. In addition to being a cabbie, Sahintas is a self-taught photographer. He focuses his lens on the poorest segments of Istanbul's society. Sahintas, who began driving a taxi when he was 19, said he started taking photos five years ago when he began working the night shift.  Watch Sahintas as he photographs street scenes » . ""I saw people on the street in winter. They were cold at night,"" he said. ""To make their voices heard, I wanted to buy a camera and show that these people are living in difficult conditions. That's how it started."" Sahintas takes photos of homeless people, who often sleep barefoot in bus stops next to billboards where smiling models advertise everything from ice cream bars to credit cards.  See the streets through Sahintas' lens » . ""I like to capture those contradictions,"" he said. ""Happy smiling people on the ad boards beside that unhappy person who is trying to sleep. I want the happy people to see that minority and do something about it."" Sahintas also takes black-and-white portraits of the other characters who roam Istanbul's streets at night: dirty street children, garbage pickers, transvestite prostitutes. Eventually, Sahintas' nocturnal perspective on Turkey's largest city began attracting attention, both at home and overseas. This month, an exhibit of his photos titled ""The Other Side of the Night,"" is on display in an Istanbul gallery. ""Basically, we were amazed by his photos,"" said Anna Heidenhain, one of the directors of Manzara Perspectives, the art program displaying Sahintas' work. She compares his photographs to the social documentary form of photography that rose to prominence in the 1930s. iReport.com: Share your view of the world . But Sahintas is the first to acknowledge he approached photography as an amateur. ""I didn't know anything about photography,"" he said. ""I didn't know any technical terms, just an on and an off button."" He keeps an eye out for subjects while driving Istanbul's winding streets. At 2 a.m., he spotted a freelance garbage-picker patrolling Istanbul and hauling giant rolling carts through traffic. Sahintas stopped and met with the man, named Yasar, and offered him a cigarette. Yasar told Sahintas he scavenges packing paper and cardboard boxes from garbage bins for resale to private recycling companies. Working until dawn, he can make the equivalent of $7 a night to feed his family of six. ""We are struggling to earn enough money to buy bread,"" Yasar said, before trundling off into the night with his cargo of paper, a lit cigarette hanging from his lips. This week Turkey, one of the world's 20 wealthiest economies, is holding an annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The delegates are expected to discuss ways to battle poverty and strategies to prevent a repeat of last year's global economic crisis. But Sahintas disagrees with experts who rate economies based on gross domestic product. A country's wealth ""should be related to how that money is distributed,"" he said. ""If all the money is controlled by a few monopolies, I believe it shows a country's poverty, not its wealth."" Sahintas' work highlights the huge income gap in Turkish society. Even though the Turkish economy enjoyed steady growth for much of the past decade, the latest government statistics show that nearly one in five Turks live below the poverty line. During the past year, the economic crisis pummeled Turkey's export-driven industries, pushing unemployment to record highs. The downturn has hit many Turks -- from Istanbul's garbage-pickers, who say there is less useful trash to scavenge, to the city's cabbies, who complain that fewer customers can afford their services. Still, at the station from where Sahintas operates his cab, taxi drivers are quick to heap praise on their colleague. ""We are proud of our friend. We like his pictures, as well,"" Tolga Donmez said between glasses of steaming hot Turkish tea. ""He makes us want to learn new skills, as well."" Despite the attention, Sahintas doesn't make enough money from his photos to earn a living. For that, the photographer has to work the night shift in his yellow cab.","Cabbie's familiarity with cameras once consisted only of ""an on and an off button""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Jack's elder sister was returning from a holiday. Her connecting flight was through Kuala Lumpur on MH370. After news of the missing flight, Jack took leave from his job to come to Beijing in search of answers. He shows me the text he received from Malaysia Airlines on his smartphone Monday night. This is the infamous text announcing that ""none of those on board survived."" Jack scrolls down to the response he texted back in English, ""F--- You"", although he spelled out the word. The fight is under way. Grief has turned to action. Inside a Beijing hotel room, Jack and eight other passengers' relatives crowd around three laptops on a coffee table. They are discussing, downloading, organizing. What's the next move? There is purpose in the air. They've already protested in front of the Malaysian embassy in China. Now they've decided to share with the media their smartphone video of meetings with Malaysian officials. They have designated themselves the media committee.

"(CNN) -- For all the heavy baggage that she carries, Hillary Clinton is walking on water. Ham-fisted attempts by the Republicans to smear her brain have backfired horribly (rightly so; they were distasteful), while Republican efforts to hang Benghazi around her neck (Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tried this weekend) have barely dented her popularity among Democrats. Obama calls her a ""buddy"" who would make a ""very effective"" president, and the former secretary of state remains clear front-runner for her party's 2016 presidential nomination. In fact, right now, she's the only real runner. And that can't be healthy -- for democracy, for the Democrats or even for Clinton. How can we be sure she's running? Well, the United States might be the only country in the world where a politician signals his or her ambitions by writing a book. This does not, alas, mean that America's politicians are unusually literate. Often, the book is bad; usually, it's ghostwritten; only occasionally is it worth reading. But it's generally a sign. The title of Hillary Clinton's ""Hard Choices"" -- out on June 9 and helpfully promoted by a series of interviews with TV's biggest anchors -- suggests a woman who is trying to make sense of a troubled recent past. Becoming Obama's secretary of state, Egypt, Libya and the Benghazi fiasco were all arguably ""choices"" forced upon her. That they were ""hard"" implies an admission that the outcome was far from desirable. Clinton is a potential presidential candidate who has to deal with not just one compromised record but two. First, the Bill Clinton administration; second, the Obama administration. In both cases, she seems keen to remind us, she wasn't technically in charge. Such is the strange ambiguity of Hillary Rodham Clinton. First, she was the co-president and architect of Bill's most ambitious domestic reforms, the anti-Tammy Wynette. Then, she was the betrayed wife who did stand by her man. Next the liberal senator, the presidential candidate of the overwhelming majority of the establishment, suddenly a primaries loser who had to reinvent herself as Annie Oakley, finally a loyal servant of the President, a man whose abilities she questioned so rudely in the nomination battle. Like Richard Nixon before her, she is one of those politicians who is defined by longevity. Her politics have changed so often that it's hard to precisely define what Clintonism is anymore, but she has lasted so long in the spotlight that it's become almost impossible to conceive that someday she won't be president. That 2016 is Clinton's time is reflected in the surprising, even depressing, lack of an alternative. What is Vice President Joe Biden doing with his weekends? Or Newark Mayor Cory Booker (who has ruled himself out, if you can believe that)? Or New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo? Without them, who are we left with? Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, headed for Iowa but probably not very well known there? Sen. Elizabeth Warren, sometimes pushed as the working-class Hillary but who would probably be unelectable outside of Massachusetts? Warren, interestingly, has written a book, too. Contrast this silence with the Republican side. The GOP is weighing up Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (whether they've showed any interest in running or not), and this pre-contest contest gives the impression that all the action is on the right while the Democrats just sit out what remains of Obama's second term, waiting for the whole thing to come to a dignified end. Stabenow: Why I'm ready for Hillary . And the Republican struggle is attractively philosophical. Paul represents the rise of libertarianism; Christie channels the spirit of Mayor Richard Daley; Bush is our generation's Nelson Rockefeller; Santorum is running to build heaven on Earth. These people are discussing ideas that will shape the future of the country. Clinton is talking largely about herself. Of course, two years is almost an eternity in politics, and things might change. At pretty much this point in the 2008 contest, Clinton also commanded a lead over her opponents and looked set to win the nomination -- and we all know what happened come Iowa. She is a different kind of politician now, having built statesman status with her time as secretary of state. But headed into her second go at the nomination after over 20 years of dominating the national stage, it's possible that many voters will simply decide that they want a change. Is America really so locked in its partisan, elitist politics that would tolerate another Clinton vs. Bush campaign? Those who think continuity is unhealthy in a democracy might judge not.","Tim Stanley: Hillary Clinton bashed by GOP, praised by Obama and still front-runner .

"(CNN) -- An alleged child predator who taught at schools across the world for more than four decades may have more victims, and the FBI is trying to track them down, the agency's Houston bureau said Tuesday. William James Vahey killed himself in Luverne, Minnesota, last month, two days after a federal judge in Houston said authorities could search one of Vahey's thumb drives that allegedly contained images depicting sexual assault on children, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. There were images of at least 90 victims, dating back to 2008, and the FBI is encouraging additional alleged victims to come forward. The images on the thumb drive allegedly belonging to Vahey showed boys, estimated to be between 12 and 14 years old, asleep or unconscious, the agency said. The images had captions and dates referencing places that Vahey had previously traveled with students, the FBI said. ""This is one of the most prolific alleged predators we've ever seen,"" Houston FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap told the station. Vahey began teaching in private schools in 1972, the FBI says. He last taught at the American Nicaraguan School in Pista Suburbana, Managua, Nicaragua from August 2013 until March 11, two days before he committed suicide, KPRC reported. The case came to law enforcement attention after Vahey fired his maid for allegedly stealing personal items from his home last year, KPRC said. In March, the ex-maid brought a stolen thumb drive to the American Nicaraguan School, saying she came forward because the drive contained sexual images, the station reported. The FBI said that when Vahey was confronted with the images, he ""reportedly admitted molesting boys throughout his entire life and said he gave the minors sleeping pills prior to the molestation."" He had residences in London and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and traveled extensively, the FBI said. He worked at schools in nine countries, teaching a variety of subjects and coaching boys' basketball. He regularly accompanied students on overnight field trips, the FBI said. The schools where he taught are, according to the FBI: . -- American Nicaraguan School in Managua, Nicaragua (2013-2014) -- Southbank International School in London, United Kingdom (2009-2013) -- Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas, Venezuela (2002-2009) -- Jakarta International School in Jakarta, Indonesia (1992-2002) -- Saudi Aramco Schools in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia (1980-1992) -- American Community School in Athens, Greece (1978-1980) -- Passargad School in Ahwaz, Iran (1976-1978) -- American School of Madrid in Spain (1975-1976) -- American Community School of Beirut in Lebanon (1973-1975) -- Tehran American School in Iran (1972-1973) Anyone who has information on Vahey and who believes he victimized them can send a confidential e-mail to HOvictimassistance@ic.fbi.gov or contact their local FBI office or nearest U.S. Embassy.","FBI: William James Vahey taught at private schools in 9 countries for 42 years .

"(CNN) -- Four years ago today, President Barack Obama signed Obamacare into law, pledging that Americans could keep their health care plans and their doctors and that their coverage would be ""more secure and stable"" than before. As the horror stories continue to roll in, however, the emptiness of those promises and the human toll of this deeply misguided experiment have become increasingly difficult for Democrats to ignore. Consider Angela Strobel, a mother of five girls from Owensboro, Kentucky. Angela was perfectly happy with the insurance and the doctor she had before Obamacare. She also had an ironclad assurance from the President that she wouldn't have to sacrifice either one if his health care plan became law. Now she finds herself among the growing group of Americans who've been shell-shocked by the reality. The fact-checkers may have declared the President's ""you can keep your plan"" pledge last year's ""lie of the year."" But Angela and millions like her will be reeling from that broken promise for years. It won't be easy. Angela not only lost her insurance, she also lost a trusted family doctor to Obamacare. In a perfect summary of modern liberalism, one of the billing clerks for Kentucky's Obamacare exchange told Angela that since she now qualifies for Medicaid, she'd be breaking the law if she tried to pay more out of her own pocket just to keep her old doctor. Medicaid rules forbid it. The upshot: for Angela and her family, it's either Medicaid or a monthly premium increase of nearly $1,000. Tragically, stories likes Angela's are playing out in households all across the country. And the promises that were made to sell Obamacare â€” that it wouldn't disrupt people's previous health care arrangements and that premiums would go down â€” are now being exposed for the cheap and deceptive sales pitch they were. It may be tempting for some to brush all this aside as standard politics. But it's hard to think of anything even comparable to the scope of the deception involved in selling this law. The President made repeated, explicit pledges that no one would lose their doctor or their plans as a result of this law. For two years, he did everything he could to assure Americans that they had nothing to worry about. Yet now, as millions of Americans speak out about their frustrations and heartbreak, he's not even listening. Instead, leading Democrats have engaged in a despicable campaign to discredit the victims. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid labeled people like Angela liars, while other Democrats have downplayed statistics that cast it in an unfavorable light. As for the President, he seems more interested in promoting his NCAA bracket and talking up Obamacare's elusive virtues on satirical talk shows like ""Between the Ferns."" For the Washington Democrats who gave us Obamacare, in other words, these stories about lost care, lost doctors, and higher costs aren't problems to be resolved, but political obstacles to be deflected. But there's only so much they can do to tune out or brush aside the cascading impact of Obamacare. In recent weeks, we've heard calamitous reports of Obamacare patients being denied access to doctors, hospitals and premium cancer care centers. A recent analysis by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. found that only a fraction of the biggest local hospitals in a given coverage area will accept Obamacare patients. An Associated Press study found that only four of the 19 cancer centers it surveyed would give Obamacare patients access to its cancer care through the new Obamacare exchanges in their states. This is progress? Don't tell that to Terri Durheim of Enid, Oklahoma. She's another mom who's been blindsided by the realities of Obamacare. Terri told CNN that her son has a serious heart condition, but will now have to travel more than an hour to find a pediatric cardiologist who's covered under her new plan. She doesn't even want to think about what she'll have to do in case of an emergency. ""Obviously we'd have to pay out of pocket and go here in town,"" she said, ""but that defeats the purpose of insurance."" Terri's story raises a key question: what was the point of all this? Those who voted for Obamacare cling to the claim that they've increased access. But as report after report has shown, increasing the ranks of the insured doesn't necessarily guarantee access. It certainly didn't for Angela and Terri. For many, the answer to all this is obvious: Admit that Obamacare is a failure, repeal it, and work together on bipartisan, patient-centered solutions that correct the deficiencies in our previous system. But clearly, those who supported this law still need convincing. Four years after Obamacare was signed into law, they still can't bring themselves to admit the reality all around us. That needs to change. Obamacare's human toll is getting worse every day. We can do better. For the sake of people like Angela Strobel and Terri Durheim, we must. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"Decatur, Georgia (CNN) -- They've survived the brutality of war, extreme poverty, religious and racial persecution. But here at a baseball field outside Atlanta, a group of giggling teenage girls from Ethiopia, Burundi, Afghanistan and Myanmar have found a level playing ground. It's around noon, time for physical education class at the Global Village School, a small private institution for refugee teenage girls who have little or no English education. The girls -- some wearing donated sneakers, others barefoot -- split into teams and take their positions. A girl with a scarf worn loosely around her long wavy brown hair is next up. She surveys the field and gets ready to kick. ""Kick the ball clear to Russia!"" shouts the coach. Robika laughs excitedly as she kicks the ball, then makes first base. Russia is where Robika, a 16-year old Afghan refugee, lived before arriving in the United States three years ago. Her family was forced to leave Afghanistan because of ""a lot of trouble"" there, she says. With the help of a U.S. government aid agency, Robika, her mother and two brothers resettled in Clarkston, about 14 miles outside Atlanta. Clarkston is home to more than 6,000 refugees who make up a majority of the small suburb's population, which is about 7,800 people, according to its mayor, Emanuel Ransom. Refugee families started streaming into Clarkston in the 1990s after federal officials found a large number of vacant apartment complexes there, he says. That's still the case today. Because of its affordable housing and access to public transportation, thousands of refugees from Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, Nepal, Vietnam, Kosovo and Myanmar (formerly Burma) now call this small rural enclave home. Ransom says programs like the Global Village School help the entire community bridge the communication and culture gap. When Robika arrived in the United States at age 13, she could not understand or communicate in English. She would have easily ""fallen through the cracks"" at a public school, says Kelley Provence, the Global Village School's academic director. ""She has some difficulty learning but has made significant progress,"" says Provence, who has worked closely with Robika to improve her English comprehension. Provence is one of a handful of full-time teachers at the Global Village School. The school, which has an annual operating budget of $250,000, survives solely on grants and donations and the help of volunteers. Founders of the school saw a need to focus on teenage girls who would never be able to adapt at public school because of their lack of English skills. There was already a school for refugee boys in Clarkston -- the Fugees Academy, where Robika's brother is a student. Like most of the other refugee students, Robika uses public transport to travel from her home in Clarkston to school, a trip that can take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. Despite the commute, she says she believes pursuing an education is a privilege. ""When I come here I didn't understand anything,"" says Robika. ""The school has a lot of respect for the student,"" she says with a smile. New and prospective students to the Global Village School are assessed on their ability to communicate, as well as their reading skills. Once accepted into the program, girls are placed in different levels of learning. Some eventually go on to high school, while others can go on to receive their GEDs and apply for college. Students are not only dealing with education and cultural barriers. Many girls were forced to leave family members behind, or worse -- lost them to violence, sickness or war. Robika's classmates, sisters Melody, 18, and Rita, 16, arrived in the United States with their older sister more than a year ago. Their parents are still in their home country, Myanmar. ""Sometimes when we talk, my mom ... she cries,"" says Melody. ""They never told us if they are in danger, they don't want us to be sad for them."" The girls never dwell on or analyze what they've been through before arriving in the United States. Robika says she wants to go to college and become a journalist one day. But now, she stays focused on her studies and improving her English. Melody, who likes to dress in the latest trends, says she's interested in finding a career in the beauty industry. Rita says math and science are her favorite subjects, and she hopes to be a researcher one day. ""In these cultures, everybody would be paralyzed if they thought about and talked about their past experiences,"" says Provence.","Global Village School educates teen girls from refugee families .

"(CNN) -- This week a Russian foundry minted a new coin to mark Russia's ""reunification"" with Ukraine's Crimea region. Vladimir Putin's portrait was on one side, and a map of Crimea on the other. Many, especially outside Russia, would dispute the use of the word ""reunification."" But few would dispute that the coin's symbolism goes way beyond Russian patriotism over a small Black Sea peninsula. Many Russians, particularly those who remember life in the Soviet times, and under former President Boris Yeltsin, see the mark of Putin on all of their coins. When he took over the presidency in the final hours of the last millennium, Russia was licking some serious wounds from the crash of 1998. In its World Economic Outlook in October 1999, the IMF observed: ""Continuing economic and political uncertainties have led to further capital flight and a sharp decline in foreign investment."" Ring any bells? Putin set about treating those wounds. He slashed income and corporate tax and cut red tape. Aided by rising oil prices, growth climbed sharply, averaging 7% over the next eight years. Russians had money and the opportunity to make more. High-end shops started to appear in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and many people travelled overseas. Prosperity and stability were prized above all else. Even democracy. 14 years later, the latest World Economic Outlook from the IMF contained unnerving parallels to 1999. Russian growth prospects were downgraded because of ""geopolitical risks"". The IMF noted that ""Investment had already been weak, reflecting in part policy uncertainty."" Standard and Poor's echoed that on Friday as it cut Russia's credit rating to one level above junk. To call this full circle would be far too optimistic. In 1999 Russia was already coming out of a decline when Putin took the reins. Now it may be on a slippery slope. While the economy is insulated by an estimated $477 billion in foreign currency reserves, sanctions could still hit hard, and there's a bigger problem: perception. Andrei Konoplyanik, an advisor to Gazprom Export, says he is worried ratings downgrades and lowered forecasts ""immediately create additional nervousness in the investment community."" Russia may not need foreign approval, but it does need foreign money. In a 2008 speech laying out Russia's goals up to 2020, Putin said: ""I stress that we have no intention of trying to take anything away from anyone else. We are a self-sufficient country. And we have no intention of closing ourselves off from the outside world and living in isolation."" It turns out he does -- but is Putin prepared to sacrifice whatever economic stability Russia has left in the process? READ MORE: Obama: World must unite to isolate Russia .

"(CNN) -- Hoffenheim have failed in their bid to get their 2-1 Bundesliga home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen replayed despite the controversial 'ghost' goal scored by visiting striker Stefan Kiessling. The German Football Association (DFB) said Monday the result would stand but have given Hoffenheim one week to appeal the decision. High flying Leverkusen were winning the ninth round match on October 18 by a single goal in the 70th minute when Kiessling headed a corner just wide of the home goal. German international striker Kiessling was seen with his head in his hands, apparently acknowledging a bad miss, but the ball found its way into the net through a hole in the side netting. It was enough to convince referee Felix Brych that the effort was legitimate and to the dismay of all concerned he awarded the goal. Leverkusen, pushing Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund hard at the top of the standings, eventually claimed three valuable points in a 2-1 win, but it has come at a cost. Kiessling, bidding for a regular place up front in the German international team for the World Cup in Brazil, has been subjected to much criticism and there have been renewed demands for FIFA to introduce video technology to help referees in such situations. After a 90-minute hearing in Frankfurt, the head of the DFB tribunal, Judge Hans E. Lorenz said they had been left with ""no alternative"" but to uphold the original result. ""The question isn't whether this judgment satisfies us from a sporting perspective,"" he said in a statement on the DBF website. ""From a legal point of view, there is no alternative. There are no grounds for the appeal. The factual decision may have been incorrect, but it is irrevocable."" Hoffenheim cited an incident in a match between Bayern and Nuremberg in 1994 when Bayern's Thomas Helmer scored a similar 'ghost' goal in a 2-1 win. That game was replayed and Bavarian giants Bayern cruised to a 5-0 win. Bayer Leverkusen are tied on points with Dortmund after a 2-1 win over Augsburg at the weekend, a point behind reigning champions Bayern, while Hoffenheim remain in mid table. Kiessling has six goals for the season, including his effort against Hoffenheim, one behind the leading tally.","Hoffenheim fail in bid to get Bundesliga match against Bayer Leverkusen replayed .

"(CNN) -- Double gold was the theme on day two of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi Sunday with Austria's Markus Salcher and Akira Kano of Japan achieving the feat at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center. Salcher claimed the men's super-G standing class to follow his triumph in the downhill on the first day. Kano wrapped up the same double in the sitting class, racing down the course in one minute 19.51 seconds, over two seconds clear of teammate Taiki Morri. Canada's Caleb Brousseau finished third. The 22-year-old Salcher, who was born with the right side of his body paralyzed, edged out fellow Austrian Matthias Lanzinger and Russian Alexey Bugaev. He said conditions had boosted his chances. ""It was a bit bumpy but I know it from yesterday and before. The snow is soft but they salted it and I think with the salt it's good. ""For me it's better that way than icy. I don't like icy slopes,"" he told the official Games website. ""The downhill race gold medal is a dream and now a second (gold medal) I can't believe it,"" he added. Salcher will bid for his third gold medal in the giant slalom later this week. Spain's visually impaired skier Jon Santacana Maiztegui had been bidding to win his second gold after taking the downhill Saturday, but could only manage fourth in the super-G. Slovakian Jakub Krako, who was guided by Martin Motyka, improved on his silver four years ago in Vancouver to take the gold. He had been fourth in the downhill. ""It is a big success today. It was hard work. It is difficult to say what I'm feeling right now but I am but I am proud,"" he said. USA's Mark Bathum won silver with Canada's edging Maiztegui for the bronze . The other golds awarded Sunday came in nordic skiing events, with Ukraine picking up its first gold of the Paralympics. Lyudmyla Pavlenko led from start to the finish for victory in the women's 12km sitting cross-country. Oksana Masters of the United took silver to complete a remarkable double of her own following a bronze in rowing in the summer Paralymics in London 2012. ""I am ecstatic,"" Masters said. ""The course for me was tricky because I am a fairly new skier still and the course had some tight turns. So I just tried to stay calm and relax on the turns and then just hammer home."" Russia's Svetlana Konovalova claimed her second medal of the championships, adding a bronze to the silver she took on day one in the 6km sitting biathlon. The hosts, who top the medals table after the second day of competition, enjoyed a clean sweep in the men's 15km sitting race. Roman Petushkov also collected his second gold medal of the Games with his teammates Irek Zaripov and Aleksandr Davidovich in second and third place. ""I want to thank my whole team. We did this together,"" said a delighted Petushkov.","Markus Salcher and Akira Kano double up in Sochi .

"(CNN) -- Director Werner Herzog has won countless film awards. His works, including ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God,"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Grizzly Man,"" are considered classics. He's been recognized for his artistic passion, his eccentricities (he once ate a shoe after losing a bet) and his disdain for many aspects of commercialism. So why is Herzog doing a public-service documentary on the perils of texting and driving? Sponsored by a consortium of cellular carriers, no less? Why, the man doesn't even own a cell phone. But he looks at the statistics for texting-while-driving incidents -- as well as our smartphone obsession and its cost in simple human contact -- and recognizes the necessity of saying something. ""I immediately understood there was something very, very important (about the subject),"" he said via Skype from Switzerland. Herzog's new work, a short film called ""From One Second to the Next,"" premiered last week online. Sponsored by It Can Wait, a driver-safety campaign launched by AT&T in 2009 that now includes T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon Wireless, it's received more than 1.7 million views on YouTube and will be distributed to more than 40,000 high schools in the coming months. The film chronicles the impact of four incidents in which texting and driving led to catastrophic injury or death. The first left a Milwaukee child, Xzavier, a paraplegic after he was hit by a driver who ran a stop sign. The second is about an Indiana man, Chandler, who rear-ended a horse-driven buggy and killed three members of an Amish family. The third profiles a brain-damaged Vermont woman, Debbie, hit while walking her dog. The film concludes with a Utah man, Reggie, whose distracted driving caused a chain reaction that left two men dead and a third severely injured. Each story has the kinds of small, wrenching details that Herzog, in typical style, underplays. Xzavier's mother says she sleeps on the couch, listening for changes in the rhythm of her boy's ventilator. Debbie's family says her chocolate Lab was thrown through the air, knocked down a distant mailbox and -- before he died -- wagged his tail as Debbie was placed in the ambulance. The men whose text-checking led to tragedy sit on roadsides, pondering the moment their lives changed. But Herzog points to another incident, one that didn't make the film, as representative of the problem. A young man, while texting his girlfriend, hit a boy on a bicycle. The boy died; the man is now in prison. ""The young man was texting with his girlfriend, and the girlfriend was right next to him,"" Herzog said. ""In the same car."" 'A powerful storyteller' Herzog admits he's an unlikely choice to direct such a film. Unlike some of his colleagues, he doesn't do commercials, and his subject matter is famously varied, whether it's French cave drawings or a lone air-crash survivor. But Michelle Kuckelman, AT&T's executive director for integrated brand marketing, says Herzog made sense. He was approached through the firm's ad agency, BBDO New York. ""He's really such a powerful storyteller. He does a great job of bringing to life the juxtaposition of an insignificant text with a very dire and significant consequence,"" she said. That's been part of It Can Wait's goal since it started four years ago. The program is aimed at teens and adults from 16 to 25, people who text frequently but are inexperienced drivers, says Kuckelman. It's not just the kids who can benefit, though. An AT&T survey in March indicated that adults text and drive more than teenagers do -- even though they know it's wrong. It's a tough point to bring home. CNN comments on that story varied between finger-wagging and shrugs, with neither side willing to concede. ""Jail time, I say ... give 'em jail time. Period,"" said Tucker70. ""It is possible to safely text and drive, but they would prefer to use paranoia and misinformation to push their agenda,"" retorted Mister Jones. Herzog's documentary, with its intimate, raw interviews, delicate music and frequent silences, may seem a poor prod to get texting drivers to change their ways. A UK PSA that begins with a terrifying car crash and a goodly share of gore (discretion advised) may seem more effective, a modern-day version of the old drivers-ed film ""Signal 30."" But Herzog believes his style is more effective. ""In this case what immediately connected to audiences, younger audiences, was the kind of deep insight, the interior appearance of the catastrophes,"" he said. ""I don't need to show any gore, blood or car wrecks."" AT&T's research backs him up, says Kuckelman. 'I'm very glad I did this' Laws regarding texting and driving are uneven. In most states, the practice is banned, but the punishments vary greatly. In ""From One Second to the Next,"" the Vermont driver who hurt Debbie received a 30-day jail term and some community service; her insurance company paid $50,000, though Debbie's medical bills topped $1 million. Herzog hopes the film prompts stronger legislation, but he's bluntly realistic about the possibilities. ""What's more important than legislation is awareness,"" he said. ""You can't legislate stupidity."" Awareness, at least, is high, particularly thanks to the director. The New York Times, referencing the film, ran an editorial on texting and driving Thursday; a broad range of media outlets including Fast Company, Slate, the Huffington Post and Gizmodo have featured the documentary in articles. Grantland's Steven Hyden called it ""the greatest and most disturbing driver's ed movie of all time."" Herzog, whose films generally fare better with critics than the box office, seems a little dazed at the attention. ""It has shown that real filmmaking somehow connects to an unbelievable amount of people in a very quick period of time,"" he said. ""It's going through the roof. I'm very glad I did this."" But it's the idea of reaching even one young driver that really moves him. ""One single accident less, and I have done the right thing,"" he said. He mentions an e-mail he received from a 15-year-old girl who watched ""From One Second to the Next"" and immediately had a talk with her mother. ""(She wrote,) 'I sat my mother down and told her, you are texting and driving. You are not going to do that anymore. Not when you take me to school,' "" he said. ""And the mother stopped it. So the signals are good.""","Director Werner Herzog has made a PSA about texting and driving .
