"Odisha State, India (CNN) -- The last time a storm as powerful as Cyclone Phailin struck the eastern coast of India, 10,000 people died. So the sense of relief is strong in the state of Odisha, where Phailin made landfall this weekend. ""I felt like I was going to die, everyone was so tense,"" said Raju Pradhan, who lives with his family in Odisha. At least 21 were killed as a direct result of the cyclone, according to Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra, Odisha state special relief commissioner. Every death is tragic, but considering Phailin was the strongest tropical storm to hit India in more than a decade, the toll could have been much higher. iReport: Cyclone leaves Indian slums in ruins . Pradhan was among 900,000 Odisha residents evacuated to shelters in schools and government offices. Authorities also moved food and medicine close to affected areas before the storm. Those preparations now are credited with the huge reduction in casualties from 1999's Cyclone Orissa, which killed 10,000 and caused more than $2 billion in damage. That cyclone, the strongest ever recorded in Bay of Bengal, carried winds of 155 mph at landfall. Phailin arrived with winds of 140 mph. By Monday evening, almost everyone who had been in shelters because of Phailin had gone home, with the few who are left expected to return home by Tuesday morning, Mohapatra said. Assessing damage . Phailin flooded highways and knocked down trees and power lines. Authorities said it could take up to a week to restore electric service. Flooded roads and rail lines could take longer to repair. Major crop damage also was expected, and some evacuees may have lost homes made of mud and bamboo. Aid had not reached all areas. When a CNN crew arrived Sunday in a coastal village in Ganjam District, residents ran outside to complain. The village was running out of food and water, the residents said. And they said they expected more flooding as rainfall from the storm drained toward them. Cyclone leaves trail of destruction . Panic buying . About 40 miles inland in the state capital of Bhubaneswar, resident Prabir Panda said he and others were alarmed into buying food, candles and buckets by news reports comparing Phailin to Orissa and the Hurricane Katrina in the United States. And he said he worried when a tree in his garden was blown down and others swung crazily in the wind. But afterward, people in Bhubaneswar emerged to check out the damage and share their relief, he said. Property damage in the city was limited to trees and small shops, he said. Panda praised the evacuations of people from low-lying places, which he said ran against ""a cultural feeling that we normally don't move out of our houses whatever the cause."" ""This time, the government ensured people are forced to move out,"" he said. He said government disaster management teams and military forces had been on the job in his city for two days. ""Everyone is happy with the way the local state government has managed it this time,"" Panda said. CNN's Mallika Kapur reported from the Indian state of Odisha, and David Simpson wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 21 deaths recorded so far from Phailin impact .

"(CNN) -- The world's coral reefs are under threat. Overfishing, unsustainable tourism, coastal development, pollution, the global aquarium trade and climate change are having a devastating effect on these fragile ecosystems, according to the International Coral Reef Initiative. In Mexico and across the world, the fragile ecosystems of coral reefs are under threat from human activity. The group has designated 2008 as International Year of the Reef in a bid to publicize the reefs' precarious predicament. Meanwhile fellow conservation group, Nature Conservancy, warns that if destruction continues at its current rate, 70 percent of the world's coral reefs will have disappeared within 50 years. A report released in January by the World Conservation Union concluded that hurricanes and rising sea temperatures in 2005 -- the hottest year since records began -- caused large-scale examples coral bleaching, in which corals lose the essential algae that coat their surfaces, devastating more than half of the Caribbean's reefs. But human activity at ground level is having an equally damaging effect, says Paul Sanchez-Navarro, Director of Centro Ecologico Akumal, an organization that monitors the impact of development on the reefs that thrive off the coast of Mexico's Quintana Roo province. Pollution spilled into the sea by the thousands of hotels on the Mexican Riviera is ""stressing"" the coral reefs. ""There are a lot of nutrients going into the ground water caused by treated water from the hotels and municipal waste water treatment plants,"" he explains. ""They inject the water into the ground and that makes its way into the aquifer... We've found way too many nutrients -- nitrates and phosphates -- and that comes from human waste, mostly urine."" The result, says Sanchez-Navarro, is increased algae growth that effectively suffocates the coral, impeding its growth. The reefs off Quintana Roo form part of the Meso American Barrier Reef which stretches over 1000 kilometers from Mexico as far the Bay Islands of Honduras, making it the second longest barrier reef in the world. The barrier reef supports more than 60 species of coral, 350 types of mollusc and over 500 species of fish. Reef-building coral has existed for 25,000 years and creates complex ecosytems which rely on a delicate balance of external pressures to survive. They thrive in water temperature of 23 to 25 degrees celcius and are usually found at depths of less than 25cm from the surface where sunlight can penetrate. While coral reefs in other parts of the Caribbean have suffered from coral bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures, Mexico's reefs have largely escaped this partly due to the hurricanes that have battered this coastline in recent years. These cool the water down in their wake but damage the reefs in other ways: the World Conservation's report, ""Corals -- facing the death sentence"", found that 2005's Hurricane Wilma and Hurricane Emily decreased coral cover from 24 percent to 10 percent in the reefs off Mexico's Cozumel. An occasional storm can actually have a beneficial effect on coral reefs, says Sanchez-Navarro, because the turbulence allows the coral to break off and spread. But the coral needs time to recover and the increase in category four and five storms, which some scientists believe is caused by climate change and rising sea temperatures, allows no time for this. ""The difficulty now with climate change is that if we are going to have big storms every year then the coral doesn't have a chance to recover,"" says Sanchez-Navarro. ""Normally you would have a big storm every five to ten years. The storm breaks up the coral but if the coral is healthy it starts to grow again and actually a hurricane every ten years is not bad because it disperses the coral in more places and then it grows up more."" While the damage from pollution and hurricanes is having a devastating effect on the Mesoamerican barrier reef and the hundreds of species which depend on it for food and shelter, eventually it will also have a human cost. An estimated one million people rely on the reef for employment and a source of income. The white sands that have made this stretch of tropical paradise so popular with tourists are generated by the breakdown over thousands of years of coral and the calcium it produces. Eventually no coral will mean no white beaches. Sanchez-Navarro believes the depletion of Quintana Roo's reefs is already affecting the local fishing industry. Around the world ten percent of all fish caught originate from reefs. ""We'll probably see reduced fish stocks because there is less areas for them to take refuge in,"" he says. ""We don't have numbers for them but we have observations made by divers who have been coming here for years who have noticed over time the depletion."" Coral reefs also provide essential protection from storms, acting as a buffer that prevents coastlines from feeling the full force of a storm surge. ""At the bottom of the hurricane you have a lot of motion going on in the water itself, it's not only above water,"" explains Sanchez-Navarro. ""This momentum that comes from the storm usually has this big surge but it hits the reef first and it changes the dynamic of the waves. Coral reefs drop the intensity of the storm significantly: the surge can become 75 percent less."" Sanchez-Navarro does not think that tourism in itself is necessarily damaging to the region's coral reefs. Snorkeling and sub aqua can cause physical damage to the reef if divers stand on the reef or anchors from boats are dropped in the wrong place. But with co-operation with the local dive schools he believes bad practice can be cut out. The main threat remains the expansion of unsustainable hotels and the dumping of untreated pollution into the sea, he says. ""The biggest challenge here is defining what is sustainability for the region because there's so much investment, especially from Spain -- Spanish investment has bought up virtually the entire coast -- and they don't seem to be required to obey the law. ""They can cut down mangrove when they want -- they actually pressured the federal government to change the mangrove law because they bought up all this mangrove and they want to cut it down and drain it and fill it up with hotels.""

"London (CNN) -- Microsoft's popular Kinect for Xbox 360 has inspired countless ingenious ""hacks"" since its launch at the end of 2010. The motion-sensing device has been modified to produce everything from real-time light sabers to nifty trash bins which catch your garbage (however bad your aim), proving a catalyst for creativity and invention. Today, Kinect's reach extends far beyond its gaming origins, spurring advances in medical treatment. Researchers at the UK's University of Southampton, for example, are using the technology to help patients recovering from a stroke. A specially devised algorithm enables therapists to remotely track patients' hand and finger movements and guide them through exercises which compliment a wider program of physiotherapy. ""It widens our opportunities to make rehabilitation more accessible to people in their homes,"" says Cheryl Metcalf, lecturer in Biomechanics at Southampton. ""(Patients) can just plug it into their TV and be monitored over the internet,"" she said. ""The whole tele-medicine idea opens up so many different avenues to be able to look and measure progress objectively."" Aided by electrical engineering company Roke Manor Research, Metcalf and colleagues have created a prototype which is currently being assessed against the traditional laboratory-based system. It's an accessible technology which people are more willing to accept, says Metcalf, and Microsoft have been very supportive. ""We're very grateful to them for releasing the (Kinect for Windows) SDK (software development kit) and making it more accessible to people,"" she said. See also: 3-D printing: the shape of things to come . The kit has been a hit with developers with downloads in the ""hundreds of thousands"" since its release 18 months ago, according to Microsoft. The company itself has been busy looking at ways to exploit the technology through its network of research laboratories around the world. At Microsoft Research's UK base in Cambridge, scientists are currently trialing a new imaging tool for surgeons. ""Touchless Interaction in Medical Imaging"" gives surgeons the power to manipulate scans and medical images on a computer screen using hand gestures. Doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and London's St Thomas' Hospital have been impressed with the equipment, says Helena Mentis, one of the Microsoft Research team working on the project. ""They've all been extremely excited to be able to have hands-on manipulation of imaging data that they are so reliant on, particularly with the push towards minimally invasive surgery,"" Mentis said. Watch video: Hands-free browsing using Kinect . Dr Tom Carrell, vascular surgeon at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, says Kinect has the potential to radically change surgery. ""With Kinect, we could revolutionize the way we do complex operations. Patients will spend less time in theater, and surgeons will be more in control of the information they need,"" Carrell said in a statement. Kinect's influence could extend further says Mentis, manipulating 3-D models of the brain for neurosurgery and expanding touchless interaction into a whole suite of surgical tools. Back in Southampton, the same optimism persists about the progress that can be made using Kinect for Windows. Metcalf predicts that a commercially viable tool for stroke patients will be achieved within five years and that this flurry of activity is only the beginning. ""The other work that's going on around the world in different domains means we can all learn from each other as well,"" she said. ""It just pushes the whole field forward.""","Microsoft Kinect inspiring developers worldwide to create novel devices .

"(CNN) -- Most Muslims in several key Middle Eastern and Asian countries hold negative views of the terrorist network al Qaeda a year after U.S. forces killed its leader, Osama bin Laden, according to a recent survey. The poll by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project, released Monday, found that a high proportion -- between 71% and 98% -- of Muslims questioned in Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon viewed al Qaeda in an unfavorable way. In Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al Qaeda leader during a raid on a compound a year ago, 55% of the Muslims surveyed had a negative opinion of the terrorist group, according to the poll. Only 13% had a favorable view. The United States has used controversial drone strikes in tribal areas of Pakistan to try to dismantle al Qaeda's infrastructure. In May 2011, an elite team of Navy SEALs flew two helicopters into Abbottabad, Pakistan, where bin Laden was living in a three-story compound with approximately two dozen people, including his wives and children. The killing of bin Laden in that raid prompted an uproar in Pakistan. The blatant violation of the country's national sovereignty embarrassed the civilian government and especially the military, which has a prestigious military academy in Abbottabad. The drone strikes, the bin Laden raid and airstrikes by NATO forces in November that killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers near the border with Afghanistan have soured relations between Islamabad and Washington. But they do not appear to have created a high level of support for al Qaeda in Pakistan, according to the Pew survey. Interfaith activist Fiyaz Mughal concurred, saying his organization uncovered nuanced feelings in Pakistan about the killing of bin Laden. ""They were unhappy about the way the killing had taken place, but there was no sense they were angry he had been assassinated,"" he said his London-based Faith Matters found two days after the killing. And with the passing of time, support for al Qaeda has fallen further in key parts of Pakistan, he said. ""As more and more information comes out and more and more attacks take place, the population has gotten fed up with al Qaeda's tactics,"" said Mughal. ""Because of the actions of al Qaeda specifically in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, they have managed to turn off a lot of people in Pakistan,"" he said of the terror network. ""They are not interested in seeing Osama bin Laden as some great martyr, feeling: 'We are unhappy with the U.S., but we are not going to grieve over bin Laden,'"" he said. Sympathy for the terrorist group appears to be stronger in Egypt, the poll's findings suggest. Twenty-one percent of the Muslims questioned there had a favorable view of al Qaeda, while 71% had an unfavorable one. The second highest level of positive opinions of the terrorist network among the countries surveyed was found in Jordan, where 15% viewed al Qaeda favorably and 77% viewed it unfavorably. Muslims polled in Turkey and Lebanon were much less likely to see the extremist organization in a positive light. Only 6% in Turkey and 2% in Lebanon viewed it favorably. In Lebanon, 98% of those questioned held a negative opinion of al Qaeda. The number in Turkey was 73%. The survey's results were based on face-to-face interviews with 1,000 adults each in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon between March 19 and April 10. In Turkey, 1,001 adults were surveyed in person between March 20 and April 11. A total of 1,206 adults were interviewed face-to-face in Pakistan between March 28 and April 13. The Pew Research Center noted that the question about views toward al Qaeda was asked at a later point in the interview in Pakistan than in the other four countries.","NEW: Pakistanis do not grieve for Osama bin Laden, an interfaith expert says .

"(CNN) -- Despite rousing approval by the vast majority of Afghan elders, Afghanistan's security deal with the United States still hangs in the balance. President Hamid Karzai says he won't sign it until some conditions are met. U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice says what the Afghan leader is asking for are new demands added to a deal that has already been worked out. Karzai wants a promise from the United States that there will be no more raids on Afghan homes, and that Afghan prisoners will be released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. He says the demands come not from him but from the 2,500 elders, who convened for four days last week at a loya jirga, a consultative assembly, to consider the agreement, Karzai said. What's missing? Karzai's signature . Rice, who met Karzai over dinner Monday night to talk about the bilateral security agreement, dug in her heels. She told him to sign the bilateral security agreement soon, or the United States will be forced to plan for a complete pull-out. That would include NATO's troops, depriving Afghanistan off all security coverage from Western forces, she said in a statement. During the loya jirga, Karzai told the crowd that the deal would not be signed until after the next presidential election in April 2014. The elders and Rice both said they would like to see it be signed more promptly. Along with their demands toward the United States, the loya jirga attendees requested that Karzai pass the agreement before the end of this year. In his speech at the jirga, Karzai had already threatened not to sign, if the sensitive issue of house raids was not addressed. ""If U.S. military forces conduct military operations on Afghan homes even one more time, then there will be no BSA and we won't sign it,"" Karzai said Sunday. ""They should give assurance about this to us before I sign it."" The raids have been one of the main sore spots between Afghans and Western military presence led by the United States. Other NATO countries, including Germany, have said they will be unable to remain in Afghanistan if the United States and Afghanistan do not reach a deal. A total withdrawal would also put at risk billions of dollars in international aid. Opinion: Hopes are dim for Afghanistan .

"(CNN)  -- South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Gov. Mark Sanford must accept $700 million in federal stimulus money, ending the only formal effort by a governor to reject funding intended to jump-start an ailing economy. Gov. Mark Sanford became the conservative face of opposition to the federal stimulus package. The two-term Republican said he would abide by the court ruling, but called it a bad day for South Carolina and the country. ""This decision is terrible news for every taxpayer in South Carolina, and even more so for future taxpayers who will ultimately bear the responsibility of paying for this so-called 'stimulus' without seeing any benefit from it,"" he said in a statement. Considered a potential future Republican presidential candidate, Sanford led the party's resistance to the $787 billion stimulus package. He warned the increased spending will bring an insurmountable debt burden on future generations. Sanford initially tried to require that any stimulus money pay down the state debt, a stance rejected by the Obama administration. Sanford had resisted taking the money even when the Republican-controlled legislature passed a budget that included the funds. Students and education officials in South Carolina filed lawsuits demanding that the governor take the money. Sanford tried to have those suits merged and heard in federal court. On Monday, however, a federal judge rejected that effort, and said that the South Carolina Supreme Court must decide what to do. In its ruling, the state's highest court said the legislature, not Sanford, has the power to decide whether to accept the federal stimulus money. ""At this stage in the process, the Governor certainly has no discretion to make a contradictory decision on behalf of the State,"" the ruling said. ""We hold the Governor must apply for the ... funds.""  Watch report on Gov. Sanford's policy defeat » . However, the court distanced itself from any role in setting policy on the issue. ""Our decision today should not be construed as a comment on the policy differences between Governor Sanford and the General Assembly respecting the wisdom or necessity of South Carolina accepting the"" money, it said. ... ""We discharge our duty to honor the rule of law, nothing more."" The ruling was in response to lawsuits filed by two students and a school administrators' association that sought to force the state to accept the stimulus money, some of which will go for education needs. CNN's Tom Cohen and Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","State Supreme Court rules 5-0 that governor must accept $700 million .

"(CNN) -- First came the dramatic discovery of the long-lost remains of King Richard III. Now, there's the mystery of the coffin within the coffin. Archaeologists working at the site in central England where Richard III's body was found underneath a parking lot are currently puzzling over a sealed lead coffin containing the remains of a yet-to-be-identified person. The lead coffin was found encased in a larger stone coffin. The smaller coffin is intact ""except for a hole at one end of the casket through which we could tantalizingly see someone's feet,"" said Mathew Morris, the fieldwork director at the site. New discovery just as exciting . Last year, archaeologists unearthed a body buried beneath a nondescript parking lot in the city of Leicester. In February, they confirmed the body was that of Richard III, the last king of England to die on the battlefield. The news drew global attention and set off a debate over Richard's bloodthirsty reputation. Archaeologists from the University of Leicester, who have been toiling away at the site this summer, say the discovery of the double coffin is just as exciting. They only uncovered the lead coffin last week after eight people hauled the heavy lid off the stone coffin. But figuring out who's inside looks set to be a much tougher task. ""This inner coffin is likely to contain a high-status burial, although we still don't know who it contains,"" Morris wrote in a blog post. ""No writing was visible on the coffin lid but it does bear a crude cross soldered into the metal."" There are three main contenders for the identity of the coffin's inhabitant: a medieval knight named Sir William de Moton of Peckleton, and two leaders of the English Grey Friars order, Peter Swynsfeld and William of Nottingham. Beneath the parking lot . The Leicester site is where a church, known as Grey Friars Friary, once stood. Over the centuries, the whereabouts of the friary's remnants were forgotten, but it remained in the records as the burial place of Richard III. Last year, experts began digging away at the area, which had taken on the less illustrious role of a parking lot. They went on to establish that it was part of the friary and that a skeleton, hastily buried in an uneven grave, was that of Richard. The archaeologists who undertook a new dig this summer think the double coffin, located near Richard's grave, was buried during the 14th century, more than 100 years before Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Of the coffin's three likely occupants, Swynsfeld died in 1272, William of Nottingham died in 1330 and Sir William de Moton died between 1356 and 1362. 'A first for all of us' Besides the puzzle of who lies within, the archaeologists were excited about the coffins themselves. ""This was a first for all of us on site,"" Morris said. ""None of the team had ever excavated an intact stone coffin before, let alone a lead coffin as well."" They have now wrapped up their four weeks of digging at the site. The lead coffin has been taken away so that experts can carry out tests to figure out the best way of opening it without damaging its contents. But, Morris said, other parts of the friary that the archaeologists tried to investigate this summer appear to have been completely destroyed -- meaning that some of the site's mysteries may never be solved.","Archaeologists found a lead coffin within a stone coffin near Richard III's grave .

"(CNN) -- Going into Election Day 2013, there was little doubt that Chris Christie was going to win his run for re-election. The only unknown was what he would say in his victory speech. The tough-talking Republican headliner has the most buzz of any potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate and he created more by delivering a speech that was aimed at both New Jersey and a national audience. ""And you don't just show up six months before an election. You show up four years before one. And you don't just take no for an answer the first time no has happened. You keep going back and trying more,"" Christie told the audience in Asbury Park. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos called Christie's address ""an announcement speech."" And it will only serve to stir up more speculation that despite his saying that he's seriously considering a run in 2016, his mind is already made up. CNN exit polls show Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 57% of the female vote and winning all age groups other than those 18-29. Christie also took a fifth of the African-American vote and half - 51% - of Latinos, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections. Overall, Christie bested his little-known Democratic challenger, Barbara Buono, by a 60%-38% margin with about 99% of the vote counted. Virginia and New Jersey are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest. And Virginia's race provided the only real drama as votes were counted. Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton confidant, trailed Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli through the evening until votes from Democratic strongholds started rolling in and propelled him to victory. A complete list of election results . The race was nasty from the get-go and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks. Voters throughout the commonwealth of Virginia were bombarded by negative ads and polling showed that neither candidate was particularly well-liked by the people who would be voting for them. With nearly all of the vote counted, McAuliffe held a 48%-45% margin over Cuccinelli. Libertarian Robert Sarvis pulled in about 7% of the vote, which could have made the difference. In New York City, the race for mayor was never in question, either, as Democrat Bill de Blasio defeated Republican Joe Lhota, by a 73%-24% margin with 91% of the vote in, making the city's public advocate the first Democrat to lead the nation's largest city in a generation. In Alabama, an establishment candidate defeated a tea party-backed candidate in a Republican primary runoff for the congressional seat from Alabama's 1st district, which had been seen as precursor of intra-Republican party contests in next year's midterm elections. Bradley Byrne, a former state senator, defeated businessman Dean Young in the race by a 52%-48% margin with all of the vote in. The contest was the first time Republican voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in October was laid largely at the feet of tea party instigators in Congress. Exit polls: Christie and McAuliffe took different paths to victory . Here's a closer look at some of the night's most interesting races and ballot measures: . A nasty race in purple Virginia . The McAuliffe and Cuccinelli campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare with McAuliffe making sure that women were aware of Cuccinelli's support of ""personhood"" legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control, while Cuccinelli frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that McAuliffe co-founded. McAuliffe and Democrats pinned Cuccinelli as a tea party activist, linking him to conservative lawmakers in Washington who initiated a strategy that eventually led to the government shutdown. Take a closer look at the Virginia race . What does Christie's win say about 2016? While much of his address was directed at his New Jersey audience, Christie also had a message for the nation. ""I know tonight, a dispirited America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington, looks to New Jersey to say, 'Is what I think happening really happening? Are people really coming together. Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers. Are we really all working together.' ""Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government our first job is to get the job done and as long as I'm governor that job will always, always be finished,"" More on Christie's big win . NYC picks first Democratic mayor in a generation . At the center of the New York mayor's race were disagreements over taxes and the city's controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program backed by incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, an idea Lhota vehemently opposed. Go deeper on the NYC race . Deep-pocketed Republicans pick winner in Alabama . Byrne, the establishment candidate, far outraised Young, the tea party candidate, thanks to major help from the business wing of the party, including the Chamber of Commerce. He also garnered endorsements from establishment figures, including several Republican House leaders. However, despite support for smaller tea party personalities, Young was largely ignored by the national tea party groups. Tea Party Express, Club For Growth and FreedomWorks -- three of the largest national tea party groups -- sat on the sidelines of the intra-party fight. Establishment beats tea party in Alabama runoff . Also on the ballot . New York is not the only major city that held a mayoral contest on Tuesday. Voters in Boston, Seattle, Detroit and Cleveland also elected mayors. And voters in six states weighed in on 31 ballot measures. Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved the marijuana tax 65% to 35%. Washington voters rejected genetically modified food labeling with 55% of voters opposing it. And New Jersey voters agreed to increase the minimum wage. Voters in 11 Colorado counties also voted on a Colorado succession measure. Pot tax, secession top state's ballot measures .

"(CNN) -- Ten cases of polio have been confirmed among children in Syria, the first outbreak of the disease in that country since 1999, a World Health Organization spokesman told CNN Tuesday. WHO's Oliver Rosenbauer said the confirmations were among 22 suspected cases that were identified on October 17 in the eastern city of Deir Ezzor after the children exhibited symptoms of ""acute flaccid paralysis"" -- a sudden onset of weakness and floppiness in any part of a child's body or paralysis in anyone in whom polio is suspected as the cause. The confirmation was key because other diseases can cause similar symptoms. Most of the victims were younger than two years old and were unimmunized or underimmunized, WHO said in a statement. The Syrian Health Ministry is working with international organizations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to get vaccine to all areas of Syria, Health Minister Dr. Saad al-Nayef told WHO's regional committee on Monday in Muscat, Oman, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Tuesday. But Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration, told CNN last week that his organization was not waiting for the confirmation to mount a vaccination campaign. ""As far as everyone is concerned, they're treating this like polio,"" he said. On October 24, health officials launched a program to immunize 1.6 million Syrian children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella -- in government- and rebel-held areas. The response, which will also include neighboring countries, is expected to last at least six months, the WHO said. According to UNICEF, 500,000 children in Syria have not been vaccinated against polio. Given the fighting, the large-scale movement of refugees and the number of children who have not been fully immunized, ""the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 across the region is considered to be high,"" it added. The highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children. Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis and death. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988. Public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources are diverted away from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines. Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing civil war, the polio vaccination effort will be helped by the fact that Syria had high rates of vaccination coverage among its populace prior to the current conflict, Aylward predicted. In an address Friday to the U.N. Security Council, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief cited the outbreak as an example of the privations endured by the Syrians and the risks they face. Diseases, including those easily preventable by basic hygiene and vaccination, are spreading ""at an alarming rate,"" said Valerie Amos. In addition, reports of malnutrition have soared, and people suffering from chronic illnesses, such as cancer and diabetes, are dying for lack of access to treatment, she said. Aid workers cannot reach some 2.5 million people in the country, she added. ""All humanitarian staff missions and convoys continue to require written approval,"" she said, citing as ""unacceptable"" and ""unpredictable"" the government's processing of visas for U.N. and non-governmental staff members. More than 100 such visas are pending, many are limited to a single entry and many of those that are issued are for insufficient durations, she said. ""There is simply no reason why humanitarian staff, whose only interest is to help those in desperate need, have not been granted visas to scale up our operations,"" she said. In response, Syria's permanent representative to the United Nations acknowledged to reporters in New York that the country is facing grave humanitarian problems, but accused Amos of having failed to properly apportion blame. ""She should know and say what are the root causes,"" Bashar Jaafari told reporters, citing neighborhoods that are ""under siege by the Syrian Army because there are armed groups in these neighborhoods taking civilians as human shields."" Jaafari said his country is ""a victim of interference by some member states into its domestic affairs."" Regarding the issuance of visas, he said, ""We are issuing too many visas to too many people; we are a sovereign nation, like any other nation; we have our own reasons sometimes to deny a visa to this or that individual."" Jaafari said Damascus has extended visas to hundreds of people working for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which is led by Amos. ""Any minimal cases here and there"" of problems ""wouldn't affect the overall picture of our cooperation with OCHA,"" he said. According to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters.

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) -- With a few drops of vaccine, Gulnaz shields another child from the devastating effects of polio. It's a simple but potentially life-saving task. It's also incredibly dangerous -- not for the children, but for Gulnaz, who works in one of the most violent parts of Karachi. Last year, her niece and sister-in-law -- also polio workers -- were gunned down by men on motorcycles. The U.N.'s children's agency, UNICEF, said they were shot to death for vaccinating the children . Why polio hasn't gone away yet . But the deaths haven't stopped Gulnaz, who is using one name for safety reasons. ""Everybody in my family was suffering from shock. Some of them tried to stop me, telling me not to do this job anymore because two coffins leaving one house leaves a mark,"" she said. Anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants ever since U.S. intelligence used a fake vaccination program to help in its hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. The CIA used a fake vaccination program to collect DNA samples from residents of bin Laden's compound to verify his presence there. Taliban to U.S.: End drone strikes, or no more polio vaccines . That wasn't a polio campaign, but the fallout still lingers. Since July 2012, at least 22 polio workers have been killed. Still, Gulnaz remains undeterred. ""After this tragedy, I'm not scared at all. In fact, I feel even stronger and more determined,"" she said. ""Every woman in this country who is doing this job is praying for me. When I'm working in the field I'm with my partner, but I also sense that my niece and sister-in-law who were killed are walking alongside me."" Gulnaz and her partner are escorted by paramilitary soldiers who seal off the area -- guarding each end of a street to ensure that young children get access to the crucial drops of vaccine that most parents and children around the world can simply get from their local doctor. Unrelenting attacks . On Monday alone, two people were killed and 13 others were wounded in a bombing that targeted polio workers in northwest Pakistan, police said. That blast took place on the outskirts of the violence-plagued city of Peshawar. At the U.N., money backs up vow to eradicate polio by 2015 . The bomb was detonated remotely as polio vaccines and accompanying materials were being handed out to health workers, said Najeeb-Ur-Rehman, a senior police superintendent. Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes. It wasn't immediately clear if the Taliban played a role in the most recent attacks. A father's dilemma . Osman was infected with polio as a child and wanted to make sure his children were vaccinated. But after the raid that killed bin Laden, he decided not to vaccinate his 3-year-old son, Musharraf. The boy became one of the 28 cases of detected polio in Pakistan in 2013. ""I'm not stupid or illiterate. I made sure my other children got the drops,"" Osman said. ""But I was very angry and wary of aid workers, because if they are cooperating with spy agencies, then it's better to keep away from them. I am sad my youngest suffered, but I don't regret my decision."" Paralympian: We can't afford to lose the fight against polio . Osman, who is using only one name for safety reasons, changed his mind only after the government released a booklet with a series of religious edicts from Muslim scholars telling parents that polio drops are safe. Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in just hours. It has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 in 2011 to 58 in 2012, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. ""I am appealing to my fellow Pashtun society, to give their kids polio drops,"" Osman said. It's a message that health care workers hope others will hear.

"(CNN) -- With Tuesday's recall vote, taxpayers in Wisconsin affirmed Gov. Scott Walker's reforms and put an end to the state's unholy alliance between big government and big labor. The reign of entrenched public sector unions may be over and a new era of self-governing fiscal responsibility beginning. The importance of Walker's victory cannot be understated. This is, after all, Wisconsin -- the birthplace of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and the first state to permit collective bargaining. Not since Ronald Reagan in 1984 has Wisconsin voted Republican, and in 2008, Obama took the state by a whopping 14 points. Analysis: Wisconsin now tougher for Obama, but still uphill climb for Romney . And yet Walker won by seven points Tuesday, becoming the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch also beat the recall. The Wisconsin saga ends close to where it began: a sobering defeat for organized labor and a stunning victory for fiscal conservatives. Walker took office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion budget hole. He had few options at his disposal to balance the budget: raise taxes, make draconian cuts or go after the sweetheart public employee pension and health care plans. He bravely chose the latter, requiring public employees to pay 5% of their salaries toward their pensions (they paid virtually nothing before) and 12.6% of their health care premiums (less than what private and federal employees pay). Furthermore, he ended collective bargaining except for wages and made automatic union dues optional. Walker's Wisconsin win big blow to unions, smaller one to Obama . Before Walker's reforms, Wisconsin state employees enjoyed salary and benefits that were about 28% higher than comparable private sector workers, according to a new study from the American Enterprise Institute. Even after his much decried reforms, Wisconsin public employees' total compensation is still about 22% greater -- $81,637 versus $67,068 -- than similar private sector workers. Yet how were Walker's proposals received? Democratic state senators fled to Illinois to avoid votes; up to 100,000 protesters stormed the state Capitol in Madison, climbing through windows and trashing the building; teachers handed out fake doctors' notes to skip school and protest, some even bringing their students with them; signs and fliers compared Scott Walker to Adolf Hitler; a Democratic state senator cursed out a Republican lawmaker; and lastly, Democrats initiated recall elections on state senators, the lieutenant governor and Walker. In the end, Democrats have little, if anything, to show for it. That's because Walker's reforms have done everything he promised. He recouped the state's budget shortfall without raising taxes. School districts that enacted his reforms were able to meet budgets without firing teachers, enlarging class sizes or cutting programs. In fact, some even reported budget surpluses. Property taxes fell for the first time in 13 years, and Walker cited figures that showed Wisconsin has added 35,000 jobs since he took office. The public sector union machine, once a colossus of Democratic power, looks weak in the wake of Walker's triumph. With mandatory union dues now extinct, union membership has withered in Wisconsin. AFSCME's Local 24 in Madison has seen its ranks drop from 22,300 to 7,100, while AFSCME's statewide membership has been cut in half. In short, Walker has broken the long running cycle of handoffs and paybacks between union leadership and state politicians. Where is the Democrat outrage? In 2007, then-Sen. Barack Obama promised, ""(I)f American workers are being denied their right to organize when I'm in the White House, I will put on a comfortable pair of shoes and I will walk on that picket line with you as president of the United States."" In February 2011, President Obama called Walker's proposals an ""assault"" on unions. But less than two years later, Obama wouldn't set foot in Wisconsin before the recall. His endorsement of Tom Barrett came via Twitter, hardly instilling confidence in the Democratic cause. Public sector unions were left out in the Wisconsin cold. On the other hand, the untold story of the Wisconsin saga may be the resurgence of the tea party. Local tea party groups, like the Racine tea party, and national groups, such as Americans for Prosperity, have hosted dozens of rallies for Walker, recruiting volunteers from around the country and pouring in campaign donations in unparalleled numbers. Any rumors of a tea party demise have been short-lived. Come November, Wisconsin will be the conservative rallying cry. Fittingly, the Badger fight song may very well be the anthem: . On, Wisconsin! On, Wisconsin! Plunge right through that line! Run the ball clear down the field, . A touchdown sure this time ... The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Recall vote a huge victory for conservatives, tea party .
He says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faced multibillion-dollar budget deficit .
Bennett says cutting worker benefits erased deficit, lowered taxes, helped state economy .
He says Obama didn't fulfill vow to stand with workers who lost collective bargaining on benefits ."
"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Lao Airlines is investigating that possibility that a plane crash that killed 49 people Wednesday was caused by ""wind shear,"" an airline official said. Wind shear -- a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance -- has been a factor in many air disasters. Chalerm Taiyalad, a Lao Airlines vice-president, said it was raining heavily at the time Flight QV301 was approaching for landing at Pakse Airport, near the Thai border, after departing from the capital Vientiane. Gusts from the remnants of Typhoon Nari appeared to have caused the pilots to lose control of the ATR 72 aircraft, he said. The ATR 72 propeller plane was preparing to land when a gust of wind appeared to push it away from the airport, and it crashed on or near an island in the Mekong River, reported KPL, the national news agency. Forty-nine people -- 44 passengers and 5 crew -- were killed in the crash. They included 16 Laotian passengers and five crew, seven French, six Australians, five Thais, three Koreans, two Vietnamese, an American, a Canadian, a Chinese, a Malaysian and one Taiwanese, Taiyalad said. He said five bodies had been recovered from the Mekong River, while the black box and the remains of the aircraft remained unaccounted for, along with the remaining 44 bodies. Families of the victims were arriving in Pakse, awaiting the recovery of their relatives. Somphone Doungdara, CEO of Lao Airlines, said his company was working with authorities and investigators from the aircraft manufacturer to determine the cause of the crash.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The general who seized control of Thailand in a coup last week said Monday that he has received royal endorsement to run the politically unstable country and warned of a potential crackdown on people protesting military rule. Dressed in a white uniform and flanked by more than a dozen other military officials, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha addressed reporters in Bangkok, saying he had received a royal command from the country's deeply revered King to head the ruling military council. Saying there was ""no set time period"" for when new elections might be held, Prayuth outlined the steps he said his junta plans to take, including setting up a committee to introduce reforms. But he also issued a warning to the groups of protesters who have gathered in Bangkok in recent days to voice their opposition to the coup and call for democratic elections. The demonstrators, who numbered in the hundreds on Sunday, have scuffled with soldiers in the streets. So far, the military has allowed the small-but-growing protests to take place, even though martial law forbids gatherings of more than five people. With more protests expected Monday, Prayuth suggested the military wouldn't tolerate public displays of dissent indefinitely, saying the situation was reaching a ""boiling point."" He urged people to stop demonstrating, warning that they risk a stricter enforcement of martial law and prosecution in military courts, and told journalists and social media users not to transmit provocative messages. Coup criticized . The Thai military carried out the coup Thursday -- tearing up the constitution and imposing a curfew -- after months of unrest that had destabilized the elected government and caused outbursts of deadly violence in Bangkok. But the sudden intervention by the armed forces -- the latest in a series of coups that have punctuated modern Thai history -- has been criticized by human rights activists and foreign governments, including the United States. Receiving endorsement from King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand's ailing but widely admired monarch, adds legitimacy to Prayuth's credentials. But it appears unlikely to change the opinions of many of the protesters who have been taking to the streets to demonstrate against the coup. Other Thais have expressed hope that the military will succeed in bringing an end to the crisis that has plagued the country for months.. Politicians, academics summoned . Since taking power, military authorities have summoned -- and in some cases detained -- scores of leading political officials and other prominent figures, such as academics and business leaders. Travel bans have also been imposed. Among the most high-profile figures who've turned themselves in is former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, who was in office when the current phase of political turmoil began in November. Yingluck, who was removed from office by the courts earlier this month, was released from a military facility over the weekend after she followed a summons to report to military authorities on Friday. A military source said Yingluck was asked to ""help us maintain peace and order and not to get involved with protesters or any political movement"" and now has freedom of movement and communication. But a close aide to Yingluck disagreed with the assertion that she was free to move and communicate. She is yet to make any public statement since the coup. Thaksin's influence . The recent unrest was driven by months of protests against Yingluck's government. The protest leaders said they wanted to rid Thailand of the influence of Yingluck and her wealthy brother, the exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in the country's last military coup in 2006. The Shinawatras' powerful political movement, which has dominated elections for more than a decade, draws its support from Thailand's populous rural regions in the north and northeast. But it is unpopular among the Bangkok elites, who accuse it of buying votes through ill-judged, populist policies. The protesters who campaigned against Yingluck's government claimed Thailand needed reforms to be imposed by an unelected council before any further elections could take place. With the military's intervention, they appear to have got their wish, although some of the protest leaders were taken into custody after the coup. Suthep Thaugsuban, the ring leader of the anti-Yingluck protests, was released on bail of 600,000 baht ($18,000) with instructions he can't leave the country, his organization said Monday on its Facebook page. It remains unclear how the pro-Thaksin red shirt movement, which held mass rallies in central Bangkok in 2010, will respond to military rule. Some of the top red shirt leaders are also among those who were detained by military authorities. CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Bangkok, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Kocha Olarn and journalist Kiki Dhitavat contributed to this report.","NEW: The leader of rallies against the former government is released on bail .

"(MatadorNetwork.com) -- Matador Network's Eva Sandoval lays out the city's most avoidable attractions...and what you should do instead. 1. Don't... get lit in Temple Bar . Temple Bar is home to several bars that drunken tourists in green face paint love to frequent. There are lovely things to see in historic Temple Bar -- for example, the Irish Photography Centre, the Temple Bar Music Centre and the Irish Film Institute -- but save your tour for the daytime, before things get pagan. Do.... tie one on like the locals . Head to the area around Georges Street in City Centre or make your way down towards Rathmines. 4 Dame Lane and The Globe for your clubbing clusterfreaks; The Duke, The Bernard Shaw, The Bleeding Horse and Roddy Boland for your beer and GAA matches. Those in search of the dirty singles scene might entertain the idea of hitting Copper Face Jacks -- a local institution, described in disgusted tones by my Dubliner friends as ""a meatmarket,"" ""full of nurses and gardaí (Irish police),"" and ""hell on earth."" But, you know, wildly popular with the locals. You've been officially warned. 2. Don't... expect to drink all night . Most pubs close at 11:30 p.m. on weeknights and 1a.m. on weekends. Something about curbing alcoholism. Well done. Do... make friends . The party still goes on after-hours in people's homes. Make sure to hit the off-license before 10:30 p.m. to stock up or you'll be doubly out of luck. Matador Network: Photo essay -- exploring western Ireland . 3. Don't... try to get inside Oscar Wilde's birthplace . 21 Westland Row is not a museum. It's the writing centre for the Creative Writing and Irish Literature Master's of Philosophy students at Trinity College Dublin. There are no tours; just would-be writers attending lectures and jumping in shock each time you ring the buzzer and shout: ""Oscar Wilde!"" I speak from personal experience. Do... visit the Yeats exhibit at Kildare Street . Brilliant. Free. Definitely open to the public. Or if it's still Oscar you're after, visit 1 Merrion Square to see the house where he grew up or the Oscar Wilde statue in Merrion Square. 4. Don't... call an Irishman (or Irishwoman) British . This goes for the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Want to start a fistfight? Talk about how Dublin is the greatest capital city in the UK; tourist goes down. Do... get it right . The Republic of Ireland is independent of the the crown. It has been a Free State since 1922. Northern Ireland is part of the UK. Matador Network: A night down the pub in Dublin by the numbers . 5. Don't... automatically dismiss the food . I might be a bit biased here because I find traditional Irish fare incredibly satisfying: hearty shepherd's pie, fat pink Irish salmon, mussels, chips and potato boxty -- what's not to like? Dublin is a vibrant capital city, full of trendy restaurants offering ethnic and traditional specialties. New Irish cuisine puts heavy emphasis on organically sourced ingredients and it's the norm to find vegan and coeliac options on most menus. Do... try Irish classics with a twist . For souped-up takes on homestyle Irish classics like fish pie and bangers & mash, try The Farm or The Winding Stair. Yamamori on Eden Quay has great fresh sushi, or try Fafie's French Crêperie on Kevin Street for crepes and gallettes. Jo Burger in Rathmines has quite possibly the world's perfect burger with homemade fixings from the Breton buns to the homemade spicy ketchup and patties of 100% locally sourced beef, chicken and lamb. Prior fasting recommended. 6. Don't... stick to British Colonial and Irish Civil War historical sights . Dublin's got serious Viking DNA, dating from the 9th century, and plenty of local pre-history to explore. Do.... take the Viking Splash Tour . 20 Euro gets you a seat on the Viking Splash Tour -- a bright yellow amphibious vehicle that parades you around Dublin's city centre to learn about its Viking past. At the end of the tour, the vehicle slips into the Grand Canal Docklands for a cruise. Best of all, the tour leader encourages passengers to shout ""ARGH!"" like Vikings at hapless pedestrians. Bonus: Everyone gets to wear plastic Viking helmets. Alternatively, visit The National Museum of Ireland - Archaeology to see bog people -- bodies preserved to eerie near-perfection thousands of years ago in Ireland's peat bogs. Free admission every day. Matador Network: 5 of Ireland's best beaches . 7. Don't.... attend the St. Patrick's Day Parade . Celebrating St. Patrick's Day in Dublin is a bucket-list goal for many -- too many. Try to be content with simply being in-country for the holiday, unless you like vomit-lined streets, exposed genitalia and sidewalk-to-sidewalk crowds. Do.... head somewhere on the West Coast . The West Coast has less crowds and less tourist nonsense. Try visiting Achill Island for their annual Piper Celebration. 8. Don't... order a Murphy's . Why would you? Murphy's stout comes from Cork! Gasp. Do... order a Guinness . You're in the land from whence the mother's milk flows, after all. Arthur Guinness signed a 9000-year lease on the Guinness Factory in Dublin 2, so you've got plenty of time. Matador Network: 10 WWOOFing opportunities in Ireland . 9. Don't... expect an ""authentic"" trad music session . These days, catching a trad music session in Dublin is like watching a rodeo in New York City. While you might get some sessions in touristy Temple Bar or at The Duke, you'll have better luck finding spontaneous traditional Irish music out on the West Coast or in the countryside. Do... find Dublin-style standup comedy . On Monday nights, the International Bar at 23 Wicklow Street in City Centre hosts Glór -- an open mic poetry, music and writing slam -- held in both English and Irish. Brilliant cultural fun. 10. Don't... take a photo next to Molly Malone . During my first visit to Dublin, my Irish then-boyfriend forbade me to set foot near the statue of Molly Malone for fear I'd get myself -- him -- pegged as a tourist. Turned out, there wasn't even a point in trying to get a photo; Dublin's most famous working girl still has people crawling all over her. Do... find another idol .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Muntadher al-Zaidi, the man seen as a hero in some circles for throwing his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush, was sentenced to three years in prison Thursday by an Iraqi court. TV reporter Muntadher al-Zaidi, shown in a file photo, was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush. Al-Zaidi threw his shoes at Bush during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in December in Baghdad. Neither shoe hit the president, and other people in the room quickly knocked al-Zaidi to the ground before security officials arrested him. Family members and journalists were cleared from the courtroom before Thursday's verdict. After news of the verdict reached family members, al-Zaidi's brother appeared close to fainting. Other family members were seen crying and shouting curses about al-Maliki and Bush.  Watch al-Zaidi's family protest the sentence » . Al-Zaidi was a journalist who worked for the television network al-Baghdadia. The network also called for his release shortly after the incident. He explained his actions during an hourlong appearance last month in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. Asked whether anyone pushed or motivated him, al-Zaidi said he was spurred by the ""violations that are committed against the Iraqi people."" In the Middle East, throwing shoes at someone is traditionally a sign of contempt. Al-Zaidi's angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world. He is regarded by many people as a hero, and demonstrators took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release shortly after the incident. Al-Zaidi, who faced a charge of assaulting a visiting head of state, had 17 lawyers to defend him. There were also three judges in the courtroom, along with the prosecutor and family members. In December, his defense team told CNN that he could face 15 years in prison if convicted. But al-Zaidi's defense team was hoping to change his charge to an insult rather than assault, which would have brought about three months in prison rather than three years. CNN's Yousif Bassil and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Muntadher al-Zaidi gets three years in prison for throwing shoes at President Bush .

"(CNN) -- The bad news just keeps coming for English Premier League champions Manchester United. Already out of the FA and League Cups, another English Premier defeat to Stoke at the weekend left the club lagging 15 points behind leaders Arsenal and now an online survey of Chinese fans reveals the London club has eclipsed United as the most popular football club in China. Arsenal edged David Moyes' side as the most popular club with Italian side AC Milan third, and ahead of Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona. Germany was chosen as the most popular national side in China ahead of Italy and Spain while the English Premier League was the overwhelming favorite national division among Chinese fans, receiving 50% of the votes ahead of Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A. The survey was conducted by Coventry University's Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) in England between September and November last year, and drew a total of 15,586 responses. CIBS researcher Jiajia Song offered a possible explanation for why Chinese football fans may prefer Arsenal to Manchester United, which has regularly toured in the Far East. ""Fans are more likely to support a club team when players from their favorite national squad regularly make the starting line-up,"" said researcher Jiajia Song, who worked on the survey. ""This means players like Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podalski, both German international players and players for Arsenal, are likely to fulfill an important commercial and marketing role for club, country and league."" Arsenal first played in China in 1995 but did not tour again until 2011, reportedly because manager Arsene Wenger preferred to focus on preseason training in Europe rather than embarking on potentially lucrative international tours. Many of Arsenal's Premier League rivals, including United, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, have traveled to China and other Asian nations in the hope of boosting their preseason coffers. But Professor Simon Chadwick, director of the CIBS, argues the potential revenue from a club's global fanbase is not being maximized. ""There's no doubt that clubs generate revenue from China, South Korea and Japan,"" Chadwick explained on Twitter. ""Whether they make a profit is a different matter. ""Typically, less than 10% of turnover from a Premier League club comes from overseas sales. Compare European football to NBA in China, for example. ""The NBA has physical and marketing infrastructure set up on the ground to capitalize on opportunities to serve fans and customers."" For now, Arsenal and its Premier League peers still deem it worthwhile to travel east to play in front of their global fans, but they face growing competition from China's domestic game. The Chinese Super League was established in 2004, rebranding the Jia-A league formed a decade earlier, and it has now been expanded to 16 teams. Guangzhou Evergrande is the club taking the domestic league by storm and last November it became the first Chinese winners of the Asian Champions League. The Chinese champions claims it regularly attracts 45,000 fans. Evergrande is coached by Italian Marcello Lippi, who guided Italy to the 2006 World Cup. The foundation for Lippi's success is a group of burgeoning Chinese talent; he only has three international players among his ranks largely because the Chinese league limits each club to employing five international players.","Arsenal is the most popular soccer club among Chinese fans, according to a new survey .

"(CNN) -- Health officials will be comparing samples to determine if two newborn infants were infected with the same strain of the bacteria that led to the rare infections that killed one and sickened another in the past month. One newborn in Missouri died from an infection caused by a type of bacteria called Cronobacter sakazakii. Another newborn baby was sickened in Illinois, but is recovering from the infection, according to the state health departments. Health officials Friday were gathering information about each newborn, including what they ate and where they were, in an effort to trace the sources of the infections. Early indications led authorities to suspect a link to powdered infant formula. The Centers for Disease Control and Infection and the states' health departments have been testing samples of open containers of infant formula, according to the CDC's Dr. Robert Tauxe, and the Food and Drug Administration has been testing samples of unopened powdered formula. ""So far no formula samples have yielded Cronobacter,"" according to Tauxe, who is the CDC's deputy director for the Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases. Cronobacter infections are very rare, according to the CDC, which says only four to six cases are reported per year. Some of these infections have been linked to powdered infant formula in the past, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. However, at this time, it has not been established that infant formula was the source of either of the latest infections, according to the CDC. Late Wednesday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced it had pulled from its outlets nationwide all cans of Enfamil Newborn powdered formula that matched the size and lot number of the formula used for the baby who died in Missouri. The retailer said it removed the product ""out of an abundance of caution"" until the investigation determines the source of the infection. ""We really don't have evidence that the two infections are related to each other,"" Tauxe told CNN. ""Those two cases that occurred this past month may just be a coincidence."" He said CDC labs will compare samples of the bacteria from both states in an effort to determine if they came from the same source. Tauxe cautions that these tests can take a long time -- ""up to a month."" Cronobacter can cause life-threatening infections in newborns. It's fatal in nearly 40% of cases, according to the CDC, and some of those who survive can be left with severe neurological problems. Because Cronobacter is not monitored by PulseNet, a national network of state and local health departments and laboratories that is coordinated by the CDC (and works with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the FDA), the CDC has alerted public health officials to be on the lookout for any other cases, Tauxe said. While breastfeeding is the healthiest and safest option to feed newborn infants, it's not always possible for mothers to do so. Commercially prepared liquid infant formula is generally safe because it's been canned, Tauxe said, but powdered infant formula is not completely sterile. The Illinois Health Department says ""formula can become contaminated with C. sakazakii through the raw products used to make the formula, contamination after pasteurization or during preparation of reconstituted formula for infant feeding."" There are steps parents can take to reduce infection in newborn babies: . -- Prepare only a small amount of reconstituted formula for each feeding so as to reduce the amount of time the formula is held at room temperature. -- Do not hold reconstituted formula for longer than two hours without refrigeration. -- Throw out any formula left in a bottle after a feeding. -- Minimize the time reconstituted formula is held in the refrigerator before feeding.","Initially, authorities suspected a link to powdered infant formula .
Tests so far have not found contamination in formula, Dr. Robert Tauxe says .
Wal-Mart has pulled a brand of formula from its shelves .
Only four to six cases of this type of infection are reported per year ."
"(CNN) -- The recent ordeal of Meriam Yahia Ibrahim Ishag, a Sudanese mother and wife of an American citizen -- coupled with Iran's continued imprisonment of Saeed Abedini, also an American citizen and a pastor -- should awaken our conscience to one grim and inescapable fact: The persecution of Christians continues. Charged with leaving Islam to marry a Christian, despite being raised a Christian and remaining one throughout her 27 years, Meriam was sentenced to death last month for apostasy. After an international outcry, she was released, rearrested, and released again, according to the U.S. State Department. In Sudan and Iran, as well as countries like Saudi Arabia, leaders and movements impose their own extreme interpretations of Islam, while restricting the rights of Christians and other religious minorities. Elsewhere in the Middle East, mass violence as well as repression arises from such movements. In Iraq and Syria, forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) commit horrific abuses against Christians and others, from torture to murder. In Egypt, scores of churches and other Christian structures were burned by radicals last autumn following President Mohamed Morsy's fall. While Christians faced repression under prior regimes like Hosni Mubarak's, their predicament has worsened in a post-Arab Spring world. 7 terrible countries for Christians . With media attention riveted on the Middle East, it is tempting to assume that persecution against Christians occurs almost exclusively in that region. But assaults against Christians are worldwide, transcending any one regional, ideological, or religious bent. Combating this problem entails a much broader solution. According to the findings of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), evidence abounds of persecution elsewhere. In Myanmar (also known as Burma), with a Buddhist majority and a struggling democracy, ethnic-minority Christians, along with Rohingya Muslims, have faced ongoing abuses. Last year, during military incursions in Kachin state, as many as 60 churches were shelled. Military forces have beaten and arrested Christian leaders and kidnapped church members for forced labor. In China, the world's most populous nation, Catholics and Protestants refusing to register with the communist dictatorship face arrests and fines, and their churches are shuttered. China's government has issued a directive to ""eradicate"" unregistered Protestant churches over the next decade, and even registered churches have recently been bulldozed in Zhejiang province. In Eritrea, a military regime jails up to 3,000 people, mostly evangelical or Pentecostal Christians, on religious grounds. Prisoners have been beaten and tortured. In interviews with USCIRF, released prisoners reported being confined in 20-foot metal shipping containers with extreme temperature fluctuations. In India, the world's largest democracy, Christians face harassment and violence, especially in states with laws restricting religious conversion from Hinduism. In Nigeria, the central government fails to protect Christians, as well as Muslims, from Boko Haram terrorism. In North Korea, a totalitarian tyranny with a cult of personality venerating the ruling Kim family, the government imprisons, tortures, and executes Christians caught transporting Bibles or engaging in missionary endeavors or other banned activities. North Koreans who flee for China and then convert to Christianity are in grave danger when forcibly returned. Punishment includes beatings, torture, forced labor, sexual violence, and forced abortions or infanticide. In Pakistan, Christians face a government that can imprison them unjustly under blasphemy laws while failing to protect them from attacks or punish their attackers. Last September, suicide bombers launched the worst assault against Christians in Pakistan's history, leaving, according to conservative estimates, at least 80 dead and more than 150 other parishioners wounded at a Peshawar church. In Vietnam, a communist government suppresses independent Protestants and other groups operating without government approval. The regime seeks to stop their growth through discrimination, violence, and forced renunciations of faith. Opinion: Extremism fuels abuse of Christians in Mideast . And in a host of post-Soviet countries, Christians in unregistered churches are seriously constrained. In several of these countries, including Uzbekistan, individuals are in prison for belonging to such churches. Abuses against Christians span the globe. A key reason is the confluence of two factors. First, there are more than 2 billion Christians in the world. Second, according to a Pew Research study, in one-third of all nations, containing 75% of the world's people, governments either perpetrate or tolerate serious religious freedom abuses. A six-year Pew study found that over six years, Christians were harassed in 151 countries, the largest of any group surveyed. In other words, given their enormous numbers and wide dispersion across nations, as well as the lack of freedom in many nations, it is no surprise how often Christians are persecuted. Christians are often regarded as alien because some are members of ethnic minorities or are perceived as being identified with Western interests. For despotic governments and religious extremists, Christianity is a dangerous source of competing authority, challenging their claims of absolute supremacy. The bottom line is that Christians are the proverbial canary in the coal mine. Wherever they are persecuted, the right to religious freedom for all is jeopardized. Wherever they are harassed or jailed, detained or discriminated against, tortured or murdered, governments perpetrate or tolerate abuses against others as well. The global persecution of Christians remains a serious indictment against governments and cultures for failing to protect a bedrock human right -- one that is enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was signed by nearly every nation, and subsequent covenants. We must continue to demand respect for that right, so that Sudanese mothers and others can follow the call of conscience and conduct their lives in peace.","Robert George: Sudanese mother's ordeal shows Christians still persecuted .

"Washington (CNN)  -- First lady Michelle Obama found herself at the center of an unlikely breast-feeding debate this week when three prominent conservative women criticized her for encouraging the creation of a ""nanny state."" Conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday asked Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, about an announcement by the Internal Revenue Service that the purchase of breast-feeding equipment would be considered a medical expense. Ingraham suggested that the first lady's advocacy of breast-feeding as a way to fight childhood obesity might have been ""coordinated"" with the IRS decision. Bachmann, a frequent critic of the Obama administration's policies, was quick to point out that the decision falls in line with the ""hard left"" agenda. ""I think this is very consistent with where the hard left is coming from,"" Bachmann said. ""For them, government is the answer to every problem. So government got us in this problem, and so they think government is going to get us out of the problem. ""I've given birth to five babies and I breast-fed every single one of these babies, and to think that the government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies. I mean, you want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny."" At an event in New York on Thursday, Sarah Palin joined the conversation -- although somewhat lightheartedly. ""No wonder Michelle Obama is telling people to breast-feed their babies, because the price of milk is rising so high,"" Palin joked, later warning reporters, ""That better not be the takeaway here."" The controversy stems from an IRS announcement earlier this month that breast pumps and other breast-feeding supplies would qualify for reimbursement as a medical expense under federal tax law. Previously, new mothers who set aside pre-tax money in health savings accounts, or who itemized their medical expenses at tax time, were prohibited from filing claims for money spent on breast-feeding equipment. As for the question of whether politics played any role in the IRS decision, spokespeople for the IRS and the Treasury Department said the decision was a legal one made by the IRS general counsel's office. Two days before the IRS announcement, Obama held a lunch with print reporters to celebrate the first anniversary of her ""Let's Move"" campaign to fight childhood obesity. When asked what plans she had for the campaign's second year, the first lady said, ""Breast-feeding. Kids who are breast-fed longer have a lower tendency to be obese."" Five months earlier, she used nearly identical language in a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus' annual legislative conference. ""Because it's important to prevent obesity early, we're also working to promote breast-feeding, especially in the black community, where 40% of our babies never get breast-fed at all, even in the first weeks of life,"" she said in September. ""And we know that babies that are breast-fed are less likely to be obese as children."" While the extent to which breast-feeding affects obesity is still unknown, some connection between the two is largely accepted. In 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics lobbied the IRS directly on the matter because of what it says are the ""diverse and compelling advantages for infants, mothers, families and society from breast-feeding and use of human milk for infant feeding."" More specifically, the academy's 2005 policy statement on breast-feeding found that ""some studies suggest decreased rates of ... overweight and obesity... in older children and adults who were breast-fed, compared with individuals who were not breast-fed."" A 2007 report on breast-feeding from Tufts-New England Medical Center found that ""there is an association between a history of breast-feeding and a reduction in the risk of being overweight or obese in adolescence and adult life,"" along with a variety of other health benefits. When asked if her problem with the IRS decision stemmed from a belief that breast-feeding shouldn't be in the same category as other medical expenses, Bachmann's office issued a statement that refocused her criticism on the federal tax code. ""The issue Americans have with the tax code isn't with one specific tax deduction,"" the statement said. ""Instead of social-engineering through select tax breaks, the government should scrap the current tax code and put all Americans on the same playing field."" The IRS has a fairly broad interpretation of the term ""medical expenses"" in the federal tax code, including wigs, acupuncture, artificial teeth, eyeglasses, contact lenses, certain home improvements, lead-based paint removal and television equipment for the hearing-impaired as deductible expenses. The cost of the IRS announcement is hard to estimate. Although the IRS provides broad instructions, individual insurance companies set their own guidelines for what is covered under health savings accounts. Additionally, only one-third of taxpayers itemize their deductions, and medical expenses need to exceed 7.5% of income in order to qualify for deduction. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation called the announcement a ""regulatory decision"" and has not prepared any public information on the issue. A 2010 cost analysis of low breast-feeding levels published in the American Academy of Pediatrics' medical journal Pediatrics found that if 90% of U.S. families followed medical recommendations to breast-feed for six months, ""The United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess (of) 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants.""","Obama promotes breast-feeding as way to limit obesity in children .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is two for two. The Republican from Janesville, Wisconsin, has successfully appeased House Republicans and engaged President Barack Obama in as little as 48 hours. A feat near impossible in these times of extreme partisanship. After laying low, Ryan swept into the budget battle crippling Washington with a plan to break the stalemate that has resulted in a government shutdown and no agreement so far on avoiding a possible U.S. debt default. With an op-ed and some persuading, he effectively moved demands by tea party aligned House Republicans on government funding and debt away from Obamacare. Op-ed doesn't mention Obamacare . Ryan responds to critics . That enabled House Republicans to propose an approach on Friday on the fiscal impasse that still hasn't met President Barack Obama's chief requirements, but hasn't scotched negotiations, either. Obama, Boehner agree all sides should keep talking . The Ryan Express chugged into the White House on Thursday with other House Republican leaders where he again waited for his opportunity to make an impact. In that meeting, progress seemed elusive as the two sides talked past each other. Then, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate stepped in. And the tone of the meeting changed. Key moment in White House meeting . Ryan conceded his side wouldn't get all it wanted while Obama asked how he could make something happen. Borger: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy . Republicans left the executive mansion expressing optimism, motivated to get to work. The White House admitted progress. But can Ryan push a deal over the finish line? He might be the person in the Republican Party to do it. Ryan leaves drama to others . In new book, Paul Ryan asks 'where do we go from here?' The Republican's chief negotiator, House Speaker John Boehner, has been unable -- or unwilling -- to reach a deal with the President amid the shutdown. Boehner and Obama have a fractured history of bitter negotiations. Both said afterward they felt burned by the other. Though they did talk by phone on Friday and agreed talks should go on. Ryan and Obama, on the other hand, have a completely different relationship. They were the fiercest of competitors during the presidential election. Even after, they remain political foes. ""Now that the president is implementing his agenda, we'll see that the benefits are far less than advertised,"" Ryan said at the National Review Institute in January, just days after Obama was inaugurated for the second time. While they spent months criticizing and deriding each other on the campaign trail, the mantra of politics is not personal seems to be true with these two. After Thursday's meeting, Republican Rep. Steve Southerland of Florida said they obviously respect each other. ""Paul and the President certainly have a pass through the last election and I think there's a great respect between them. And you can't make that up."" Southerland said, adding that ""the communication between Paul and the President, I think, was an important part of the conversation."" What's more, a White House official told CNN that the President viewed Ryan's op-ed as an opening and provided an opportunity for negotiations to open the government and lift the ceiling to take place. Ryan is steeped in fiscal matters as chairman of the House Budget Committee. The two politicians are only nine years apart, and while their positions on government spending are the role of government sit on opposite ends of the political spectrum, the have a bit in common. They both tap into the younger generation yet have an academic approach to their work. But most importantly, they seem to get along. CNN's Gloria Borger put it this way: Ryan and President Obama have a ""preexisting condition."" They have a prior relationship built on ideological differences not personal insult. ""They respect each other,"" Borger said. The last time they worked together was six months ago. During the last budget battle in March, Obama invited Ryan and his Democratic counterpart on the Budget Committee, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, to lunch. It was the first time Obama and Ryan had sat down together since the presidential race. Van Hollen said at the time that ""their relationship is developing."" One of their first public encounters, however, was mixed. When Obama invited himself to a Republican retreat in Baltimore in 2010, he took questions from the members while the television cameras rolled. Ryan introduced himself as ""a ranking member of the Budget Committee,"" indicating he wasn't sure the president knew who he was. After a back and forth about the budget, the president abruptly cut Ryan off, ending the discussion. Obama later complimented Ryan, saying, ""I think Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family."" Obama joked. ""And by the way, in case he's going to get a Republican challenge, I didn't mean it. Don't want to hurt you, man."" Fast forward to today. While they have been on different sides of nearly every debate, their relationship is not broken. And in today's Washington, that's saying a lot. Shutdown polls: No winners, but a bigger loser . Christie: 'If I was in the Senate right now, I'd kill myself' Coburn: Our spending addiction is out of control . Supporters stand by representatives, and government shutdown .

"(CNN) -- Sandy disrupted the lives of millions of people when it turned toward the Northeast United States and morphed into a superstorm. Most will return to their routine in time, but some lives are forever changed. Among those people, here are three of their stories: . Emergency: A desperate rush to save lives in a hospital . The doctors, nurses and staff at the New York University's Langone Medical Center acted fast Monday evening when their hospital basement flooded, cutting off power and the roof-top generators choked under Sandy's torrential rain. How you can help . Ventilators giving newborns breath failed, lights dimmed and elevators in the 15-floor hospital stopped. Dr. Andrew Brotman described a desperate rush to find other hospitals to take their 260 patients and ambulances to take them there along streets flooded by the superstorm. The hospital was empty of patients by 11 a.m. Tuesday, but Brotman and his colleagues were left with the challenge of reclaiming it from Sandy's fury. Read more about the fast-thinking efforts of the hospital staff . Rescue: Police chief aids hundreds who stayed behind . One of Ralph Verdi's jobs as police chief of Little Ferry, New Jersey, is to make sure residents heed warnings when danger approaches. But many of the 10,000 residents who rode out Irene last year -- the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey in 108 years -- might have seen Sandy as another overhyped storm. When Sandy lived up to her billing and flooded Little Ferry and two neighboring towns, Verdi's job became the rescue of residents trapped in the top floors and roofs of their homes by 6-feet-deep water. Rescuers under Verdi's direction scrambled to save a Bergen County woman who waved and shouted from her front porch. The chief has been too busy to count how many people have been whisked from rising water, but he knew it was in the hundreds -- with many others, some in pajamas and barefoot, calling for help. Read more about the rescue efforts in hard-hit New Jersey . Death: She answered the call of the sea and history . While the patients at Brotman's hospital and the people Verdi rescued all survived, Sandy took the life of Claudene Christian. Christian, 42, was living her dream as a deckhand on a replica of the historic HMS Bounty before giant waves, churned up by Hurricane Sandy, overtook the three-masted, 180-foot sailing vessel off North Carolina's coast early Monday. While 14 crew members made it to lifeboats, waves washed Christian, Capt. Robin Waldridge and another crew members overboard. The third crew member eventually swam to a lifeboat. The U.S. Coast Guard staged a daring helicopter rescue: They flew into the hurricane's outer bands and plucked the surviving crew members from two lifeboats. Christian's body was later pulled from the sea, but Waldridge remained missing Tuesday. Read more about the adventurous life of Claudene Christian . Elizabeth Cohen, Ashley Frantz and Thom Patterson contributed to this report.","Emergency: Dr. Andrew Brotman describes a frantic rush to evacuate 260 patients .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- At least 18 people have died and 44 people are missing after Typhoon Wipha pummeled the Tokyo area on Wednesday. The majority died after heavy rain triggered flooding and landslides that blocked roads and crushed houses in Oshima, a small island 120 km (75 miles) south of Tokyo, a local official said. One woman died in the Tokyo metropolitan area but the capital was largely spared significant damage. Forty one people were still missing on the offshore island as of Thursday morning local time. iReport: Heavy winds near Tokyo as Typhoon Wipha hits . More than 500 domestic and international flights were canceled at Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports and the national rail operator halted bullet train services in central and northern Japan.

"(Parenting) -- ""Now stay in bed and go to sleep,"" my husband, Bill, said as he hugged our 3-year-old son, Davey, good night. ""If you don't, I'm gonna talk in my troll voice all day tomorrow."" As dads spend more time with their kids, mothers sometimes feel they have to defend their territory. I smiled with pity at this poor, deluded man. Several times a night, Davey had been getting up to look at books. I had spent fruitless hours reasoning with him. No way could Bill's threat make a difference, especially since Davey found his troll-under-the-bridge act more funny than scary. But that night, Davey didn't get up once. In the morning he ran around crowing that he'd won and the troll couldn't come. Bill, unlike me, must have known that Davey needed to turn staying in bed into a game. Of course I was grateful. I was also just the tiniest bit jealous. Why hadn't I been the one with the great insight? Why couldn't I talk like a troll? It's comforting to know that I'm not the only mom who's had such moments. Plenty of us admit to everything from mild envy to full-blown resentment of our mates' parenting skills. And that makes us feel ungrateful: After all, we finally have something that mothers have wanted for generations: an extra pair of hands. Today's dads spend 21.7 hours a week on child care and related duties such as shopping and housework, up nine hours from 30 years ago, according to research by the University of Maryland. Which isn't to say that moms still don't handle the vast majority of kid-linked tasks -- a whopping 39 hours weekly. Still, our guys are doing more than their dads did. Fathers clip tiny toenails and baby-food coupons. They read bedtime stories and clothing labels. And while some of our own dads had no clue about how to change a diaper, our kids' dads often have fierce opinions on Luvs versus Huggies. Parenting: Secrets to a made-to-last marriage . We moms say we want our spouses to be do-it-all dads: We're forward-thinking women of the 21st century. Besides, if they did less, we couldn't possibly juggle our busy lives without going nuts. ""But we don't want them to take over,"" says Pyper Davis, a mother of two in Washington, D.C. ""We don't ever want to be pushed off that throne of being Mommy."" Jealousy and envy and ego, oh my! One reason we're possessive of the parental crown may be that, although society's changed, we still get traditional messages about women's roles. ""A lot of our mothers, our workplaces, our TV shows still tell us that moms should do most of the childcare,"" says Liz Park, Ph.D., a marriage and family therapist with three kids in Crownsville, Maryland. We moms can be good at taking such messages to heart. Parenting: Keeping score in the chore wars . ""For women, no matter how far along you are in your career or no matter how much of a feminist you consider yourself to be, at some level you're coming from an assumption that women are caretakers,"" says Heather Gerken of New Haven, Connecticut, a law professor and the mother of Anna, 6, and Ben, 2. ""When Anna was a baby, I would feel guilty about the time away from her,"" she says. And at home, sharing child care with her husband, she felt a little jealous that he was as central to Anna's life as she was. ""Now that I've gone through this twice, all I'd add is that the twinges of regret are overwhelmed by the joy of raising kids together. There's no other reason I can think of for that jealousy, except for the guilty, nagging feeling that you ought to be spending more time with your child."" Well, there are at least a few other reasons. The briefness of those precious early years, for one. ""When our son was a baby, Brian  gave him more of his baths,"" says Jessica Davis of Chicago. (Both names were changed.) She believed it was important for them to have such one-on-one moments, but ""I remember thinking a few times, 'I should take the bath with him!' Especially when they're babies, you're likely to think, 'I want this piece or that piece' because babies sleep so much and quality time with them is much more limited than with an older child."" Parenting's guide to kid sleep . Then there's the matter of love. Naturally, when our spouses spend extra time nurturing our children, the kids become extra attached. ""David* just adores his dad. He's his little shadow,"" Amy Conner* of Nashua, New Hampshire, says of her 3-year-old son. She understands the daddy worship; she thinks her husband, is ""more playful"" with David than she is. ""But at first it just hurt because I didn't feel that he loved me as much as [him],"" she admits. For some moms, like me, what hurts is a deep-seated notion that we should be better parents than our spouses -- more instinctive, more inventive, more in tune with our kids' needs. D'Anne Gleicher of Alameda, California, finds herself battling this idea when her daughter is sick. Because she can't get paid time off from her job as an attorney, her husband is usually the one to stay home with Ava, 8. ""I know he's very capable of caring for her, but I want to believe I'm better at it than he is -- even though I'm not. I think it's the whole 'I'm the mommy and I can fix anything.' It's almost like a savior thing."" Working mothers aren't the only ones who long to be saviors. Sarah Mock of Tualatin, Oregon, quit working as a high school teacher when her second daughter was born. ""When you've made this decision to stay home, you've given up this side of you where you can shine as your own person. Instead, you feel pressure to shine as a parent,"" she explains. Which can make it frustrating when your husband is as much fun with the kids as you are. ""Recently John helped them make their own version of Candy Land. I thought, 'Why can't I think of things that are more creative?' "" she says. ""It seems he's doing very well at work and then when he comes home he's doing very well with the kids, so it's like he's doing great everywhere and I'm running to keep up."" Who's the boss? If we're not careful, jealousy and insecurity can turn moms into control freaks. So says Park, a recovering control freak herself. ""With our first child, I was constantly asking my husband, 'Are you making sure he's getting his vegetables?' It feels good to make the decisions."" Trouble is, ""the more we control how dads do things, the less involved they want to be,"" Park says. A recent Ohio State University study of almost 100 couples with newborns backs her up: Researchers found that even dads who believed they should be highly involved in childcare shied away from doing things for their infant if Mom was very judgmental. Parenting: The truth about bonding . So Park recommends trying what she did with her husband and her son, Joe, now 11. ""I had to let go and let them have their own relationship -- he's a competent man! If Joe doesn't have a vegetable, who cares?"" When you find yourself hovering, Park suggests, leave the room. And if you feel compelled to share some crucial knowledge -- the latest food pyramid for toddlers, say -- try offering him some childcare lit. ""That way it's neutral. It's not like you're dictating to him how to do it,"" she says. Rethinking the rivalry . As for curbing the green-eyed monster, it comes down to discovering things you do well with your kids. When they're babies, simply breastfeeding them is something Dad can't do, and may be enough. Later on, try sharing your passions, from gardening to karate. It's also smart to take turns doing the fun stuff, like playing with the kids, as well as the non-fun stuff (say, disciplining them). Dad's giving the baths? Great. Make storytime yours, instead of moping. Parenting: Play list . Most important, moms say, remember how lucky your kids are to have two hands-on parents. Gleicher hopes that having a caring, involved father will one day spur her daughter to choose a guy with those qualities. ""She won't end up with somebody she doesn't respect,"" she says. Speaking of respect, adds Gerken, it's the best cure she's found yet for parental jealousy. ""Just to glory in your husband's abilities as a dad, I think, is key,"" she says. Next time Bill pulls off a child-care coup, I plan to be a model of admiration. I'll watch and learn. And I won't begrudge him his troll voice one bit -- as long as talking like SpongeBob can be mine, all mine. Try a FREE TRIAL issue of Parenting Magazine - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- Delicious cupcakes can make pretty much any situation sweet. So when NBA star LeBron James wanted to apologize to his neighbors in Cleveland for a recent bout of chaos he headed straight for the bakery. His decision to re-sign for his hometown Cavaliers franchise prompted an explosion of joy in the city, and an explosion of interest in him. News crews descended on his property in the Bath Township area of the city as well as fans after he announced he was coming home. And his way of saying sorry to his community was to enlist a local bakery to deliver the treats on behalf of the LeBron James Family Foundation. Contained within the boxes were six ""Just A Kid From Akron Cherry Cola"" cupcakes and six ""Homecourt Chocolate Chunk"" cupcakes. Attached to the cupcakes was a note that read: ""Dear friends, we know things have been hectic in our neighborhood these past few weeks and we are sorry for the chaos. ""We are so thankful to live in this wonderful community and we are so blessed to have understanding neighbors like you."" James is one of the NBA's biggest stars and left the Cavs in storm of controversy in 2010 when he announced he was signing for the Miami Heat in a televised special called ""The Decision."" A minority of Cavs fans still haven't forgiven James for walking out on his local team but he went on to win back-to-back NBA Championships with the Heat. His announcement on July 11 prompted a wave of euphoria in Cleveland, with ""Welcome Home"" banners plastered all over the city.","LeBron James sends cupcakes to his neighbors in Cleveland by way of apology .

"(CNN) -- When mixed martial arts fighters Ronda Rousey and Liz Carmouche stepped into the octagon Saturday night, they made history for women's sports. When Rousey stepped out, she was the champion in the first women's match in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Rousey and Carmouche met in the headline fight for the UFC 157 pay-per-view event in the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. Rousey used her signature armbar move to force Carmouche to submit late in the first round. ""The place was going nuts,"" Rousey said, ""and I'm glad it was a full house and I'm just honored to be a part of it."" Meet the UFC's first female superstar . Just having two women in the ring was a historic first for the UFC, which has been around since 1993. In 2011, UFC President Dana White said there would never be a women's MMA match in the UFC. At the time, he wasn't convinced people would pay to watch women fight. But then Rousey came along, and White changed his mind. ""I know I was the one talking smack about women's MMA,"" White said Saturday night. ""But I believed in this fight, and I believed in it enough to make it the main event."" Before becoming an MMA fighter, Rousey competed in judo. She took bronze at the 2008 Olympics, becoming the first American to win a women's judo medal since it became an Olympic sport in 1992. On Saturday, Rousey found herself in early trouble for the first time as an MMA fighter. Carmouche, a former U.S. Marine, mounted Rousey's back and tried a neck crank for several seconds before Rousey escaped. ""I wasn't worried, but I was very aware of the situation,"" Rousey said. Rousey recovered, responded with a series of strikes and eventually got Carmouche in an armbar. Carmouche quickly tapped out. ""It was a great fight,"" Carmouche said afterward. ""I thought I had it."" The armbar has been a reliable weapon for Rousey. She had won by armbar in all six of her previous MMA matches before joining UFC. And like Saturday, all six of those came in the first round. Rousey improved to 7-0 in her MMA career and made history by winning the first women's match in the UFC. Now, she just might become a household name. ""This is something really special and it might take a little to really sink in,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Author Doris Lessing, who won a Nobel Prize for her life of literature, died Sunday at age 94, her publisher, HarperCollins, said. The British author was best known for ""The Golden Notebook,"" which is considered by many critics to be one of the most important feminist novels ever written. Lessing ""passed away peacefully"" at her London home early Sunday, according to HarperCollins spokeswoman Susanna Frayn. Lessing began writing at 7, which she said was not the result of inspiration, but her innate capacity. ""I was born to write, as other people are born to paint ... that's all,"" she said. ""Writers tell stories. This is what we do."" Lessing was awarded the Nobel prize in literature in 2007 at the age of 88. The Swedish academy called her ""the epicist of the female experience"" who had ""subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny."" ""She is survived by her daughter Jean and granddaughters Anna and Susannah,"" the publisher said. ""Her family has asked for privacy at this time."" Lessing was born to British parents in Persia (now Iran). Much of her fiction was based on her experiences growing up in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where she moved as a young child. Her mother raised her on storytelling, reading stories that Lessing gave her own spin when sharing them with her younger brother. These childhood stories evolved into the powerful fiction that made up her 50 books. Lessing, who dropped out of a school in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, when she was just 13, developed her writing skills by reading the works of Dickens, Tolstoy, D.H. Lawrence and Dostoevsky. ""I educated myself by reading,"" she said. In her Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Lessing spoke of the desperate struggle for knowledge of people in some developing countries. ""Not long ago a friend who had been in Zimbabwe told me about a village where people had not eaten for three days, but they were still talking about books and how to get them, about education."" She left home at 15 to work as a nursemaid but also started writing stories and later sold two of them to magazines in South Africa. Her first novel, ""The Grass is Singing,"" was in her suitcase when she moved to London in 1949, the HarperCollins statement said. Published in 1950, it examines the tension between oppressed black Africans and white colonials. Lessing ""broke new ground"" in 1962 with ""The Golden Notebook,"" the publisher said. HarperCollins editor Nicholas Pearson called it ""a handbook to a whole generation."" ""But her many books have spoken to us in so many various ways,"" Pearson said. ""Doris has been called a visionary and, to be in her company, which was a privilege I had as her editor towards the end of her writing life, was to experience something of that. Even in very old age she was always intellectually restless, reinventing herself, curious about the changing world around us, always completely inspirational. We'll miss her hugely."" ""She was a wonderful writer with a fascinating and original mind; it was a privilege to work for her and we shall miss her immensely,"" longtime friend and agent Jonathan Clowes said Sunday. ""Doris Lessing was a one of the great writers of our age,"" HarperCollins UK CEO Charlie Redmayne said. ""She was a compelling storyteller with a fierce intellect and a warm heart who was not afraid to fight for what she believed in. It was an honor for HarperCollins to publish her.""

"(CNN) -- I've been tasked with the assignment of following President Clinton on two legs of his Southeast Asia trip for his charity the Clinton Foundation. We join him and his large entourage in Hanoi, Vietnam, where he's visiting an AIDS orphanage about an hour's drive outside the city. Despite the heat and humidity, the president walks around the facility, speaking to local staff through a translator, commending them on their tireless work. His foundation provides tuberculosis medicine for the children infected with HIV/AIDS and it's saving lives. The children perform a dance for their distinguished visitor -- and the president can't wipe the smile off his face. ""I was watching them dancing and they gave me a little poster where each of them wrote what their dreams are for the future,"" explains Clinton, who is clearly moved by what he has just witnessed. ""When we came here first in 2006 every one of the children was HIV positive. They would have eventually died from AIDS. They had no future, so to see them now healthy and alive it's just amazing."" Clinton says he decided at a very early age that he wanted to dedicate his life to public service. Meeting President John F. Kennedy at the White House as a student in 1963 and listening to Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech the same year was a life changing experience that he says firmly placed him on his path. I ask if his charity gives him a sense a purpose. ""Oh yeah,"" he says in his folksy southern drawl. ""I like it because it's personal flesh and blood. You're not just talking in abstract policy terms. You are actually seeing the lives of people change and it's one of the great things about the life I have now. ""I loved my life in politics -- I loved it. But the difference now is I can see the personal human implications of the decisions we are making."" ""And then you see results -- there they are. Those kids dancing -- I wouldn't take the world for that. I'm going to have a film of that and I'm going to have that all my life now."" MH17, Gaza, and the rise of China . He speaks with emotion and it's more than just being at the orphanage. He just found out that some of the people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 when it went down over Ukraine were due to attend the AIDS conference he will soon be speaking at in Melbourne, Australia. ""It's awful. I mean those people are really in a way martyrs to the cause. We need to wait to make any definitive statements until we know exactly what happened but it was sickening -- thinking about those people being knocked out of the sky. It's pretty tough."" We discuss world issues such as the Gaza offensive and the ongoing Middle East conflict -- a conflict he tried to resolve while in the White House. He believes it's up to Israel to clinch a peace deal with the Palestinians, but I ask him if that's realistic considering the current state of war. ""Well I think it's possible partly because you get tired of doing the same thing over and over again and getting the same result -- it's crazy. I hope that this will lead to a little soul searching and trying to get back to the baseline issue of a peace agreement."" Our conversation moves on to the isolationist policy now being adopted by the U.S. after its long wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I ask if America is still the world's policeman and he replies: ""I don't think we have been the world's policeman since the end of the Vietnam War."" ""But I do think we have been more active and less active over time. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were highly costly to us. They cost us a lot in lives and wounds and national treasure. We have a lot of work to do within the U.S. to rebuild our economic strength. But I think we have been and should be active in the world."" On the issue of a rising China that is becoming more assertive in its foreign policy, especially in the South China Sea, he says he is ""concerned."" ""The Chinese obviously have a legitimate interest in and right to try to develop a natural capacity to have enough natural resources to continue to grow their economy. But I think it's a big mistake for them to be seen as big footing the whole region. ""Historically that's not been their role and wherever they have done it they have wound up paying a price bigger than the benefit they got. This whole thing is still playing out so this where we ought to be working for the best and preparing for the worst."" Hillary 2016? Towards the end of the interview I ask the question on everyone's lips -- will Hillary run for President in 2016. He laughs. It's a question he's been asked a thousand times and will continue to be asked until his wife makes an official announcement. ""I don't know,"" he explains. ""I think she really needs some time to think this through. We reached a point in our life when we think you shouldn't run for office if you don't have a clear idea of what you can do and a unique contribution you can make you can outline that. ""So much of politics is background noise and we don't need the background noise anymore. I am proud of her and whatever she does is fine with me. I'll support what she does."" I get the feeling he wants his wife -- who he met in the spring of 1971 in a library at Yale Law School -- to run. It would be history in the making -- America's first female president and the first husband and wife to ever be leaders of the free world. ""It's a decision that only she can make and I'm not going to try and jump the gun, and if she decides not to do it I'll be happy too,"" he says. ""We have a lot of good years left I hope regardless. So we will do whatever happens.""","CNN's Anna Coren interviews former U.S. President Bill Clinton during his Southeast Asia trip .

"(CNN) -- In photos released Sunday, the two dads are embracing. Theirs is a meeting wrought with profound grief, spurred by shared tragedy. Peter Rodger's 22-year-old son, Elliot Rodger, went on an armed rampage in late May in Isla Vista, California, killing six people. One of them was Richard Martinez's 20-year-old son, Christopher Martinez, a University of California, Santa Barbara student. Christopher Martinez was in a deli where Elliot Rodger fired several rounds, police said. Rodger also killed three men in his apartment and two women outside a sorority house, police have said, and drove wildly in his black BMW, shooting at pedestrians and injuring some. The BMW collided with other cars before coming to a stop, authorities said. When officers approached, they said they found Rodger dead of a gunshot wound to the head. At the time, Richard Martinez faced television cameras, tearfully and angrily demanding more gun control. ""Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the (National Rifle Association),"" he said. ""They talk about gun rights; what about Chris' right to live? When will this insanity stop?"" On June 1, the two fathers met. The images of them together were released to mark Father's Day by the advocacy firm Rally.

"Canon City, Colorado (CNN) -- Life begins at conception, according to the Catholic Church, but in a wrongful death suit in Colorado, a Catholic health care company has argued just the opposite. A fetus is not legally a person until it is born, the hospital's lawyers have claimed in its defense. And now it may be up to the state's Supreme Court to decide. Lori Stodghill was 28 weeks pregnant when she went to the emergency room of St. Thomas More Hospital in Canon City vomiting and short of breath, according to a court document. She went into cardiac arrest in the lobby. ""Lori looked up at me, and then her head went down on her chest,"" said her husband, Jeremy Stodghill. Before and after Roe v. Wade . She died at age 31. Her unborn twin boys perished with her. That was New Year's Day 2006. Stodghill, left behind to raise their then-2-year-old daughter alone, sued the hospital and its owner, Catholic Health Initiatives, for the wrongful deaths of all three. After about two years of litigation, defense attorneys for the hospital and doctors entered an argument that shocked the widower. They said that under state law, an embryo is not person until it is born alive, according to court documents. The Stodghills' twins were deceased when they were removed from their mother's lifeless body. ""I didn't even get to hold them,"" Jeremy Stodghill said. ""I have an autopsy picture. That's all I've got."" The court agreed with the argument, and Stodghill lost the suit. The court also ruled against Stodghill in the case of his wife for other legal reasons. The hospital and doctors then sued him for over $118,000 legal fees and attempted to garnish his wages, according to a legal document filed on his behalf. The defendants offered to forget the fees if Stodghill dropped his appeal. He refused and filed for bankruptcy to avoid having to pay the claim, which he says he can't afford as he struggles to raise his now-9-year-old daughter, Libby. Stodghill has petitioned the Colorado Supreme Court to hear his case, and he'd like to hear from the Catholic Church. Representatives of the Catholic bishops of Colorado declined to comment on the legal proceedings, but said they will review the litigation and Catholic Health Initiatives' practices ""to ensure fidelity and faithful witness to the teachings of the Catholic Church."" Catholic Health Initiatives would not speak to CNN on camera, but said in a statement, ""In this case... as Catholic organizations, (we) are in union with the moral teachings of the Church."" Stodghill wears a tattoo on his chest with his unborn sons' footprints, their names and the words ""our sons."" He wants the church and his state to see them the same way.

"(CNN) -- When David Green, 22, graduated from Western Washington University in December, he applied for dozens of jobs, from fast food to secretarial positions -- sending out more than 50 resumes and scoring only two interviews in the process. The organization Reach to Teach has seen a 100 percent increase in applications to teach English in Asia. ""It was horrible. I couldn't find anything,"" said Green, a history and social studies major. With few employment options in his hometown of Bellingham, Washington, Green applied to teach English in a South Korean middle school through Reach to Teach, an organization that assists college graduates with finding teaching positions in Asia. Green, who counts trips to Canada as his only experience abroad, will be leaving for Seoul on March 20 for one year. ""I am scared. I've only had one major breakdown so far, ... but I'm really excited about being on my own ... somewhere completely new where I know absolutely no one,"" he said. Like Green, many recent college graduates are searching for alternatives to jumping into the job market in the face of the recession. An increasing number of young Americans are searching out paid positions teaching English in countries like South Korea, Japan, China and Spain as a means to expand their horizons and weather the economic doldrums. Mitch Gordon, director of school relations for Reach to Teach, said his organization has seen more than a 100 percent increase in applications in the last six months, with 3,784 applicants compared to 1,488 during the same six-month period last year. The application system doesn't track U.S. applicants separately, but Gordon estimates more than 70 percent are from the United States. The program also has seen a significant increase in current teachers extending their teaching contracts abroad for an extra year. Gordon said he believes the recession is the primary reason for the steady increase in applicants, and the increase has made the program more competitive. ""We have more people for the same number of positions,"" he said. ""We're able to raise our standards a little bit more."" Japan's JET (Japan Exchange and Teaching) program also has recorded a jump in applicants. For 2009 positions, the Japanese government-sponsored program has received 15 percent more U.S. applications than last year, according to program coordinator Joelle Williams. The program attributes the jump in part to the economic situation and the tough job market in the United States. JET officials also noticed that more applications arrived farther in advance of the deadline this year. 'Taking control of my own life' Ayana Hosten, a spring 2008 graduate of Claremont McKenna College, has been working as an English teaching assistant in Madrid, Spain, since February through a program organized by the Ministry of Education of Spain. Her contract is ending in June and she is already looking to extend her stay for another year. Spain's Ministry of Education has announced more than 1,200 openings for U.S. and Canadian ""cultural ambassadors"" for the 2009-2010 school year. Grants provide the teaching assistants with about $900 a month for the eight-month stay. Teachers are responsible for their own lodging and transportation costs, and applicants should have a functional knowledge of Spanish. For Hosten, 22, going to Spain was a way to escape a rough job market that left her without a full-time job between graduating and applying for the teaching program. ""After being unemployed for three months, it really started to affect me emotionally, which was something I was not prepared for,"" Hosten said in an e-mail. ""Going to Spain was me taking control of my own life and pretty much just wiping my hands of the financial crisis."" Travis Lee, a University of Tennessee alumnus who is in a teaching program sponsored by a university in Wuhan, China, began teaching English in September 2008, originally intending to stay for one year. ""Now I'm thinking of extending my stay for another semester or full year, and if I really like it and can't find a job in America, who knows?"" Lee said in an e-mail. He said the economy and the tight job market have been a big influence in his consideration to stay in China. Trying another path . For many recent graduates, working abroad is becoming a more secure option than searching for a job in the United States. Most teaching programs in other countries will provide teachers with a salary and health insurance, and some programs in Asia will even provide free housing, said Jake Hanin, a teach abroad program coordinator for the Council on International Education Exchange, who also has noticed an increase in applications. For programs in Asia, fluency in English is usually the most important qualification for teaching jobs, and many do not require applicants to have previous teaching experience, Hanin said. Lee's salary in China is approximately $555 per month, which he says is more than enough to live comfortably in Wuhan. The university also provides him with a rent-free apartment and pays his electric bill. ""We make twice what a Chinese teacher with a bachelor's makes and we do half the work,"" Lee said in an e-mail. But for Lee and many other recent graduates, working abroad is primarily about having once-in-a-lifetime experiences in a completely different culture. ""You have plenty of time to get a career, start a family, and follow that path,"" Lee said. ""Why not try another path first? What have you got to lose?"" CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Economy is prompting some recent grads to delay entering U.S. workforce .

"(CNN) -- You've heard that classic mixology before: ""Bond went into the lobby bar to gather his thoughts and ordered a vodka martini, explaining to the barman the best way to achieve the effect of vermouth without diluting the vodka too much. Ice in the shaker, add a slurp of vermouth, pour out the vermouth, add the vodka, shake well, strain into a chilled glass, add a slice of lemon peel, no pith."" Immortalized on the big screen and in Ian Fleming's 14 James Bond books, practically everyone knows the British superspy and his drink of choice. But this drink -- this Bond -- was written not by Fleming, but by author and screenwriter William Boyd. He was asked by Fleming's estate to write a new Bond novel; ""Solo"" hit shelves this month. In ""Solo,"" Boyd took a retro approach, choosing to set his story in 1969 at the height of the Cold War. While there are plenty of cocktails, fast cars and alluring women, Boyd says he wanted to take Bond back to his roots. In Boyd's version of Bond, there are no gadgets, no gimmickry, no flying cars and no villain with dreams of world domination. In the novel, Bond has just turned 45, and is now a veteran of MI6. He's sent to a West African nation in the middle of a bloody civil war. His mission: quash the rebels and covertly help the established regime. While there, Bond is forced to go ""solo"" on a dangerous, self-appointed mission of revenge. This Bond is still stylish, dresses impeccably, drives a Jensen Interceptor II, even knows how to whip up his own salad dressing (the recipe is included in the novel's only footnote) but Boyd's version is realistic, gritty and close to the original Fleming. We spoke to Boyd about his take on the iconic character. Fast facts: William Boyd . Age: 61 . Early life: Boyd was born in Accra, Ghana. He grew up there and in Nigeria. For fans of: James Bond, spy novels, literary thrillers. What else he has written: 20 best-selling novels and 15 films including ""Any Human Heart,"" ""A Good Man in Africa"" and ""Waiting for Sunrise."" Special honors: He was named a commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005. Fun fact: Boyd has worked on films with three actors who portrayed James Bond: Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. Five questions for William Boyd . CNN: How were you approached to write a new James Bond novel? Boyd: It just came out of the blue. It's not something you're even aware you're being considered for or discussed. I just got a call from my literary agent one day saying stand by for this: Would you be interested in writing a new James Bond novel? I thought about it and said almost immediately, yes, please. Then the process gets a bit more involved. You have to meet the Fleming family and I had questions for them and they had questions for me. There was a kind of interview and after that I officially got the job. It's something that just came right out of left field and took me completely by surprise. It was a treat. I took it very seriously but I had great fun. It was a wonderful thing to be asked to do. CNN: Was there any difficulty in taking on an iconic character like Bond? Boyd: For some people there might be, but I had written two spy novels so I was very familiar with the demands of the genre. I've written a film about Charlie Chaplin. I wrote a six-hour miniseries about Hitler. So taking on a book about James Bond, somebody that's present in the minds of millions of other people, didn't seem as strange to me as it might have been to other writers. It was a challenge but it was a highly intriguing one. So I approached it very much in that spirit. I was also given a very free hand by the Fleming family. If they had wanted me to write to a formula or a pastiche of Ian Fleming I wouldn't have done it. They really let me write in my own voice, invent my own storyline with a very hands-off, benign approach. So it wasn't a daunting prospect, more an enticing one. Shaken and stirred on the slopes: The greatest Bond scene ever made? CNN: You've written about Ian Fleming before, so were you already a fan of his? Boyd: It was more of a curiosity. I became quite curious about Fleming as a certain sort of Englishman. He was a close acquaintance of Evelyn Waugh, a writer who I've read every word he's written. I'm equally curious about Waugh but the two men didn't like each other at all. I began to wonder why this should be and started to investigate Fleming's personality and his particular nature, which I think in some ways is very English. I think he wanted to die, which is what's so odd. He was a misanthrope and maybe depressive. He was only 56 when he eventually died but he was in a hurry to get to the grave as he said himself. So I was very intrigued by him as a sort of case study. In many ways he seemed rather similar to Evelyn Waugh and it was odd that the two didn't like each other at all. So the Fleming curiosity was certainly there, I had put him in as a character in my novel, ""Any Human Heart."" I don't know if the Fleming family was aware of this, but I was certainly clued up about their famous ancestor. CNN: Why did you choose to set the novel in 1969 and largely in Africa? Boyd: I wanted very much to set the novel in the era of Bond. The novels appeared between 1953 and 1964 and if Fleming had looked after himself a bit better he could have conceivably written a novel in 1969. So it's very much that world that Bond the character would know and it's also a world of no mobile phones, the Cold War is raging, there's no Internet, computers are fairly elementary, it's classic spying. I very much wanted to exploit all those echoes and illusions and textures. I thought I would take him to Africa, because I said to the Fleming family when I met them that I wanted to write a very realistic Bond novel, a real spy novel about a real human being, a real spy on a real mission. So I thought about my own background, my own upbringing. I'd been living in Nigeria in the late 1960s when the Nigerian civil war was on and it had a profound effect on me. I thought I'll send Bond off to a nasty little war in Africa. You can't get more down and dirty and gritty than that. So I paralleled the events of the novel pretty closely on the events of the Nigerian civil war. But in the interests of making Bond real and making his mission real, I didn't want to write anything with too much gimmickry or gadgetry involved, or fantastical plots or organizations wanting to take over the world. I wanted it to be a highly realistic novel. CNN: Is there another character from literature you would like to take on? Boyd: When I come across a character I'm intrigued by, I often write a short story about this character. I fictionalize aspects of their life. I wrote a short story about Brahms, for example, because I'm a great lover of his music. I wrote a short story about Chekov for the same reason. In my novel, ""Any Human Heart,"" I was able to have my fictional character bump into all sorts of real people who either intrigue, infuriate or fascinate me. I guess I'm quite curious about Ernest Hemingway as a character. I'm not a great admirer of his novels but I'm very curious about him as an individual. So it might be quite stimulating to revisit Hemingway through the filter of fiction and see what I make of him the way I've been able to do with these other characters. I'm currently writing a miniseries about Lawrence of Arabia, another deeply complex, strange man but because it's a drama I'm able to move away from the restrictions of documentary fact and present my imagined portrait of T.E. Lawrence, which is a very fascinating prospect. So Hemingway, I keep reading every book that comes out about him. There's obviously something about him in the same way as Fleming that intrigued me. So watch this space, maybe it will happen. 10 hotels featured in James Bond movies .","Before his death, Ian Fleming wrote 14 books about iconic British spy James Bond .

"(CNN) -- When Tahani Hamdan booked her trip to the Middle East, the 25-year-old was excited to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan with her family for the first time. Born and raised in Houston, Hamdan normally feels safe making the trip to the Middle East. But the recent violence has made the Palestinian-American fearful for her safety, even though she's visited several times. ""I feel like I'm putting my life in jeopardy by going,"" she said. Hamdan left Houston on July 19, and after two days of flight delays, she arrived in Jordan and drove into the West Bank, where she's staying. She said she wishes she could have postponed her trip, but she doesn't know when she'll see her family again. ""I have multiple sclerosis as well as rheumatoid arthritis, so I don't know if I'll be physically able to visit again if I don't go this summer,"" Hamdan said. The violent conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants has intensified this month after the June killings of three Israeli teenagers and a Palestinian teen. The conflict has made for tense and scary times for Israelis and Palestinians, with rocket attacks and airstrikes occurring daily. On July 16, an Israeli strike killed four children playing on a Gaza beach. After a temporary cease-fire, the situation escalated further the next night when a ground operation started with Israeli tanks entering Gaza. Over the weekend, the fighting continued to intensify, with the increasing death toll of Palestinian militants, Israeli soldiers and civilians from both sides. Some travelers are questioning their safety and reevaluating their scheduled trips, but others remain committed to going. Israel warns it may further expand Gaza operation . Jennifer Tapiero has waited her whole life to visit Israel, and the 25-year-old talk radio host finally was about to embark on July 13. Her plans changed that day, when family members in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem called and told Tapiero and her sister not to come. With increasing rocket strikes, they didn't believe the women would be safe there, even though they were traveling with an experienced tour group. ""We canceled right before the plane was supposed to take off,"" said Tapiero, a Los Angeles resident. ""Our family was so worried for us."" While Tapiero is deeply saddened by the events of the past few days, she's also glad she didn't go, knowing that her safety couldn't be guaranteed. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines responded to the increased violence last week, waiving fees to reschedule certain flights to Tel Aviv. More than the 3.5 million people visited Israel in 2013, a record, according to the country's Central Bureau of Statistics (PDF). Before the recent violence, the bureau reported a record 1.4 million visitors for the first half of 2014, but the latest outbreak is expected to affect the numbers. Anywhere from 15% to 25% of vacationers cut their stays short because of the violence as of Tuesday, when CNN spoke with Yossi Fatael, managing director of the Israel Tourist and Travel Agents Association. Fatael said that about 25% of travelers were canceling upcoming trips. Even if the conflict eases over the next few days, Fatael expects to see summer bookings down about 30%. He predicts that it will take several months for the country's travel industry to recover. With a trip scheduled for September, would-be first-time visitor Eli Arias of Los Angeles feels unsure about his travel plans. Although he was aware of the tension in the area when he booked his trip two months ago, he didn't think the violence would escalate to this point. He was planning to travel alone, and his family in the United States has expressed concern over his going. At this point, he's undecided about the trip but knows he still wants to ""experience this beautiful country."" What makes Jerusalem so sacred? Taglit-Birthright Israel, a group that provides free educational trips to Israel for Jewish teens, said that at the beginning of the crisis, it was seeing 5% to 10% daily cancellations. That percentage had increased this week, but there's been no further increase since Thursday's events. However, the group doesn't think it will affect travelers once the conflict dies down. ""It's only natural to expect a small drop in arrival at such times,"" said Taglit-Birthright CEO Gidi Mark. On Monday, the U.S. State Department updated its February travel warning for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, recommending that travelers postpone all nonessential travel to the Israel and the West Bank. The warning also urges citizens to avoid all travel to Gaza, saying it is ""under the control of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization."" In the United Kingdom, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is advising against all travel to Gaza and said it was unable to offer consular assistance to citizens heading to the region. The office also recommended avoiding nonessential travel to areas of Israel within 25 miles of the Gaza border. (That would not include Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.) The Australian and Canadian governments have also issued alerts advising against travel to Gaza. The violence isn't enough to dissuade some travelers. Eboni Johnson of New Orleans has planned a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in November, and she still plans to go with a religious tour group. For Johnson, it's not just a vacation. It's a spiritual awakening in which she'll experience the places she reads about every day in the Bible. ""I truly believe Israel is chosen and special to God,"" Johnson said. ""I'm not concerned about what is going on, because I trust that God would keep me from all harm."" For Larry Ritter, president of New Jersey-based Israel Tour Connection, the impact has been mixed. ""We had tour groups there when the violence broke out last week,"" said Ritter, whose travel company offers religious and general tours of Israel. ""They all stayed until the end of their scheduled trip."" Travelers scheduled for tours with the company aren't feeling so secure. The company had groups scheduled to leave on Sunday, and Ritter expected about half of the 35 tour group participants to cancel. Most were likely to be families traveling with children, he said. On Monday, Ritter's company announced that it had put together a last-minute solidarity mission to the country. He'll be leaving Saturday, along with 40 rabbis, priests and pastors who simply want to show support for Israeli citizens. Ritter said that Thursday's escalation of the conflict caused an influx of sign-ups. ""There's an emotional connection between Israel and people that transcends personal safety,"" Ritter said. Jerusalem's five most contested sites . Other companies are experiencing different results. Offering a range of trips for Muslims, Christians, Jewish and interfaith travelers, Virginia-based MEJDI Tours hasn't had any cancellations as of Friday morning, said office manager Haley Douglass. ""Many of the phone calls and e-mails I have received are from travelers asking about the situation, hoping that their tour is not canceled,"" she said. An Islamic-focused tour of Israel scheduled for late July with Ahalan Olympus Ltd. was canceled a few days after the crisis started, according to owner and general manager Kfir Schwarz. Because of the holy month of Ramadan, very few Muslim tourists are traveling anyway, he said. It's normal for all travelers to feel some sort of anxiety during times of violence, says Peter Vlitas of Protravel International in New York. The travel agent's job is to keep customers up to date on the situation. ""We don't wait for them to come to us,"" Vlitas said. ""We reach out to our clients and advise them of State Department and UK travel advisories, and present them with their facts and options."" Abram Murray of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is glad he took his first trip to Israel and the West Bank in May through a tour group. Although he didn't notice any violence during his visit, and the places he visited on the West Bank were far from the current conflict zone, he's not sure he'd feel safe traveling to Israel now. ""With tensions and fighting escalating these days, I'm glad that I went when I did,"" Murray said. ""I'm not sure if I'd want to go over there right now.""

""The Winston was the culmination of multiple parties,"" says Joel Heffernan, executive mixologist at Crown Melbourne's Club 23 bar and creator of the cocktail. ""The Folle Branche grape variety used to make the vintage cognac doesn't exist anymore. I wanted to pay homage to that grape.

There's more wining and dining at astronomical prices before a visit to New York's Algonquin Hotel Times Square, Autograph Collection, and a thirst-quenching $20,000 diamond-filled martini, served by the man with the steadiest hands in the city, food and beverage director Alex Aubry. ""Awaiting you when you arrive back in London will be the ultimate goody bag,"" says Warmington.

"(CNN) -- Kindergartens in three Chinese provinces are accused of giving prescription drugs to children without their parents' knowledge, according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. The drugs were given to prevent the children from getting sick in order to boost attendance, the news agency reported. The schools get paid based on attendance. The scandal started last week in one kindergarten in the city of Xi'an and has now spread to several in the country, prompting China's education and health ministries to require its local branches to check all kindergartens and primary schools for illegally administered drugs, according to the Global Times newspaper. Almost 2,000 children who attended the suspected kindergartens are receiving medical attention as some reported side effects from the medication, such as dizziness, stomachaches, leg pains and genital swelling, Xinhua said. In an article Tuesday, state media called it a ""crisis of confidence in kindergarten managers."" It said that many parents are fed up with private kindergartens ""which are poorly funded, poorly managed and frequently in a bad state of repair."" China's preschools have been riddled with what the state media called ""a long history of avoidable problems"" such as food safety and physical abuse. Some angry parents of the affected kindergartens rallied in front of the facilities and local government buildings. First incidents . Last week, Xinhua reported that a parent accused a kindergarten in Xi'an, in Shaanxi province of administering an antiviral drug to children. One parent told the Global Times that several kindergarteners had been complaining about stomachaches or night sweats. When their parents took them to the doctors, they found abnormal results in urine and blood tests -- traces of possible damage to the kidney or liver, the parent told Chinese media. The doctors were stumped over the diagnosis. Local authorities said that the administrators at the Fengyun Lanwan Kindergarten had given children moroxydine ABOB, a medicine which can cause side effects such as sweating, loss of appetite and hypoglycemia since 2008. The prescription drug is used to treat the flu. ""Teachers told my child the pill was good for him but should be kept secret,"" one parent, identified as Zhang told Xinhua. ""They have been taking it for nearly three years."" Another kindergarten in Xi'an, called Hongji Xincheng has also been suspected of following the same practice, Xinhua said. Together, the two kindergartens have 1,455 students. Little known about drug in question . Dr. Nelson Lee, professor of infectious diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said not much is known about moroxydine ABOB. The drug was produced in the 1950s and could have some antiviral effects such as suppressing the flu virus, but there are no reports or clinical trials in English.This means doctors know little about how helpful or harmful it could be. For kindergartens to administer such a drug with little research or data is something Lee said he has never heard of. ""I think the most effective, suitable way to prevent flu infection is to ask the students to get flu vaccines every year. It's the proven, safest way to prevent flu, rather than taking long-term medication with unknown side effects and efficacy."" Similar incident in Jilin province . Days later, another kindergarten came under scrutiny, this time in the northeastern province of Jilin. Investigators told Xinhua that a branch of the Fanglin Kindergarten in Jilin City had given some children the same drug -- moroxydine ABOB -- to prevent them from catching colds and infectious diseases. The kindergarten staff were reported to have said they were using the drug to improve attendance. Three administrators have been arrested, according to Xinhua. The kindergarten's 375 students are getting checked at hospitals, it reported. Latest incident in Hubei province . The parents of children who had been attending Xingang Kindergarten in Hubei province, had become suspicious, telling Xinhua that their children developed symptoms such as stomachaches, irregular heartbeats, itching, vomiting and dizziness. Kindergarteners told their parents that they were forced to swallow ""white, bitter-tasting pills."" The principal and vice principal of the kindergarten ""admitted to having fed pupils an over-the-counter anti-fever drug and vitamins to boost their immunity and improve attendance,"" reported Xinhua on Tuesday. The kindergarten, located in Yichang City, was shut and about 200 students are receiving medical check-ups, according to China's state media. Authorities are looking into where the schools got their supply of prescription medication.","State media: Several kindergartens in China gave prescription drugs to kids .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- As a medical student six years ago, Benjamin LaBrot would travel to remote areas of Africa and treat patients with supplies he could carry in his backpack. But one time, while treating Maasai villagers in Tanzania, LaBrot's supplies ran out. He was devastated. ""I got back into the car ... having felt like I had just done so little ... and I cried for 20 minutes,"" LaBrot said. The farming village was extremely poor, and many people were in desperate need of medical attention. ""I essentially decided right then and there that I was going to come back, either to that village or to another one of the hundreds of thousands of villages just like it all over the world ... and I would bring more help. I would bring a bigger backpack."" Today, LaBrot's ""backpack"" can carry 20,000 pounds of medical supplies. The American started Floating Doctors, a seafaring medical group that provides free health care for people in remote coastal regions. In the last two years, LaBrot and his team of volunteers have traveled on ""The Southern Wind,"" a 76-foot-long refurbished ship, to treat nearly 13,000 patients in Haiti, Honduras and Panama. ""Most of the communities that we serve are communities that have fallen through the cracks because they're too small, they're too far away (or) they're too hard to get to,"" said LaBrot, 36. Typically, LaBrot and his team will anchor at the coast and then use a smaller craft or vehicle to reach remote areas. In some cases, they'll walk miles to reach small villages in need. ""The end result is that you end up in a community which may never have been visited by modern health care providers,"" he said. ""I'll find patients who have never seen a doctor before in their lives."" Approximately one-half of the world's population lives in rural areas, according to the World Health Organization, and most of them usually lack trained health care workers. Oftentimes, these communities don't have electricity or running water, either. LaBrot first steered ""The Southern Wind"" to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, delivering 20,000 pounds of medical supplies, 80 sheets of plywood and 2,500 pounds of tin roofing. He and his team then stayed in the country for three months treating patients. They had no money for personal transportation, so they walked to and from the clinic where they worked. It endeared them, LaBrot said, to the Haitian people. ""You gain extraordinary acceptance by your patients when you walk through the same mud that they do,"" he said. During the three months the group spent living and working in Haiti, it operated 25 mobile clinics, treated 2,500 patients, and rebuilt schools with the tin roofing they brought. LaBrot said the entire undertaking cost only $5,000, including the fuel to get to Haiti from Miami. It helps that the medical supplies are donated by groups like Direct Relief International, but using a ship is also a very cost-effective way of working. ""You can house people onboard,"" LaBrot said. ""On a ship, you can generate your own water, you can generate your own power. And those power sources can be from renewable energy sources."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . LaBrot originally envisioned Floating Doctors to be a provider of ""brigade medicine."" He imagined himself and other volunteers dropping into hard-to-reach areas for short durations. But Haiti changed that. There, LaBrot saw the need to stay put for a while and make a real impact. ""The benefits that you can create if you're there longer are extraordinary,"" he said. ""In Haiti, we learned after two weeks you just start to know your way around. After a month, you have some sense of the health care ecology of the area. After two months, you can really start calling on the community to assist you in your work."" In addition to providing medical care, Floating Doctors enlists locals to help with smaller-scale projects that address specific community needs. The group has installed water filtration systems, built ramps for the disabled, improved care for the elderly and raised awareness about local health issues. LaBrot works side by side with his younger sister, Sky, to run the all-volunteer organization. Since the project began, 180 volunteers from nine countries have joined the effort, including medical residents, nursing students and retired physicians. LaBrot is the only full-time doctor on board. Following their initial trip to Haiti, LaBrot and his team traveled to Honduras for a seven-month stay. They later returned to Haiti to offer aid during a cholera outbreak, and then in May, the group left Haiti for Bocos del Toro, Panama, where they have been working for the last nine months. LaBrot said he knew of the need in Honduras and Panama, and connections he had made in those countries enabled him to reach remote communities there. In the future, LaBrot hopes to set up permanent clinics that would be run by local health care workers in the three countries they've visited. ""I do not want to have to treat a couple hundred people and then have to go,"" LaBrot said. ""I want to treat thousands and thousands of people. And better than that, I want to be able to provide the people we treat with the capabilities to carry on what they've learned so they can continue to help others after we leave."" Floating Doctors is run entirely on donations. While LaBrot wears many hats to keep his project afloat -- he often serves as captain, cook and lab technician -- he says he wouldn't have it any other way. ""I had to postpone many aspects of my own personal life. I don't have a home somewhere. I had to give up a lot,"" he said. ""But I gained everything."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- An Italian appeal court has overturned former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's convictions for sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of power. A panel of judges convicted Berlusconi of both charges in June 2013, sentencing the flamboyant billionaire tycoon to seven years in prison and barring him from holding public office. Prosecutors had argued that Berlusconi had sex 13 times with underage dancer Karima el Mahroug -- known as ""Ruby the heart-stealer"" -- and abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from jail, where she was being held on charges of theft. They said Berlusconi paid el Mahroug and other young women performing stripteases and erotic actions at ""bunga bunga"" parties. Berlusconi said the parties were normal dinner gatherings where no one misbehaved. He denied the charges against him and his attorney told reporters at the time that he would appeal the convictions, arguing that it had not been a fair trial. The billionaire media tycoon claimed he had persecuted by leftist magistrates. ""There are still people who use the penal code as a weapon in their ideological battles,"" he said last year. On Friday, Milan Court of Appeal presiding judge Concetta Locurto read his acquittal verdict live on Italian television. Locurto said Berlusconi, 77, had been acquitted of the charge of abuse of office because the ""the act did not take place"" and from prostitution with a minor because the ""facts do not constitute a crime."" Milan's prosecutor can appeal the verdict to Italy's Supreme Court, which would make a final ruling in the case. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, is arguably one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. For years, he has been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached Italian courts. Berlusconi was handed a four-year community service sentence last August -- commuted to a year -- for tax fraud at Mediaset, the large commercial broadcaster that he founded. He is is serving that sentence at a hospice near Milan -- where he was for today's acquittal in the Ruby case.","Prosecutors said Berlusconi had sex with underage dancer called ""Ruby the heart-stealer""

"(CNN) -- Actor Tracy Morgan agreed to return to Nashville next week to apologize to people who heard his anti-gay rant during a recent stand-up comedy show, a pro-gay rights group said Monday. Morgan released a written apology last Friday, but he followed up Monday morning with a phone call to the president and staff of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD.) By the end of the call, Morgan had agreed to go back to Nashville with GLAAD staffers to deliver a face-to-face apology to people who were in the Ryman Auditorium and to work with the Tennessee Equality Project, GLAAD said. ""By not only apologizing, but sending a message of support for gay and transgender people, Tracy will help many realize that no one should be treated differently or subjected to violence,"" GLAAD President Jarrett Barrios said. Morgan is a star of the hit NBC sitcom ""30 Rock"" and a ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran. Details of Morgan's anti-gay remarks, delivered during a June 3 show, emerged last week when an audience member posted them on a Facebook blog, which was picked up by Jezebel magazine. The blog, titled ""Why I No Longer 'Like' Tracy Morgan,"" said the comic said gays should ""not be whining about something as insignificant as bullying."" ""He mentioned that gay was something kids learn from the media and programming, and that bullied kids should just bust some ass and beat those other little f**kers that bully them, not whine about it,"" Kevin Rogers wrote. Morgan said that if his own son told him he was gay, he would ""pull out a knife and stab"" him, Rogers wrote. ""The sad thing is that none of this rant was a joke,"" Rogers wrote.

"Washington (CNN) -- A divided federal appeals court on Friday struck down Michigan's controversial ban on consideration of race and gender in college admissions. The 2-1 panel at the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals concluded the voter-approved ban on ""preferential treatment"" at state colleges and universities was unconstitutional, and ""alters Michigan's political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities."" The issue is likely to renew the national, political and legal debate over affirmative action, which the Supreme Court could be poised to resolve in the coming months. The affirmative action ban was passed five years ago in a referendum and was added to the state's constitution, barring publicly funded centers of higher education from granting ""preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin."" That prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from various groups. ""The university is reviewing the possible implications of the court's decision, and recognizes that there may be further legal steps as well,"" Kelly Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the University of Michigan, said Friday. She would not speculate how or when the school would need to alter its policies in response to the court's ruling. A state appeal to the Supreme Court is almost certain, setting up a potentially heated election-year debate in 2012 over whether race and gender preferences are still a socially necessary step. The issue comes after the justices in 2003 ruled that while Michigan universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit, they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted. The appeals court has now said the Michigan law violated the Constitution's equal protection laws. ""Because less onerous avenues to effect political change remain open to those advocating consideration of non-racial factors in admissions decisions, Michigan cannot force those advocating for consideration of racial factors to go down a more arduous road than others without violating the Fourteenth Amendment,"" said Judges R. Guy Cole and Martha Daughtrey, both named to the bench by former President Bill Clinton. In dissent, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons said voters had a right to pass this kind of referendum, even though school officials ultimately make the individual admissions decisions. ""Having no direct or indirect influence on the bodies vested with authority to set admissions standards -- the faculty committees -- the people of Michigan made a political change at the only level of government actually available to them as voters,"" said Gibbons. ""The Michigan electorate, therefore, as opposed to choosing a more complex structure for lawmaking, employed the one method available to exert electoral pressure on the mechanisms of government."" The current controversy was sparked by the earlier Supreme Court decisions. In two cases from the University of Michigan, the divided high court said the university's law school could give preferential treatment to minorities -- as one factor in the admissions process -- but could not set quotas or use a point system. Writing for the majority in the law school case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the Constitution ""does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body."" The moderate-conservative O'Connor has since left the bench, replaced by the more right-leaning Justice Samuel Alito, who could prove the decisive vote if the current case reaches the Supreme Court. The referendum effort was led by Jennifer Gratz, who was at the center of the high court case eight years ago. As a white student, she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state's largest university. She eventually attended another school, and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent reverse discrimination lawsuit. She ultimately prevailed at the Supreme Court -- long after she had graduated -- and then began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions. Efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial. The famous Brown v. Board of Education high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools, but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states who initially refused to integrate. In 1978 in the so-called Bakke case, the justices said universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity that allows for the use of affirmative action. That issue involved a reverse discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school. And the high court in 2007 struck down public school choice plans in Seattle and Louisville, concluding race could not be a factor in the assignment of children. Those school districts had sought to use raced-based criteria to achieve diversity. The issue in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met. O'Connor in her 2003 decision predicted, ""The court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."" The justices could be asked to decide whether Michigan's current policy meets that legal and social test. The current case is Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality by Any Means Necessary v. Regents of the University of Michigan (08-1387).","The court concludes in a 2-1 ruling that the voter-approved ban is unconstitutional .
The case is likely to renew a national debate over affirmative action .

"(CNN) -- Concerned parents of students at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York say their children were told to go on fall break several weeks early and no one knows when they'll be going back to school, thanks to the federal shutdown. Meanwhile, it's business as usual at the other four U.S. federal academies. The Merchant Marine Academy is operated under the U.S. Department of Transportation, while those for the Air Force, Navy, Army and Coast Guard operate under the Department of Defense. And in this case, that makes all the difference. Almost all of the academy's faculty and staff are civilians who are subject to shutdown furloughs, while the majority of the staffs at the other military academies are active-duty military and are not subject to furlough, according to the academy's website. Some parents of USMMA students worry that the shutdown could eventually delay careers, because of the academy's unique scheduling. Adam Feinberg's son is in his second year at the academy. ""It is very tough because Kings Point has a compact curriculum. You spend three trimesters out at sea after two years of taking classes. These shutdown days cut into the sea days,"" Feinberg told CNN. In a statement released last Thursday, Rear Admiral James Helis, the academy's superintendent, stated that by ""swapping"" the fall break, it will minimize the impact the shutdown has on students and on the academic calendar. The academy's website says fall break was originally scheduled for November 1-11. The rescheduled break started Friday and will last until October 14. So what is the plan if the federal shutdown lasts past that date? ""While we hope the shutdown will be resolved by the end of the newly-scheduled break, if the shutdown is still in place, we will be forced to shut down the Academy on October 15,"" the website stated. In his statement, Helis said the leadership of the academy and the DOT are working on options to address a long-term federal shutdown in the event that happens. According to the academy's website, 225 midshipmen are currently at sea and will be allowed to continue their training. When those sailors complete their sea training, the academy will bring them back to campus, or to their homes, depending on the status of the government shutdown at that time. Calls to the Merchant Marine Academy were not immediately returned on Saturday. The Merchant Marine transports cargo and passengers in domestic waters during peace time, and during war is an auxiliary of the U.S. Navy and can be called to transport military cargo and supplies.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from the magnitude-7.1 earthquake in the central Philippines rose to 144 on Wednesday, authorities said. The quake, which struck Tuesday, injured 291 people and rattled many celebrating a religious holiday. The bulk of the casualties were in Bohol province. More than 20 people are missing, and authorities are checking into reports of people trapped in collapsed buildings, the Philippines News Agency reported. The quake was centered about 620 kilometers (385 miles) south-southeast of Manila, near Catigbian, and its depth was 20 kilometers (12 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Philippines disaster council gave the temblor a slightly higher rating: 7.2 magnitude. iReport: 'Our building is not safe' Tuesday was a national holiday, the beginning of the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. There was no widespread threat of a tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. It warned that earthquakes this large can sometimes cause tsunamis within 100 kilometers of the epicenter. Tourist Robert Michael Poole said he was riding a bike in Bohol when the earthquake struck and cracked the road in front of him. ""It was very strong,"" Poole said. ""I live in Tokyo. I am used to earthquakes. But this one was very strong. It shocked a lot of people here."" He said he was able to move around and document some of the destruction, including a giant church that was decimated.

"(CNET) -- Facebook stopped a phishing attack on Thursday, its second day in a row of dealing with a worm on the site that lures people to a fake Facebook page and prompts them to log in. Facebook has faced two phishing attacks in the past two days but officials aren't sure whether they are related. Unsuspecting Facebook users get a message from a friend urging them to ""check this out"" and including a link to a Web page that appears to be a Facebook log-in page, but it is a fake site that steals their information when they type in their username and password. The worm also sends a copy of the message to the infected Facebook member's contacts. In the latest attack, the Web address was ""FBStarter.com."" In Wednesday's attack, the address was ""BAction.net."" The attacks were stopped within a few hours in each case, said Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt. He said it was too early to say whether the two phishing attacks are related. ""We are investigating,"" Schnitt said. Once Facebook learns of a phishing attack, either by members notifying the company or employees noticing that a URL is being distributed to a lot of people, the company deletes the URL from members' pages, blocks fresh postings, and removes the redirect to the URL that appears in e-mail messages, Schnitt said. Facebook also goes in and resets the passwords of member accounts that had been used to distribute the spam, he said. The company also alerts anti-fraud partner MarkMonitor, which passes the phishing URL on to the major browsers to block it and contacts ISPs to take the site down, according to Schnitt. To protect against phishing scams, Facebook users should make sure that the URL they are visiting says ""www.facebook.com."" If it doesn't use that domain it's likely to be spam. Also, members that are already logged in to Facebook will not be asked to log in again. ""People should have a healthy dose of suspicion, and ask themselves 'why did I get logged out?'"" Schnitt said. ""If something looks a little strange you should check the address bar."" Facebook users who think they have been affected by the scam should change their passwords and review their Facebook stream for any unauthorized changes. If they use their Facebook password for other sites, they should change those passwords as well. And if they are using their Facebook authentication to log in to any other sites, they should check for any unauthorized changes on those sites. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Malik Bendjelloul, the acclaimed Swedish director who ran out of cash and finished shooting his Oscar-winning documentary ""Searching for Sugar Man"" with a smartphone app, died suddenly Tuesday in Stockholm, police said. He was 36. No crime is suspected in the death of the filmmaker, who won the 2013 Academy Award for his debut feature about an obscure American crooner who gained fame abroad but remained virtually unknown at home, Stockholm Police Sgt. Janne Gyllstedt told CNN. Gyllstedt would not specify the cause of death and said he was unable to disclose any additional information. ""Searching for Sugar Man"" is the story of Sixto Rodriguez, a singer from Detroit who became a legend in South Africa. With lyrics such as ""The system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tune,"" Rodriguez unwittingly became the voice of the anti-Apartheid struggle in the 1970s, even as his records flopped in his own country. ""A man who lives his whole life in Detroit working as a construction worker, without knowing that, at the very same time, he's more famous than Elvis Presley in another part of the world,"" Bendjelloul told CNN's Poppy Harlow in 2012. ""I thought it was the most beautiful story I've ever heard in my life."" ""Searching for Sugar Man"" producer Simon Chinn said in a statement: ""I felt so fortunate when Malik came into my life, with his charm, optimism and boundless energy and lack a guile, and now he is gone. It feels like a bright light has been snuffed out."" He added, ""As a filmmaker he was an inspiration -- someone who, despite his relative inexperience, was driven by a passion and determination to do justice to the great story he had found and to prove those (who) had doubted he could do it, of which there were too many, wrong. How he proved them wrong! I feel honoured to have gone on this journey with him, and I simply can't believe he is gone."" Tom Bernard and Michael Barker of Sony Pictures Classics compared Bendjelloul to the subject of his debut feature. ""Much like Rodriguez himself, Malik was a genuine person who chased the world for stories to tell,"" they said in a joint statement. ""He didn't chase fame or fortune or awards, although those accolades still found him as many others recognized his storytelling."" After running out of money for the film, Bendjelloul finished shooting the documentary using an iPhone app. ""I started shooting with a Super 8 camera which, in the end, was too expensive,"" he told CNN. ""How am I going to finish? Then one day I realized there was this app for the iPhone called the Super 8 app. It was $1. It worked very well. Actually, I used that for the film."" The film gets its title from ""Sugar Man,"" a 1970 Rodriguez song about a drug peddler. ""It was this lost masterpiece, like a Cinderella story, a fairy tale,"" Bendjelloul said of Rodriguez's life. ""I never heard anything like that. A story that was so rich and true."" Bendjelloul, who was born on September 17, 1977, in Sweden, performed in the Swedish TV series ""Ebba och Didrik"" as a child in the 1990s and later studied journalism and media production at the Linnaeus University of Kalmar, according to imdb.com. He produced several musical documentaries for Swedish TV. Bendjelloul also worked as a reporter on the show ""Kobra"" until he resigned to travel the world, which was when he first came across the story of Rodriguez, according to imdb.com. ""It's a touching story that hits you in the heart,"" he said. ""And also he's such a lovable character. Everyone falls in love with him. He's a person you can actually really love."" In 2013, his debut feature beat out ""5 Broken Cameras,"" ""The Gatekeepers,"" ""How to Survive a Plague"" and ""The Invisible War"" for best documentary. ""Oh boy!"" Bendjelloul said in his acceptance speech. ""Thanks to one of the greatest singers ever, Rodriguez."" Bendjelloul had likened the Oscar to winning his native country's Nobel Prize.

"Washington (CNN) -- It must have been at least a little satisfying Thursday for President Barack Obama. He had repeatedly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin against annexing Crimea from Ukraine, threatening tougher sanctions aimed at the Russian economy. Following the Russian parliament's vote to approve the annexation, Obama made a previously unscheduled appearance before TV cameras to essentially tell Putin: I told you I'd do it. ""These are all choices that the Russian government has made, choices that have been rejected by the international community, as well as the government of Ukraine,"" Obama said. ""And because of these choices, the United States is today moving, as we said we would, to impose additional costs on Russia."" 'We said we would' His hastily arranged remarks signaled European allies that Obama would take a leading role on the issue, and also responded to pressure from political foes and some supporters at home for a tougher response to what Vice President Joe Biden called a ""land grab"" by Putin. Even Hillary Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state who is the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, said this week that the administration should do more to support Ukraine. Russia lawmakers vote to annex Crimea; U.S. steps up sanctions . The steps announced Thursday expanded on a previous U.S. list of sanctions targets, adding more senior Russian officials and what officials called ""cronies"" of Putin as well as a bank controlled by a Putin associate. Obama also warned Moscow that possible further sanctions would go after key sectors of the economy if Russia escalates the crisis in Ukraine. A new executive order signed by Obama authorizes his administration to target Russian companies in the financial services, energy, metals and mining, defense and engineering industries -- all vital components of the Russian economy. EU leaders met Thursday to discuss their own steps, so Obama's immediate response gave him the mantle of leadership on the matter. Finland's Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Alexander Stubb told CNN's Nina dos Santos that the EU will add as many as 10 more names to its previous list of targets, but won't hit any companies at this stage. So far, European powers such as Germany and Britain have been unwilling to embrace significant economic sanctions against Russia because of their strong trade and investment ties with Moscow. Severe consequences . In a briefing to reporters, senior U.S. administration officials sounded further warnings against any Russian provocations in Ukraine. ""We believe that it is very important to signal that if Russia further escalates this situation they will be met with severe consequences,"" one official said. The tough talk looked even more credible compared to Russia's almost comical response to the U.S. announcement: sanctions against nine U.S. political leaders and administration officials. On Ukraine, more must be done . Moscow's list included House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Republican Sens. John McCain and Dan Coats, Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez and Mary Landrieu, and some members of Obama's White House team. ""I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off, my Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen,"" McCain joked in response. 'Badge of honor' Landrieu, who is facing a tough re-election battle this year in generally conservative Louisiana, called her sanction by Russia ""a badge of honor."" Obama and U.S. officials have made clear that the response to Russia will remain in the diplomatic and economic arenas, with one senior administration official essentially rejecting for now any direct U.S. effort to bolster Ukraine's military forces for a ground war. ""Nobody wants the outcome here to be a full-bore military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and in fact, the Ukrainian government themselves have been quite restrained in not giving in to provocation and not having this go the way of bloodshed,"" the official said, adding that ""we don't want to take steps to add to a momentum of further militarizing the situation."" Clinton walks a 'fine line' on Putin .

"(CNN) -- It just about broke Elise Kamin's heart to have to tell her 6-year-old daughter, Piper, that she couldn't buy her a Halloween costume this year. The child knows little about the adult struggles that Kamin and her fiance are facing as federal employees who have been working without pay since October 1. Kamin, who works for the Social Security Administration in Winter Haven, Florida, is trying to shield Piper and her 9-year-old brother as long as she can. ""Having to explain to your children why they can't go to tutoring right now, or why they can't get a Halloween costume or pumpkin, or why they can't attend a friend's birthday party, all because of this nonsense in Washington, is horrible,"" Kamin wrote on CNN iReport. She said she shared her story with CNN because ""I feel like I have no other way to voice my concerns and to help my children than to speak up."" Since the U.S. government went on a partial shutdown, CNN iReport has received more than 1,500 stories from families, many sharing fears and worries about what will happen if the impasse lags on. Plenty of families are already feeling the collateral damage -- and begging for an end to the paralysis in Washington. 'Put my grandma back to work' On Tuesday, 59-year-old Joy Lorien had to ask her two grandchildren to eat the free breakfast offered at school because her cupboards were bare. She always makes the 9- and 10-year-olds breakfast -- fried potatoes, a little bacon, cut-up bananas and a sweet roll. She cried just thinking about it as she took them to school. Lorien also reflected on the irony of the situation -- her grandchildren having to take government assistance because the government forced her out of work. It would normally be peak season at the Skyland Resort in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, where Lorien has worked as a server or hostess for the past 30 years. She can usually count on making $1,000 a week this month -- enough to get her through the four months of the year when the lodge is closed. But temporary layoffs for Lorien and 200-plus workers at the resort went into effect on October 1 after the park's closure. She expects to come back to work after the government resumes, but she won't get back any of her lost pay because the lodge is owned by a private company. Losing her job in October ""has taken my Christmas savings away, has taken what I could have saved for winter to get heat, food and pay my bills,"" she wrote. ""How can anyone who had a part in shutting down the government look at themselves in the mirror?"" Writing letters to the editor of her newspaper and going to protests with her grandson has helped Lorien feel like she's making her voice heard. The boy held a sign he made that said ""Please put my grandma back to work."" Americans on the edge . Furloughed 90% of his staff . Small-business owner Buddy Gilmore estimates he's losing $40,000 in revenue a week. His company does modeling and simulation, as well as network engineering, for the Department of Defense. And that number doesn't include the $300,000 in outstanding invoices he has from a project work completed in July. ""That's pretty tough for a small business,"" he said. He's had to furlough 90% of his Colorado Springs, Colorado, staff because of lost business. And because his employees are not federal workers, they won't recoup that pay, he said. ""My mind is with my employees, some of whom have run out of vacation time and are dipping into their savings,"" Gilmore said. ""I have offered up early Christmas bonuses, and some have opted to take them."" But his attempts to make the best of the situation aren't enough to assuage all of his employees. ""Some of my best and brightest employees are already looking for employment elsewhere, and they would be very hard to replace,"" he said. ""Our shutdown fears have been realized."" 'I am collateral damage' Elise Kamin is a claims representative for the Social Security Administration in Winter Haven, Florida, and her fiance is a supervisor at the Transportation Security Administration at the Orlando airport. Both have been deemed essential workers by the government, so they must work without pay or face disciplinary action. They'll get paid eventually, but that's little solace now when Kamin's figuring out how to stretch out her last check -- for 48 hours of pay instead of 80 -- to cover her kids' before-and-after-school care and the gas she needs to keep showing up to work. Kamin has tried to shield her children from her money woes; they've already been through a lot, having lost their father, uncle and grandfather in a boating accident last year. But the missing paycheck is already affecting them. Kamin canceled the private tutoring her son has received since falling behind in school last year and has told her daughter she can't go to two birthday parties because they can't pay for gifts or gas to get there. ""I also have bills to pay such as food, water, electricity, housing, etc. I can only hold off creditors for so long. I can only balance the tightrope for so long,"" she wrote in a comment on her iReport. ""I did nothing to cause this. I've done nothing but be a loyal worker. I am collateral damage.""

"(CNN) -- The extraordinary new film ""12 Years a Slave"" immerses us in the reality of historical slavery at a deep level of complexity and nuance. The film is an opportunity to honor all who were held in chattel slavery, treated like property, and subjected to levels of violence, torture, and control that no human should ever endure. The movie, directed by Steve McQueen, is also an opportunity to start a meaningful conversation about how prevalent slavery is today. Most of us believe that slavery in America disappeared over a century ago. In the narrative we've learned, the Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth Amendment ended this horrific chapter in our nation's history. But this narrative is simply wrong. Slavery may no longer be legal or accepted. Slavery may no longer be as brutal, as visible, or as blatant. But it's time for us to fully absorb that slavery has been with us every day since the late 1800s. Solomon Northup, whose autobiography the film is based on, was a free man living with his family in Saratoga, New York, during the 1840s. He was deceived, coerced, drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery. His money and documents were taken. He was given a new name, and his true identity was suppressed. He was physically and psychologically tortured, enduring abuse for years and threatened with death if he tried to escape. The parallels to slavery today are striking. The control mechanisms used by Solomon's recruiters and captors are the same tactics and stories we hear about daily from the people who reach out to us for help on the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline, which Polaris Project operates. The International Labor Organization estimates nearly 21 million people around the world are victims of modern slavery.. That's 21 million people living in circumstances similar to those that drove Solomon Northup to despair. Modern slavery is the man who was promised a job on a farm to earn enough money to pay for his parents' medical care, then forced to work long hours, intimidated with violence, and made to live in deplorable conditions in a cramped room with his co-workers. It's the man working in a restaurant who was assaulted by his manager and threatened should he ever try to leave. Modern slavery is the 15-year-old girl who was romanced and recruited by a pimp, then raped, beaten, and sold online into the commercial sex trade. It's the woman from South America held against her will in a house in the suburbs, paid only a fraction of the wages she was promised, and compelled to work as a domestic servant. These are only a glimpse into types of cases Polaris Project learns about every day -- cases right here in the United States. Human trafficking is a low-risk crime with high profits. The U.N. estimated it to be a $32 billion a year industry in 2005, and many in the anti-trafficking field believe that number is outdated and too low. As ubiquitous and overwhelming as the global scale of modern slavery feels, we can't shy away from the enormity of the challenge to address it. One way to respond is to offer a lifeline: to provide that one moment that helps someone get out of slavery. For the millions of men, women, and children being trafficked, that moment of opportunity doesn't need to take 12 years to arrive like it did for Solomon. With global telecommunications technologies, political will, and anti-slavery resources, help can be one phone call or one text away. All of us can help create that moment of opportunity: Learn about modern slavery and recognize its signs. Share the national hotline number and post fliers in places where vulnerable populations might see it. Report tips and relevant information about suspected slavery in your community by calling Polaris Project. Urge your elected leaders to pass stronger anti-slavery laws that crack down on traffickers and protect survivors. Support efforts nationally or in your community that are building a movement against modern slavery. We have a duty to learn from Solomon's story and the horrors of historical slavery, to never let it happen again, and to mobilize for the 21 million victims of human trafficking still trapped in slavery. The opportunity to truly eradicate slavery is before us. Now let's rise to the challenge and seize it.

"(CNN) -- In the past couple months, thousands of teachers and parents have been calling for radical change in the education system, citing issues with the No Child Left Behind policy. Teachers, students, and parents across the country have come together with one goal in mind: fix a faulty education system. Organizers are calling for a march on Washington, where they hope to inspire change. Anthony Cody is a national board-certified teacher and mentor teacher for the Oakland, California, schools. He is one of the organizers of the Save Our Schools March, set for Saturday. He recently spoke to CNN about the march, its purpose and what teachers hope to gain. CNN: Where did the idea for the Save Our Schools march come from? Cody: The idea was born after President Obama was elected. Teachers, especially, were tired of No Child Left Behind and the emphasis on standardized test scores to judge students, schools and teachers. Teachers really hoped for change. When we didn't see that change coming, we got concerned. I got involved last December with teachers, parents and professors. We started doing the hard work of building our coalition, strengthening our guiding principles and figuring out what we wanted instead. There was a lot of dissatisfaction with education policy, and we needed a positive agenda and not just be critics. There's a lot of momentum building for the march, rally and conference. Endorsements are lining up from parent organizations, students, academics and, of course, from teachers. People are excited about the chance to get our voices heard. Opinion: Why America's teachers are enraged . CNN: Why do the organizers feel it's necessary to ""save"" our schools? Cody: For the last 10 years, since No Child Left Behind was enacted, more and more emphasis has been put on test scores. The underlying belief is that if we punish schools for low test scores and reward schools and teachers for high scores, then student achievement will improve. Those who work in schools see the effects that this has had. The practice of labeling schools ""failures"" hasn't worked. It is actually undermining public schools. More support is going to semi-private charter schools and flowing away from public schools. More money and instructional time is being spent on more complicated and sophisticated tests. The actual education of our students is suffering. Teachers are demoralized; many are leaving the profession. Those teachers still here are taking a stance to protect schools and students from this. Tests are not going to fix our schools. Real solutions are needed to improve our schools, and those start with students, teachers and parents who invest in our schools. CNN: What's the objective of this march? Cody: Secretary (of Education) Arne Duncan sent a letter to American teachers in honor of Teacher Appreciation Week in which he heaped a lot of praise on teachers but at the same time made it clear that policies that are so destructive in our schools are not changing. The response that he got to that letter was overwhelmingly critical from teachers. Teachers simply could not believe his praise, because at the same time Duncan says he appreciates teachers, he has supported the firing of entire staffs. So there's a real disconnect between education policy and the rhetoric that says that teachers are so valued. What we hope will happen as a result of this march is a recognition that there is a serious problem in education reform policies in this country, that there is serious and principled opposition to those policies and real alternatives that are actually working in schools. Opinion: Why we protest education cuts . CNN: Some teachers are afraid to appear at rallies or speak out against the status quo for fear of losing their jobs. Have you encountered any teachers who want to participate but feel they can't? Cody: Teachers comment all the time online that they are fearful of speaking out more. Social movements take some bravery, some guts. Standing up in large enough numbers, that's what it's all about. Only then, teachers can't be dismissed or discriminated against. It's incumbent on all teachers who are professionals to take stock of the ethical commitment to students, and at a certain point, that commitment requires taking risks. The time is now to take some risks, or else the teaching profession is not worth working in. CNN: How are you looking for parents to become activists? Cody: Recently in my district, I worked as part of a group that brought together 200 teachers to discuss ways that we could improve teaching. The energy that was unleashed is the energy of activism, the energy of people taking responsibility and control of their profession. That energy is completely absent if you try to coerce people into doing things, if you try to bribe them with merit or punish them by saying they will lose their jobs if their test scores don't improve. What teachers wanted is to improve schools and work together. The result? A lot of concrete ideas on how to do this. Parents need to do the same thing by getting involved in local schools, running for the school board. A social movement across this country is needed to defend neighborhood schools. It isn't going to happen without the parents; it isn't going to happen without the teachers. It shouldn't happen without the students. Everyone needs to get involved. The march is just one part of that. CNN: How will determine if this event has been a success? Cody: If we strengthen the network of people who care about schools, we raise the profile of a positive vision for public education, we make it more difficult for the Department of Education to pretend that the majority of the teaching profession supports their policies, and we remind Congress and the president that there are many, many thousands of people who care deeply about the future of our schools. We don't want schools sold off to corporate charters, don't want them micromanaged by standardized tests. Teachers, parents and students should be entrusted with the real work of reforming our schools.","Parents, teachers, students plan Save Our Schools march in Washington on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- The Fit Nation ""6-Pack"" is visiting the National Training Center in Clermont, Florida, this week to learn more about biking, swimming and running. Like many newcomers to the sport of triathlon, they've made some mistakes early on. This trip, halfway through the training, is about fixing those mistakes. I've trained three groups of Fit Nation triathletes, and over the years I've come up with five simple rules all beginners should follow: . 1. Find a love for each discipline. It's OK not to love every training session, but I think it's important to enjoy your time swimming, biking and running. It's important to view this time as a gift -- as an opportunity for adventure, improved fitness and overall better quality of life. 2. Keep it simple. The triathlon industry is fast paced and high tech, based on the demographic of the sports participants. Don't get lost in the heart rate, wattage, newest gadget, latest diet plan or running shoe. At the end of the day, the sport is simply: Swim. Bike. Run. I am not saying some of these gadgets won't help your progression as an athlete, but they are not all necessary, especially not early in your training. Don't get lost in the hype and the information overload. 3. Do not avoid the sport you favor the least. It is human nature to do what we are more familiar with more frequently. If you are a weak swimmer, however, your swim will not improve by running three to four times a week and swimming only one to two times a week. Aim for balance in your training rather than avoidance. 4. Follow a training plan. Write your own plan, find a training plan online or work with a coach. Choose the path that is the best fit. A plan will help you reach your goals, create balance in training and help prevent injury. 5. Don't worry about the finish line. Stay in the present throughout your triathlon progression. Break things up into manageable pieces and check them off as you accomplish bench marks. For example, break your first 4-mile run effort into 2 x 2-mile efforts. Don't think about the second effort until you have accomplished the first. Acknowledge the accomplishment of the first 2-mile effort as you continue moving forward into the second part of the effort.

"Charleston, West Virginia (CNN) -- Is it really safe? West Virginia's governor is asking federal authorities to do further study on the possible health effects caused by last month's chemical spill near Charleston. ""It is critical this study is funded and that work begins immediately,"" wrote Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin in a letter Tuesday to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On January 9, the chemical -- 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, or MCHM -- was discovered leaking from a storage tank into the Elk River and from there into Charleston's water supply. Its licorice smell alerted residents to the contamination and led to a do-not-use order for 300,000 West Virginians, some of whom could not drink or bathe in their water for more than a week. It also underscored that little is known about the health effects of the chemical, which is used to wash coal prior to market in order to reduce ash. The spill was originally estimated at about 7,500 gallons, but Freedom Industries said late last month that about 10,000 gallons of chemical had escaped. The company also told regulators that a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers, known as PPH -- was part of the leak. ""I am committed to the health and well-being of West Virginians and believe there is a pressing need to further study the potential health effects resulting from exposure to water contaminated with crude MCHM and PPH,"" Tomblin said. An independent water test conducted early this month at CNN's request found trace levels of MCHM, both in untreated river water and in tap water from two homes in Charleston. The amounts ranged from less than 0.5 parts per billion to 1.6 parts per billion -- well below the 1 part per million that the CDC has said it considers unlikely to be associated with any adverse health effects. ""We stand willing to continue to assist and will be discussing with officials there what additional toxicology and epidemiology studies may be needed,"" said Laura Bellinger, a CDC spokeswoman. Dr. Rahul Gupta, the health officer and executive director of the Kanawha-Charleston and Putnam County health departments, has called for a long-term study to be carried out ""in a manner able to capture any long-term impact."" In the wake of the spill, two waves of patients sought treatment from private doctors and 10 emergency rooms in a nine-county area for non-specific symptoms such as rash, nausea, vomiting and cough, Gupta told CNN on Wednesday. The first peak -- about 250 patients -- occurred in the first three days after the spill was reported on January 9, he said. A lull ensued during the several days of the do-not-use advisory, followed by a second peak -- about the same number -- during the first few days after the advisory was lifted on January 13, he said. There is widespread distrust of the water, with only about 1% of the 200 people who attended town hall meetings in late January about the matter saying they were drinking it, he said. Gupta, who has a masters degree in public health, acknowledged that his findings were ""non-scientific"" and that he did not know what the baseline incidence would be of patients appearing at an ER with such symptoms, but said the anecdotes point to the need for further studies. ""Those two peaks are undeniable,"" he said. ""Perhaps there is something going on here."" Gupta said the water in his own house continues to smell of licorice, and that he avoids drinking tap water, though he would not be opposed to doing so. ""The question becomes, is a pregnant mom going to drink it? Should developing brains of children be drinking it?"" The CDC has expressed similar concerns. ""Due to limited availability of data, and out of an abundance of caution, pregnant women may wish to consider an alternative drinking water source until the chemical is at non-detectable levels in the water distribution system,"" it said in a paper dated February 5. ""For mothers with babies, there is no research that suggests consuming water with these low levels of MCHM poses any health risk to their baby. However, if you have any concerns, please consult your doctor."" But the West Virginia Poison Center said in a posting on February 10 that some symptoms, such as nausea and headaches, may not indicate that the chemicals were harmful. ""These symptoms are not due to toxic effects but are a body's physical and real response to unusual smells/tastes,"" it said, adding that the poison center received calls from more than 1,900 patients reporting chemical exposures related to the drinking water in the days after the spill was reported. ""Most reported symptoms included mild rashes and reddened skin from dermal exposure, or GI distress (nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea) from ingesting contaminated water. The symptoms tended to be mild and self-limiting."" It urged that anyone with continuing symptoms be evaluated for other medical conditions, and noted that viral gastroenteritis, influenza, the common cold and other infections are all common at this time of year. A spokeswoman for West Virginia American Water Co. said the company was continuing to flush the system to get rid of pockets of licorice smell that remain. ""For us, it's not over until we resolve the odor issue,"" said Maureen Duffy. Dr. Tanja Popovic, the director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, told reporters on February 5 that repeated testing had shown the water to be acceptable for all uses. ""What I can say is that with all the scientific evidence that we have, with everything that numerous people have worked on so far, I can say that you can use your water however you like,"" Popovic said. ""You can drink it, you can bathe in it, you can use it how you like."" Tomblin said then that tests had shown levels of less than 10 parts per billion or too low to detect, and that he and his staff had been drinking the water ""for the last couple of weeks."" But when asked whether he could declare it ""100% safe,"" he said, ""No."" ""The only thing that we can rely upon is what the experts tell us, and, you know, for all the tests done that's who we've got to depend upon,"" Tomblin said. A federal grand jury is probing the spill at Freedom Industries, sources familiar with the grand jury's activities have told CNN. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield reported from Charleston, Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta, Stephanie Gallman and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","""Perhaps there is something going on here,"" says county health officer .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Bishop Eddie Long has apologized to the Anti-Defamation League over an incident in which he was wrapped in a Torah scroll and crowned ""king."" As shown in a video that went viral, the televangelist was wrapped in a ""Holocaust Torah"" and crowned king during a recent ceremony at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, his suburban Atlanta congregation. ""The ceremony was not my suggestion, nor was it my intent, to participate in any ritual that is offensive in any manner to the Jewish community, or any group. Furthermore, I sincerely denounce any action that depicts me as a King, for I am merely just a servant of the Lord,"" Long wrote in a letter dated Saturday. The letter was addressed to Bill Nigut, southeast regional director of the Anti-Defamation League -- a Jewish group that fights anti-Semitism. ""While I believe that Rabbi Ralph Messer has good intentions during his message at New Birth, I understand that the ceremony he performed on Sunday, January 29th, caused harm to the Jewish community, for which I am deeply sorry,"" Long wrote. On Sunday, Nigut acknowledged the apology and said he was grateful for it. ""I thought it was a very heartfelt, sincere, humble apology,"" he told CNN. ""I was very gratified by Bishop Long apparently recognizing what our concern was."" Nigut said he was deeply offended by the ""fake ritual,"" and by how the Torah was handled during it. Video from the ceremony showed Messer wrapping Long in the Torah scroll, which he said was recovered during the Holocaust. He then directed four men to lift a seated Long in his chair and parade him before the New Birth congregation. ""He is a king. God's blessed him. He's a humble man, but in him is kingship, royalty,"" Messer shouted. He said during the ceremony that the Torah was a ""priceless"" 312-year-old scroll that had been recovered from the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. He said he wanted to honor Long ""on behalf of Jewish people, and the land of Israel."" Rabbi Hillel Norry of Congregation Shearith Israel in Atlanta said last week the ceremony was ""ridiculous."" There's no Jewish coronation ceremony where someone is wrapped in a Torah and made a king, he said. ""We just don't do that. We treat it with deference,"" Norry said of the Torah. ""It's not a shawl, not a crown. Don't treat it that way."" Norry said Messer doesn't appear to be an ordained rabbi in the Jewish faith. He also doubts that the Torah scroll that Long was wrapped in is actually 312 years old, and had somehow escaped detection in a concentration camp. Long is one of the most well-known televangelists in America. At its peak, New Birth had around 25,000 members, and Long's sermons were broadcast around the globe. Two years ago, Long's public image took a hit when four young men accused him of misusing his spiritual authority to coerce them into sexual relations. He settled out of court. Long's wife, Vanessa, filed for divorce last year. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Eddie Long writes a letter of apology to the Anti-Defamation League .

"Cleveland (CNN) -- Cleveland's public schools mirror many of the problems of inner city life: gang activity, drug infestation, poverty, low academic achievement and a dismal graduation rate. Within the past year, the school system has undergone a comprehensive and sometimes harsh reorganization in hopes of changing that reality. ""Our 54% graduation rate was the major catalyst,"" said Renee Cavor, chief of transformation for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. The school system closed 16 schools in 2010, and there are more changes to come. The school board recently voted to offset a projected $74 million budget deficit by closing seven more public schools and laying off 702 employees, including 643 classroom teachers. Closing schools is hard on the community, school leaders said, even if it's better in the long run for financial stability and students' educations. ""I closed my alma mater,"" Cavor said. ""It wasn't producing."" Her school, South High School, had about 800 students, although the building could handle about 2,000, Cavor said. The graduation rate was about 30%. But 12 schools throughout the Cleveland school district are restarting with the help of the federal government's School Improvement Grants, which could bring more than $36 million to Cleveland schools over four years. In 2010, the federal government provided $546 million for about 1,000 low-achieving schools across the United States. Districts could use the  money to reorganize or close down schools completely. Miami school's turnaround wins Obama's attention . In Cleveland, school officials chose to use a reorganization model for several of their schools, including Lincoln-West and Glenville high schools. To receive the funds, they had to replace the principal and rehire no more than half the school's staff. Although the academic numbers for the year haven't been analyzed yet, officials at both high schools said they're on the right path. As part of the reorganization, both schools were divided into smaller academies, each with its own principal and teachers inside the same large building. The smaller academies allow school personnel to keep better track of students, which officials say has led to a decrease in school violence. ""Lincoln-West last year was one of the schools that stayed in the media because of gang violence,"" Cavor said. For this school year, ""we actually have an 83% decline in terms of serious incidents that are happening in the building,"" said Irene Javier, one of three principals at Lincoln-West. ""That includes number of suspensions. So, it directly impacts our attendance."" And attendance affects how students learn. ""You can't be sporadic in your attendance and think that you're going to turn on the light switch and it's just going to work,"" Lincoln-West Principal Perry Myles said. Principal Maria Carlson echoes that sentiment. ""(Students) are in class, which is different from last year. They are paying attention in class, and they are getting the work done that the teachers are asking them to do,"" she said. At Lincoln-West last year, there were often six or seven police cars in the parking lot in order to manage school violence. ""Our police officers, who used to come last year because of the violence that may go on outside, are here now to control traffic. ... There's no fights out there,"" Myles said. Across town at Glenville High School there's been a similar drop in violence. ""A lot of people thought because of the different schools coming to Glenville there would be a lot more. It's actually been a lot less,"" senior Cedric Thorbes said. Glenville Principal Teresa Conley attributes part of the improvement to the smaller academy system. ""When you're trying to manage a campus, a comprehensive high school, there's no way possible you could learn 1,100 kids,"" she said. ""On my floor now, I have roughly 400. I know my 400 kids. I know them by face, I know them by name, I know the parents."" David Quolke, president of the Cleveland Teachers Union, said there are pros and cons to replacing half of the staff at public schools. ""One of the benefits of the 50% replacement that I've seen is now that we've got staff in these buildings from other schools, they are sharing strategies they believe worked at their previous school, and a lot of teachers are saying 'OK, let me try that strategy,'"" Quolke said. On the downside, it takes time for the staff to become a team. ""All of their principals are kind of learning their staff at the same time. That's one of, I think, the biggest downfalls of replacing 50% of the staff, replacing the principal and expecting immediate, good results,"" Quolke said. Closing schools and shifting teachers and students around is not an easy task, even if the school is considered a failure. When they were working on the transition plan, Cavor said, it was a challenge to convince parents that it was best for children. Parents were willing to overlook a building that was falling apart and school that was in academic trouble. ""It was almost as if some parents said 'I know the school is failing, I know it's raggedy and falling down, but the people there love my child. My child feels safe. I am comfortable sending my child here and this is OK,'"" she said. Glenville's Conley said  it was disheartening that the state report card didn't reflect teachers' hard work. Under the reorganization, she said, teachers are still working as hard as they did before, but now they are working smarter. Principal Vance Benton, who oversees ninth-graders at Glenville, said he initially lost his job in the Cleveland schools overhaul, but was rehired in a different role. ""The plan has nothing to do with the adults. At all. And it shouldn't,"" he said. ""It's all about the children and what is best for the children."" The children seem to be adapting just fine. When the students in Rosalie Spano's 10th-grade biology class were slicing up an onion to look at under a microscope, they weren't thinking about the major transition in their school system. They were more concerned with drawing what they saw and learning science. ""If you see air bubbles, you should draw air bubbles,"" Spano told them as they peered into microscopes. ""But I also want to see the onion underneath."" For all the improvements, there's a lot more work to come, Cavor said. ""While those schools are able to do some major changing and reforming,"" she said, ""that's 12 (schools) out of a hundred.""","Cleveland is working to transform its failing public schools .

"(CNN) -- Apparently, cats do rule and dogs drool. What other conclusion could any human being with a heart draw from the video in which a little cat bravely and boldly saves a boy being attacked by a dog?

Let's hope Tara inspires a generation of cat heroes around the globe -- as well as the rest of us, including those in children's literature and Hollywood -- so we no longer see cats just as lazy, fat Garfield-style layabouts, but ferocious, fierce daredevils. Move over, Superman. Tara, the movie, is coming to a theater near you soon. Cats love nothing more than to bask in the sun, literally.

"Washington (CNN) -- Lamenting he is ringing in the new year with an old concern, Chief Justice John Roberts is again warning leaders in the other two branches of government that continuing budget shortfalls and sequestration cuts will create a ""bleak"" future for the fair administration of justice in the nation's federal courts. In his annual year-end report on the judiciary, Roberts on Tuesday said the courts have already made significant unilateral cuts in funding, adding a prolonged reduction by Congress would be extremely hard to overcome. ""I would like to choose a fresher topic, but duty calls,"" said the 58-year-old chief justice. ""The budget remains the single most important issue facing the courts."" ""What would be the consequence of forgoing this [modest proposed increase in] funding in favor of a hard freeze at the sequester level? The future would be bleak: the deep cuts to judiciary programs would remain in place."" Roberts made his remarks in a 15-page summary of U.S. courts, part of his role as head of the entire federal judiciary. The effects of the so-called sequester in the past year have been particularly hard on the third branch of government-- from civil and bankruptcy cases being delayed; furloughs of hundreds of court staff and federal public defenders; and reductions in courthouse security and monitoring of criminals on probation. Nationwide, the judiciary's budget had been cut nearly $350 million for the fiscal year that went through September, just from the sequester. ""Emergency measures"" have been imposed by the Judicial Conference, the federal court's internal policy arm. ""In the civil and bankruptcy venues, further consequences would include commercial uncertainty, lost opportunities and unvindicated rights,"" said Roberts. ""In the criminal venues, those consequences pose a genuine threat to public safety."" After cost reductions, what next? Weeks of furloughs from sequestration and the partial government shutdown meant up to a 24% reduction in staffing in some judicial branch offices through the fall, when Congress enacted another continuing resolution in October to restore some of the lapses in federal funding. Congressional leaders said they hoped to finish the appropriations process for fiscal year 2014 by January 15. Roberts noted the judicial branch generally receives less attention when it comes to its spending, but said an ""aggressive"" cost-containment strategy has been in place since 2004. That includes new plans to close or downsize 31 federal court facilities across the country, to reduce work space and rent costs. But the chief justice said such discretionary internal cutbacks can only go so far, since most of the courts' ""core functions"" are constitutionally and statutorily required, including hearing all criminal, civil, and bankruptcy cases presented to them. ""In the coming weeks, and into the future, I encourage the President and Congress to be attentive to the needs of the judicial branch and avert the adverse consequences that would result from funding the judiciary below its minimal needs,"" he said. While the chief justice continued his respectful tone in the face of fiscal constraints, a number of federal judges have told CNN privately in recent months of their anger and frustration -- juggling rising caseloads and responsibilities with diminishing resources. Part of that unease has to do with their lack of political clout. The federal courts only make up two-tenths of 1% of the entire federal budget, and judges by custom stay out of partisan policy fights. But many do not like how the other two branches are handling the fiscal crisis in their sphere. Looking for a 'happy ending' The federal court system and its administrative offices operate on an annual budget of about $7 billion. That includes judges trying and hearing cases and appeals, both criminal and civil; managing pretrial, defender, and probation offices; and maintaining the bankruptcy court system. Most of the money -- about 62% -- goes for personnel costs. Roberts noted the courts earlier this month submitted a budget proposal to Congress that was $180 million less than their original plan, which he said ""strikes a fair balance"" with other competing funding requests. ""It takes no imagination to see that failing to meet the judiciary's essential requirements undermines the public's confidence in all three branches of government,"" he concluded. ""Both 'A Christmas Carol' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' have happy endings. We are encouraged that the story of funding for the federal judiciary -- though perhaps not as gripping a tale -- will too."" There are 874 full-time, life-tenured federal judges, including the nine-member Supreme Court, the district and appeals courts, and the nine-member Court of International Trade-- part of a 35,000 federal court workforce nationwide. Past year-end reports from the current Chief Justice of the United States (the official title) have focused on frozen salaries, rising caseloads and court security. These summaries have been an annual tradition for about four decades. They were begun by the late Chief Justice Warren Burger as a way to speak to the executive branch and Congress, the judiciary itself, and the public at large.","Chief Justice John Roberts issues his annual report .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Hyundai Motor's labor union voted to accept a wage deal with the company Monday, ending four months of negotiations. The strikes, in July and August, were very costly to South Korea's largest automaker, cutting production by more than 80,000 vehicles. This cost it 1.7 trillion won ($1.5 billion), Hyundai said in a statement. One of the key issues at stake was night shifts. Hyundai has agreed to abolish overnight shifts and will rearrange the working day from March next year into two shifts, the latter ending at 1.10 a.m. The moved was welcomed by union officials. Spokesperson Kwon Oh-Il told CNN, ""This is the first time shifts have changed in 45 years. ""We've been pushing to change this working shift system for the past ten years. Union members will have more time to spend with their family and can invest more time in their daily lives."" The union also expressed hope the deal struck could signal future changes for other industries as well. As part of Monday's deal, Hyundai agreed to a 5.4% increase in basic pay, a 350% bonus increase and a one-time payment to each employee of 9.6 million Korean won ($8,468).

"(CNN) -- Everyone has that friend or family member who unwittingly still posts publicly on Facebook. It's not that they're over-sharers, they just haven't bothered to keep up with the social network's ever-changing and often confusing privacy settings. Facebook highlighted some of its minor new and future privacy features on Tuesday, including one aimed squarely at the people left behind by complicated settings. A new pop-up message featuring a cartoon dinosaur will appear for Facebook users who haven't tinkered with their privacy settings in a while. When someone who always shares publicly posts a link or update, Facebook will double check that they really want to share it with that audience. The company's privacy team is also testing other tweaks, including updating mobile and Web designs with more prominent audience controls, a new default privacy setting for cover photos (old images used to be public, now they're private), and a message clarifying who can see an image you post when your friends re-share it. In its 10 years, the social media company has amassed more than a billion users. That's a lot of people to please, but one area that has received consistent cries of dissatisfaction is privacy. When Facebook updates a setting or adds a feature, there is often a privacy backlash, especially when new sharing settings make information public by default. The company's motto, ""Move fast and break things"" led to broken trust with users. To counteract that sense of wariness, Facebook is making sure future privacy considerations aren't just part of a settings screen, but also taken into account by engineers making new features and at the infrastructure level. ""We understand that some people have felt that Facebook privacy has changed too much in the past,"" said Mike Nowak, a product manager on Facebook's privacy team. Not changing settings ever again isn't an option, so Facebook is searching for new ways to improve the experience that won't anger or alienate users. The company has been running extensive surveys to find out what kind of privacy experiences people are having on the site and in the app. It currently runs 4,000 surveys a day in 27 languages. Squeezing useful information out of these surveys can be difficult. Facebook engineering manager Raylene Yung said people will commonly just write in the word ""privacy"" when asked what they want to improve. However, enough users have managed to articulate what situations upset them. People said when they share things on Facebook they feel their info is shared with more people than they wanted. Facebook knows giving those people a sense of control is key to keep them from leaving the service. ""At the end of the day ... when people have an unpleasant surprise like this it's bad for them and it's bad for us,"" said Nowak.","Facebook is testing minor privacy settings changes to give users more control .

"(CNN) -- A dizzying number of trackers are available for health and lifestyle. Enthusiasts can now chart every calorie burned or consumed, have their genetics broken down and backdated for centuries, or follow their stress levels through a family holiday. But while our waking moments become ever more transparent, the one-third of our life spent asleep has remained off limits. Throughout history, dreams have proved resistant to interrogation. It is not known why we sleep at all beyond a general need to recharge and avoid the negative consequences of not sleeping, while an explanation for the substance of dreams has proved even more elusive, still dominated by the theories of wish fulfillment espoused by Freud and Jung. But now, digital innovations are picking up the challenge. The Shadow app seeks to connect users with their dreams, and to make them sociable. Its first function is as an alarm clock that wakes the user gradually over up to 30 minutes, easing them into consciousness so as to preserve more of the dream state, rather than shattering it abruptly. Dream researchers estimate that 95% of dreams vanish upon awakening. Once the user touches their phone it begins recording and invites them to share the still-fresh memories of the night, prompting them with questions. The input is scanned for keywords and patterns so that the user can build a picture of their experiences over time. More ambitiously, their personal data is anonymized and sent with gender and geographic data to cloud servers in the hope of building a global dream database. In this social network people can compare and discuss their experiences, while trends can be identified and analyzed. ""We want to know what the most popular dream is in Japan, or Cambodia, at a given time"", Shadow founder and CEO Hunter Lee Soik said. ""You can see the dreams from each city organized by keywords and numbers"". Currently on a very limited launch of around 1,000 users, the data gathered is already offering insights. ""Last week the most dreams were recorded in New York City and the most common subject was relationships. It makes sense that as we are social creatures, we are social in our dreams too."" Soik wants his creation to be ""a whole other psychological layer"" of quantified technology that people can use in conjunction with their daytime devices for a more complete picture. The science of dreams . Scientific rigor is being applied to the project through specialists in psychology, neurology, sleep and behaviorism from leading academic institutions such as Harvard and Berkeley, who will analyze the data and contribute their findings. One study will assess environmental impact on dreams, whether through temperature or war. A similar project is being undertaken by Professor Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire, a sleep specialist and the UK's only Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology. But in his case the goal is to actively shape dreams. Wiseman's Dream: ON app monitors sleeping movement in order to identify the REM stage, the state of deep sleep which is most fertile for dreams and signaled by the cessation of neurotransmitters that control activity such as seratonin, and paralysis of movement but for the eyes. It targets the last and longest of these stages with a range of sound input from ""peaceful garden"" to ""zombie attack"". The Professor employed double blind tests and received over a million submissions from users, and noted a significant impact. ""It affected the emotional tone of the dream rather than content"", says Wiseman. ""Pleasant nature sounds resulted in more pleasant dreams than jagged sounds. The more people used it the more effective it is. It's hit and miss because we're targeting REM from movement, but after 20 soundscapes they get used to it, they are less likely to be worried or woken up."" There is a therapeutic function, as bad dreams can be an indicator mental health problems. ""You can wake up in a better mood, but also people with depression tend to dream more, and more negatively than non-depressives, which could be counter-acted."" Lucid pilots control trips . Wiseman is candid about the limits of his method, but new wearable devices are making far grander claims. The Aurora headband is one of several innovations to smash its crowd-funding goal with the promise of lucid dreams -- consciousness while asleep. Aurora measures sleeping brain activity through EEG reading, and provides physical prompts to the user once they are in the suggestible REM state. While the product is yet to be systematically tested on humans, lucid dreams are a proven phenomenon, with over 50% of adults believed to have experienced one. Efforts to teach people how to access such dreams have been successful, and even electronically induced in clinical trials. One of the earliest scientists to establish the existence of lucid dreaming, Stephen LaBerge, will soon launch his own wearable tool the NovaDreamer2, based on decades of research data. The appetite for such innovations is huge, shown in the millions of dollars raised for them in crowdfunding, as well as the thriving online communities that use lucid dreams for anything from thrill-seeking experiment to self-analysis and meditation. ""What's happening now is a digital dream movement"", says Ryan Hurd, author of 'Dream Like a Boss' and board member of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD). ""We can fulfill a lot of potential that hasn't been realized as there is a lot more quantifiable data."" Hurd sees vast potential in seeking to influence and participate in dreams, pointing to tests that show athletes can improve performance by practicing in their dreams, artists can improve their creativity, and everyone can gain insights. ""People are becoming aware of how important sleep and dreams are for mood, cognitive performance, physical health, and we are beginning to see them enter the quantified self paradigm,"" says Hurd. Neuroimaging shows physical form of dreams . Physically identifying dream activity in the brain has seemed hopelessly ambitious but this too is now entering the realm of the possible. Researchers from the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, have been able to interpret EEG waves into simple images with around 70% accuracy after extensively monitoring the patterns in sleeping brains and learning to recognize them. ""It is hard to identify the neural origin of dreaming, but at least we can now read out part of dream contents from activity patterns in the visual cortex, which is normally active when we see objects and scenes during wakefulness,"" says lead researcher Yukiyasu Kamitani. Currently the images are crude, black and white shapes, but Kamitani sees vast potential for improvement and application. ""More aspects of dream contents, such as action, emotion, and narrative structure, will be decoded with more sophisticated experiments and analysis methods."" ""The results may be relevant to learning, memory, or mood. If so, the interpretation may serve as a marker for cognitive capacity and mental health...It will be helpful to study the effect of particular dream contents on subsequent waking experience."" The tantalizing prospect of laying bare our unconscious mind has never been closer. But the more we can shape and monitor our dreams, the main issue could become just how well we want to know ourselves. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"(CNN) -- Syria says results will be available Monday from its referendum on changes to the country's constitution, a vote taken as government troops continued pounding the opposition stronghold of Homs and other cities. Opposition activists reported at least 55 deaths across the country on Sunday, including 25 in Homs, which has been under bombardment for more than three weeks. Despite the ongoing violence, it held a vote on what the government of President Bashar al-Assad calls a move toward reform. Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar said the voting ran ""normally"" in most provinces, and turnout was ""huge ... except in some areas,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Results from the vote would be announced Monday evening, SANA said. But analysts and protesters ridicule the constitutional referendum as window dressing, the latest in a series of superficial measures intended to pacify al-Assad's critics. Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamado, a spokesman for the rebel Free Syrian Army, said civilians reported government authorities were pressuring them to support the new constitution. Al-Assad's family has ruled Syria for four decades. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the president is using the referendum ""to get people to leave the streets"" after a nearly year-long uprising. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, has said about 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown on opposition last March. The Syrian government says more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by ""terrorists"" during that period, including seven ""martyrs"" who were buried Sunday, SANA reported. CNN and other media outlets cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because Syria has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. But the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. In Homs, the International Committee of the Red Cross has been trying for days to negotiate even a temporary cease-fire to deliver humanitarian aid into the Homs and its hardest-hit neighborhood, Baba Amr, without success. ""The negotiations continue -- they never stop. We remain very hopeful to get back into Baba Amr, but the negotiations have been difficult,"" said Saleh Dabkah, a spokesman for the local partner organization, the Red Crescent. Sunday's toll also included nine deaths in Hama, seven in Daraa and 11 in Idlib, where Syrian tanks began shelling the city early Sunday, according to the LCC. Syria announced the referendum amid intense international pressure to halt the bloodshed and open up its regime to reforms. But among the changes in Sunday's referendum was one article that states ""the law shall regulate the provisions and procedures related to the formation of political parties."" ""Carrying out any political activity or forming any political parties or groupings on the basis of religious, sectarian, tribal, regional, class-based, professional, or on discrimination based on gender, origin, race or color may not be undertaken,"" it continues. The language suggests government permission is needed to form a party and excludes a number of people and groups from political activity, Tabler said. ""It's not going to change the fact that it's a minority-dominated situation,"" he said. ""It will remain a presidential system with powers vested in the hands of the president."" But former Syrian lawmaker George Jabbour said ""clause 8 of the new draft of the constitution is the essential point"" of the document. It ""allows a multi-party system"" instead of leaving the ruling Baath Party as ""the leading party of the society and the state,"" as current constitution does. Jabbour said ""special committees will be formed to look into the licensing of new parties in line with the new constitution."" As for presidential elections, they ""will be competitive since there is no leading party anymore, and all the parties' candidates are eligible provided their candidacy is endorsed by at least 35 members of parliament,"" Jabbour said. Meanwhile, the opposition Syrian National Council urged Syria's Alawite community, the minority sect to which al-Assad belongs, to join the revolt and promised their rights would be protected in a post-Assad Syria. ""The Alawites remain an important component of Syria, and will continue to enjoy the same rights as other citizens as we build one nation of Christians, Muslims, and other sects,"" an SNC statement declared. ""The regime will not be successful in pitting us against one another. We are determined to unite our society, and the first step is for us to extend our hand to our Alawite brothers and sisters, to build in Syria a nation governed by citizenship and the rule of law."" The opposition council acknowledged that the revolt had been tinged with ""sectarian strife"" -- but it blamed that on al-Assad's ""brutal violence, which has led to an increase in sectarianism."" ""However, it is important to emphasize that the first step in halting sectarian strife in Syria is to overthrow the regime,"" it said. ""We in the SNC consider members of the Alawite sect to be an essential element of Syria's cultural and ethnic fabric."" And U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that diplomatic efforts were under way to peel away support from Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. ""We have a lot of contacts, as do other countries -- a lot of sources within the Syrian government and the business community and minority communities -- and our message is the same to all of them: 'You cannot continue to support this illegitimate regime because it is going to fall,' "" Clinton told CNN. But she said the SNC was not yet the kind of united opposition movement that toppled Moammar Gadhafi with international help in Libya last year. The Libyan opposition base in the city of Beghazi gave the international community ""an address"" to deal with, Clinton said. ""We don't have that in Syria,"" she said. ""The Syrian National Council is doing the best it can but obviously it is not yet a united opposition."" And former U.S. national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski also cautioned against seeing Syria as another Libya. ""We shouldn't be careless in any comparisons between Assad and Gadhafi. Gadhafi was far more vulnerable than Assad is. I think it's far from clear yet that Assad can, in fact, be overthrown at this stage,"" Brzezinski told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" He recommended letting regional powers take the lead on whether to arm Syria's opposition. ""I would be very much guided by the Turks and the Saudis. The Turks have the regional role to play. They're assuming that role. They have intelligent leadership,"" he said. ""The choice of how to act and particularly if one is to be engaged in some fashion militarily, I think, has to be made first by them and also the Saudis, and not first by us."" Questioned about the brutality that the government has unleashed since demonstrations began nearly a year ago, Brzezinksi said that history shows brutality often works.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine corporal who was declared a deserter twice has turned himself in to authorities and is on his way to Virginia. Cpl. Wassef Ali Hassoun failed to report for duty in January 2005 at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, the Marine Corps said in a statement. He is expected to arrive in Norfolk, Virginia, on Sunday. ""The Naval Criminal Investigative Service worked with Cpl. Hassoun to turn himself in and return to the United States to face charges under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice,"" the statement read. Hassoun, 34, is believed to have been in Lebanon for much of the time he was gone, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to talk to the media. It was not immediately clear where he turned himself in to authorities. Before his 2005 disappearance, he had disappeared in Iraq, just one year earlier. The Marines charged Hassoun, who served as a truck driver and translator, with desertion and theft. Hassoun denied deserting then and was not held in confinement. Marine officials did not believe he was a flight risk because he had turned himself in in Lebanon. Hassoun disappeared from a Marine camp outside the Iraqi city of Falluja in June 2004. Originally listed as a deserter, his status was changed to ""captured"" after the release of a videotape showing him blindfolded, with a sword hanging over his head. Islamist Web sites reported that he had been executed by an Iraqi militant group, but Hassoun turned up with relatives in Lebanon and was returned to the United States. He failed to report in North Carolina after authorized leave to see his family in West Jordan, Utah, Marine official said. Celebrated at first, Bergdahl's release raises questions .

"(CNN) -- Evidence of atrocities including mass killings emerged Tuesday in South Sudan, and the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to send thousands more troops to protect civilians in the young nation convulsed by violence. The council's vote could nearly double the size of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the country, allowing for up to 12,500 military troops and 1,323 police to patrol there. ""Even with additional capabilities, we will not be able to protect every civilian in need in South Sudan,"" Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said after the unanimous Security Council vote that urged the clashing parties to seek a peaceful solution. ""There is no military solution to this conflict,"" Ban said, later adding that ""in this season of peace, I urge the leaders of South Sudan to act for peace."" U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Toby Lanzer tweeted that more accounts were reaching him of human rights abuses amid the widening violence that has stoked fears of an all-out civil war in the world's newest country. ""Mass extrajudicial killings, the targeting of individuals on the basis of their ethnicity and arbitrary detentions have been documented in recent days,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. Ban also cited reported rapes and mass graves, and warned that such atrocities could constitute war crimes. One U.N. official saw 14 bodies at a mass grave in Bentiu and another 20 on a nearby riverbank, said Ravina Shamdasani, a UNHCR spokeswoman for the commissioner. ""As for the other two reported graves in Juba, we are still working to verify but it is very difficult, and there are reports that some bodies may have already been burned,"" she said. South Sudan's breathtaking descent into widespread conflict comes a little more than two years after the nation was ushered into existence with help from international powers after decades of civil war between separatists in the oil-rich south and Sudan's northern government. Fighting began midmonth after President Salva Kiir said forces loyal to the country's dismissed vice president, Riek Machar, launched a coup attempt. Kiir and Machar are longtime rivals. In an interview with CNN, Machar denied there was a coup attempt. South Sudan has suffered from sporadic violence since its formation in 2011. But the broad nature of this conflict and the intensity of the violence -- which U.N. officials say has taken on ethnic overtones -- have raised fears of another genocide along the lines of Rwanda, the African nation where 800,000 people were slaughtered in 1994, according to the United Nations. Ban said Tuesday that he was asking countries contributing troops and other support to existing missions to allow their forces to be shifted to the South Sudan mission as part of the additions approved by the Security Council's 15-0 vote. He said the request to borrow from other missions was intended to speed up the often lengthy process of getting them authorized and moved into place. ""We need at least five battalions and police officers and attack helicopters and utility helicopters, transport airplanes,"" Ban said. He also noted casualties to U.N. forces in South Sudan in the past week, including three members of the U.N. Mission in South Sudan injured Tuesday at the U.N. base in Bor. Marines on standby . Meanwhile, about 150 U.S. Marines flew from Spain to Djibouti, hundreds of miles to the east, to prepare for possible participation in helping evacuate Americans. A U.S. defense official said 50 of the Marines moved closer to South Sudan by going to Entebbe in Uganda, CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr reported Tuesday. In a statement, the U.S. military's Africa Command said Monday it was positioning the Marines to be able to respond should conditions deteriorate even more. The decision grew out of the U.S. experience in Benghazi, Libya, where an attack last year killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. No U.S. forces were close enough to respond quickly. ""One of the lessons learned from the tragic events in Benghazi was that we needed to be better postured, in order to respond to developing or crisis situations, if needed. These precautionary movements will allow us to do just that,"" the command said in its statement. According to a senior administration official, 380 Americans and about another 300 third-country nationals have been evacuated. ""Based on registration, there are American citizens in other towns and areas throughout South Sudan. We are trying to track down how many may still be there. Many may have gotten out on their own. We are trying to track that down,"" the official said. On Sunday, all Americans who showed up at the U.N. camp in the flashpoint town of Bor were evacuated safely, the State Department said. A State Department official said about 15 Americans were flown out Sunday. U.N. civilian staff were moved from a compound in Bor to Juba, the capital, on Saturday. Continued fighting . Sudanese forces retook Bor after a nearly six-hour fight Tuesday, Defense Minister Kuol Manyang Juuk said. During his Christmas address to the public, President Kiir confirmed that the military had reclaimed Bor. There was no immediate independent confirmation. Sudanese military spokesman Col. Philip Aguer also predicted Tuesday that government forces would soon recapture the oil-rich Unity state. Government forces and opposition fighters also clashed Tuesday in Malakal, he said. The United Nations said fighting had spread to five of South Sudan's 10 states. It described the situation in Juba as ""stable but tense,"" but said conditions in Jonglei were deteriorating, with reports of clashes between armed factions near Bor, the site of a U.N. peacekeeping base. Conditions were also tense in Bentiu, where the United Nations reported military units on the move amid sporadic fighting. The United Nations also said it had credible reports civilians were being attacked and killed based on their ethnicity, and reported that private property and the facilities of some humanitarian groups were being looted. Kiir called for calm and unity in his Christmas message. He expressed willingness for a peaceful settlement of differences with his former vice president and all other groups who have taken up arms against government forces. Humanitarian concerns . Meanwhile, U.N. officials struggled to make accommodations for some 45,000 people crowding its compounds seeking shelter from the violence. Nearly as many people were seeking shelter elsewhere. U.N. officials said they have concerns about health conditions among those fleeing the fighting and urged assistance for medical care and other needs. The U.N.'s Lanzer, who visited the base in Bor on Monday, said in a statement he had heard ""heartbreaking accounts of people's suffering."" Ban said Monday the United Nations would do its utmost to protect civilians. ""The U.N. stood with you on your road to independence,"" he said in a message to the people of South Sudan. ""We will stay with you now. I know that the current situation is causing great and growing fear. You are seeing people leave the country amid increasing chaos. The U.N. will stay with you."" Diplomatic efforts . Secretary of State John Kerry has spoken with Machar in a bid to get talks started between the former vice president and the government, a senior State Department official told CNN. ""He urged him to implement a cease-fire and begin mediated political talks,"" the official said. Ethiopia's foreign minister is leading regional leaders' efforts to find a political resolution to the crisis, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement Tuesday. Hague said he'd sent a senior British diplomat to Juba to support the political process. ""South Sudan was a country born amid hopes of increased peace and prosperity for its people,"" Hague said. ""The gains made over the past two years should not be thrown away."" The European Union's foreign affairs minister, Catherine Ashton, said the violence threatens to send South Sudan ""spiraling into a disaster for both its own people and the region."" ""Such a situation can, and must be avoided,"" she said in a statement. As Ban did Monday, she called for all sides to begin talks to resolve their differences. ""This dialogue must include all groups, including those whose leaders are currently imprisoned and those in revolt against the government,"" she said. ""The use of force will achieve nothing, and all must use their influence to immediately cease hostilities and prevent further fighting which will only cause the further shedding of innocent blood."" CNN's Khushbu Shah, Mariano Castillo, Jennifer Rizzo, Marie-Louise Gumuchian, Barbara Starr, Nana Karikari-apau, Salma Abdelaziz and Antonia Mortensen and journalist Mading Ngor in Juba, South Sudan, contributed to this report.","NEW: A senior British diplomat arrives in Juba to help with negotiations .

"(CNN) -- Karen Schlieve and her fiancÃ© were supposed to be married in July on a pavilion in St. Paul, Minnesota, against the backdrop of the Mississippi River. But Mother Nature had other plans. Today, that same pavilion is under several feet of water, in a surge of flooding that has swept through several Minnesota towns. At the height of wedding season, Schlieve must now find a different venue. ""I never would have thought, never would have imagined this would happen,"" Shlieve told CNN affiliate WCCO. In several cities across the state, communities are moving fast to protect their neighborhoods from rising floodwaters. In St. Paul, residents are using pumps to remove water from their properties, said meteorologist Chris Franks at the National Weather Service. And along the Minnesota River -- a tributary of the Mississippi River -- the community of Henderson has only one road to get around town, Franks said. Residents of Prior Lake are continuing to pile sandbags up to 5 feet high to protect their homes and businesses. People, wading through the high floodwaters, are building dikes to prepare for the rain forecasted for Saturday and Sunday. ""The summers is pretty much over,"" said Gil Roscoe to CNN affiliate KARE. ""Nobody wants to swim in this now."" A particularly wet year is likely to blame for the floods. With just over 25 inches of rain since the beginning of 2014, the Twin Cities are on track to have the wettest year on record, Franks said. And heavy rain continued to fall in several cities -- Prior Lake included -- through the start of the weekend. But there could be an end in sight. Though the torrential rains continue, they'll likely have little to no effect on water levels because the Minnesota rivers are starting to recede, Franks said. ""It's a very slow process, but the water levels are indeed going out.""","Several Minnesota communities are under water .

"London (CNN) -- After a fourth consecutive night of violence that convulsed much of London and spread elsewhere in Britain, the scene before dawn Wednesday was largely calm, a tentative calm enforced by thousands of police. Hours before, police reported outbreaks of violence in Wolverhampton and West Bromwich, about 100 miles north of London, and in the northwestern city of Manchester. There, a library and supermarket were ablaze, said Jeff Gill from the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue. In West Midlands, 80 people were arrested and 19 of them were charged, said Sara Astbury, a spokeswoman for the West Midlands Police Department. In Nottinghamshire, 30 arrests were made as hundreds of police sought to handle more than 1,000 reports of incidents -- most of them related to rowdy behavior by roaming bands of youths -- throughout the city and in Canning, Clifton, Basford and Radford, police said Tuesday in a statement. Eight people were arrested in connection with the firebombing of Canning Circus police station, it added. Nottinghamshire Assistant Chief Constable Paul Scarrott, who led the police operation, described the events in the town more than 100 miles north of London as ""gratuitous, senseless and wholly unjustified acts of wanton criminality."" Cameron, who cut short his vacation in Italy to hold an emergency meeting Tuesday, recalled lawmakers from their summer break. He is to hold a meeting of his crisis-response committee at 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) Wednesday. Parliament is to meet Thursday. London Mayor Boris Johnson, who cut short his holiday in North America, called the violence ""utterly appalling."" The riots were sparked by the shooting death on Thursday of 29-year-old Mark Duggan, a black man. Officers from Operation Trident -- the Metropolitan Police unit that deals with gun crime in London's black communities -- stopped the cab in the working-class, predominantly Afro-Caribbean district of Tottenham during an attempted arrest, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said. Soon after, shots were fired and Duggan, a father of four, was killed. Shooting deaths are rare in England. The IPCC said Tuesday an illegal firearm had been found at the scene, with a ""bulleted cartridge"" in the magazine, but there was ""no evidence"" it was fired during the incident. A bullet that lodged in a radio carried by an officer was police issue, the IPCC said. ""A post-mortem examination concluded that Mr. Duggan was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest. He also received a second gunshot wound to his right bicep,"" the IPCC said, without saying who fired the bullets nor why police had stopped the cab. The man's family and friends, who blamed police for the death, had gathered peacefully Saturday outside the Tottenham police station to protest. The protest soon devolved into violence as demonstrators -- whose numbers included whites and blacks -- tossed petrol bombs, looted stores and burned police cars. Violence continued in isolated pockets on Sunday, spread Monday to other parts of the nation and continued Tuesday. Metropolitan Police and Duggan's family have appealed for calm. Police said they were stretched thin as they tried to respond to emergency calls -- which were up nearly 400% Tuesday. British Prime Minister David Cameron's vow of action to quell rioting in Britain's cities was backed up by an increased police presence -- about 16,000 officers were set to be on London's streets Tuesday night -- twice the number on Monday night. ""People should be in no doubt that we will do everything necessary to restore order to Britain's streets and make them safe for the law-abiding,"" said Cameron, who called the events ""criminality, pure and simple."" The trouble -- described by police as ""'copycat criminal activity"" -- takes place against a backdrop of austerity measures and budget cuts that have led to high rates of unemployment, particularly among the nation's youth. Some 685 people have been arrested in London since the violence began, police said late Tuesday. With Metropolitan Police detention cells full, authorities were taking those they arrested to facilities belonging to surrounding police forces. Of those arrested, 111 have been charged. Most of the charges relate to burglary, with other offenses ranging from assault on a police officer to possession of an offensive weapon and handling stolen goods. In all, 111 police officers and five police dogs have been reported injured, according to a police statement Tuesday afternoon. ""Many officers are still undergoing hospital treatment, some requiring surgery,"" it said. ""Injuries range from fractured bones, serious head injuries, concussion, cuts and sprains, even injured eyes from smashed and thrown glass."" Apparently, some people are not depending on police for their security. Amazon UK reported that sales of aluminum baseball bats had skyrocketed since the violence broke out. In Hackney, where Monday's disturbances first broke out, Graciela Watson, a mother of two, watched aghast from her home as hooligans, known as ""yobs"" in Britain, barricaded a normally quiet residential street with burning trash cans and clashed repeatedly with police for more than an hour. ""It seemed like a war zone,"" she said. ""There were youths grabbing bricks from our front wall and hurling them at police."" A resident of Clapham Junction in southwest London, who did not wish to be identified for fear of reprisals, told CNN he had seen groups make repeated trips overnight to his street to fill their cars with looted goods, including televisions and clothes. The resident said this went on for several hours until police used armored vehicles to disperse them. ""At first I was just, 'OK, it's a bunch of kids letting off steam.' But once they started heavy, heavy looting, and it started getting out of hand, I started getting a bit concerned,"" he said. ""This is not something that's typical of our neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination."" Sociology professor Paul Bagguley told CNN that a disproportionate number of young people appeared to be involved in the unrest and that the looters appeared to be motivated by greed. But people who have spoken to local ethnic minorities also talked of a sense that tension had been building over months, he said, with some upset by police ""stop-and-search"" tactics. A community cleanup effort began Tuesday morning in London, with organizers using Twitter to get volunteers together in their local areas, using the hashtag #riotcleanup. Organizer Dan Thompson, who runs a network aiding small businesses on the south coast, said many thousands of people were supporting efforts to help shopkeepers. ""I thought the quickest, best thing was just to help them get cleaned up this morning, get trading again,"" he said. ""It's a city people love, and to see it destroyed in the way it has been is shocking stuff."" Questions have been raised about what the disturbances may mean for security during next year's Olympic Games, which London is preparing to host. A spokeswoman for the London 2012 organizing committee told CNN: ""A lot of detailed work has taken place regarding security plans for the Games, and we will continue to review them together with the Met Police and the Home Office over the coming year."" Tottenham has been the site of riots before. In 1985, Floyd Jarrett, who was of Afro-Caribbean origin, was stopped by police near the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham on suspicion of driving with a forged tax disc, a document all British vehicles must carry. A few hours later, officers raided the nearby home of his mother, who collapsed and died during the raid. Rioting erupted shortly afterward, and a police officer, Constable Keith Blakelock, was killed. Like the current violence, a protest outside Tottenham Police Station sparked the 1985 conflict.

"(CNN) -- A car bomb exploded outside a Foreign Ministry building in the Libyan city of Benghazi Wednesday, state media said, on the anniversary of an assault on the U.S. Consulate there that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. The blast did not cause any casualties but blew away large parts of the building's facade, said Col. Abdullah Al Zaydi, spokesman for the Joint Security Task Force in Benghazi, according to Libya's state news agency, LANA. Al Zaydi said the explosion was very powerful and destroyed the vehicle used for the bombing, which contained a large quantity of explosives, the news agency said. The blast also damaged a branch of the Central Bank of Libya and slightly injured one of its security guards, the bank said. The branch director, Abdel Qader Mohammed, said the explosion caused ""material damage"" to the building, but its computer systems were not affected. Fast facts: The Benghazi Consulate attack . Benghazi resident Sami Berriwen told CNN he heard the blast in the eastern city at about 7 a.m. Berriwen, a university student, said that if the explosion had happened just an hour later, the street would have been full of people. He said most Benghazi residents walk the street to get to school and to work, but because it was early, no one was out yet. Berriwen said he saw a fire truck but no casualties or ambulances at the scene. Diplomatic missions and security officials have repeatedly been the targets of attacks in Benghazi, leading most Westerners to leave. In January, gunmen targeted the car of the Italian consul general in Benghazi, but no one was injured. Bomb attacks also occurred last year on a U.N. convoy, as well as on a convoy carrying the British ambassador. In November, unknown gunmen assassinated the city's temporary security director. Other towns and cities, including the capital, Tripoli, have also seen frequent attacks. In recent days, scores of U.S. Marines were moved closer to Libya to help beef up security before of the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and the first anniversary of the attack on the Benghazi consulate. Two U.S. officials told CNN on Monday that 250 combat-ready Marines had moved from their base in Moron, Spain, to the U.S. naval installation at Sigonella, Italy. That would enable them to reach Tripoli in three to four hours in the event of a crisis. Other U.S. forces are helping boost security at various embassies in the region, since the period around September 11 is seen as a time of greater threat to U.S. interests. The attack at the Benghazi compound has been a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain before the November 2012 election. A report by the U.N. secretary-general on the U.N. Support Mission in Libya, released this month, highlights the continuing security concerns and political polarization in Libya following the overthrow of strongman leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The status of the revolutionary fighters who helped to oust Gadhafi remains unclear, the process of transitional justice is almost stalled, the country's borders are leaky and there are many unsecured weapons, adding to the instability, it said. ""The continuing volatile security situation in Libya in general, and in the eastern and southern parts of the country in particular, is a source of grave concern,"" it said. ""Targeted political assassinations, criminal activity and attacks and threats against the diplomatic community continue to plague the country, including Tripoli. The protection of the civilian population and the enforcement of law need to be reaffirmed as a national priority.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- President Xi Jinping promised citizens his government will pursue the ""Chinese dream,"" in a keynote speech as the National People's Congress came to a close on Sunday. ""We must make persistent efforts, press ahead with indomitable will, continue to push forward the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and strive to achieve the Chinese dream of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua. XI spoke in crisp, clear Mandarin, in relatively plain language, in keeping with his desire to drop the jargon traditionally sprinkled through official speeches and text. In his speech, Xi paid tribute to his predecessor, Hu Jintao, 70, who is retiring, commending his ""outstanding contributions"" over the years. Xi paused to allow a long applause from the 3,000 delegates in the Great Hall of the People as Hu stood up and took a bow. Xi's speech was followed by the first news conference by Premier Li Keqiang who, like Xi, was confirmed as one of the nation's new leaders during the meeting. They are replacing Hu and Wen Jiabao, who led the country for 10 years. During the question and answer session broadcast to millions nationwide, Li addressed China's relationship with the United States and recent friction over allegations that Chinese hackers had targeted U.S. networks. Common interests between the U.S and China far outweigh the differences, he said, and stressed the need to maintain friendly ties. On the issue of hacking, Li took exception to a reporter's question, saying it presumed guilt. ""This is a worldwide problem and in fact China itself a main target. We are opposed to such activities,"" he said. ""I think we should not make groundless accusations against each other and spend more time doing practical things that contribute to cyber security."" In front of hundreds of local and foreign journalists in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Li said the new government was seeking to curb its own power. ""This is demanded by the government and wanted by the people. We are determined to make that sacrifice ... we will keep our promise."" Li acknowledged that shaking up the system would be difficult -- ""sometimes stirring vested interests may be more difficult than stirring the soul"" -- but that the government had no choice but to act. He said the aim was to create a fairer country. ""Whatever kind of wealth creator you are -- as long as you compete on a level playing field and conduct your business in a clear and honest way then you will be able to taste success,"" he said. During visits to communities, he said, locals complained that they had to seek approval from several departments to get something done. About 1,700 items still require the approval of state council departments, he said, and his government plans to cut that by a third. Echoing recent comments from the president, Li said the government would lead by example, reducing spending on government offices, buildings, travel and hospitality. Instead, money would be redirected toward social spending. ""We need to win the trust of the people by promoting frugality,"" Li said. He said the government would strive to be ""the guardian of social fairness,"" and work to narrow what he called the ""two biggest gaps"" between the people; urban and rural dwellers, and people from different regions. ""We need to raise the level at which social security funds are managed. And in the area of medical and old age insurance, we need to make sure that people can reimburse their expenses and transfer their accounts to where they currently reside."" Achieving economic stability remained the government's priority, the premier said, while repeating economic targets this year of 7.5% annual growth. ""Our trade will continue to grow and even at a high speed in the years ahead,"" Li said. "" That will create enormous opportunities for the world."" However, economic growth will not come at the cost of the environment, he said, adding that complaints about pollution and tainted food supplies had been heard.

"(CNN)  -- A rising Canadian folk singer was killed by coyotes this week in a national park in Nova Scotia, a park spokesman said Thursday. Taylor Mitchell, 19, was at the beginning of the Skyline Trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park on Tuesday afternoon when she was attacked, according to Chip Bird, the Parks Canada field unit superintendent for Cape Breton. Bird said hikers saw the coyotes attacking Mitchell and called 911. She was airlifted to a hospital in Halifax, where she died about 12 hours later, he said. Mitchell was recently nominated for Young Performer of the Year honors by Canadian Folk Music Awards. She was touring the Maritime provinces and had a break between gigs to go hiking Tuesday, her manager, Lisa Weitz, said in an e-mail. ""She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity,"" she wrote. ""Words can't begin to express the sadness and tragedy of losing such a sweet, compassionate, vibrant, and phenomenally talented young woman,"" Weitz said. ""Her warmth, loving nature, astounding artistry, and infectious enthusiasm will be so missed and forever remembered."" Read more about who Taylor Mitchell was . Mitchell, who was originally from the Georgian Bay area in Ontario, lived in Toronto, Weitz said. Bird said the area where the attack occurred is popular and well traveled. It remained closed, and park authorities had shot one coyote believed to be involved. A pathologist will test the animal's body for diseases that might have triggered the attack, he said. Searches for other aggressive animals in the park continue, he said. ""Public safety is our primary concern,"" he said. He said no other coyote attacks had ever occurred in the park. ""We've had coyotes approach people too closely,"" he said, and about six years ago one nipped a person. That animal was killed because of ""lack of fear,"" he said. But Tuesday's attack is ""unprecedented and a totally isolated incident,"" he said. In a written statement, Emily Mitchell described her daughter as ""a seasoned naturalist and well versed in wilderness camping. She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity. Tragically it was her time to be taken from us so soon. ""We take a calculated risk when spending time in nature's fold -- it's the wildlife's terrain,"" Emily Mitchell's statement continued. ""When the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes, I clearly heard Taylor's voice say, 'please don't, this is their space.' She wouldn't have wanted their demise, especially as a result of her own. She was passionate about animals, was an environmentalist, and was also planning to volunteer at the Toronto Wildlife Centre in the coming months."" Send your stories, photos of Mitchell . Michael Johnston, Mitchell's producer for her debut album, ""For Your Consideration,"" said the singer was a ""brilliant and beautiful light that people were naturally drawn to."" ""She was so young and talented. Her big dreams were a perfect match with her big, kind heart."" He said he and his family would soon be organizing a celebration of her life. Coyote attacks on humans are extremely rare, said Michael O'Brien, wildlife manager of furbearers and upland game for Nova Scotia. It is ""not expected or normal behavior,"" he said, although he said there had been aggressive incidents in Nova Scotia before, but no deaths. Illness, injury and familiarity with humans can affect an animal's behavior, he said.","Taylor Mitchell was at the Skyline Trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park .

"(CNN) -- Five days ago, Justin Bieber wasn't worried about a thing. And it wasn't because he didn't have a reason to be. The pop star has been under investigation for alleged involvement in a January 9 egg attack on a neighbor's home -- one that caused an estimated $20,000 in damages -- but you wouldn't know it from his tweets. After police raided his Calabasas, California, home and seized his security footage and iPhone, Bieber was on Instagram sharing photos of a snowy vacation with friends. His carefree attitude was emphasized in an Instagram post he captioned, ""worried about nothing.'"" While the media has been running in circles over allegations ranging from drug abuse to public urination, Bieber's social life -- at least as depicted on his social media accounts -- never faltered. Here's a breakdown of how Bieber's been spending his free time in the days leading up to his arrest: . Getting new ink . Biebs has gotten so many tattoos that they can make up their own guide. On January 12 he shared a photo of a freshly inked compass -- maybe he was feeling a little lost. Snowboarding . For the past week, we've heard little from Bieber that didn't include him hanging out with friends. Word has it that the star has been thoroughly enjoying his break from concerts and work commitments. Lounging (sometimes shirtless, because why not?) Nothing says wealth like a near-empty chest of drawers and a selfie taken in slippers -- at least, that's how we're interpreting this Instagram post from five days ago. Or maybe he's trying to signal that his shorts were hanging a little low because of all the cash in his pockets? The prior shirtless snapshot is a little easier to figure out -- the kid is always thinking of his fans. Pranking friends . No one knows whether it's Bieber's butt that's mooning a snoozing Lil Za -- one of Bieb's regular pals -- or someone else's, but he did feel comfortable sharing the bro prank with the world. Smoking Cuban cigars and shooting hoops . We know that Bieber flew down to Miami on a Monday, and the reports of what he's being doing there -- aside from his recent arrest -- include spending $75,000 in a strip club. Bieber hasn't confirmed that bit of gossip, but we do know he's recently lit up at least one Cuban cigar and been to Lil Wayne's Miami-area skate park. Tagging . Justin Bieber's love for graffiti art has only increased in recent years -- and sometimes it gets him into trouble. Yet it wasn't tagging his initials that got him popped by the cops in Miami ... Cruising in a Lamborghini . We all know how this turned out. But before the police arrived, Bieber and his car companion -- who's been identified as model Chantel Jeffries -- were captured enjoying a night drive, an image shared on Bieber's friend Khalil's Instagram account. All of which leads up to the early hours of January 23, when Bieber was arrested on charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. Obviously, given the circumstances, we can imagine that the star won't be sharing any Twitter updates for a while.","Justin Bieber was arrested in Miami, Florida, on January 23 .

"(CNN) -- He travels in private jets and is one of the world's highest-paid athletes, but Fernando Alonso's humble beginnings are never far away from his thoughts. He recalls with fondness those childhood days when he used to race go-karts -- the precursor to his enormous success on the Formula One circuit -- free of any pressure. Back then he didn't have to worry about points or standings. His passion for motorsport stemmed from his father Jose Luis, himself a former go-kart driver, and Alonso is also quick to remember the sacrifices his parents made as they drove him around Spain and Europe during his rise through the ranks. His mother Ana Maria would even make his racing outfits, adjusting the size of his overalls as her son grew up. ""One of the most important things that I received from my parents was to have always this sense of family and to be united,"" the Ferrari star -- who has an older sister, Lorena -- tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""You always have little fights with your family, with your sister when you're a kid, but at the end of the day you must know that family will always be there."" Alonso admits he wants to have children of his own one day, but for now he is focused on trying to win more titles with arguably the most famous Formula One team in the world, the iconic ""rosso corsa"" of Ferrari. Talking to CNN at an exhibition of memorabilia in Madrid documenting his illustrious career, the 32-year-old reflects on his early days in Oviedo -- a city in northwest Spain, in the province of Asturias. ""My father was the one to introduce the adrenaline and the passion for racing into the family,"" Alonso says. ""The go-kart I had when I was three years old was going very, very slow. Basically my father was walking alongside me to control the steering wheel or if I was doing any funny things. ""The weekends were probably a nightmare for (my parents) because they needed to take the car, they needed to drive maybe 10 hours with me asleep in the back and then have a race somewhere -- and then come home because they needed to work and I needed to go to school."" Alonso showed promise from a young age, but his mother and father made it clear that the priority wasn't landing trophies. ""First it was to study,"" he says. ""If I do well, I keep racing in go-karts. ""I needed to do all the exams. I missed a lot of lessons and I needed to recover. I needed to recover in the back of the car reading books, so that was my school probably."" With his family's support, Alonso flourished -- becoming a megastar who last year was rated 19th in Forbes' top-earning athletes list on $30 million, and is considered F1's most marketable driver. His first ""key"" moment, he says, was winning the Spanish national championships in 1994. ""I felt that this was a good moment and I would keep this trophy all my life because you never think that you will continue,"" says Alonso, a cycling enthusiast, too, who hopes to have his own team. ""I didn't know if I would race anymore in go-karts or if my family would take me to the next weekend's race. You never know. ""You just enjoy the present. And maybe that was the nice thing about that period of my career when I was a go-kart driver. ""You enjoy that Sunday. You don't think anymore because you don't know if there is something more coming."" In Alonso's case, plenty did come. In 1998, he was runner-up at the European karting championships and two years later finished fourth in Formula 3000. Alonso made his Formula One debut with Minardi in 2001 but wasn't thinking of winning that day in Melbourne. He was just happy he didn't crash. ""We didn't have any preseason test because the car wasn't ready,"" he recalls. ""It was just ready for the first race. They explained briefly what the steering wheel was, the buttons to press. ""There was a panic moment because I did not know what the neutral button was, and I was trying to find it. I had one second or I would crash somewhere."" Despite not tallying a single point in 2001, Alonso caught the eye and soon moved to Renault, where in 2005 at the age of 24 he became F1's youngest world champion -- a record since beaten by Lewis Hamilton and reigning titleholder Sebastian Vettel. ""When you're world champion, there are many memories from the past, 20 years in different motorsports,"" says Alonso. ""You arrive in Formula One, you win the world championship -- that's it. It's enough for your whole life, probably. ""The satisfaction you have in a few minutes of your life when you become champion, it's enough to live forever."" Yet Alonso didn't stop there. He repeated as world champion to emulate the likes of Ayrton Senna -- his hero. ""When I was 10 years old to 15 years old, in my room when I opened the door to get clothes, I had a photo of Ayrton with a car. He was at Suzuka with McLaren and I remember that particular picture every time I open the door of the room."" After leaving Renault for the first time in 2007, he endured a difficult season with McLaren, clashing with Hamilton and finishing third in the championship. His problems with the British driver led to accusations that Alonso was difficult to work with, but he insists that reports of tensions with his teammates over the years are ""exaggerated."" ""It's true that you should beat your teammate to have a better reputation or to have a better result in that weekend,"" he says. ""But believe me, when we are in a meeting or a debrief after a race, there are zero problems -- there are only good things, helpful comments from the other driver. ""All are working together, if we discover something in the setup, immediately the other driver tests to see that positive result and confirm that that will be our standard setup from that moment on. ""So there's a huge communication and a huge teamwork, despite what you read or what you see from the outside."" Like everyone else on the circuit, he has lagged behind Vettel since joining Ferrari in 2010, with the Red Bull driver claiming four consecutive titles. This season Alonso is joined at the Italian team's Maranello headquarters by Kimi Raikkonen -- the last driver to win the championship for the Scuderia back in 2007. Felipe Massa, the man Raikkonen replaced, said last year he thought the two world champions would ""collide"" but Alonso has welcomed the Finn. ""I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and huge motivation for myself first and also for the team because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result,"" Alonso says. ""Myself I know I need to deliver my best."" And there's nothing he'd like more than adding to his already impressive collection of racing souvenirs. ""If you ask me this question in 10 years' time ... I will tell you that two championships are more than I could dream of -- I never thought I'd become a Formula One driver, I never thought I'd win one grand prix. I'm extremely proud and extremely happy with my career,"" Alonso says. ""If you ask me right now ... I am hungry for victories, hungry for success -- I will tell you that two championships are not enough.""","The foundation for Fernando Alonso's success stems from his family .

"(CNN) -- An investigation into the deaths of two people who spent up to two hours inside a ""sweat lodge"" at an Arizona retreat last week has been elevated from an accidental death investigation to a homicide inquiry, Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told reporters Thursday. Self-help author James Arthur Ray has hired investigators to investigate two deaths at an Arizona sweat lodge. Authorities said James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Kirby Brown, 38,  of Westtown, New York, died Friday at the Angel Valley Resort after spending up to two hours in the sauna-like sweat lodge. Nineteen others were treated for injuries. One person remained hospitalized Thursday in critical condition, Waugh said. The dead and injured were attending a program by self-help author James Arthur Ray, authorities said. A search warrant was executed Wednesday at the James Ray International offices in Carlsbad, California, the sheriff said. Authorities were attempting to determine whether documents exist on how to construct sweat lodges and on their proper use, as well as documents showing whether participants were advised of the risks of sweat lodges either before or during the program. They also were searching for rosters from past events, Waugh said. Police would not say what, if anything, was found in executing the search warrant.  Watch what goes on inside the 'sweat lodge' » . Asked why the deaths have been classified as homicides and the investigation upgraded, Waugh said, ""We believe there are indications that it was not accidental, and ... we feel that there should be some culpability on some individuals."" Those individuals could include Ray and possibly others, he said. A spokesman for Ray said authorities should be focusing on the investigation rather than talking to reporters. ""The Sheriff's Department is trying this case in the media,"" said Howard Bragman, noting that Thursday's news conference was the sheriff's second this week. ""There were no additional facts presented today; there were implications. I find words like 'homicide' -- when they don't have all the facts -- inflammatory and inappropriate at this time, and I think they're purposely inflammatory. ... Let's show as much zeal with the investigation and getting to the facts as they have in trying to tar my client,"" Bragman said. The sweat lodge was meant to be a ""spiritual awakening"" exercise for the participants in the ""Spiritual Warrior"" program, Waugh said. A sweat lodge is a dome-like structure covered with tarps and blankets. Hot rocks and water are used to create steam in the enclosed environment. The owners of the resort built the sweat lodge, Waugh said, under Ray's direction. A nurse on Ray's staff was present during the event, police have said. At least one of those who died was in the back of the structure, Waugh said. Ray was positioned near its door. There were no seats, he said; participants either sat or lay on the floor. On Tuesday, Ray said he has hired his own investigators to determine what happened at his Arizona retreat, located in a secluded valley 20 minutes from Sedona. ""I have no idea what happened. We'll figure it out,"" Ray said. ""I've lost people I love and really care about."" Ray is the author of the best-selling book ""Harmonic Wealth: The Secret of Attracting the Life You Want."" Ray, described on his Web site as a ""personal success strategist,"" has appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" and the ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"" and is featured in the self-empowerment film ""The Secret."" The use of sweat lodges for spiritual and physical cleansing is a part of several Native American tribes' cultures. A traditional Native American sweat lodge is a small dome-like structure made of willow branches carefully tied together and covered in canvas. Rocks are heated in a nearby fire pit and placed inside the lodge, and water is poured over them to create steam.","2 die, 19 injured in sweat lodge at Arizona retreat .

"(CNN) -- Brad Ludden is a world-class whitewater kayaker. Throughout his professional career, the 31-year-old has braved treacherous rapids in more than 40 countries and racked up over 100 first descents â€” successfully paddling a river's uncharted territory. Despite his success and the boyish good looks that landed him in Cosmopolitan magazine as ""Bachelor of the Year"" in 2008, the down-to-earth Montana native has always had a greater purpose: To use his passion for the sport to help young adults with cancer. In the prime of his career in 2001, Ludden founded First Descents, a nonprofit that provides free outdoor adventures for adults ages 18 to 39 battling the disease. It all started when Ludden's aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer when he was 12 years old. ""That was the first time cancer had become very personal to our family. Seeing someone you love go through this disease really changes the way you view it,"" he said. ""Seeing how few resources were available to her as a young adult made me realize that there was a tremendous need there."" So he turned to what he loves most â€” kayaking. In 2001 he took 10 people on a weeklong kayaking adventure to prove to them that they could be stronger than their cancer. Since then, the organization has expanded to 13 employees and now includes rock climbing, mountaineering and surfing. It has grown from one program in Colorado to 50 programs throughout North America, Central America and South America. ""Cancer, especially as a young adult, can really send someone into isolation,"" Ludden said. ""They come to these programs and often for the first time since their diagnosis they meet someone else their age with cancer. They can have conversations about cancer that they couldn't have before. They start to regain a lot of trust in themselves and a lot of confidence in their bodies."" At a surfing event in Nags Head, North Carolina, 15 young adults came together to tackle the waves. All the participants got nicknames so they could assume a new identity for the week â€” one that separates them from their cancer. Joey Reed, a mother of four nicknamed ""Hot Mama,"" showed no fear on the water. But two years ago, things were much different. ""In 2010, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. ... I had just had a baby, and I was diagnosed when he was 10 months old,"" she said. ""So there's a lot of fear that was there."" Now in remission, Reed, 39, says the program has helped her gain a new perspective on life. ""Getting to be here was one of the dreams I've had,"" she said. ""I can conquer the waves. I can go after dreams still. I can be strong."" Beth Pointer, nicknamed ""Ripple,"" was diagnosed last year with stage 4 molecular lymphoma. She is still undergoing chemotherapy treatments and said it was a gift to have the camp to look forward to.

"(CNN) -- Former Bolivian President Jorge Quiroga will appeal his prison sentence of nearly three years for defaming a bank, his attorney said Sunday. Judge Rene Delgado sentenced Quiroga on Saturday after the former leader was found guilty of defaming the Banco Union in statements he made in February 2009, nearly seven years after leaving office. The former president, who ruled from August 2001 to August 2002, said the Banco Union was ""a money-launderer for resources obtained in a bad way, for Venezuelan resources and for resources from corruption,"" the state-run Agencia Boliviana de Informacion said. Quiroga's attorney, Ivan Aleman, said the sentencing was unexpected. ""We were surprised yesterday by an aberrant ruling that my client would be denied his liberty for two years and eight months,"" Aleman said Sunday. At the time of Quiroga's comments, the Bolivian Public Ministry was investigating Banco Union in connection with $450,000 in a trust fund handled by businessman Jorge O'Connor D'Arlach, who had been shot to death in January 2009, the state news agency said. The bank filed a legal complaint against the former president after his comments, which were carried extensively by local media. Quiroga, 50, received a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from Texas A&M University in 1981 and holds a master's degree in business administration from St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. He served as Bolivia's vice president from 1997 to 2001, when he assumed the top spot after President Hugo Banzer resigned due to health problems. Quiroga ran for president in 2005 but was soundly defeated by current President Evo Morales.","A judge sentenced Jorge Quiroga to two years and eight months in prison .

"(CNN) -- The death of a Georgia man who fell about 85 feet from an upper level of Atlanta's Turner Field has been ruled a suicide, an official said. Ronald Homer, 30, fell during a Braves-Phillies baseball game on August 12. The cause of death is blunt force trauma, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office. Betty Honey, an investigator with that office, said Thursday that Homer had committed suicide. He had no other injuries besides those sustained as a result of his fall from the fourth level of the stadium shortly before 8:55 p.m. during a rain delay. The game was scheduled to start at 7:10 p.m., but heavy rains pushed back the start time nearly two hours. Homer's was the second such death at an Atlanta sporting venue in the last year or so.

"(CNN) -- Under the cover of darkness, gunmen approached a college dormitory in a rural Nigerian town and opened fire on students who were sleeping. At least 40 students died, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. The gunmen fired indiscriminately on the male dorm, said Lazarus Eli, a military spokesman. The attack took place at about 1 a.m. Sunday at the College of Agriculture Gujba. ""So far all evidence points to the Boko Haram,"" Eli told CNN by phone. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Part of a pattern? Since 2009, Boko Haram has sown murder and mayhem in Nigeria's northeastern region. The Islamic militant group's name translates from the local Hausa language as ""Western education is a sin."" Boko Haram militants often target schools and churches. In 2011 and 2012, Christmas attacks were blamed on them. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan created a new wing of the military to specifically deal with the insurgency. In May, Jonathan declared a state of emergency in three northeastern states. He cited ""terrorists"" who have caused a ""a near breakdown of law and order."" One of the three states is Yobe, where Sunday's attack took place. It was the third attack on a school in four months in Yobe. The ongoing violence in this predominantly Muslim region has claimed thousands of lives. Meanwhile, human rights groups have accused the military of committing atrocities against civilians. During a May trip to the country, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Nigeria ""has acknowledged that there have been some problems"" and was ""working to try to control it.""

"(CNN) -- Rebels and regime fighters girded for a decisive battle in Aleppo as world powers issued dire warnings of a government onslaught in the sprawling and densely populated Syrian city. Fighting flared in parts of the metropolis Friday. But Malik Kurdi, deputy commander of the rebel Free Syrian Army, said both sides are preparing for a bigger confrontation the regime is calling ""the mother of all battles."" Rebel battalions trekked into Aleppo from the countryside and the regime is taking forces from other regions into the city. The huge urban center resembles a ""ghost town"" in many areas, with only fighters are on the streets, Kurdi said. Faces of the Free Syrian Army . ""People are fleeing the city towards the countryside. I think they are sensing that a huge battle is about to take place, a decisive one,"" Kurdi said. The confrontation could signal the fate of the President Bashar al-Assad and his government, which has been engulfed in an uprising that started peacefully in March 2011 but has transformed into an armed rebellion. Activists said early Saturday that regime forces are preventing fuel and food from entering neighborhoods controlled by rebel fighters. Amateur videos showed long lines at bakeries and grocery stores, as people tried to get their hands on whatever was available. ""They are besieging our area,"" Abu Omar, a resident of the Salaheddin neighorhood, said. ""There is no electricity in some parts, and food is scarce."" Aleppo, in northern Syrian near Turkey, is the country's commercial capital and a World Heritage site. The CIA World Factbook says it is the nation's most populous city. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that if the government's military effort fails in Aleppo, ""it will cost the regime dearly and begin a process of contraction of regime control over Syria."" ""If the regime is able to beat the rebels back, this conflict will go on far longer,"" he said. Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the former head of the U.N. observer mission in Syria, told CNN ""it's only a matter of time before this regime will fall"" and ""time is on the side of the rebels."" Syrian rebels appear more capable, yet still outgunned . ""It can take a lot of time or it can go quickly, it's impossible to say. ... It is a cycle of violence. Sooner or later we will reach a climax with the fall of the regime,"" he told CNN. Violence hit parts of the city on Friday. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported a ""horrific massacre"" in the city's Fardos district, where regime forces indiscriminately shelled homes. The international activist group Avaaz, saying it has spoken to witnesses, also reported violence in Fardos. The witnesses reported casualties in a ""blistering"" regime ""dawn attack"" in the district, in central Aleppo. Regime forces in the Khaldieh district fired at protesters coming out of the Al-Ghafran mosque and shelled the Salaheddin district with missiles, automatic weapons and attack helicopters, the LCC said. Syrian state TV said that ""special security authorities"" destroyed five pickup vehicles equipped with machine guns used by ""terrorists"" in the Aleppo countryside. The report said people in the vehicles were killed and injured. Kurdi said rebels have had skirmishes with regime forces and destroyed several vehicles. At least 15 of the 100 people slain in Syria on Friday were from Aleppo province, the LCC said, and the count is expected to rise. The day before, 48 of the 200 people killed in Syria violence were also from the Aleppo region, the first time since the uprising started that the region led in the number of deaths in a single day. As the violence unfolded, throngs of protesters marched down Aleppo streets Friday, chanting and carrying signs, saying, ""we stand for all the Syrian devastated cities"" and ""we are all Syrians."" The world community urged al-Assad's regime to stop its assault. Opinion: After the fall of the House of Assad, could Syria be worse? ""I urge the Syrian government to halt their offensive,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Friday in London. ""The violence from both sides must stop for the sake of the suffering civilians of Syria."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the ""utterly unacceptable escalation of the conflict could lead to a devastating loss of civilian life and a humanitarian disaster."" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called the developments in Aleppo ""really worrisome,"" saying the use of heavy weapons and air forces on such a civilian hub would constitute ""an international crime, clearly."" ""Such an attack would both start a massive migration and also such destruction of a commercial center like Aleppo would mean cutting the lifeline of Syria,"" he said. ""For a regime to destroy its own country in such a rough way is really turning into a crime of humanity."" Battles for key cities of Aleppo, Damascus heat up in Syrian civil war . Iran, meanwhile, signaled its support for al-Assad's government. Its energy minister, Majid Namjou, vowed his government ""will not leave Syria alone in such a difficult situation,"" according to a story by state-run Press TV. The report said the two nations signed a deal Thursday to expand sharing of electricity and water, with Namjou saying Iranian firms are ready to rebuild damaged power plant facilities. Iran plans to export at least 250 million watts of electricity, and Iranian companies ""to produce and supply industrial equipment needed in the Arab country,"" according to the energy minister. U.S. officials, meanwhile, have increased contacts with the Syrian opposition in recent weeks, a senior U.S. official said Friday. ""The U.S. and others are playing more of an advisory role to the opposition now,"" the official said. Yet U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said Friday he's not aware of any discussions about giving the opposition any ""lethal support."" The rebels are composed largely of soldiers who have defected from the Syrian military. But many civilians -- including students, shopkeepers, real-estate agents and members of the president's ruling Baath party -- also are trying to end four decades of Assad family rule. They are gearing up for a fight. Rebel commander Mustafa Abdullah, told CNN that rebels have set up medical clinics in Aleppo homes and have plans to transport and evacuate anyone who is wounded. ""They (government forces) want to surround Aleppo completely and send support from all sides, then start shelling rebel-controlled areas and hospitals,"" Abdullah said. Abdullah, the rebel commander in Aleppo, recalled the merciless government bombardment of the city of Homs this year as he geared up for battle. Asked if these fighters had enough ammunition to withstand a government siege, Abdullah said simply ""no."" He then added, ""It will be just like Homs"" and wept at the thought. The Aleppo fighting has hit home politically. A Syrian parliamentarian from Aleppo has defected to Turkey, according to the opposition Syrian National Council. Ikhlas Badawi is the first member of the assembly elected in May to defect and the latest in a series of high-profile officials to cut ties with the regime. This follows defections by high-level Syrian diplomats to the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus and Iraq. ""I call on all of my colleagues to join this revolution and defend their rights to stand up for the free across all of our society's sects,"" he told reporters Friday in Antakya, Turkey. ""I also call on members of the Syrian army to honor their word and defend our country, not just one ruling family."" More from CNN inside Syria . As fighting raged in recent days, aid agencies scaled back their efforts in Aleppo. A spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross -- which said it is temporarily moving some aid workers out of Syria to Beirut for security reasons -- said the organization doesn't have a presence in Aleppo at the moment. In addition, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent has had to suspend some of its activities. ""The situation there is extremely volatile,"" the ICRC said. ""Several schools in Aleppo have been opened to host displaced families, and the local SARC volunteers have provided some relief items (mattresses, hygiene products and food). However, humanitarian needs are on the rise."" Outside Aleppo, battles between regime forces and rebels raged. Heavy shelling rocked other cities, including Damascus, Daraa, Idlib and Homs, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Thirty people died in Daraa province, 23 in Damascus and its suburbs, 11 in Deir Ezzor province and 10 in Homs province, the LCC said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another pro-opposition group, said early Saturday that rebel forces controlled the biggest and most important checkpoint in the northern city of Maaret Nouman, in Idlib province.

"(CNN) -- Gunmen who stormed an Iraqi university on Saturday used students as human shields and clashed with security forces, authorities said. Forces have surrounded al-Anbar University in the city of Ramadi and are attempting to retake the campus from the attackers. The campus is about 110 kilometers (68 miles) west of Baghdad. The gunmen are believed to be members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a rogue Sunni Muslim extremist group formerly affiliated with al Qaeda, also known by its acronym ISIS, police said. Approximately 1,200 students, professors and staff who live in the campus residential buildings were present during the attack; nearly 20 students were slightly injured, officials said. The majority of students were able to flee, but some are still inside, police officials told CNN. The Al-Anbar University attack comes amid a wave of violence that has taken Iraq by storm. Also Saturday, six roadside bombs exploded in the capital of Baghdad, killing at least 33 people and injuring 72 others, police officials said. The explosions occurred in a busy commercial Shiite neighborhood, targeting mostly civilians, police said. This year, Iraq has witnessed some of the worst violence since 2008. The United Nations reported that May was the deadliest month since the beginning of the year. The escalating violence in recent months has left hundreds dead, raising fears it could return Iraq to the level of violence in 2006 and 2007, when bodies littered the streets.","Six roadside bombs kill dozens in Baghdad .

"New York (CNN) -- Mary Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had been in the headlines for her alcohol and drug problems, but is remembered by relatives as a devoted mother and pioneer of ""green"" architecture. Mary Kennedy's family blasts stories on her death . A dark-haired beauty, Mary Richardson met Robert F. Kennedy Jr. through her friendship with his sister Kerry Kennedy, a roommate from school. The couple married in a civil ceremony in 1994 when the designer was six months pregnant, according to the Westchester County Journal News in New York. One month before the wedding, Kennedy divorced his first wife, Emily Black, the mother of his two oldest children, the newspaper said. He and Mary Kennedy were together for 16 years before he filed for divorce two years ago, said her family attorney, Kerry A. Lawrence. Mary Kennedy's funeral set for Saturday . The pair, who had four children together, were still married at the time of her death Wednesday at home in Westchester County. The 52-year-old died of asphyxiation due to hanging, said Donna Greene, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County medical examiner. Both sides of the family paid tribute to Mary Kennedy as a devoted mother. ""It is with deep sadness that the family of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. mourns the loss of Mary Richardson Kennedy, wife and mother of their four beloved children. Mary inspired our family with her kindness, her love, her gentle soul and generous spirit,"" a statement by her husband's family said. Outside the home, Mary Kennedy made her mark as an architect who pushed the boundaries of eco-friendly design. She was ""a tremendously gifted architect and a pioneer and relentless advocate of green design who enhanced her cutting edge, energy efficient creations with exquisite taste and style,"" her husband's family said. She also advocated finding a cure for food allergies and asthma and was a co-founder of the Food Allergy Initiative, the world's largest private source of funding for food allergy research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s family said. Her own family paid tribute to ""our beloved sister Mary, whose radiant and creative spirit will be sorely missed by those who loved her,"" including the four children she loved ""without reservation."" Mary Kennedy's death was the latest for a family that has seen its share of tragedy. ""We know from a history of this family, it's very hard being a Kennedy, either being a blood Kennedy or being married to one,"" Laurence Leamer, a Kennedy biographer, said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""The overwhelming celebrity, the attention, the obligations, the expectations that you're supposed to do something with your life. It's very, very hard."" In 1968, Robert F. Kennedy Sr. was assassinated in California while making a run for the White House. His death came less than five years after his brother, President John F. Kennedy, also died at the hands of an assassin. More than three decades later, in 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr.; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy; and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, died when a plane he was piloting crashed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. David Kennedy died of a drug overdose in 1984, and Michael Kennedy was killed in a skiing accident in 1997. Both were sons of Robert F. Kennedy Sr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent environmental lawyer who is a professor at Pace Law School in White Plains, New York, is the third of 11 children born to Ethel and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Details of the couple's private life were exposed after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed for divorce from Mary Kennedy in Westchester County on May 12, 2010. The next evening, according to police records, police in Bedford, New York, responded to a 911 call. When police arrived at the Kennedy residence, they found the couple in an argument over taking their four children to a carnival at St. Patrick's School. According to a ""domestic incident"" report filed by the officer on the scene, ""Mr. Kennedy stated that his wife was intoxicated and was acting irrational so he took the children to the carnival to remove them from the situation."" No one was injured, the report said. Two days later, Mary Kennedy was arrested for driving while intoxicated. At the time, Bedford Police Lt. Jeff Dickans told CNN that a Bedford police officer saw Kennedy's 2004 Volvo swerving onto the curb of Greenwich Road in Bedford and asked her to pull over. Kennedy had slurred speech and a blood-alcohol content above 0.08%, the legal limit in New York. She was charged with driving while intoxicated. Lawrence, her family attorney, said the case resulted in a reduction to a violation, the criminal charge was dismissed, and her driver's license was suspended for 90 days. A second arrest occurred in August of the same year in the town of Pleasant Valley, in which she was charged with driving while impaired by prescription drugs, Lawrence said. Those charges were dismissed completely in July 2011 because all the drugs were prescribed and taken as her physician advised, the attorney said. As a designer, Mary Kennedy sought to advance environmental principles and green technologies. In a book titled ""Kennedy Green House"" that was co-authored by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he describes how he and his wife restored their flooded, black-mold-infested home, transforming it into an eco-friendly residence. A website devoted to the project describes how it focused ""on maximum energy and water efficiency and improved indoor air quality to benefit the future of our planet and health of our children."" In the book, her husband wrote that she had worked for the design firm Parish-Hadley and worked on the renovation of the Naval Observatory in Washington, the official residence of the U.S. vice president. CNN's Nina Ibarra contributed to this report.","NEW: Mary Kennedy, 52, died of asphyxiation due to hanging, a local official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Gary Condit's semen was found on underwear belonging to Chandra Levy, according to an FBI biologist testifying Wednesday in the trial of Ingmar Guandique, who is accused of murdering the Washington intern in 2001. The panties were retrieved in May 2001 by investigators searching Levy's apartment in the days after her parents reported her missing. Her body was found over a year later in Washington's Rock Creek Park. The testimony addresses the question of whether Condit, a sitting congressman from California at the time Levy vanished, was having an affair with the intern, who had just turned 24 when she disappeared. The biologist, Alan Giusti, testified for prosecutors that no DNA was recovered from a separate pair of underwear and sports tights recovered from the crime scene. Regarding lab tests of the underwear recovered from Levy's apartment, Giusti said that ""the sperm DNA profile was compared to and matched to Gary Condit."" Condit, who testified in the trial on November 1, has refused to address the question of whether he had sex with Levy. ""We've lost our feeling for common decency,"" Condit told prosecutor Amanda Haines when she asked in court if the two had been intimate. ""I didn't commit any crime. I didn't do anything wrong."" The disappearance of Levy, then an intern for the federal Bureau of Prisons, drew national attention after her parents discovered a connection with Condit. The congressman was never a suspect in the case, but was questioned intensively for details as to Levy's whereabouts. Prosecutors believe Guandique, a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha, attacked Levy while she was jogging and then killed her when she began to scream. Guandique denies that he attacked Levy. There has been no physical evidence linking him to the assault, leaving prosecutors to base their case largely on Guandique's alleged jailhouse admission that he killed the young intern. Partly as a result, prosecutors on Wednesday asked the trial judge to drop two of the six counts against Guandique, including a count of first degree sexual assault. He is still, however, facing first degree murder, kidnapping, and robbery charges. The judge rejected a defense motion to acquit Guandique on the remaining counts.","NEW:Prosecutors have recommended dropping 2 of the six charges against Guandique .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Either Justin Bieber is having a wild time on his South American tour or media reports of the 19-year-old singer's antics are off the mark. Many reports barely rise above the gossip threshold, but they echo throughout the tabloids and mainstream media. What you should believe -- and why you should care -- is a raging debate online with Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and beyond. ""My truth is in the music,"" Bieber said in a message to his 46 million Twitter followers this week. It was posted the same day his newest single, ""Bad Day,"" released. Journalists know very little about what goes on in Bieber's private life. He is constantly surrounded by bodyguards and his representatives consistently refuse to confirm, deny or comment on any reports that surface. But that does not limit speculation, much of it based on paparazzi photos and video of the teen's comings and goings. The New York Post's ""Page Six"" column published several photos last weekend that the newspaper said implied the singer was enjoying the services of Brazil's legal prostitutes while on his South America tour. One photo showed a man walking out of a Rio de Janerio brothel under a blanket and surrounded by bodyguards. No face is visible, but the Post says Bieber could be identified by ""his gray wraparound wrist tattoo, which is visible in some photos, and his signature sneakers."" Another photo shows two women in a vehicle that the newspaper said took them from the brothel to the hotel where Bieber was staying. Minions carry Justin Bieber up Great Wall of China . Belieber Rorschach test . The media frenzy over Bieber's alleged sexcapades grew after a video appeared on YouTube on Wednesday that apparently was recorded by a young woman excited about her quiet time with the entertainer. The 15-second clip does not show Bieber doing anything scandalous. He's just sleeping. The tattoos on his arms, the earring, his baby face, short blond hair and red ball cap are all familiar identifiers. The woman pans the camera to reveal Bieber sleeping under a blanket, then points it at herself while flashing a big grin. It ends with her blowing a kiss toward him. The video is something of a Rorschach test to diagnose if you are a ""Belieber,"" the term used for Bieber's diehard fans. They always believe the best of their idol. But un-Beliebers suggested the woman was one of the two females who left with Bieber from the brothel, although they have no way of connecting her to that night.

""The girls got their phone confiscated so they wouldn't take pictures,"" the fan wrote. ""Obviously, because he wanted to have fun without any media around. But when all the girls left, they got their phone back. So did this girl. When this girl got her phone back she sneaked in and filmed him while sleeping. Explains why the video was so short."" Bieber: ""Just gotta know your truth"" The truth is -- we don't know the truth. We do know that Justin Bieber is at what can be an awkward point in a teenage idol's career. He's months away from no longer being a teenager. Making the transition from kid to adult is tough enough, but Bieber has the world watching. Chasing Bieber is a popular, lucrative and dangerous sport for paparazzi. It has led several times to traffic citations for both the singer and the photographers. Punches have allegedly been thrown during confrontations. Bieber -- unlike some other teen stars -- has managed to stay out of criminal court, although he has been accused and investigated. His hit songs keep coming. His concerts sell out. And the world can't divert its eyes away from him. ""Can't believe or dwell on the bs. Just gotta know your truth.

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blasted Democratic political opponents Friday for criticizing his absence from the state during the snowstorm that pounded the Northeast over the Christmas holiday. He also took a shot at the media for giving what he characterized as excessive attention to the controversy during what is typically a slow news week. Both Christie and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, first-term Republicans, were away on vacation during the storm, which dumped up to three feet of snow throughout the region. State Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat, briefly took the reins of power Sunday, becoming acting governor before declaring a state of emergency. Some top Democrats, in turn, questioned why the state legislature had bothered to create an office of lieutenant governor in 2005. Christie, who returned to New Jersey on Thursday, said the state had competent leadership during his absence. He said he would not break a long-held promise to his children to bring them to Disney World over the holiday and noted that Guadagno had made plans months before to take a two-week cruise with her severely ill father. ""My first and most important responsibility, in my view, is as a husband and a father,"" Christie said. ""I think I made that pretty clear to the people of New Jersey when I was running. ... And I was not going to rescind my child's Christmas gift, especially when I was convinced that we had a plan in place."" Christie also said he had constantly been in touch from Florida during the storm. ""This is not like in the 1800s when, you know, nobody would be able to get me,"" he said. ""Believe me, my cell phone was ringing ... much more than I would have preferred it to under normal circumstances when I'm away on a family vacation."" There is ""able leadership in the executive branch of this government, (and) I was talking to them on a regular basis."" ""All this carping and craziness"" about leaving the state ""stranded"" is ""just partisanship,"" Christie argued. Democratic critics in the state legislature ""took shots ... without knowing the full story."" They should ""learn this is a responsible government."" Noting the massive media coverage of the storm, the governor dismissed it as a reflection of ""the nature of the time of the year."" ""All you guys"" in the press ""would be doing this time of year, absent a disaster, would be retrospectives on what happened in 2010. So you got a disaster to fill the week, and so people want to talk about that,"" he said. Christie emphatically declared, however, that he was not bothered by the criticism. It ""just rolls off my back. It's what I expect,"" he concluded. ""If you're going to let that kind of stuff bother you in this job, then you're not going to last very long in it, and I intend to last in it for quite some time.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A technical snafu left some Visa prepaid cardholders stunned and horrified Monday to see a $23,148,855,308,184,500 charge on their statements. Josh Muszynski noticed the 17-digit charge while making a routine balance inquiry. That's about 2,007 times the size of the national debt. Josh Muszynski, 22, of Manchester, New Hampshire, was one Visa customer aghast to find the 17-digit charge on his bill. Adding insult to injury, he had also been hit with a $15 overdraft fee. He noticed that his debt exceeded the world GDP while making a routine balance inquiry on his online Bank of America account. According to his statement, he had spent the profound sum in one pop at a nearby Mobil gas station -- his regular stop for Camel cigarettes. ""Very, very panicked,"" he jumped in his car and sped to the station. Had they perhaps noticed any ""outrageous"" charges come across their books recently, he inquired of the cashier there. She checked the records. They had not.  Watch the story of an astounded customer in Memphis, Tennessee » . Muszynski wondered aloud what he might possibly have asked to purchase for such an astronomical price. ""Can I buy Europe on pump 4?"" He next called Bank of America, the issuer of his Visa prepaid debit card. The bank kept him on hold for two hours, during which time he contemplated the impossibly bleak financial future that might await him. He also felt a stab of fear that he had saddled all his unborn grandchildren -- and their grandchildren -- with a lifetime of debt. ""Down the generational line, nobody would have any money."" Finally, a bank representative told him that the $23 quadrillion charge -- and the $15 overdraft fee -- would be stricken from his account. Muszynski compared the giant debt reprieve to receiving ""an amazing Monopoly card that says, 'Bank error in your favor.' "" In a statement, Visa said the rogue charges affected ""fewer than 13,000 prepaid transactions"" and resulted from a ""temporary programming error at Visa Debit Processing Services ... [which] caused some transactions to be inaccurately posted to a small number of Visa prepaid accounts.""

"Finale Emilia, Italy (CNN) -- Northern Italy was shaken by an aftershock Monday morning, a day after a magnitude-6.0 quake killed at least seven people and left thousands of survivors huddling in tents or cars overnight. Monday morning's aftershock caused buildings to sway in the town of Finale Emilia, in Italy's industrial heartland. The tremor had a magnitude of 3.2 and hit near the site of the original quake, according to the Italian Seismic Service. The head of Italy's Civil Protection Department, Franco Gabrielli, said 11,000 people had been displaced by the first quake around 4 a.m. (10 p.m. Saturday ET) on Sunday morning. The government put 3,000 people up in tents or hotels, but could not shelter everyone who was displaced. Although a moderate rain fell on the area Monday, the local weather forecast called for partly cloudy skies and dry conditions to prevail by Tuesday. In Finale Emilia, about 35 kilometers (21 miles) north of Bologna, 75 people were sleeping in cars in a public park. One of them was Filomenna Gatti, who planned to cram into a Fiat Punto with her husband and three children under 6. ""I close my eyes and I see stones falling and I feel the ground shaking when it's still,"" Gatti said as she walked her dog. ""I don't want to be in any building."" Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti was expected to return from the NATO summit in Chicago on Monday. Monti said Sunday he was leaving the conference early, vowing, ""All that is necessary will be done as soon as possible"" to help the survivors. The quake was centered about 4 kilometers outside Camposanto, northwest of Bologna, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. In addition to the seven reported fatalities, 50 people were injured in the quake, Gabrielli said. iReport: Watch the earthquake aftermath unfold . The stricken region is part of Italy's industrial heartland, and the dead included two people killed in a ceramics factory in Sant'Agostino di Ferrara, about 30 kilometers from the epicenter, civil protection agency spokeswoman Elisabetta Maffani said. Workers were still digging through rubble in hopes of finding survivors in Sant'Agostino, where the quake knocked down a church bell and a magnitude-4.8 aftershock brought down part of its city hall Sunday evening. ""We have just lost our history. Four generations of my family lived here, and now it's gone,"" 72-year-old Luciano Frendo said as he walked through Finale Emila. ""Our history has collapsed."" The civil protection agency said it expects to get more reports of injuries as rescue workers make their way to remote villages in the mountainous area. Heavy rain was expected to continue into Tuesday after hampering rescue efforts and efforts to spot survivors from the air. Other deaths included one person killed when a work shed collapsed in nearby Ponte Rodoni di Bondeno, Maffani said. In addition, a woman in Bologna died of a heart attack during an evacuation, a Moroccan national died when the factory he was working in collapsed and a sixth victim was found dead under rubble in Sant'Agostino, she said. The body of a seventh victim was located under a collapsed house, according to Alessio Bellodi of the civil protection branch in Bologna. The same area was struck by a 5.3-magnitude quake in January. And a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck near the central Italian city of L'Aquila, more than 400 km to the south, in 2009, killing more than 300 and causing widespread destruction.

"(CNN) -- More than 100 state troopers and deputies searched for the third occupant of a hot air balloon that crashed in flames at a Virginia balloon festival, killing the other two people on board, state police said Saturday. Witnesses captured photographs of the balloon after it drifted into power lines, burst into flames Friday night and crashed into the countryside about 25 miles north of Richmond. Some reported seeing two people either jump or fall from the basket at a dizzying height. The bodies were found about 1,500 yards apart in a heavily wooded area, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Saturday afternoon. Two members of the University of Richmond women's basketball program were among those aboard. Ginny Doyle, associate head basketball coach, and Natalie Lewis, director of basketball operations, were on the balloon, the university said in a statement. It said the medical examiner's office has not provided official identification. ""As alumnae, classmates and colleagues -- and as invaluable and devoted mentors for our student-athletes -- Ginny and Natalie have been beloved members of our community,"" President Edward L. Ayers said. ""Their leadership and friendship will endure in the lives of so many."" The search was scaled back at sundown Saturday because of the difficulty of navigating the terrain in the dark. A full-scale effort will resume at daybreak Sunday, police said. The basket and the balloon separated at some point; neither had been found. Earlier Saturday, Geller told reporters the effort had transitioned from rescue to recovery. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. ""We will investigate the man, machine and the environment,"" NTSB air safety investigator Heidi Moats said. Weather conditions are one of the elements investigators are looking at, Moats said, though there was no inclement weather at the time and, so far, officials don't believe those conditions played a role in the crash, Geller said. Thirteen hot air balloons had been soaring on the eve of the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival in Doswell, and three were landing close to each other. Two landed safely, Geller said, but as the third balloon descended, it hit a power line, sparking a fire that spread quickly. The pilot began doing his safety maneuvers and ""took every step to manage the situation,"" the spokeswoman said. But then there was an explosion and the basket and balloon separated. Those aboard the balloon pleaded for their lives, witness Carrie Hager-Bradley told CNN affiliate WWBT. ""They were just screaming for anybody to help them. 'Help me, help me, sweet Jesus, help, I'm going to die. Oh my God, I'm going to die,'"" she said. Her daughter told her she saw someone falling out of the basket. Then Hager-Bradley also saw someone plummeting to the ground. Organizers canceled the festival after the accident. How safe is hot air ballooning?

"Sabha, Libya (CNN) -- A military site containing what appears to be radioactive material has been uncovered by revolutionary forces near the southern Libyan city of Sabha. Military forces loyal to the country's National Transitional Council took a CNN crew Thursday to the site, not far from Sabha in the Sahara desert. The crew saw two large warehouses there, one containing thousands of blue barrels, some marked with tape saying ""radioactive,"" and several plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same tape. The material has not been confirmed as being radioactive, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, confirmed Thursday that the Libyan government had yellowcake stored near Sabha. Yellowcake is processed uranium ore that can, after extensive refining, be used to produce enriched uranium for nuclear purposes. Fighters entered Sabha, long regarded as a pro-Gadhafi stronghold, on Wednesday afternoon and met initially no resistance, officials said. Elsewhere, revolutionaries have taken control of the southwestern town of Ubari, chasing toops loyal to now-deposed leader Moammar Gadhafi from the area as Libya's new leaders continued to gain momentum, NTC field commander Al-Amin Shtawi said Thursday. In another event likely boost to revolutionary morale, Libya's most recent prime minister under the Gadhafi regime, al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, was arrested Wednesday night in Tunisia, the government confirmed to CNN Thursday. Al-Mahmoudi was detained in Tamaghza, near Tunisia's border with Algeria, the Tunisian interior ministry said, having entered Tunisia illegally without a visa. He was attempting to cross into Algeria at the time of his arrest, a ministry spokesman said. ""I believe the Libyan people will want to see him brought to Libya and put on trial here for his crimes under Gadhafi's rule,"" Abdul Rahman Busin, an NTC spokesman, told CNN. The NTC has not yet formally requested al-Mahmoudi's extradition, he added. The Algerian government on Thursday also declared its willingness to work ""closely"" with the new Libyan authorities, the official Algeria Press Service reported. This cooperation would benefit both countries and ""stimulate the appropriate conditions to maintain peace, security and stability in the region,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement quoted by APS. Algeria had previously declined to recognize the NTC as the new government in Libya. A number of Gadhafi family members, including his wife and three of his children, fled Libya for Algeria last month. In another sign that stability may be returning to Libya, the United States reopened its embassy in Tripoli Thursday, in the former residence of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. The old embassy building in the center of the city was trashed by Gadhafi supporters in May. The military site outside Sabha, found Wednesday night, is now guarded by about a dozen lightly-armed revolutionary fighters. It does not appear to have been left unfrequented for long. Protective suits were found hanging in offices that appear previously to have belonged to the Libyan government, along with rubber gloves, devices for measuring radioactivity and various military documents. The second warehouse at the site contains rockets and old surface-to-air missiles on which the fuses have deteriorated, making them liable to explode if they're struck. A field commander for the revolutionary forces said the NTC wanted the international community to come in, identify the suspect material and take it to a place of safekeeping. The forces fear it could cause an environmental disaster if it were to explode during fighting, he said. John Pike, a defense expert at Global Security, told CNN the elderly rockets might pose a greater threat to safety than the suspected radioactive material. The discovery of the material is not a surprise, he said, as the IAEA had established that yellowcake was at the site. The current status of the material is not known, however. A U.S. Defense Department official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the issue, told CNN that Libya's remaining stock of highly enriched uranium was removed from the country as of 2009. ""We also continue to monitor Libya's stockpile of uranium yellowcake,"" the official said. ""This material would need to go through an extensive industrial process, including enrichment, before it could be used in building a bomb. Such processes do not exist in Libya."" The official said it was important that the NTC fully secured the site and that it worked to allow international monitors to return to Libya as soon as possible. Gill Tudor, a spokeswoman for the IAEA, said it could confirm that previously declared yellowcake was stored in drums at a site near Sabha. ""The IAEA has tentatively scheduled safeguards activities at this location once the situation in the country stabilizes,"" she said in a statement. These ""safeguards"" measures would not mean the IAEA was physically protecting the material -- a national responsibility -- but rather that it was carrying out technical checks on what was there to avoid proliferation, she said. Libya declared its previously covert nuclear program in December 2003 and Gadhafi's government cooperated with verification efforts by the IAEA from that point on. An IAEA report from 2008 states that Libya had declared that between 1978 and 1981 it imported 2,263 tonnes of uranium ore concentrate, which was being stored at Sabha. However, plans to build a uranium ore concentration and conversion facility in the Sabha area were not carried out, the report says. The latest territorial gains by the revolutionary forces come days after the NTC received the significant milestone of being recognized by South Africa and the African Union as Libya's legitimate rulers. Troops loyal to Libya's new leaders have been putting pressure on several regime holdout cities in recent days. Along with Thursday's military action in Ubari, fighters also clashed with Gadhafi loyalists in the northern town of Bani Walid and in Sirte. Ahmed Bani, an NTC military spokesman speaking in Tripoli Thursday, said revolutionary fighters had encountered mercenaries who appeared to be from Chad or Niger, and had uncovered caches of weapons and military supplies. He said most of the towns in southern Libya had been ""liberated"" from Gadhafi loyalists and that revolutionary forces would continue to fight for control of Bani Walid. ""Our revolutionaries won't lose hope,"" he said. Despite not yet having complete control over the entire country, the NTC says it is planning on how to set up a new government. Elamin Belhaj, a senior member of the NTC, told CNN Wednesday that the formation of a Libyan government will not be announced until anti-Gadhafi forces control the borders of the country and liberate the three cities of Bani Walid, Sirte and Sabha. That effort could take up to one month, he said. After liberation, the NTC will create an interim government by appointing a prime minister who will be responsible for forming the government. The prime minister will decide how many ministers will be in that interim government, but he must return to the NTC for approval of that government. That government will create a new constitution that will be put before the Libyan people for approval in a referendum. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Barbara Starr, Houda Zaghdoudi, Zied Mhirsi, Kamal Ghattas, Brian Walker, Mohammed Fahmy, Pam Benson, Jill Dougherty and Helena DeMoura contributed to this report.","NEW: Tunisia says it has detained Libya's former prime minister under Gadhafi .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova pulled out of the season ending WTA Championships in Istanbul Monday, still plagued by a troubling right shoulder injury. The Russian World No.3 has only played one match in the second half of 2013 and has admitted defeat in her battle to get fit for the prestigious tournament in Turkey later this month. ""I am very disappointed that I will not be able to play in the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships this year,"" she told her official website . ""The fans in Istanbul have welcomed us each year with such intense passion and warmth, I will sincerely miss the energy and excitement they brought to the year-end tournament."" Last year's tournament was played to capacity crowds in the Sinan Erdem Dome and Sharapova progressed to the final where she was beaten in straight sets by current No.1 Serena Williams. Sharapova showed fine form in the first half of this year, winning two tournaments and losing to the dominant Williams in the final of the French Open. But at Wimbledon she lost in the second round to qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito before injury problems struck again. Sharapova has battled shoulder injuries throughout her career and underwent major surgery in October 2008. She defied the doubters to return to the upper echelons of the rankings, capped by her French Open triumph in 2012, completing a career grand slam of the major titles. Sharapova will now bid to recuperate in time for the 2014 Australian Open in January. Meanwhile, the WTA announced that Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic, Italy's Sara Errani and Jelena Jankovic had clinched their place in the eight-strong field for Istanbul.

"(CNN) -- ""My last boss was a woman. All she did was micromanage everyone."" ""Every woman boss I've ever had was extremely passive-aggressive in their leadership."" ""It (was) much easier being managed by a male because he didn't put up with the pettiness or the gossip."" Sorry, ladies of the working world. Those are comments we received in response to my recent piece about how companies with more women in C-suites and corporate boards do better financially. But so many commenters said they absolutely preferred working for a man, we knew we had to explore the ""why"" behind that sentiment. Then this week, the Gallup organization added some numbers -- and fuel -- to the debate. 'I'm not surprised' In telephone interviews with a random sample of 2,059 adults, Gallup found that Americans still prefer a male boss over a female, with 35% choosing to work for a man and 23% saying they prefer women supervisors. It's the highest-ever number recorded for women bosses since Gallup has been asking. When you compare these results to the 1953 responses -- that's when Gallup first asked this question -- the gap has narrowed significantly. In 1953, 66% chose a male boss and 5% picked a female one, a huge gap that has been reduced to a 12-point difference today. ""I think it's great to see that trend, so I'm very encouraged by it, but I'm not surprised that it's still a 2-to-1 ratio of people preferring to work for men than women,"" said sociologist and workplace consultant BJ Gallagher, who has written several books, including a best-seller on diversity called ""A Peacock in the Land of Penguins."" Topping the list of reasons, according to Gallagher, is the fact that men still have more power in the workplace than women. ""If you had your druthers, you'd rather work for somebody who has some influence, some power, some clout, some status and that's true for men and women,"" Gallagher said. ""It trickles down so that if you work for a powerful boss, you're a little bit more powerful. Your whole department is seen in a more positive light if the boss is a powerful (and) influential person,"" she said. 'How to Tell a Male Boss From a Female Boss' In conversations with Gallagher and other experts, it's clear another factor is at work -- the real stereotypes that exist about working for a woman. ""It's an old stereotype that women may not be good bosses so when that happens, it sticks,"" said Susan Nierenberg, vice president of global marketing and corporate communications for Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on expanding opportunities for women in business. ""Because the stereotype is in the water, and there are fewer women leaders than men, you may remember the woman who treated you badly and say, 'Oh yeah, I remember her.' And it reinforces the stereotype. ""Perception is not reality, and stereotypes are perceptions."" Gallagher has created a list titled ""How to Tell a Male Boss From a Female Boss"" with examples of perceived gender differences -- ""A male boss is assertive; a female bossy is bossy"" and ""A male boss is attentive to details; a female boss is picky."" Opinion: Are female leaders too cheerful for their own good? ""There is a double standard,"" said Gallagher, who also wrote ""Everything I Need to Know I Learned From Other Women."" ""The same exact behavior in a male boss is seen as a plus, and the same behavior in a female boss gets seen as a negative."" For instance, Gallagher said if a male boss ""gets agitated and slams his fist down on the table and goes, 'I want this done by 3 o'clock this afternoon,' everyone goes, 'Ooh, take charge kind of guy.'"" If a woman does the same thing, Gallagher said, people are likely to say, ""Oh, what a bitch."" ""So the same tone of voice, the same words, the same body language, the same everything gets filtered through our stereotypes and assumptions about how various groups should behave,"" she said. The 'token woman' issue . Fueling the stereotypes, Gallagher and leaders from Catalyst said, are environments with few women in leadership positions. ""When there's going to be a token woman, one woman is going to make it to the top, what does this do?"" said Ilene Lang, president and CEO of Catalyst, during an interview last month. ""Does that encourage anybody to support women? Does it encourage women to support other women? It's a culture that will encourage women to fight with other women or to discourage other women."" But when the culture of the organization focuses on mentorship and sponsorship, and there are more women in leadership positions, that ""Queen Bee myth"" of women not helping women gets busted, Lang said. In fact, a report by Catalyst found that 73% of women who received career development support are helping to support and develop other women, versus 30% of men. ""Our research shows that women not only sponsor and support other women, but that they do other men as well, and they really do pay it forward to a huge amount,"" Lang said. That's been the experience of Karen Shaer, one of the women I profiled last month. Shaer is senior executive vice president and general counsel of the legal services firm Garden City Group, where eight of the company's 15 executives are women. ""It could be that some women tend to be more critical, but I haven't seen that,"" Shaer said. ""I've seen more of the efforts for women to be supportive of other women."" The mom of two said, ""It's infectious. When women help other women, then the women they help (have) a role model in that regard. And then ... if (they) develop and grow into a position of power or authority, I expect they will be more likely to turn around and treat someone that way."" 'I've had good experiences with both' Shaer, a former federal prosecutor, said she doesn't have a preference -- she's had good experiences with female and male bosses. ""I'm looking more for qualities that can be shared by men and women,"" she said. ""I'm looking for someone who's a good communicator, who's going to be someone who is a good teacher, as well as be supportive, someone who is open to giving opportunities for growth and development and that can be provided by a man or a woman."" Complaints we saw from readers that women micromanage, hold grudges and are unable to make decisions didn't reflect Shaer's experience, she said. ""Maybe I've just been blessed with very good bosses, supervisors,"" she said. ""It has not been my experience that women do those things. I think my experience maybe has been contrary to that."" When I asked an unscientific sampling in my Facebook community about the new survey's findings, I received a handful of responses, the majority with positive comments about working for women. ""With one notable exception, all my great bosses have been women,"" said Kim Kennedy, a television news producer in New York. ""The best ones are collaborative and intuitive, give you some room to accomplish things beyond your assignment or job description, and many have been good mentors as well."" On the other side is Joy Lipkin, a college educator in New York who also works with young special-education students. ""Men are more straightforward, less emotionally attached (I mean this in a good way),"" Lipkin said on Facebook. ""Women hold grudges and seek vengeance on their subordinates. That's been my experience."" A father of two who didn't want to use his name said he reports to two women now who are ""so much nicer"" to work with than the male supervisors in his last job. But he added, ""I think, overall, it just depends on the individual people."" I agree. The most horrible boss I've had in my career was a woman. The most amazing, mentoring and supportive boss I've had was also a woman. I've also had good and bad male bosses. So, like Shaer from the Garden City Group, I don't have a preference. My current boss is a woman, so, of course, these days, I lean in that direction. Do you prefer a male or female boss?

"(CNN) -- Danish football club FC Copenhagen has been left in limbo ahead of its European Champions League game at Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk due to the current conflict in Ukraine. Copenhagen is due to face the Ukrainian side on July 29 in the city of Dnipropetrovsk to contest the first leg of the competition's third qualifying round. However, following the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash last week and the ongoing unrest in Ukraine, the Danish club does not know if it will be able to travel by plane for the game or even find a company to insure it for the trip. ""We are waiting,"" Copenhagen head of press and communications Christian Wolny told CNN. ""There are some issues right now that we need to get sorted. ""There is no way our travel agent can find any company that will fly us to Ukraine. ""It's currently a serious risk to fly over Ukraine, so many, many companies have removed their route to the country. We cannot get there by flight. ""Furthermore, the Danish foreign ministry has labeled the region as being unstable, which means they do not tell us not to go there, but it is not stable. They cannot guarantee what the situation will be in nine days [for the match]. ""The last point is our insurance company, they do not cover us in the eastern part of Ukraine, where Dnipropetrovsk is. ""We need to get these three issues solved, and we have made UEFA aware of the situation."" Prior to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash, UEFA's Emergency Panel decided its European club competition matches involving Ukrainian clubs would be allowed to take place in Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa, in addition to Kiev and Lviv. UEFA has yet to confirm if Copenhagen's trip to Dnipro will go ahead, or if it will be played in another venue. Ukrainian champion Shakhtar Donetsk is currently unable to play matches at its Donbass Arena stadium due to the conflict in the city of Donetsk. ""For us we have no problem with FC Dnipro as a club, or the city that they play in,"" Wolny added.

""We are preparing as much as we can. But usually at this point normally, for a match of this importance, we have everything ready by now,"" Wolny said. ""All the details -- transfer plans for players and staff, where to stay, where to eat, everything that would give us the best possible chance of performing on the pitch.

"(CNN) -- Sometimes it feels like President Clinton never left the public spotlight. Although there were moments during the 2008 campaign when it seemed he was as much of a target within his own party as were the Republicans, these days Clinton is everywhere and Democrats want him by their side. Members of President Obama's campaign team say Clinton will offer them his services next year. The re-emergence of President Clinton in Obama's circles has been gradual. It has taken time to recover from the tensions that flared during the 2008 Democratic primaries, when some Democrats accused Clinton of making racist remarks following Obama's victory over Sen. Hillary Clinton in South Carolina. But over the past year, the White House has brought him back on more and more occasions to strengthen Obama's standing. What explains the former president's appeal -- beyond his knowing how to work the necessary magic that got him re-elected in 1996 and left booming approval ratings at the end of his presidency? His strengths offer some guidance for President Obama to improve his standing, even beyond his campaign. The first is that President Clinton was very successful at counteracting Republicans when they attacked. One of President Obama's great frustrations has been the ""messaging wars."" He has frequently been frustrated by how the GOP portrays him to the public and defines his policies in unfavorable ways. Clinton didn't let the GOP do that easily. When Republicans painted the president as left of center early in his term, he responded by aggressively highlighting his centrist credentials, lowering the deficit in 1993 and reforming welfare in 1996. Although he accepted their terms of debate, unlike when President Obama has done the same, he was able to follow through on that co-optation by strengthening his party's standing. When House Republicans shut down the government over spending, Clinton helped convince the public that they were extremists, forcing Republicans to backtrack. When the GOP started the process to impeach President Clinton in 1998 and 1999, he focused public attention on that process, which he said was driven purely by partisan concerns. Republicans said that the president was corrupt. The president responded that Republicans were simply using impeachment for partisan purposes. His approval ratings skyrocketed. The GOP struggled. The second reason is that President Clinton was relentless in his focus on the economy. Clinton, who famously campaigned with ""It's the economy, stupid"" in 1992, never took his eye off the ball. He continued to hammer away at the recession that he inherited and didn't stop talking about the problems Americans faced. Although Clinton did turn his attention toward health care in 1993 and 1994, he continued to work on the economy, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act. He proposed enterprise zones to try and revitalize urban areas and fought against Republican proposed cuts to key domestic programs. During the rebound of the mid-1990s, Clinton was in a good position to claim credit for the improved circumstances. President Obama has certainly worked hard to improve the economy. In more dramatic fashion than Clinton, he persuaded Congress to pass an economic stimulus bill as well as financial regulation. But too often, President Obama has seemed focused on other concerns, whether it was health care reform in his first two years as president or deficit reduction after the midterm elections. The situation has left many Democrats yearning for a president who understood that economic recovery was the top priority for many in the party. The final reason is that President Clinton displayed a phenomenal ability to show empathy with Americans who were suffering, whether they were struggling with hard economic times or were the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. Although empathy is much different from policy, it was clear that Clinton's ability to forge connections with voters in small groups, or even through speeches, was one of the reasons his polls remained so strong. This has been one of the hardest challenges for the president, who often seems distant and disconnected from the problems facing the country. Obama, a skilled orator, has had trouble connecting to voters at this level. None of this is to ignore the many Democrats who still look back to the Clinton years with a skeptical eye. After all, some Democrats argue that he helped to promote the deregulatory policies that fueled the financial meltdown and that he did little to reverse the growing economic inequality in America. Nonetheless, many aspects of his presidency are attractive in retrospect. For all these reasons, President Clinton is back. The man who often positioned himself against the Clinton legacy is running side by side with him. Besides the campaign for reelection, President Obama should spend some time thinking about what lessons Clinton has to offer this presidency in the final months of his first term -- and in his second term, should that come to pass. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Bill Clinton has re-emerged as a political force to be cultivated .
Obama could learn how Clinton got himself re-elected, he says, won high ratings .
Zelizer: Clinton succeeded in countering GOP attacks, stayed focused on economy .
Another lesson for Obama is Clinton's empathy for struggling Americans, he writes ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has given big business, unions and nonprofits more power to spend freely in federal elections, a major turnaround that threatens a century of government efforts to regulate the power of corporations to bankroll American politics. A 5-4 conservative majority crafted a narrow overhaul of federal campaign spending Thursday that could have an immediate effect on this year's congressional midterm elections. The justices eased long-standing restrictions on ""independent spending"" by corporations and unions in political campaigns. ""When government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority. ""The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves."" The opinion radically alters the election calculus, offering greater spending flexibility for a broader range of for-profit and nonprofit groups seeking a voice in the crowded national political debate. Hours after the ruling, President Obama responded, saying the court has given ""the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington -- while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates."" In a statement, he said he is telling his administration ""to get to work immediately with Congress on this issue. We are going to talk with bipartisan congressional leaders to develop a forceful response to this decision. The public interest requires nothing less."" ""The Supreme Court has given a green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics,"" Obama said. ""It is a major victory for big oil, Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans."" Reaction on the other side said the ruling was long overdue. ""The Supreme Court's decision today is a victory for the First Amendment and the right of all Americans to participate in the political process,"" said Theodore Olson, who successfully argued the case for the conservative Citizens United. In a dissent to the opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, ""In a democratic society, the long-standing consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden applications of judge-made rules."" He added, ""The court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions around the nation."" The case was the first one heard on the bench for newest Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and she voted in dissent with her three more liberal colleagues. The issue hinged on whether corporations' ability to pour money into election campaigns could be strictly regulated, or whether corporations have free-speech rights to spend their cash to influence elections, just as individual donors do. In this ruling, the justices also nullified earlier rulings upholding the core of a 6-year-old federal law aimed at curbing corporate campaign spending. Under current law, there are severe restrictions on campaign ads used by corporations for federal elections. They generally must be issue-focused -- talking about abortion or taxes, for instance -- and not expressly supporting or opposing a candidate. Those limits have now been generally removed. The specific case grew out of a documentary on Hillary Clinton. Produced last year by Citizens United, ""Hillary: The Movie"" was a scorching attack on the then-presidential candidate. The filmmakers wanted to promote it during the heat of the 2008 primary season, but a federal court blocked any ads, as well as airings on cable television's video on demand. On that specific question, the justices ruled against Citizens United, saying federal restrictions on broadcast ads are appropriate. ""Citizens United's narrower arguments are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute,"" Kennedy wrote. The Washington-based nonprofit corporation and advocacy organization balked at campaign finance rules that would have required disclosure of its financial backers, and restrictions on when the film could air. It was financed with a mix of corporate and individual donations. Navigating the complex, ever-evolving landscape of election money rules has spurred a cottage industry of financial, political and legal armies, ready to do battle over the money and the message. The crux of this dispute, like others before it, is just how far the government may go to regulate campaign spending and campaign ads. In his opinion, Kennedy acknowledged that, but said Americans should be trusted to decide competing election issues. ""The appearance of influence or access,"" he wrote, ""will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy."" ""Our nation's speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights,"" Kennedy said. ""The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach."" But Stevens, who read part of his harsh dissent from the bench, said, ""The court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding."" Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts were key to the ruling, agreeing with their more conservative colleagues. Alito replaced moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who upheld past corporate restrictions in 2003, when the high court last confronted the issue. Section 203 of the comprehensive Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002, widely known as the McCain-Feingold law, bans the broadcast of ""electioneering communication"" by corporations, trade groups, unions and some issue advocacy groups, if the material would air close to election dates and identify candidates by name or image. The law also requires an on-screen notice of the groups financing such ads, as well as public disclosure of all who donated to the sponsoring organizations. The landmark McCain-Feingold law took effect the day after the November 2002 elections. Among its many provisions are a ban on ""soft money,"" the unlimited and unregulated contributions to national political parties; a ban, in the 60 days before an election, on advocacy ads, those criticizing or supporting a candidate's stand on an issue; contribution limits; and donor disclosure requirements. Much of McCain-Feingold remains unaffected by the high court's latest ruling, including the current ban on large, unregulated donations to political parties and the candidates themselves by corporations. The case also does not affect political action committees, separate groups created by corporations, unions and others that can contribute directly to federal candidates. PAC money has a $5,000-per-candidate limit, and must be funded through voluntary contributions from employees, members or individuals, not by direct corporate or union treasuries. The ruling could have far-reaching effects beyond the federal arena. Twenty-two states have similar bans on corporate spending in state and local elections. Restrictions on money in gubernatorial, legislative and even judicial races could soon be a thing of the past. ""Campaign 2010 was already bulked up with the potential of campaign ad spending,"" said Evan Tracey, president of Campaign Media Analysis Group and CNN's consultant on political television advertising. ""Now it's on steroids."" Excerpts of the movie and the ads can be viewed online at www.hillarythemovie.com. The case is Citizens United v. FEC (08-205).","NEW: Ruling gives special interests ""more power in Washington,"" president says .

"(CNN) -- A 9-year-old rapper's adult-themed music videos are finding some new viewers -- Massachusetts child welfare authorities. The child, Luie Rivera Jr., whose stage name is ""Lil Poopy,"" is seen in videos posted online, including on YouTube, smacking a woman's backside, flashing wads of cash, riding in a Ferrari and rapping about how ""coke is not a bad word."" A separate video shows the young performer in a nightclub with a dancing woman in a sexually suggestive position, with people in the crowd throwing cash. The Brockton, Massachusetts, police department contacted the state's Department of Children and Families after receiving a call from a ""concerned citizen"" who saw the boy in videos featuring sexual themes and drug references. The state agency is brought in when there is suspicion of physical, mental, or emotional abuse of a child, according to Brockton police Lt. Robert Sergio. ""An investigation is now open,"" said Cayenne Isaksen, public affairs director for the state agency. Isaksen would not discuss details about the investigation, but added that non-emergency investigations typically take no longer than 15 days. Lil Poopy is a member of internationally known, Moroccan-born rapper French Montana's group, Coke Boys. According to CNN affiliate WCVB, Luis Rivera, Lil Poopy's father, says his son is ""not doing anything wrong,"" and that he planned on contacting his lawyer. CNN has been unable to independently reach the elder Rivera.

"(CNN) -- A Michigan teenager pleaded guilty Monday in the mob beating of a 54-year-old grandfather after he inadvertently struck a child with his truck in April, according to a news release from the Wayne County Prosecutor's office. Bruce Wimbush, 18, pleaded guilty to assault with intent to do great bodily harm, according to the news release. Wimbush admitted in court Monday that he punched the driver, Steven Utash, in the jaw and was among a ""large group of people"" that attacked the man in April. The teen told Judge James Callahan that after seeing Utash hit a child, he ""got emotional"" and his anger took over, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. ""I have a little brother and when I saw the kid, all I could see at the time was my little brother,"" Wimbush said, according to WDIV. The charge was reduced by prosecutors from assault with intent to murder with the agreement that Wimbush will testify in future proceedings related to the assault, the release said. Three other adult suspects are charged with attempted murder in the attack while a fourth, a juvenile, is charged with assault and ethnic intimidation. They are scheduled to appear in court this week, according to the prosecutor's office. Wimbush will be sentenced on July 7 and faces up to 10 years in prison, according to the prosecutor's office. Utash, the driver, was hospitalized in a coma after the attack. He returned home in May after spending more than six weeks in a hospital and rehabilitation center, according to a ""Help Steven Utash"" Facebook page post.

"Washington (CNN) -- For years, Denise Scott and her three daughters thought they had certainty about their loved one's death on September 11, 2001. They believed Randy Scott -- Denise's husband and father to Jessica, Rebecca and Alexandra -- died instantly when the second hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 175, hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Randy Scott worked for Euro Brokers Inc. on the 84th floor, very close to the plane's point of impact. The family took some comfort believing that he might not have suffered. But a handwritten note with just five words and two numbers on it has changed everything for the Scott family. The note reads, ""84th floor west office 12 people trapped."" The note was written by Randy Scott. ""We all just wrote the same ending,"" Denise Scott told CNN Connecticut affiliate WTIC-TV, ""and it wasn't correct."" Remembering 9/11 . The note reveals that Randy Scott was not only alive after impact but actively trying to get help. He somehow sent the note out an opening in the South Tower and down to the street below. Randy Scott's best friend, Steve Ernst, believes he knows what happened. ""He actually literally broke a window, probably with a desk,"" Ernst said. ""That's how they found that it was his note; his bloody thumbprint was on the corner of the letter."" According to Ernst and accounts the family gave to WTIC and the Stamford, Connecticut, Advocate newspaper, the note was recovered on the street almost immediately. Then, according to those accounts, it was handed to a guard at the nearby Federal Reserve Bank. The South Tower collapsed shortly after that. The Federal Reserve kept the note stored for years and then turned it over to the National September 11th Memorial & Museum, according to those accounts. The museum worked with the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to process the note. It was that smudge of blood on the note -- Randy Scott's blood -- that enabled the medical examiner to use DNA technology to trace the note. By the time the note had gone through all those processes, a decade had passed. In August 2011, the medical examiner's office called Denise Scott, said it had something written and asked her to identify it. She brought Ernst with her. ""When we saw the letter, you can't mistake his handwriting,"" Ernst said. ""So we knew right away that ... he went down fighting as hard as he could."" ""It was hard to hold back your tears,"" said Ernst, who like the Scott family lives in Stamford. ""It's another part of him that just comes back."" After 9/11, how we honored our son's memory . Ernst and Denise Scott decided it was best not to tell Denise's daughters right away. ""I think we both realized that it's a really tough awakening, to realize that your father didn't die instantly, and might have really suffered or might have had a harder time than we thought,"" Ernst said. Only ""fragments"" of Randy Scott's body were recovered, according to Ernst. Denise Scott waited until this year, when the youngest daughter, Alexandra, was out of college, to talk about the note. ""My youngest, when I told them about the note, said, 'Oh, Daddy must have been so scared,"" Denise Scott said. ""And I said 'No, your father was hopeful.' "" Ernst said he believes the physical characteristics of the writing tell Randy Scott's story in those final moments. ""He wasn't trembling. He wasn't nervous. It just looked like, 'This is what I gotta do. I gotta get some help to these 12 people.' "" Teaching my child about the 9/11 attacks .","Randy Scott worked at the World Trade Center .

"(Budget Travel) -- The freedom to go precisely where you want, when you want and how you want -- behold, the power of one! Budget Travel's Trip Coach answers 6 of the most common solo travel questions: . I'm planning to take a trip by myself. Are there any destinations that are especially appealing for solo travelers? First off, you're not alone. Solo travelers account for 11 percent of all American vacationers. No destination is strictly off-limits to solo travelers, but some places are easier (and more appealing) to navigate than others. In general, the best bets for first-time single travelers are English-speaking destinations known for their friendliness and hospitality, such as Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. After all, you're a lot less likely to get lost or feel lonely if you're surrounded by people who can understand what you're saying. Within Southeast Asia, Thailand and Vietnam are also particularly welcoming, if only for the affordability and prevalence of English. Quiz: Name that hotel chain . What are some ways I can connect with others on the road? You'll want to start planting the seed before you go: Talk up your travel plans on Facebook, Twitter and other social-media outlets. You might be surprised to discover a long-lost friend from college who plans on passing through Paris when you are, too; or perhaps a colleague has family in India, near the yoga retreat where you've booked a stay. Another networking suggestion, from IndependentTraveler.com editor Sarah Schlichter, is to use the website couchsurfing.org. Even if you're not interested in the site's primary service (setting up free couch-stays), it can be a handy tool for connecting with locals around the world. ""The site draws social types who are obviously up for meeting and hosting travelers,"" she says. ""You can suggest lunch or coffee at a café or museum."" Beth Whitman, author of ""Wanderlust and Lipstick: The Essential Guide for Women Traveling Solo,"" offers this simple tip: Go to a busy park, sit out on a bench with a map and phrasebook, and wait for a curious passerby to make the first move. ""You'd be amazed how often this works for me,"" she says. ""In faraway locations, especially, there are always friendly college students who want to practice English."" Budget Travel: 10 great girlfriend getaways . Finally, be strategic about where you stay. At big chain hotels, people tend to retreat to the comfort of their own private rooms; your chances of befriending other travelers are far better at B&Bs and family-run inns, where guests congregate at the breakfast table and in common areas. Any tips for keeping costs down? When you're on your own, lodging becomes the main, annoying expense. Solo travelers are effectively charged twice as much in hotels because most places automatically base their room rates on double occupancy. One way around this surcharge, called a single-supplement fee, is to simply ask for a discount: Point out that you're the only person staying in the room and that you'll be using less electricity and water and eating less breakfast than two guests. ""Bargaining over room rates is common and accepted in most of the world,"" Whitman says. ""Smaller, family-run hotels are more apt to give price breaks than chains or ritzy properties."" Budget Travel: 16 awe-inspiring American monuments . On cruises, solo travelers are often charged the full cabin rate -- which amounts to a 200 percent single-supplement fee -- but you may be able to find deals by booking early or at the very last minute, according to Amber Blecker, a travel agent who runs Solo Cruise Resource. Specifically, Princess and Holland America often offer solo cruisers discounts of up to 50 percent off the single-supplement fee for bookings made six or more months ahead, and Celebrity and Royal Caribbean often reduce fees by as much as 25 percent as the cruise's date of departure nears, Blecker says. Tour package supplements vary significantly, so choose wisely if you want to go guided. Charging solo travelers around 30 percent more is typical, for instance, but some outfitters, such as Gap Adventures and Cosmos, offer price breaks and design itineraries specifically for groups of singles. That trend seems to be growing, according to Diane Redfern, founder of the website Connecting: Solo Travel Network, which lists tours and trips specifically for solo travelers. ""When I launched the company in 1990, I knew of just one travel company that catered specifically to singles,"" Redfern says. ""Now I have upward of 400 tours and cruises listed on my site at any given time."" Check out our sidebar, ""Trips for One, for Less,"" for more money-saving trip ideas on cruises, tours and accommodations. How to save on solo travel . I absolutely dread going out to eat on my own. Help! Count yourself in good company. Dining alone may well be solo travelers' number-one fear, so much so that it even has an official diagnosis: solomangarephobia. In practice, however, it can be a lot easier than you expect. Whitman recommends getting a seat at the bar, rather than at a table, in restaurants. ""There are always people to chat with-other solo diners, regulars, even the bartender."" If you're not feeling talkative, bring along a book or magazine to stay occupied. You could also skip the restaurant scene altogether, by sampling street food or picnicking in a park with items from a farmers' market. I'm concerned about safety. Anything I can do? To minimize risks, follow these five practical tips, gathered from experts including Whitman, Schlichter and travel guidebook author Rick Steves. (1) Project strength. Walk purposefully, and show no fear-even if you have to fake it. Pickpockets prey on travelers who look like confused, easy victims.   (2) Always remain alert. ""It's those few seconds of inattentiveness when your bag or purse could get snatched,"" Whitman says. ""Thieves are generally looking for a quick steal, so bring a cable lock to secure your belongings to your seat on trains, and lock the zippers of your bags together so no one can easily open them.""   (3) Readjust your schedule. If you feel uncomfortable going out at night, don't force it. Instead, sightsee during the day, make lunch your biggest meal, and turn in early. ""Everyone should avoid walking alone at night,"" Schlichter says. ""I've heard plenty of stories of male travelers who put themselves in bad situations -- they made the mistake of assuming they'd always be fine because they're guys.""   (4) Avoid the flirts. Steves has long advised single female travelers to wear fake wedding rings, especially in Mediterranean and Latin countries, where the men tend to pay more attention to women than Americans are typically used to. Getting hit on doesn't always turn into a safety concern, of course, but a simple gold band could save you some headaches.  (5) Follow your gut. If your radar goes off, listen to it -- no matter who sets it off. ""Women and young children are just as likely to be pickpockets in some European countries -- not men with knives,"" Whitman points out. ""They often get away with it, I think, because people don't want to be rude to a nice-looking, middle-aged lady holding a baby, even if she's being pushy."" How can I get some decent vacation shots -- with me in them -- if I'm alone? If you go the obvious route (asking someone to snap a picture with your camera), you're not only handing off a pricey piece of electronics to a stranger, you're also relinquishing control of how the photo turns out. Your best bet is to invest in some new gear, namely the XShot Camera Extender ($30), a metal rod that attaches to your camera, extends up to three feet, and acts as an extra-long arm. Once you master your camera's timer, you can capture self-portraits that look like someone else took the shot. ""I carry it on every trip,"" Whitman says. ""I put my iPhone in it and take pictures of myself and the friends that I've made. The photos are always great because everybody's laughing when I set up the shot. It's goofy, but fun."" Now you can be the designated photographer, stay in the picture, and come home armed with frameable souvenirs. Get the best travel deals and tips emailed to you FREE - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- If you believe the cover of The New Yorker magazine, Bert and Ernie may be ready to come out.

The suggestion is that the characters were happily celebrating the recent SCOTUS rulings on gay marriage. There has been plenty of speculation about Bert and Ernie over the years, which intensified after a tweet from the Sesame Street account which quoted Bernie talking about his mohawk hair cut that some took to be a hint to the character's sexuality.

"(CNN) -- For the first time, Indonesian maids working in Saudi Arabia will be guaranteed a monthly wage, time off, and contact with their loved ones, under a new agreement signed by the Gulf kingdom and Jakarta this week. Human rights groups say the pact is a step towards ensuring the protection of foreign workers' basic rights in Saudi Arabia. But it fails to address a worrying trend of domestic helpers filing complaints of exploitation and abuse only to face counter-allegations by their employers of ""theft, witchcraft or adultery,"" according to Human Rights Watch. The penalties for these crimes are harsh in the deeply conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which practices a puritanical form of Islam. ""There's a real belief, and it's something that can be prosecuted through the Saudi courts, that black magic or witchcraft is real,"" said Nisha Varia, senior researcher for women's rights at Human Rights Watch. ""Domestic workers are especially vulnerable to these types of accusations because of cultural differences."" Abuse of Asian migrants . Varia, who spoke to domestic workers as part of a report on abuses against Asian migrants in Saudi Arabia, says an amulet on a necklace may be enough for an employer to accuse a maid of plotting to bring bad luck on the family. Earlier this month, King Abdullah pardoned an Indonesian maid, who was on death row after being convicted in 2003 of ""casting a magic spell on her employer and his family,"" a spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy told Saudi news site, Arab news. She returned to her home in West Java, but others haven't been so lucky. Some 41 other Indonesian workers face possible death sentences in Saudi Arabia on charges ranging from black magic to stealing, adultery and murder, according to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry and local non-profit groups. Many facing charges claim they suffered long-term abuse or exploitation at the hands of employers, according to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's director for legal aid and protection of Indonesian nationals overseas, Tatang Budie Utama Razak. ""When I observe why they killed their employer, most of them were not mentally ready (to work overseas),"" Razak told CNN. ""They have to work unlimited hours, they have take care of the children, take care of the house, (their salaries are) unpaid, they cannot go out, (and) they cannot contact their families,"" he said. No fair trial . Most have not been given a fair trial, said Anis Hidayah, executive director of Indonesian group Migrant Care. ""Sometimes they don't have access to interpreters or lawyers who make sure they understand the trial process,"" Hidayah added. Hidayah's organization is campaigning for the release of Satinah binti Jumadi Ahmad, a 40-year-old maid who is on death row for murdering her employer and fleeing with SR37,500 (US$10,000). The woman reportedly admitted to killing her boss but said it was in self defense as her employer had been trying to attack her at the time. In cases like Satinah's, it can be difficult to know exactly what happened, said Varia from Human Rights Watch, since the alleged incidents often take place behind closed doors in employers' homes. Varia said many domestic workers who are being overworked or aren't getting paid won't come forward because they fear the authorities will believe their employers, who are well-connected or at least speak flawless Arabic, over a foreigner who may be unfamiliar with the language, local laws and her rights. 'Blood money' Satinah is due to be beheaded in the coming weeks, unless she can raise a hefty ""blood money"" payment to give to her employer's heirs. Indonesian authorities have negotiated the amount down from SR10 million (US$2.6 million) to SR7 million (US$1.8 million), according to Razak. The maid's 20-year-old daughter, who was 11 when her mother left Indonesia, sent a letter to the employer's family pleading for her release. So far, SR4 million has been raised, including a SR3 million contribution from the Indonesian government along with other donations from Indonesian citizens and an unnamed Saudi donor, Razak said. Around 1.5 million women -- mostly from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines -- work in Saudi Arabia as domestic workers, according to Human Rights Watch. They make up less than a quarter of the kingdom's eight million foreign workers but account for most of the complaints received by embassies of sending countries, the organization said. Common complaints include wages not being paid, passports being seized, brutal work hours, and forced labor along with physical and sexual abuse. Another 28-year-old Indonesian on death row, Tuti Tursilawati binti Warjuki, allegedly killed her employer in 2010 when he attempted to rape her following months of sexual violence. Workers freeze . In 2011, the beheading of Indonesian maid Ruyati binti Satubi by Saudi Arabia sparked outrage in Indonesia. Jakarta had been in the process of requesting a pardon for the 54-year old, and was not informed prior to her execution. This seemed to be the last straw for Indonesia which announced it would put a freeze on sending new workers to Gulf nation. Saudi Arabia responded by suspending visas to Indonesian domestic workers. The ban has remained in place since, but disputes between foreign workers from other countries and their employers have continued to emerge. In one of the most high-profile cases, a Sri Lankan, Rizana Nafeek, 24, was beheaded in January 2013 after being convicted of killing her employer's baby when she was 17. At the time, Amnesty International condemned the death and warned that ""a disproportionate number of foreign nationals, mainly migrant workers from countries in the global South,"" had been executed in Saudi Arabia over recent years. New rules . Six months later, Saudi Arabia introduced new regulations that offered all foreign domestic workers basic protections including sick leave, work days of no longer than 15 hours, and paid vacation for one month every two years. The regulations also stipulated that domestic workers must respect the teachings of Islam, maintain her employer's family secrets, and follow their employers' ""orders."" After more than two years of negotiation, Saudia Arabia and Indonesia signed an agreement on Wednesday that clarifies, for the first time, the duties and wages of workers and responsibilities of employers, explained Razak. According to reports in Saudi media, a statement from Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Labor said the pact aims to ""strengthen relations between the two countries and moderate the relationship between employers and employees."" The ministry has signed similar agreements with three other countries that, combined, make up 70% of Saudi Arabia's domestic helper workforce, and has started new committees to look into foreign workers' issues, the statement added. CNN reached out to Saudi authorities for this story but have yet to receive a response. Under the new agreement, Indonesian maids must have one day off a week, be allowed to keep their passports, to communicate with family and friends outside their employers' homes, and receive health insurance. The agreement could lead to the ban being lifted, but Indonesia wants to see how it will be implemented before allowing more citizens to migrate to Saudi Arabia, according to Razak. He hopes the agreement will minimize the risk of Indonesians ending up on death row in Saudi prisons by preparing the workers better while helping employers to understand the rights of workers in their homes. Rights groups skeptical . Indonesia must also ensure potential domestic workers receive medical check ups and do not have a criminal record, and setting up these systems will take time, Razak said. There must also be a shift in how some employers perceive their workers, he said. ""We thank the destination countries because they have provided jobs. At the same time the user must be thankful for the workers, because they also will be assisted by the workers."" But human rights groups are skeptical that the 2013 regulations and the new pact with Indonesia will improve the lives of the workers any time soon. Varia from Human Rights Watch said there are some advances in the pact, but it fails to tackle some of the root causes of what makes domestic workers so vulnerable, such as Saudi Arabia's ""kafala,"" or sponsorship, system. ""Employers have so much control over their domestic worker by being their immigration sponsor. They have control over whether the domestic worker can change jobs (and) they have to give their approval before the domestic worker even leaves the country,"" she said. ""This system is the cause of such a huge power imbalance that leads to a lot of exploitation and that needs to change.""","Saudi Arabia and Indonesia sign pact to outline basic rights of foreign domestic workers .

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- The first distress call from the ferry Sewol came not from the crew, but from a boy who used a cell phone to contact emergency services from aboard the sinking ship, the South Korean coast guard confirmed to CNN Tuesday. CNN affiliate JTBC reported that the boy dialed South Korea's emergency number, telling dispatchers for a local fire service, ""Help us. The boat is sinking."" The boy's fate was not clear. It was not until three minutes later, the coast guard told CNN, that the ship's crew made a distress call to maritime officials. The revelation is likely to add to questions about the conduct of the crew, nine of whom are facing charges in last week's sinking. Among other things, authorities have questioned why an inexperienced third mate was guiding the ship at the time of the accident, why so few of the ferry's life rafts were deployed and why crew members ordered passengers to don life vests and stay put. At least 146 people are confirmed dead, according to the joint task force leading the search. Earlier, when the death toll was reported to be 128, authorities had said that 174 people were still missing. The death toll had been expected to climb as divers were able to reach the ship's cafeteria, where many passengers were thought to be when the ship began to have troubles last week. But early Wednesday, the coast guard said no bodies had been found in the cafeteria. Search for survivors goes on . Rescuers will continue to focus on the third and fourth decks of the five-level ship, said Koh Myung-seok, a spokesman for the joint task force. Above the ship, two buoys marked its location in the water, surrounded by dozens of vessels, ranging from dinghies to warships. Inflatable powerboats zipped across the sea, ferrying divers to the area. Searchers used guide ropes to lead them into the submerged ferry. ""Divers can't even see their hands,"" Koh said. Bard Yoon, one of the divers, said conditions are so bad ""my heart aches."" ""We're going in thinking there may be survivors,"" he said. ""When we have to come back with nothing, we can't even face the families."" On shore, relatives of missing passengers waited anxiously, many of them parents of high school students who were on a field trip. As bodies come in, they are called into white domed tents to identify the remains of their loved ones. Authorities said the efforts are still a search and rescue operation, but no survivors have been found since 174 people were rescued soon after the ferry went down. Captain and crew criticized . As the search continues, investigators are trying to figure out what happened to make the ship list before finally capsizing and sinking into the ocean. Initial criticism has focused on the captain and some crew members. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Monday that their actions were ""akin to murder."" The captain, Lee Joon-seok, has defended his decision to tell passengers to stay put as the ferry began sinking, saying he was concerned about the sea's strong currents and cold water as well as the lack of rescue ships. Questions have been raised about why the third mate was steering the ship when it ran into trouble on its way to a popular vacation island. The captain was in his cabin at the time. Chonghaejin Marine, which operated the ferry, has posted an apology on its website. ""We pray for the Sewol victims who lost their precious lives due to the accident,"" it said. ""We prostrate ourselves before the victims' families and beg for forgiveness."" In recent maritime disasters, captains didn't hang around . Students remember vice principal who took own life . Murky waters cloud the horror facing rescue divers . CNN's Kyung Lah and K.J. Kwon reported from Jindo, and CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Khushbu Shah, Tim Schwarz, Steven Jiang and Judy Kwon, journalists Stella Kim and Jung-eun Kim, and translator Hyoun Joo Song also contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll has risen to 146, authorities say .

"New York (CNN) -- As a symbol of communication, refuge or romantic longing, the pay phone is an enduring cultural icon. Witness John Cusack braving a downpour to call his girl in ""Say Anything ...,"" Tippi Hedren under attack in Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" or Clark Kent, that intrepid reporter, dashing into a phone booth to become Superman. With the rise of mobile phones over the past decade, pay phones have been disappearing. New York City had a high of 35,000 pay phones in the late 1990s. Today, there are only about 11,400, according to the city. Nationwide, the number of pay phones has dropped from approximately 2.1 million in 1999 to around 425,000 today. But thanks to some new initiatives, pay phones may not be doomed to fade from the urban landscape like penny-farthings and oil-lit street lamps. Anyone with a cell phone knows that connectivity is not always guaranteed -- especially not during emergencies, when networks are overloaded. In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, which pounded the Northeast in late October, many New Yorkers found themselves without power and without mobile service. To communicate with the rest of the world, they took to pay phones. ""I wanted to call my mom, but my cell phone wasn't working. I remembered there were two pay phones on the corner of my street,"" said Ashley Freskos, 30, who works in men's fashion in Manhattan, and at the time, lived in the Lower East Side where electricity and mobile phone service were knocked out by the storm. ""I hadn't really used a pay phone since I was 14, before I got a cell phone. I didn't even know if they still worked,"" she said. ""My mom didn't even pick up (at first) when I called because she didn't recognize the number."" Pay phone volume across New York City's five boroughs rose tenfold during Sandy, said Peter Izzo of Van Wagner Communications, which operates 4,200 pay phones in the city. ""Pay phones are the last life line of communication for the poor in America,"" said Willard Nichols, president of the American Public Communications Council. More than 750 million calls are placed on pay phones per year, he said. ""There's no question that pay phones are critical when there is an emergency,"" Nichols added. ""We saw in Sandy the same as Katrina. There were still pay phones working in New Orleans during the height of the storm when all other communication was out."" When all hell breaks loose, a pay phone is a good bet. But to stay relevant, the pay phone of the future needs to offer valuable services at all times, not just during emergencies. So the city of New York is trying to give the humble pay phone an upgrade. In July the city created Wi-Fi hotspots at 10 payphone kiosks in three of its boroughs, the first step in a pilot program designed to make wireless access available to as many people as possible in the city. And this month Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced a new initiative the city hopes will rejuvenate the city's remaining public pay phones. The Reinvent Payphones Design Challenge dares students, technologists, designers, policy experts and urban planners, to come up with new solutions to take advantage of the existing pay phone framework and shape the future of public communications infrastructure. ""We're challenging our dynamic and ever-growing tech community to 'Re-Own the Phone' and provide their ideas on what the future of payphones could entail,"" said Bloomberg. Several pilot programs in New York already use existing payphone infrastructure, from digital advertising on phone kiosks in Times Square to interactive touchscreens around Union Square. But the new contest hopes to create a new purpose for the pay phone. ""What's unique about the pay phone network in New York is that the reliability of service is overwhelming -- and not just in hurricanes,"" said Izzo, citing the blackout of 2003 and the chaos of Sept. 11, 2001. Izzo credits the ""spider web"" like network of copper wire, paired with coaxial and fiber crossing underneath city streets, for the network's durability. ""There's no single 'choke point' to disrupt the service,"" he said. ""It's a matter of taking the existing infrastructure and making something new that people need. That copper wire is an old technology, but it still works.""","With the rise of mobile phones over the past decade, pay phones have been disappearing .

"(CNN) -- A day after House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's almost unprecedented primary loss, his defeat is being felt far from his central Virginia congressional district. Aftershocks from Cantor's loss at the hands of a little known and underfunded tea party supporter and economics professor rocked the political world -- from the campaign trail to the halls of Congress and the White House. The ouster of the No. 2 House Republican, who was seen by many as the next speaker, overturns the chamber's leadership hierarchy, and effectively kills any chance of immigration reform. ""It's just sending shivers throughout the Republican conference,"" veteran GOP Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. And Dave Brat's David vs. Goliath win will embolden a tea party movement that's experienced more defeats than victories so far this primary season. ""This is a major shot in the arm for the tea party movement,"" said Adam Brandon, a top official at FreedomWorks, a leading organizer of grassroots conservatives. 7 reasons Eric Cantor lost . Here are five things we learned from the political upset of the year: . 1. Showing up matters: Cantor apparently took things for granted. How Eric Cantor's 'House of Cards' fell apart . ""Eric Cantor lost this race as much as Dave Brat won it. He simply violated rule number one of politics: go home,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. ""This is Eric Cantor's fault. He was in Washington on primary day. Not back in his district."" He also turned down last-minute help from political allies. ""His confidence, his arrogance, his smugness cost him his seat,"" King added. Cantor didn't read the pulse of conservatives in his Republican-dominated district. ""My sense from talking to people in the 7th is that he had lost touch with the base of the Republican Party there, and by the time he realized it and tried to make amends, it was too late,"" Virginia political analyst Quentin Kidd said. ""Cantor's loss proves Speaker Tip O'Neill's point about all politics being local. The tea party movement may be stumbling in some places, but there was a lot of local tea party frustration at Eric Cantor. He is seen as removed from the issues they care about, such as on immigration. They saw him as trying to have it both ways, and they called him on it,"" added Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. Contrast that with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent target of conservatives, who easily bested six primary challengers from the right on Tuesday. ""To Graham's credit, he ran a great campaign. I think the assumption among a lot of people was that he'd solely wage an air war, but I was impressed with the way he also ran a traditional, grassroots-focused campaign in addition to a compelling broadcast message. And Lindsey himself spent a lot of time on the ground here holding events and interacting one-on-one with voters,"" South Carolina Republican consultant Joel Sawyer told CNN. Graham tended to the folks back home. Apparently Cantor didn't go home enough. 2. The tea party is alive and well: Remember all those stories earlier this spring about the demise of the tea party. Forget about that. Cantor challenger, Dave Brat, 'shocked' as results rolled in . The five-year-old anti-establishment grassroots conservative movement suffered a string of high profile defeats to incumbents and other mainstream Republicans earlier in the primary season. But the tide may be turning a bit. And with a bunch of tea party vs. establishment primary battles yet to come, what happened in Virginia will only embolden the grassroots. Cantor becomes the second member of Congress running for re-election this year to go down to defeat in the primaries, following Republican Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas, who lost a runoff contest two weeks ago. Hall is 91. Longtime Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi may soon become the third. He's fighting for his political life as he faces a primary runoff in two weeks against a tea party backed state senator who narrowly edged him in last week's primary. FreedomWorks, which is among the groups supporting Cochran challenger Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, says the Cantor defeat will only help their efforts. ""What happened last night in Virginia is just like adding jet fuel on that fire. Our grassroots person is getting inundated with requests from activists to help. They're saying 'what can we do. What can we do,'"" said Brandon of FreedomWorks. Mainstream Republicans also agreed that Cantor's defeat will give the tea party more mojo. ""This victory is the 'Pulp Fiction' equivalent of the adrenaline needle plunged into the chest of the tea party,"" said GOP consultant Ron Bonjean, who served as a top strategist and adviser top House and Senate Republican leaders. Who said the tea party was dead? 3. There will be a House leadership shakeup: House GOP members and aides say they are still reeling from the news and it's still sinking in. There were a flurry of calls between leadership offices and small gatherings of House GOP members on Tuesday night as the results came in, but multiple GOP leadership aides say it's still unclear what happens next. ""It's just stunning,"" GOP Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska said. ""And we're trying to analyze what really happened here."" Cantor's expected to announce he will step down as Majority Leader effective July 31, a senior House Republican source told CNN's Bash. And the move could trigger a fight to replace him. Cantor's stunning upset does make it more likely that House Speaker John Boehner stays in office.  According to a GOP source, Boehner reaffirmed his colleagues Wednesday that he was ""all in for speaker"" in the next Congress and then got a standing ovation. Current House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy of California is expected to announce his intention to move up the leadership ladder and run for majority leader. He is popular and helped raise money and elect many of the new members of the conference. Cantor said if McCarthy runs, he would be ""an outstanding Majority Leader"" and would back him. But conservative members are already demanding someone from a red state be elected to represent their views at the leadership table. Several House conservatives have pointed to Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who currently heads the group of fiscal conservatives in the House, Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, and Georgia Rep. Tom Price as possible candidates for leadership jobs. Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas told reporters Wednesday that he's planning to run for majority leader. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State, the House Republican conference chair and top women in the leadership team, announced that she will stay put in her current position and not bid for the majority leader position. 4. Immigration reform is dead for now: The vast majority of House Republicans already decided they didn't want to vote on any immigration bills before the midterm election. Those advocates who were pushing for action conceded that even the most minor steps would have to wait until primary challenges were over. But after a low-profile and underfunded tea party candidate who ran almost solely on railing against Cantor's embrace of ""amnesty"" beat him soundly any prospects for action have evaporated. Cantor embraced some of the most minor immigration reforms so House Republicans fearful of losing their own jobs won't want to touch the issue. ""The members who want immigration reform will still be pushing it, but last night's election makes the road they must travel much steeper,"" said GOP strategist John Feehery, who was a top aide to one-time Speaker Dennis Hastert and Tom DeLay when he was majority whip. 2014 midterms: What's at stake . Complete midterm coverage . 5. If you can believe it, gridlock on Capitol Hill will get worse: The partisan toxic pre-midterm election atmosphere in Washington was already bad. Just getting the most basic bills passed to keep the government running has been a Herculean task. Terry told CNN's Bash the loss will mean members will have less motivation to work across the aisle. Terry added that the message to House GOP members is ""negotiation or compromise could get you beat."" Feehery added that the Cantor loss throws the Republican conference into chaos and makes it harder to get anything done. CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen agreed. ""For Cantor to be knocked off by a tea party conservative over his efforts to push for immigration reform and his earlier efforts to lift the debt ceiling, I think it will send shockwaves through Republican ranks. Look at the price he paid for doing things the majority of Americans support,"" said Gergen a senior adviser to both Democratic and Republican presidents. Jack Trammell is the Democrat who no longer has to face Eric Cantor .","Cantor's loss is sending ""shivers"" through the House Republican Party .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship is about to make its final voyage. Salvage crews began the arduous task of refloating the ship last week so they can move it from its resting place off Giglio Island to the Italian port of Genoa to be dismantled. It is set to sail Wednesday morning, according to Nick Sloane, the senior salvage master. He said the Blue Peter flag was being flown, a maritime tradition that tells sailors they need to get ready and get to the ship. It's been more than 2Â½ years since the ship ran aground off Giglio Island with more than 4,200 passengers aboard, killing 32 people in a disaster that drew global attention. The vessel will be towed -- slowly and carefully -- approximately 240 kilometers (150 miles) to Genoa, where it will be broken up. A convoy of 17 boats will travel along with it. The ship is expected to arrive in Genoa on Sunday, Sloane said. It'll take about two years to dismantle the massive cruise liner. Environmental concerns prompted the decision to undertake the expensive and difficult process of refloating the Costa Concordia rather than taking it apart on site. Since the wreck two years ago, 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture, dishes, food, personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed. The Costa Concordia is the largest salvage ever attempted -- and the most expensive, at a cost of $1.5 billion so far. Nine things to know about the plan to salvage the Costa Concordia .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- An audience of millions watched Cher drop a verbal bomb when she uttered the f-word on an awards show. Bono said it, too, a year later, and Nicole Richie uttered it and s--t in the same sentence. Singer Bono appears at the 2003 Golden Globes on NBC,  where he uttered a ""fleeting expletive."" Because the celebrities made their remarks on live television, the Federal Communications Commission levied heavy fines on the broadcast networks. Now the Supreme Court will weigh in on the ""isolated"" use of such words -- politely referred to as ""fleeting expletives"" -- and the power of government to clamp down on what it sees as pervasive indecent language on the public airwaves. Arguments in the free speech case are Tuesday. ""Make no mistake what this is about,"" said Tim Winter, who heads the Parents Television Council and is supporting the FCC efforts. ""The networks are suing for the right to use the f-word in front of children during prime-time broadcast television."" But Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, had a different view. ""The crux of this case is whether the inconsistent way the FCC has regulated indecent speech gives writers, producers, and directors, as well as television broadcasters, clear guidelines for them to comply,"" said Schwartzman, whose group has filed legal briefs on behalf of the creative forces that provide programming for the networks. The controversial words have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the-air networks in the past six years, when federal regulators began considering a stronger, no-tolerance policy. Fox, NBC, ABC and CBS are parties in the case. A federal appeals court in New York last year ruled in their favor, calling the FCC's policy ""arbitrary and capricious."" The commission then appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking restoration of its power to penalize the networks airing ""indecent"" speech, even if it is broadcast only once, and even if it does not describe a specific sex act. Such language is seen with greater, albeit varying, frequency on cable television, the Internet and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints when ""indecent"" language reaches television television and radio, which is subject to greater regulation. That is especially relevant during daytime and early evening, when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching. The FCC formally reversed its policy in March 2004 to declare that even a single use of an expletive could be illegal. Commission members noted, ""Given the core meaning of the 'F-Word,' any use of that word or a variation, in any context, inherently has a sexual connotation. The 'F-Word' is one of the most vulgar, graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the English language. Its use invariably invokes a coarse sexual image."" The changes became known as the ""Golden Globes Rule,"" for singer Bono's 2003 acceptance speech at the awards show on NBC, where he uttered the phrase ""really, really, f---ing brilliant."" The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Richie's potty-mouth language during the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired on Fox. Richie, in an apparently scripted moment said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple."" The complaint against ABC involved ""NYPD Blue,"" a now-canceled scripted police drama, and the one against CBS involved ""The Early Show,"" a news and interview program. Enforcement of the law, as well as fines and sanctions for the incidents, have been put on hold while the case is being argued. The appeals court ruling said the FCC did not adequately explain amendments to and enforcement of its ""vague"" policy on broadcasts of profanity. But after the ruling, Michael Copps, an FCC commissioner, warned that ""any broadcaster who sees this decision as a green light to send more gratuitous sex and violence into our homes would be making a huge mistake."" The Supreme Court first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978, when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian George Carlin, on society's taboo surrounding ""seven dirty words."" The bit had received some radio airplay. The author of that narrow opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens, still sits on the high court. He famously defined ""indecent"" speech as any depiction or description of ""sexual or excretory activities or organs"" in a manner that is deemed ""patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium."" The now-88-year-old justice steered clear of a philosophical discourse on the First Amendment at the time, choosing instead to focus on the practical effect of suppressing ""dirty"" speech: protecting young children who might be watching or listening . The broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer have expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words are permitted. Their worry is the unplanned, often spontaneous use of an indecent or profane word at live events, like awards shows and sporting events. Company officials say such programs are often on a five-second delay, and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language. But some indecent words can slip through, they admit. Critics call that laughable. ""This past summer, CBS edited into a show that had to go through multiple reviews, by multiple people in the organization, the f-word,"" said Winter, whose group advocates ""responsible"" programming. The show in question was ""Big Brother 10,"" a taped series. Broadcasters argue they are uncertain about which words are banned, and in what context. They say ""s---t"" is forbidden under FCC rules, but not ""poop"" or ""crap,"" even though all those words are crude references to excrement. The appeals court noted the government does not punish every ""indecent"" reference on the air, citing the R-rated ""Saving Private Ryan,"" an Academy Award-winning 1998 movie that is filled with realistic, often coarse language from soldiers. The film has been aired repeatedly on the networks, but the FCC said such profanity was not intended to shock or titillate, but rather to ""convey the horrors of war."" In a separate incident, over nudity, a federal appeals court in June ruled in favor of CBS, which aired singer Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction""-- when her breast was briefly revealed -- at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show. The FCC imposed an indecency fine of $550,000. An appeal to the high court is possible. Time Warner, parent company of CNN, filed an amicus brief supporting the networks fined by the FCC. The company is part owner of the CW broadcast network, and also operates several cable networks. Broadcasters and producers say that while there is no substitute for responsible parenting, the current social and political environment makes it difficult for them to do their jobs. ""Trying to produce material that is artistically superior is extremely difficult,"" says Schwartzman, ""in a context where somebody with a clipboard is running around saying, 'Well maybe this word is OK, maybe this word isn't OK, can't you change this.' "" Lawyers from both sides expect Tuesday's oral arguments to be filled with the ""indecent"" language at issue, so expect to see a lot of f-bombs being tossed around by the justices, all in the name of legal clarity, of course. The case is FCC v. Fox Television Stations (07-582).","On Tuesday, the justices will weigh in on ""fleeting expletives"" on broadcast TV .

We normally don't enjoy organized tours, but we've never gone wrong with them. They got us to remote waterfalls that we may not have found otherwise."" Getting around . ""I rented a car and drove clockwise around the island and never looked back!"" iReporter Bryce Anzelmo said. Some visitors to Iceland swear by renting an off-road vehicle and exploring the country yourself, if you're feeling adventurous. But beware, these aren't like the traffic-clogged interstates you're used to. Farm animals and fresh gravel are the enemy here. Wile recommends maintaining a full tank of gas before venturing off, as well as food -- outside of the main towns, gas stations are few and far between. And just because the road sign says that a location is 80 km away, don't assume it will take an hour. A network of skinny, gravel roads comprise much of Iceland's countryside. ""Get a respected guidebook and follow the recommended places to visit,"" iReporter Mark Bergner said. ""There are amazing sites to see, but you may not know about them without a good guidebook."" He also suggests that if you rent a vehicle, pay attention to the map and spend a little extra to include a trusty GPS. ""If the map says you shouldn't take your rental vehicle down a particular road, believe it -- they're not just blowing smoke."" Hiking is a favorite way to explore Iceland's wild side, but again, proceed with caution. ""Don't wander off the trails if you go hiking,"" iReporter Christopher Duran said. ""This is mainly due to the possibility of getting lost or overexposed after severely misjudging distances. The country has almost no trees and little atmospheric haze to calibrate against. Another good reason is due to patches of unmarked boiling mud."" Experiencing Iceland's offerings . Making a little time to check Iceland's social calendar before you plan your trip could pay off. The country is known for hosting multiple festivals, and they are a must for first-timers. ""Experience some of Iceland's many holidays and cultural events that are fun to participate in, such as Culture Day/Night, known as Menningarnótt, and music festivals like the Iceland Airwaves Music Festival,"" iReporter Catharine Wood said. ""A good source of information is the Reykjavik Grapevine."" Take time out of your vacation to relax in Iceland's famous Blue Lagoon. It's the perfect way to end a day of adventure. ""Stop at the Blue Lagoon for a soak in the milky blue geothermal seawater,"" Burba said. ""Floating in the Blue Lagoon at night, with steam rising around you while you gaze up at the black sky, is a truly memorable experience."" Remember, no matter how you travel across Iceland, make the journey personal. Explore every inch that you can, and don't just sit in your vehicle. ""Go out and explore,"" Swanson said. ""Climb a mountain. There are mountains and hiking paths for every skill level and I can't say enough about how amazing it feels to get to the top of a mountain you never thought you would manage to climb. The views from the top will be worth it.""","Waterfalls, fjords, volcanoes, mountains and glaciers dot Iceland's landscape .

"(CNN) -- The former cop who killed his wife and tried to cover it up by burning down their house was sentenced Monday to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Judge Larry Solomon's sentencing decision comes nearly two months after a Kansas jury convicted Brett Seacat of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Vashti Seacat. ""You haven't admitted guilt. You haven't admitted responsibility, and you didn't this morning even express remorse that Vashti's no longer on this earth,"" Solomon said. ""One of the victim's family asked me to show you no mercy, and I don't intend to show you any mercy. You didn't show Vashti any mercy on April 30, 2011."" Under the judge's sentence -- the maximum allowable under Kansas law -- Seacat must spend 31 years and three months behind bars before he's eligible for parole. Cop accused of killing wife: 'She just seemed... sad, upset' At Monday's hearing, Vashti Seacat's family members asked the judge to give the maximum sentence and condemned the man who murdered her. Brett Seacat maintained his innocence, accused the judge of conspiring to convict him and said the jurors were going to hell for their decision. ""I teach about crimes,"" Seacat said. ""I know what covers up crimes and what doesn't. I know that a bullet hole has never been covered up by a fire. I know that a murder has never been concealed by means of fire. I wouldn't have lit a fire to try to cover this up."" His attorneys said they planned to appeal the judge's decision. Prosecution undercuts handwriting expert . In June, a jury deliberated for six hours before deciding Seacat's fate. During her closing argument, prosecutor Amy Hanley said Seacat was full of uncontrollable rage because his wife had filed for divorce and was kicking him out their house. ""He was like a burning fuse,"" said Hanley. ""That's why he was reckless."" Throughout the trial, Seacat maintained his innocence. Defense attorney Roger Falk said that Vashti Seacat killed herself because she was depressed due to a side effect of her medication. At Monday's sentencing, Solomon said Seacat's guilt was ""overwhelming."" ""Evidence to support your defense of suicide was totally unbelievable and totally unsupported by any credible evidence,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Taylor Spearnak met her boyfriend in 2002, during her third year of college, when they were both congressional interns in Washington. A friend set them up, and they laughed for hours over cheap burgers and a terrible action movie. They kept the relationship going when they returned to their schools in Boston, and when they studied law at schools in different states. In 2007, when they reunited in New York City, they decided it made sense for them to move in together, Spearnak said. They lived in one of the most expensive cities in the country, and had law school loans to pay off. They'd be busy as new law firm associates, and knew they'd be spending nights at each other's apartments, anyway. Spearnak's parents trusted them, and thought it was a smart decision. ""We knew we were serious, but not ready for marriage. This was the next step for us,"" the 30-year-old lawyer said. ""We wanted to be able to spend as much time together as possible."" As the stigma of ""living in sin"" fades and more people delay marriage, researchers are finding that living together before marriage can be a stabilizing force in relationships. It is often leading to marriage and children, demographer Casey Copen said. Between 2006 and 2010, 48% of women between the ages of 15 and 44 moved in for the first time with a man to whom they weren't married, according to a report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. In 2002, it was 43%. In 1995, it was 34%. That's 1 in 4 women living with a man by age 20 and almost 3 in 4 by 30, according to the report, ""First Premarital Cohabitation in the United States,"" which studied male-female relationships. ""Generations that were cohabitating less are now being replaced by a group of women and men that find cohabitation to be quite normal,"" said Copen, the study's lead author. ""Overall, these unions are lasting longer, they're more stable and the highest proportion of them transition to marriage."" Marriage: It ain't what it used to be . The increase doesn't surprise psychotherapist Lisa Kift, who counsels married and unmarried couples in her San Francisco, California, practice. Just as social mores are changing what families look like, long-term partnering is changing, too, she said. The study, which is based on 12,279 interviews from 2006 to 2010, found a shrinking percentage of women moving in with a man for the first time because of marriage -- 23% in 2012, down from 30% in 2002 and 39% in 1995. ""Long-term commitments are more broadly defined and for many, can mean cohabitation without a legal document or public declaration,"" she said. ""Many couples believe they are doing their due diligence by having the experience of living together before making a commitment to marry."" But do these unions last? And do they lead to marriage? The study found that 40% of women living with significant others for the first time between 2006 and 2010 transitioned to marriage within three years, while 32% of those relationships remained the same and 27% dissolved. The numbers are growing across racial and ethnic groups, except for Asian women, the study said. Demographers use the information to explore how cultural and economic differences can change the experience, Copen said. Forty-four percent of white women married within three years of living together the first time, while 31% of black women and U.S.-born Hispanic women did so. Fifty-three percent of women with a bachelor's degree or higher had transitioned to marriage by the three-year mark, while 30% of women with less than a high school diploma had married by then. Spearnak and her boyfriend intend to marry one day. But, they've been together so long that it sometimes feels like they're already married, she said. Her parents want them to marry, she said, but by being committed and comfortable, they've pushed back against pressure. What's the rush? ""Neither of us feels a need to put a ring on it,"" she said. ""We know we are solid. We survived the bar (exam), assembling IKEA furniture and moving."" Cohabitation leads to childbearing with greater frequency, the study found. Nearly 20% of women became pregnant within a year of moving in with someone for the first time, up from 18% in 2002 and 15% in 1995. The chances of becoming pregnant were higher among women younger than 20, foreign-born Hispanic women and women with less than a high school diploma. Montclair, New Jersey, resident Sarah Groom lives with her boyfriend of nearly nine years, and recently gave birth to a baby girl. They met at a fraternity house in Boulder, Colorado, in 2003 and developed an relationship a year later. It was a passionate, impulsive decision when they moved in together in 2005, but stressful, too, she said. They broke up, moved out, argued over who got the dog and reunited more than once. They live together now, and she wants to get married, but it hasn't happened. Along the way, there was ""stress, chaos, self-doubt and even resentment,"" but it seems to have worked out, she said. But, her experiences have taught her the importance of foresight, she said. ""I have a beautiful baby girl now, so it is hard to say I regret my choice,"" Groom said. ""I would advise people choosing to cohabitate prior to marriage, to not make the decision lightly and to discuss potential issues that may arise and how they would be handled well in advance."" There are still benefits to getting married, she said. ""One works harder to preserve a relationship,"" she said. ""Its whole nature is less disposable.""

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Conflicting accounts emerged Wednesday from heightened fighting in eastern Ukraine, with a Ukrainian government official claiming forces loyal to Kiev had inflicted heavy losses on separatists and a pro-Russia official boasting that militants had downed government jets and helicopters. A Ukrainian government spokesman claimed that more than 300 pro-Russia militants had been killed and at least 500 wounded during an ongoing Ukrainian military operation in the towns of Krasny Liman and Slovyansk. The self-declared separatist mayor of Slovyansk, however, said only 10 separatist fighters had died and 12 were injured in the fighting. CNN could not immediately confirm either report. But CNN's Tim Lister, reporting from Donetsk, Ukraine, questioned the government account, saying it would be ""incredibly difficult"" to confirm such a body count amid the heightened fighting. ""It would be a dramatic escalation on anything we've ever seen before,"" he said. Ukrainian anti-terror spokesman Vladislav Seleznev said two Ukrainian soldiers also died and 45 were wounded in the fighting Tuesday night, part of an ongoing military operation meant to sweep pro-Russia militants from eastern Ukraine strongholds where the government claims they have been hiding in hospitals, medical clinics and recreational facilities. On the separatist side, the self-declared mayor of Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, said pro-Russia fighters had shot down two Ukrainian jets and destroyed a tank and four armored personnel carriers in Tuesday's fighting. On Wednesday, militants shot down two Ukrainian helicopters, claimed. While the casualty figures conflict, what is not in doubt is the dramatic uptick in violence in separatist-held areas of eastern Ukraine. Video emerged Wednesday of damage to a hospital in Krasny Liman after it was hit by five rockets. The facility, which serves mainly railway workers, was hit Tuesday, according to Vladimir Seliyvanov, with Dontesk Railways. Four people, including a surgeon, were wounded in the attack, he added. The images showed the impact of several detonations and many broken windows at the hospital. It's not clear if the hospital was hit because militants were thought to be taking cover there or because of inaccurate targeting. Seliyvanov would not comment on whether injured separatists were being treated there. At the nearby railway station, one man was killed in what appears to have been another rocket attack. The official Donetsk Regional Authority says that clashes in Slovyansk continue. ""Terrorists are trying to escape (the) encirclement together with civilians evacuating from the area. The Ukrainian military is taking measures to identify militants in order not to let them escape."" In Luhansk, the government said separatist fighters had taken over two military bases, one run by the Border Guard and the other by the National Guard. Border Guard troops retreated from their base after it had been heavily damaged in 12 hours of fighting on Monday, the Border Guard Service said on its website. Separatists then moved in, the agency said. The Ukrainian National Guard said troops at its base in Luhansk used up all their ammunition trying unsuccessfully to fight off an attack. Video from a National Guard base in the city appeared to show its detachment surrendering to separatists early Wednesday. The National Guard said three of its troops were inured and six attackers killed. The other troops at the base had been safely relocated, it said. CNN could not independently confirm the casualty figures. The heightened fighting comes as U.S. President Barack Obama visits Ukrainian neighbor Poland. Obama met with Ukrainian President-elect Petro Poroshenko on Wednesday, when the U.S. leader vowed to stand with Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. ""We will not accept Russia's occupation of Crimea or its violation of Ukraine's sovereignty,"" Obama said in Warsaw. ""Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia.""

"(CNN) -- When Senators Trent Lott and Tom Daschle ran the Senate, partisan politics was nonexistent and the chamber ran with no hiccups. Well, not exactly. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, they dealt with President Bill Clinton's impeachment, controversial tax cuts, and welfare reform just to name a few contentious issues. But Tuesday, the two former majority leaders said that partisanship has gotten so extreme that things need to change. ""As we have seen throughout our careers, many political decision-makers increasingly favor partisan rancor over reasoned debate in discussing national policies,"" Daschle and Lott said in releasing a set of recommendations to turn things around in Washington. Daschle was the top Democrat in the Senate from 1995-05 and Lott led Republicans from 95-02. They served on a 29-member committee along with other former members of Congress, White House officials, business owners and academics formed to drum up solutions. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Commission on Political Reform offered changes to the legislative system and the electoral process, recommendations that Daschle said are aimed at transforming Congress ""into a high performing"" entity. Among the proposals: . * Senate only be allowed to change its rules at the start of a session. The Democratic-led Senate imposed controversial rule changes in the middle of the current session. * Lawmakers return to a five-day work week. Currently, the House and Senate mainly work three-day weeks. * Congress pass budgets every two years. Currently, annual budget fights exacerbate partisanship. * Independent commissions oversee congressional redistricting every 10 years. Currently, redistricting is conducted by the states based on census shifts every decade, so the time frame wouldn't change. But gerrymandering has created districts loyal to individual parties, which critics say limit competition and exacerbate partisanship. * Create a national primary day and ease access to voting and registration. Primaries are staggered nationally, and controversy has flared over Republican-led voter ID campaigns, which critics say disenfranchises minorities. Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican who represented Maine in the Senate until 2012, said she decided not to run for reelection when she realized she could not invoke change within the system because ""partisanship and politics would not diminish."" She said increasingly partisan congressional districts have resulted in a noncompetitive general election, giving primaries an ""outsized and disproportionate role"" in politics. The low voter turnout in primaries results in a minority of people are determining who is elected to office, she said. Writing the report is the easy part. Implementing it is not. The political heavy hitters plan to use their heft to push the ideas in Congress and state legislatures. Lott said that when he ran it by the current Senate leaders, Republican Mitch McConnell and Democrat Harry Reid, they were ""both moderately not happy."" That's a good place to start, Lott said, grinning.","Two former Senate leaders back a plan that would change the political system .
Recommendations include a national primary day and altering redistricting .

"LABELLE, Florida (CNN) -- Bryan Beer, a citrus grower in southwestern Florida, sees himself as a bit of a pioneer. He's not digging for gold. It's more like he's planting for oil. Bryan Beer and his family have grown citrus for 40 years. He says farmers need alternatives to diesel. He is planting a jatropha tree, a plant that can produce diesel fuel and could one day power a 747. His plans are a little less ambitious; he just wants to plant enough to run his tractors. ""Any kind of relief or help we can get from a cheaper source of oil could impact the agricultural industry tremendously throughout the country, throughout the world,"" said Beer, whose family has been growing citrus for decades. Jatropha means ""doctor food."" It originated in South America, where it was once used for medicinal purposes. There are three seeds within the golf-ball-sized fruit. When pressed, its oil can be used as fuel in any standard diesel engine with zero processing, experts say. Sound like a pipe dream? It's not. It's being taken very seriously by companies all over the world, including the Chrysler motor company and Air New Zealand. The airline is planning a test flight in November in Auckland in which jatropha biodiesel will be mixed with diesel fuel. This is what has farmers, scientists and engineers excited.  Watch jatropha fruit as a dream fuel » . ""It is a superior oil,"" said Roy Beckford, an agricultural scientist with the University of Florida. Air New Zealand says the quality and quantity of the product may be so good that the airline could run the test flight without having to mix the jatropha biofuel with any normal aviation fuel. Beckford said countries like China, India and Brazil have planted millions of acres of jatropha, but the United States has yet to make that sort of investment. ""We are way, way behind these people,"" he said. ""But certainly we have the ability, and we have shown that over and over again that we can beat people on technology and applying that technology."" Beckford has been experimenting to see how the tree grows best. He says jatropha can be grown in soil that is not suitable for most food crops. ""Even under harsh drought conditions with minimal amount of water or moisture, it will survive,"" he said. Jatropha is being tested in nurseries and farms, primarily in Florida and Hawaii, to see if it can be used as a viable alternative biofuel nationwide. Caribbean nations have used jatropha for years as biofuel and a home-made medicine to treat constipation and inflammation, Beckford said. He says jatropha would probably never be the main biodiesel crop but should be added into the mix of biodiesel crops. ""It think it's going to be part of the equation."" Beckford's research is done on a small patch of land in Fort Myers, Florida, where 176 seedlings were planted last year. Some are fertilized; some are not. Some are exposed to insects, and some plants are scattered around the foundation of an old home. Beckford showed how the jatropha plant thrived right in the middle of the foundation, within the dirt and rocks. He and his researchers believe that U.S. technology will aid in the growth of the trees. Currently, each tree yields only about two gallons of oil a year. ""In the next four or five years, I think we'll increase not only the fruits per jatropha tree, but we'll also increase the amount of oil in each of those seeds,"" Beckford said. Right now, biodiesel is a growing industry but hasn't made an appreciable dent on the global dependence on heavy crude oil, from which diesel fuel is processed.  Watch skyrocketing fuel prices are killing farmers » . The National Biodiesel Board says that less than 1 percent of the 60 billion gallons of diesel fuel used each year comes from biodiesel, most of it produced from soybeans, animal fats and recycled oil. But, the board says, the 20 million gallons of diesel fuel saved from these alternative fuels was the equivalent of eliminating the emissions from 700,000 cars. Some consumer groups say it's unrealistic to think that biofuel will replace oil totally. Experts also say the potential savings here may be offset by higher prices somewhere else as farmers use their more crop land to experiment with alternative fuel crops. ""There are implications to dedicating more and more crop land to fuel production rather than food production,"" said Tyson Clocum of the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen. ""That comes in the form of tighter supplies for food production, and that leads to higher prices."" Beer says he's not looking to abandon his family's citrus business. LaBelle Grove Management has been around for more than 40 years. He's currently farming 30 acres of jatropha, compared to 2,500 acres of citrus. Beer is trying to figure out how he's going to afford to put diesel in his heavy equipment. He has four tractors that each run on 120 gallons a day. ""We have to have these machines running. If we don't have these machines running and we don't have diesel fuel, we don't produce our crops,"" he said. So, for now, Beer is taking a stab at growing his own fuel. Jatropha won't be a replacement crop for him, but it may help him fill up his tractor. ""To be a better America, we are going to have to have a secondary source besides oil,"" he said. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","A fruit tree called jatropha can be used to make clean biodiesel, experts say .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pharmacies in England are reporting a run on supplies like surgical masks, thermometers and anti-bacterial gels by customers concerned about swine flu amid a surge in the number of people infected by the virus. A box of leaflets containing information about swine flu, distributed by the UK's Department of Health. In some cases, drug stores in England say they are out of the items and may not get more in for weeks or months. ""People are very panicked,"" said a pharmacy assistant at Zafash Pharmacy in southwest London. ""That's why everyone is running for thermometers, surgical masks, and anti-bacterial gels."" The UK's Department of Health estimated this week that there were around 100,000 new cases of swine flu in England in the week ending July 17 -- nearly double the number of cases for the previous seven days. The UK has been hit hard by the H1N1 virus, with only the U.S. and Mexico recording more cases of infection, according to World Health Organization figures earlier this month. The World Health Organization has stopped giving a global tally of cases but said Friday that swine flu has now spread to more than 160 areas and territories in the world. At least 26 people have died of the disease and this week the British government set up a national flu hot line and Web site to allow those suspected of having swine flu to get a prescription for antiviral medication over the phone. Those who are given prescriptions must pick up the medication at designated collection points in their area. But at Hodgetts Chemist in north London, a supply of surgical masks that normally lasts for half a year has gone in three days, said pharmacy assistant Sylwia Sznyk. Sznyk displayed a receipt from the chemist's suppliers that showed three types of digital thermometers that were out of stock. The pharmacy is now out of thermometers. ""One of the manufacturers, he said the next thermometers they will have is in October, so now there is no chance to get them from this particular supplier,"" she told CNN. The supplier is also out of stock of three different types of anti-bacterial gel, she said, even though the gel is ineffective against viruses. Central Pharmacy in Ashington, in northern England, is also out of thermometers, pharmacist Nadeem Shah told CNN. He said he believes most shops and pharmacies in the area are also out. ""There's no thermometers at all, which is worrying because it's just a sign that it's going to impact on other supplies as well linked to people generally not feeling well -- in particular paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, and other medications,"" Shah said. The pharmacy was out of stock of anti-bacterial gels last month, but manufacturers are making more so it's back on the shelf, he said. However, it's being sold for nearly double the price, he said. ""They're pennies otherwise to buy, but very quickly some manufacturers have got into the market of producing gels and their prices are quite high,"" Shah said. At their sister pharmacy in nearby Morpeth, any anti-bacterial products at the checkout counter are ""gone in a day, rather than in a month,"" he said. ""Some of the gels don't do anything different to your soap at home,"" he said, emphasizing that good hygiene, good handwashing, and disposable tissues are the best way to ward off viral infection. ""There's definitely some kind of misunderstanding -- people are thinking that having those type of products will give them a bit more confidence. But it's their choice, obviously."" Though Central Pharmacy does not normally sell surgical masks, they considered stocking some when the virus broke out a few months ago, Shah said. They decided against it so as not to stoke panic. ""It could be seen as a sign of endorsement rather than asking people to get advice,"" he said. ""It would just give a very visible panic message."" Croydon Pharmacy, south of London, still has stocks of thermometers despite higher demand, but it has run out of surgical masks, said pharmacist Michael Hammond. He said the pharmacy has noticed a rise in people asking questions and wanting information about swine flu. ""I think the reaction has been in response to what they've heard on the news,"" Hammond said. ""And even where it is not a true case of the patient suffering, they still want more information. But I think generally we've been able to give them what they need."" A branch of the Boots pharmacy chain in Fulham, southwest London, has been out of thermometers for two weeks, said employee Wilson Le. They're also running out of anti-bacterial gels; the store doesn't stock surgical masks. While it is not running out yet, one pharmacy in the eastern English city of Norwich said it is noticing an increase in demand for masks, thermometers, and anti-bacterial items. ""It's not completely a foregone situation where I can't get hold of it, but it's becoming difficult,"" said the pharmacist, who asked not to be identified because his pharmacy is one of the government's distribution points for the antiviral medication Tamiflu, and he didn't want to spark concern. The pharmacist said he was doling out Tamiflu to 70 to 80 people a day and described the lack of supplies as worrying. ""From a business point of view, yes, and from a clinical point of view, yes, because I can't offer the services I need to,"" he said. ""And if people want reassurance from (the supplies), I'm not able to reassure them."" The pharmacist complained that the paperwork he is required to fill out for each patient takes him five minutes per person, giving him less time to spend consulting with other customers. ""I wish somebody would have organized it a little bit better,"" the pharmacist said. Shah, of Central Pharmacy, said the run on supplies makes him worry that they won't be available later in the year, when flu season kicks in. ""Manufacturers would have made their plans for winter a while ago, but if we're consuming these products early, in August and July, I don't know if those manufacturing plans are in place yet,"" he said. The government advises anyone suspected of having swine flu to send a friend or relative -- a ""flu friend"" -- to their pharmacy to pick up the medicine for them. But that advice isn't being followed by everyone. ""Some patients come in directly rather than ask their friend to come,"" said Le, of Boots pharmacy in Fulham. He said one dispenser has come down with swine flu after being infected by a sick customer.","English pharmacies report shortages of surgical masks, hand gels, themometers .

"(CNN) -- He's only 26 years old but Sebastian Vettel has already achieved so much in Formula One with four world titles under his belt and now a record-equaling ninth straight victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday. The win capped a momentous season for the German and more are on the way, according former world champion Jody Scheckter who says Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles is well within his grasp. ""I think it's hard to believe that he won't beat Michael's record,"" the 1979 world champion told CNN. ""Four championships in a row is incredible. I can't see him not beating the record. I thought nobody would ever beat that record."" The 63-year-old South African puffs out his cheeks when asked to name Vettel's best performance. ""All of them! He seems to get out in front and stay there and pull away. It's incredible really. He's obviously magic,"" says Scheckter before highlighting the technical nous required to be a champion. ""It's very technical, more than other sports,"" he says. ""You've got to understand all the complexities of the car ... then you're getting in that car, driving it fast, keeping it on the limit and not doing stupid things because that's quite easy to do."" With so much to focus on, it's easy to see why Vettel and previously Schumacher might come across as being cold, methodical and big-headed, perhaps. But the characterization isn't necessarily fair, Scheckter says. ""Both Michael and Sebastian are concentrating on what it takes to win. Sometimes from the outside it looks arrogant. I see it in a different light to other people,"" Scheckter says. ""The first thing is to win and the next thing is to be nice. Jackie Stewart could always be nice, talk to everybody else and then (still go on to win). I was the complete opposite."" Three-time world champion Stewart, who spoke to CNN on the eve of the Brazilian Grand Prix, thinks Vettel's personality shines through in a different way. ""He's a very charismatic young man as far as I'm concerned just because of his skill,"" Stewart said. ""He's very modest, he's only 26 years of age and he's the most mature 26-year-old driver I've ever seen. He's had a sensational season."" Yet despite his achievements, Stewart hesitates to rank Vettel alongside all-time greats like Argentina's five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio and Scot Jim Clark or more recent multiple champions Alain Prost or Niki Lauda. Not yet, anyway. ""You've just got to wait and see what the future holds because he's got a car that's faster than anybody else's right now and a designer (Adrian Newey) that's probably the most brilliant in the history of motorsports. So he's had a huge advantage."" the Scot said. Vettel, who also equaled Schumacher's record of 13 wins in a season with victory in Interlagos, will look to match his compatriot's run of five straight world titles next season. Scheckter, for one, envisages a closer constructors' championship in 2014 because of all the regulation changes, but he still can't look beyond Vettel and Red Bull. ""I still wouldn't bet against them. I would have thought that some of the top teams would show up better going into the new situation and make it better. I've been surprised by Lotus. You never know.""","1979 world champion gives his assessment on Sebastian Vettel during 2013 season .

"Washington (CNN) -- As Iraq continues to dissolve into chaos, Republican lawmakers strongly urged that the United States act swiftly on both the diplomatic and militaristic front, warning that the growing instability directly threatens the safety of Americans. The Sunday political talk shows focused on the crisis in Iraq. Military option . Republicans dominated the political talk shows Sunday regarding Iraq, pushing for immediate involvement in the country that is in turmoil and under attack by an extremist group known as the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Fresh off a victory in his Republican primary, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham emphatically insisted on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the United States needs to conduct military air strikes in Iraq to prevent ISIS fighters from advancing into and taking over Iraq's capital, Baghdad. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers, agreed, telling CNN that ""a little bit of U.S. air support can be very, very impactful."" And Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia indicated he'd get behind a military option in Iraq. ""I'm open to ... air strikes, technical support, drones, whatever it takes, but I want to make sure our intel is accurate before we start doing this, and I'm hopeful that they're getting accurate intel on this,"" Manchin said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" President Barack Obama on Friday did not exclude U.S. military options -- except for on-the-ground combat troops -- but is reviewing a range of options, including air strikes. Meanwhile ISIS gained control of Mosul last week, Iraq's second largest city, as well as much of northern Iraq, and ISIS fighters worked their way toward Baghdad. Republicans on Sunday said the President needs to be decisive and act immediately, ""not two weeks down the road,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul, House Homeland Security Committee chairman, on ABC's ""This Week."" Rogers said one question needs to be answered: ""Is al Qaeda holding land the size of Indiana a problem for the United States?"" Graham said the extremist group's growing real estate will result in consequences of ""monumental proportions"" if the United States doesn't help stop ISIS. One of those consequences would be ""the next 9/11,"" Graham said. McCaul also warned that ISIS is ""the greatest threat"" to U.S. national security, in part, because Iraq and Syria are a training ground for violent extremists, including Americans and Western Europeans who can freely travel to the West. While Graham spoke with utter conviction of what the American response should be, McCaul was more measured, saying the U.S. ""has to be very careful"" about using the military in this situation. That's a sentiment echoed by Republican Sen. John McCain on Friday who said air strikes are ""not easy."" The only lawmaker on the political talk shows Sunday strongly opposed to a military option in Iraq was Iraq War veteran Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. She is opposed to U.S. involvement. ""We have to ... focus our great military on those direct and imminent threats rather than getting distracted by involving ourselves in another civil war that's occurring in another country between religious factions that have been warring for generations,"" Gabbard, a Democrat, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R- Illinois, also an Iraq war veteran, sharply disagreed. ""If the establishment of a caliphate by an organization that makes al Qaeda look like a bunch of kitty cats is not in U.S. national interest to stop it, I don't know what is,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" Diplomacy . The lawmakers also called for a diplomatic component of the U.S. response, but they disagreed on which countries should be diplomatic partners and how to go about it. Graham offered an unexpected solution: working with Iran -- an American foe over Iran's nuclear program and its back-channel role in numerous conflicts. Graham said it would be a ""mistake"" not to engage with the majority-Shiite country. ""We need to coordinate with the Iranians,"" Graham said. ""The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall."" But McCaul said the U.S. needs to be more leery of Iran and aware that it is seeing Iraq's instability as an opportunity to grab a hold of power. Rogers said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he ""wouldn't fall in that trap"" of engaging Iran. But Graham said the possibility that Iran can sweep in and take power in Iraq is precisely why the U.S. should engage. ""Don't let the Iranians save Baghdad. Let us save Baghdad so there will be a chance at a second government,"" Graham said. Rogers said the U.S. should turn to the Arab League to get involved and that it would be ""a failure of U.S. leadership"" if it can't elicit Arab League involvement. But shortly after Rogers made that statement, the 22-country organization released a statement that while its members denounced the violence they would not get involved in a sovereign country's affairs. Maliki and Obama . All of the lawmakers had little good to say about Iraq Prime Minister Maliki or Obama. Graham said Maliki should resign because he's ""incapable of bringing the Sunnis back into the fold."" McCaul said, ""Maliki has failed, as well as our President without the Status of Forces Agreement."" The Status of Forces Agreement was never reached between the United States and Iraq to keep residual troops in the country. Graham said on CNN that it was ""absolutely a lie"" that Maliki refused to allow American troops to stay behind. ""The Obama administration wanted to say: 'I ended the war in Iraq,'"" Graham said, adding that he blames Obama ""mightily for a hands-off policy.""","Graham: Consequences of ""monumental proportions"" if ISIS is not stopped .

"(CNN) -- Nine months after a Justice Department investigation castigated Puerto Rico's police department, another exhaustive report, this one by the American Civil Liberties Union, discloses evidence of widespread abuses and violations of civil rights. The Puerto Rico Police Department, the second-largest police department in the United States, was the object of a scathing report by the ACLU that concluded things have not changed since the government issued its own report. The 17,000-strong department ""is a dysfunctional and recalcitrant police force that has run amok for years,"" the report said. The organization found routine use of excessive force and incidents of civil and human rights violations, especially against low-income people, Puerto Ricans of African descent and Dominican immigrants. ""These abuses do not represent isolated incidents or aberrant behavior by a few rogue officers. Such police brutality is pervasive and systemic, island-wide and ongoing,"" the new report states. Puerto Rico's secretary of state called the ACLU report a ""rehash"" of what the federal government had already found, and said that changes are already under way. Millions of dollars have been spent on retraining, new equipment and salary raises to improve morale, Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said. The Justice Department's own report included more than 100 recommendations that had been drafted and implemented by the Puerto Rican government itself, he said. ""We are already changing the police force and changing it dramatically,"" he said. Government officials of the U.S. commonwealth admit that there are some problems with its police force, but it is not correct to call it pervasive, he said. ""For some agents it was something ingrained, in some members of the force,"" McClintock said. The Puerto Rican government has raised more than $50 million to spend on its police force, much of that going to police raises and training. When the Justice Department released its report last year, it noted that amid the allegations of abuse, Puerto Rico was grappling with a record-number of homicides in 2010. The ACLU report updates the figure, saying that with 1,130 murders in 2011, last year set a record for homicides. Over a five-year period from 2005 to 2010, more than 1,700 officers -- or about 10% of the total police force -- were arrested for criminal activity such as assault, theft, domestic violence, drug trafficking and even murder, the report says. The ACLU says that incidents of abuse or impropriety have been reported as recently as May of this year. ""You don't have a dramatic transformation overnight,"" McClintock said. According to the ACLU, the Puerto Rico Police Department has used unreasonable force in at least some of the 28 deaths of civilians that it said came at the hands of the police. The most recent killing happened in April of this year, the report states. On April 27, two brothers got into a dispute with a police officer after he stopped their sister for speeding. At one point, one of the brothers took the officer's nightstick and hit him with it, and the other hit him with a pipe, police have said. The officer responded by firing 14 times, killing Saul Medina Figueroa and critically injuring Adrian Medina Figuaroa, the report states. The sister disputes that the officer acted in self-defense, raising questions about the justification of the officer's use of force, the ACLU report says. The ACLU based its findings on interviews conducted in Puerto Rico between March and September, 2011. Puerto Rico: A forgotten front in America's drug war? KKK wants ACLU help to adopt highway .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- In most of Japan, it's still legal to possess child pornography. Although production and distribution have been banned for 15 years, Japan lags behind other major developed nations in forbidding people from simply holding the sinister material. That is about to change in a country regarded as a global nexus of child pornography. The country's upper house of parliament is expected to pass legislation this month making possession of it a crime punishable by up to a year in prison. Children's rights activists have applauded the step, although their reaction is tempered with frustration that it has taken such a long time. ""As a member of a group that's been hearing the voice of the victims for many years, we welcome the news,"" said Shihoko Fujiwara, a representative of Lighthouse, a nonprofit group that helps exploited children. ""Japan took so long, and it is too late to reach this decision as a developed country."" The proposed law, which was already approved by the lower house of parliament this week, comes with a couple of noteworthy loopholes. When it goes into effect, it will give those already in possession of child pornography a year to dispose of it. And it won't cover the country's popular manga (comic book) and anime (animation) industries, which include depictions of violent sexual abuse of children in their publications. Fujiwara said a discussion about some of the imagery in manga and anime -- content that would be illegal in many Western countries -- would be a natural ""next step."" 'A necessary evil' But representatives of those industries say that while they support the ban on real child pornography, any move to censor their products would be an unjustified restriction of freedom of expression. Daisuke Okeda, a lawyer and inspector for the Japan Animation Creators Association, said it was ""natural that animation is exempted."" ""The goal of the law itself is to protect children from crime,"" he said. ""Banning such expression in animation under this law would not satisfy the goal of the law."" Okeda said that no studies have been done that prove any link between pedophilia and animation in Japan. Hiroshi Chiba, the manager of Chiba Tetsuya Production, one of the country's best known manga production houses, said that more could be done in terms of age restrictions on graphic content featuring children and to distinguish it more clearly from other comics. And he admitted that some products of the industry leave him and his colleagues ""disgusted."" ""But rich, deep culture is born from something that might not be accepted by all,"" Chiba said. ""We need to allow the gray zone to exist as a necessary evil."" 'An international hub' Some experts counter that children suffer in a culture that appears to tolerate images of child sexual abuse. Hiromasa Nakai, a public affairs officer for UNICEF in Japan, pointed to the graphic content in manga, anime and some video games, as well as the ""junior idol"" genre of books and DVDs that display minors wearing tiny bikinis and striking sexual poses. Japan should do more -- beyond the proposed law change -- ""to protect the best interest of children,"" Nakai said. Statistics show that child pornography remains a big problem in Japan. The U.S. State Department's 2013 report on human rights practices in Japan labels the country ""an international hub for the production and trafficking of child pornography."" It cited Japanese police data showing the number of child pornography investigations in 2012 rose 9.7% from a year earlier to a record of 1,596. The cases involved 1,264 child victims, almost twice as many as in the previous year. The fact that possession remains legal, for the time being, ""continued to hamper police efforts to enforce the law effectively and participate fully in international law enforcement,"" the report said. Girls as sex objects . One local authority already took matters into its own hands. The prefecture of Kyoto in central Japan introduced a ban on possession of child pornography in 2011. But Nakai said addressing the problems isn't just a matter for government, suggesting parents, the media, the private sector and even children themselves can play a role in improving the situation. The portrayal of young girls as sex objects in Japan has long raised eyebrows among Westerners. An article in Wired in 1999 reeled off a list of examples in Tokyo: ""Vending machines sell schoolgirls' used panties, which the girls sell to middlemen. 'Image bars' specialize in escorts dressed in school uniforms. Telephone clubs feature bored adolescent girls earning spending money by talking dirty. Sex shops sell a porn magazine called 'Anatomical Illustrations of Junior High School Girls.'"" Some experts suggest the situation is born out of Japan's long-established patriarchal society. Whatever the cause, changing a culture may prove a lot harder than changing a law. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Junko Ogura and Will Ripley contributed to this report.","Legislation to criminalize child pornography is making its way through parliament .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration announced new measures to combat black-market fishing and protect ocean ecosystems on Tuesday, as scientists, diplomats, policymakers, and heads of state concluded a conference dedicated to ocean preservation. In a recorded statement kicking off the second day of the Our Ocean conference, the President cited recent efforts by his administration to limit carbon output from power plants as a first step toward promoting ocean health. ""Today,"" he said, ""I'm building on that promise by directing the federal government create a national strategy to combat black-market fishing that threatens our oceans, undermines our economy and often supports dangerous criminals."" ""And like Presidents Clinton and Bush before me,"" said Obama, ""I'm going to use my authority as president to protect some of our most precious marine landscapes, just like we do for mountains and rivers and forests."" The President will be taking steps to expand the protected area around the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, where commercial fishing and other extraction activities are banned. The area currently comprises approximately 82,129 square miles in the south-central Pacific Ocean. That initiative was outlined by White House counselor John Podesta, who said the president is ""committed to using his executive authority to preserve ocean areas for future generations as we already protect our most beautiful environmentally significant landscapes."" The black-market fishing task force will be giving its recommendations to the president within six months, according to Podesta, and will recommend a strategy aimed to ""give consumers confidence that, when they go to a restaurant or a fish counter, their filets were caught legally and they were labeled correctly."" These moves by the administration are likely to antagonize Obama's critics, who say the he is overstepping his authority as President by increasingly bypassing Congress in favor of executive orders. The task force will tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, a shadow industry that costs law-abiding fishermen and other commercial seafood interests an estimated $10 billion to $23 billion a year, according to the White House. The conference was hosted by Secretary of State John Kerry, who called ocean protection ""a vital international security issue,"" affecting ""the capacity of people to exist and live where they live today."" In his opening remarks on Monday, Kerry said, ""I want us to walk away from this conference with more than ideas. I want us to walk away from here with a plan, a plan that puts an end to overfishing through new rules based on the best available science."" On Tuesday, Kerry applauded the president's pledge to curb black-market fishing, saying, ""If there's no market, we have an ability to really be able to begin to diminish the impact of illegal and undocumented, unwarranted fishing."" Environmental issues have long been priorities for the secretary of state. One of Kerry's first forays into activism came in 1970, when he organized Earth Day initiatives in Massachusetts. Twenty years later, Kerry met his wife Teresa at an Earth Day rally. Both Kerry and Obama spoke about how their childhoods, in Massachusetts and Hawaii respectively, influenced their appreciation for oceans and sea life. Perhaps the real star of the conference was actor Leonardo DiCaprio, whose philanthropic foundation supports nature conservation projects around the world. Earlier this year, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation pledged $3 million to the ocean conservation organization Oceana, and on Tuesday, the actor announced he would be committing an additional $7 million to promoting ocean preservation. ""Without healthy oceans we are in serious trouble,"" said DiCaprio, ""and the outlook for their health is not good."" The actor also called on world leaders to increase preservation efforts in their countries, saying, ""The only way to address problems of this scale is through smart collaboration between governments, communities, organizations and scientists."" DiCaprio added, ""I stand here today to challenge all of you to step up, to utilize your positions of authority to ensure the health of the oceans that are so vital to people's lives all around the world."" An avid diver, DiCaprio said he has seen the effects of ocean degradation firsthand in his travels. ""What once had looked like an endless underwater utopia is now riddled with bleached coral reefs and massive dead zones."" ""Because of modern industrialized fishing, ships are heading into ever deeper waters in search of catch, only to find ever dwindling stocks,"" he added.","Obama calls for strategy to combat black-market fishing .

"(CNN) -- Linda Brown, a third-grader in Topeka, Kansas, walked across railroad tracks each morning in 1951 as part of the six-block walk to her school bus. From there, she rode one mile to her segregated elementary school. Her neighborhood school, open to whites only, was a mere four blocks from her house. Yet because of the color her skin, Linda could not attend. Linda's father, Oliver Brown, served as the lead plaintiff in Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark Supreme Court case that dismantled the ""separate but equal"" doctrine in public schools. Acknowledging in their 1954 decision that black children were being denied a quality education, the Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously that equal educational opportunity was a right guaranteed for all American children. But 60 years later, a new playbook of discriminatory education policies continues to keep schools separate and unequal, with countless children of color on the outside looking in. Landrieu: Charter schools: Let every child have access . Instead of the old segregationists in the business of denying opportunities to students of color, so-called education ""reformers"" today are producing the same outcomes through the policies of school closures and literally turning education into a business. Nationwide, public schools that serve predominantly African-American and Latino communities have been aggressively targeted. Schools are being closed, with students re-enrolled in different ones away from our neighborhoods. They're being closed and turned over to private companies or swapped out for charters. Taking the public out of public education . The rhetoric of ""we must do something"" is dishonest at best. What the reformers don't acknowledge is that this approach of closures and privatization has kept public education separate and unequal -- and, increasingly, not public at all. Parents, students, educators and community leaders across the nation have repeatedly resisted such policies. So at the onset of the 60th anniversary of the Brown decision, we are again taking action. On the behalf of the Journey for Justice Alliance -- a network of 36 grassroots community-based organizations across 22 cities -- this week the Advancement Project filed three complaints under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in use of federal funds. We focused on cities deeply impacted by the school closures epidemic: Chicago, New Orleans and Newark, New Jersey. In each of these, African-American children are being uprooted, shuffled around and ultimately sent to schools that are no better than the one that closed. Districts are shirking their responsibility to use our tax dollars to educate our children and instead are giving multimillion dollar contracts to companies to do the job. In each city, African-American students' hopes of equal educational opportunities are being dashed. We hope these complaints will help move these cities, and our nation, closer to the still elusive promise of Brown. Also this week, Journey for Justice released a report on the real-life impacts of school closings and privatization. Entitled ""Death by a Thousand Cuts: Racism, School Closures, and Public School Sabotage,"" the report provides a searing look at the national pattern of school districts setting our schools up to fail through a combination of the following policies: high-stakes, testing-based accountability systems, enrollment policies that concentrate the most disadvantaged students in a few schools without providing the needed resources and siphoning public funds by promoting and favoring charter schools. Once these schools consequently suffer underenrollment and financial shortfalls, public officials then justify closing them. As the report details, school closures not only hurt educational outcomes, they have far-reaching negative consequences for children of color and their communities. Disproportionately hurt by school closures . In Chicago, for example, 50 public schools were closed during the last school year alone. These closures targeted African-American communities, with black students accounting for only 43% of all Chicago students but making up 87% of the students affected by the closures. Dyett High School on Chicago's South Side, for example, was sentenced to a slow death. Next year will be its last year in operation. With only 69 students left because of a refusal to admit any more, equal education is not even a fleeting thought. There are no advanced placement classes, and students must take physical education and art online. This was not because of bad teachers or uninterested parents and students, but a reflection of an appointed school board made up of people who don't have children in public schools and who do not have to bear the weight of their policy decisions. Students of color in New Orleans and Newark are also reeling from the impacts of these policies. With increased school closures and the expansion of charter schools in New Orleans, the city's Recovery School District has only five traditional public schools left and is on its way to being the nation's first all-charter school district. Many of the schools in the city have admissions requirements that deny large numbers of children admission. Students in New Orleans, the majority black, have been swapped multiple times between different big-box charter chains, often finding it hard to get into a school but easy to get pushed out. Newark's public schools have been under state control since 1995, with no local control or community accountability for nearly 20 years. As a result, Newark communities have been unable to stop New Jersey's plan to close neighborhood schools. Many of these are generational schools that fathers and grandmothers of current schoolchildren had attended years before. Now, very young children may be forced to ride two or three buses by themselves to attend unfamiliar schools, with unfamiliar staff, in a completely different part of town. By eliminating public input into school decision-making, school districts have forged a clear path to characterize our schools as failing, ushering in measures that set them up for closure, turnaround or phase-out. Meanwhile, education outcomes have not improved as a result of these initiatives. Our children should not be treated as collateral damage in failed educational experiments, and school districts and the federal government must abandon the discriminatory education reform agenda that supports the aggressive use of school closures and charter school expansion. These unsuccessful models should be replaced with a community-based model that ensures local solutions are tailored to local issues, with supports to ensure that the full array of students' developmental needs are being met, and that every student has access to a curriculum that is enriched, engaging and culturally relevant. As our nation recognizes the anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the fight for education justice is as present as ever. And just as Oliver Brown stood up for his daughter then, today parents in communities of color are continuing the struggle to make equal education real for their children.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Sunday she won't vote for any more money to support the four-year-old war in Iraq without a plan to start bringing U.S. troops home. Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton greets people before speaking in Washington on September 17. ""I've reached the conclusion that the best way to support our troops is begin bringing them home,"" the New York senator and former first lady told CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer."" ""I don't believe we should continue to vote for funding that has an open-ended commitment, that has no pressure on the Iraqi government to make the tough political decisions they have to make, or which really gives any urgency to the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts."" Clinton's declaration comes as the Senate debates the Defense Department's 2008 spending authorization bill. It follows her vote against a $120 billion war-spending bill in May, when Congress dropped a call for the withdrawal of American combat troops by March 2008 after President Bush vetoed a bill containing that provision. ""The president has no intention of changing his policy in Iraq,"" she said. ""He's now talking about leaving it to his successor."" Meanwhile, the Senate's Republican minority routinely filibusters Democratic proposals to wind down the war, which is costing the Treasury about $10 billion a month and has claimed the lives of nearly 3,800 American troops. May's spending bill made continued U.S. support contingent on a set of benchmarks for Iraq's government. But the Iraqis met only 11 of the 18 benchmarks, according to the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. ""Even those who are implementing this policy of the president's cannot tell us it will make America more safe, nor that it will lead to the kind of political decision-making that we have to expect from the Iraqis themselves,"" Clinton said. Nearly two-thirds of the American public now opposes the war, according to a CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted in early September. Clinton said, if elected president, she would end the conflict ""as quickly and responsibly as I can,"" but said some U.S. forces would likely remain as trainers, to protect Americans and to battle Islamic militants loyal to al Qaeda. The two-term senator, who leads her Democratic presidential rivals by a double-digit margin in national polls, made the rounds of all five Washington talk shows Sunday. Last week, Clinton supported two amendments that would have forced the Pentagon to begin a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. But she said Sunday that even if Democrats muster enough Republican support to break a filibuster -- something they have been unable to do -- Democrats would still be unlikely to get the two-thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto. ""The answer for this is, let's elect more Democrats in 2008,"" she said. ""That will help solve the problem.""

"(CNN) -- Diners at Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants in Iowa and Nebraska caught an intestinal illness after eating salad mix that came from Mexico, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The federal agency said its investigators have traced the outbreak to four ""illness clusters"" of restaurants, which spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman later identified to CNN as Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations. The probe didn't find indications that any bags of salad mix with the rare type of parasite -- known as cyclospora -- were sold at U.S. grocery stores. The tainted salad mix came from Taylor Farms de Mexico, ""a processor of foodservice salads,"" according to the FDA. Darden -- the parent company for Olive Garden, Red Lobster and other restaurant chains such as LongHorn Steakhouse -- described the August 2 announcement from the FDA as ""new information."" ""Nothing we have seen prior to this announcement gave us any reason to be concerned about the products we've received from this supplier,"" Darden said in a statement, in which the company insisted ""it is completely safe to eat in our restaurants."" Taylor Farms has been cooperating with U.S. officials, the FDA said, adding that tests will be conducted at the company's processing facility in Mexico ""to try to learn the probable cause of the outbreak and identify preventive controls."" The last inspection there, in 2011, turned no notable problems, according to the federal agency. The company's CEO, Bruce Taylor, told CNN on Friday night that the company's plant in Mexico produced and distributed about 48 million servings of salads to thousands of restaurants in the Midwest and eastern United States this past June. ""We have an extensive testing program in Mexico to test water sources and raw product for coliforms, E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria,"" said Taylor. ""All our tests have been negative and we have no evidence of cyclospora in our product."" As of Thursday, there had been 146 cases of cyclospora inspections reported in Iowa, according to that state's public health department. There were 82 reported cases in Nebraska. Iowa health authorities said Thursday that the prepackaged salad mix of iceberg and romaine lettuce, carrots and red cabbage was no longer in the state's supply chain. ""Bagged salads and all other vegetables are safe to eat,"" the state's health department said. What's happening in that state and Nebraska may be linked to 140 cyclospora cases in Texas, that state's department of health services said Friday. As of then, authorities had not singled out a common source for the Lone Star State's outbreak, which is largely centered in and around Dallas and Fort Worth. Despite the lack of a connection, a Dallas woman sued Darden on Friday -- soon after the FDA implicated the restaurant company -- ""for all general, special, incidental and consequential damages"" tied to her July 1 visit to an Olive Garden in Addison, Texas. Suzanne Matteis contends in her lawsuit that four days after eating spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad from Olive Garden, she suffered severe intestinal issues. She says a clinic near her home took a stool sample and diagnosed her with a cyclospora infection. Matteis says she's still not feeling completely recovered. ""I think I'm getting better, but I still don't have a lot of energy. I'm pooped. I'm worn out,"" she told CNN. While he hadn't been aware of the lawsuit until being alerted by CNN, Darden spokesman Mike Bernstein said that his group's restaurants in Texas have a different supplier than its restaurants in Iowa and Nebraska. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has been collaborating with health officials in numerous states since late June trying to pin down what's causing the spate of cyclospora. As of August 2, the CDC has been notified of 425 cases in 16 states: Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. At least 24 people have been hospitalized, the CDC says. ""It is not yet clear whether the cases from all of the states are part of the same outbreak,"" the organization says. People get the disease by eating food or drinking water that's been contaminated with feces with the parasite. The ailment -- which strike in places where cyclospora is common, like tropical or subtropical regions, but is occasionally seen in the United States as well -- causes symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss and nausea that can last anywhere from a few days to more than a month. CNN's Amanda Watts and Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","NEW: The CDC has been notified of 425 cases in 16 states .

"(CNN) -- It looks like Kanye West's new wife is rubbing off on him. In the August issue of GQ magazine, the rapper talks about everything from his design ambitions -- he'd like to build amusement parks -- to his next album to his home life, including the relationship he's built with uber-celebrity Kim Kardashian. According to West, his reality star bride, whom he married in May, has helped him acquire a unique set of skills: ""Kim K skills,"" if you will. ""One of the reasons why I think that me and Kim are very powerful together isn't just the concept of celebrity or this mega rap star and this mega-beautiful pop star,"" West said. ""What I had to learn from Kim is how to take more of her advice and less of other people's advice. There's a lot of Kim K skills that were added. In order to win at life, you need some Kim K skills, period."" And that's just one of things we now know about Yeezus. Here are eight more: . 1. Kanye is a blowfish . ""People have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way, and in no way am I that. I wouldn't want to hurt anyone. I want to defend people. I want to help people. ... I'm not a shark, I'm a blowfish."" 2. He gave a 45-minute toast at his own wedding . And he freely admits this. ""In the speech, I talked about the idea of collaboration and all the people involved working together and being able to change things. ... I said, ""Wow, Carine (Roitfeld) is seven seats down from Kim (Kardashian). Farnaz (Farjam), the producer of the Kardashians and the producer of 'The Real World,' is four seats down from (director) Steve McQueen. And four seats, because in between them is Hosain (Rahman) from Jawbone. This is what I talked about. That was not a forty-five-minute speech to myself. Do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other?"" 3.He doesn't care that Jay Z and Beyonce weren't there . It may have been Kim and Kanye's wedding, but all anyone wanted to know was whether Jay Z and Beyonce were going to be there. They ended up not attending -- although Beyonce gave her congratulations via Instagram -- and 'Ye seems fine with it. ""All that, I wouldn't even speak on. It doesn't even matter to me whatsoever, who would show up. Because the most important person to show up there, to me, was Kim."" 4. He feels like he's constantly fighting . Even in the GQ interview. ""I'm sitting right here, it's a fight. I'm fighting with the way I line my words up together and the way I place a sweater on top of a T-shirt. At this point, people know what's up. People know I'm smart. And people know that, whether it's SNL or Jimmy Kimmel, it's a trend to take the piss out of celebrity -- just as much of a trend as wearing a gray hoodie or driving a Prius."" 5. Especially for celebrity rights . In his wedding toast, ""I talked about the idea of celebrity, and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the '60s, having no rights, and the fact that people can slander your name. I said that in the toast. And I had to say this in a position where I, from the art world, am marrying Kim. And how we're going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life. She didn't choose to be a celebrity. But she is. So I'm going to fight to make sure she has a better life."" 6. He also fought for Kim . ""I had to fight for that for seven years."" 7. He's actually not that sad . Despite what the #sadKanye meme would lead you to believe, he's feeling pretty good. ""(W)e got the Vogue cover, Steve McQueen won the Oscar, we finally got married... You know? We have a child. We're a family now. I am an arbiter of taste, and people think that I have the ability to make things cool -- or if I'm doing it, it should be cool. And I feel that this stuff's starting to be cool. And that feels good to me. Because I don't like walking around with people thinking I'm doing uncool s**, because there's nothing I'm doing that's uncool. It's all innovative. You just might not understand it yet. But it's cool. Family is super cool. Going home to one girl every night is super cool. Just going home and getting on the floor and playing with your child is super cool. Not wearing a red leather jacket, and just looking like a dad and s**t, is like super cool. 8.

"(CNN) -- Ukraine is days away from getting a new president, though seemingly much longer from securing a lasting peace -- as demonstrated yet again Thursday, with its military and separatists continuing to face off in eastern and southern parts of the country. As has been true for weeks, the deadly clashes are centered in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Pro-Russian separatists have seized two military bases, and civilian deaths have been reported. Ukrainian National Guard troops on Thursday blocked the main road between the cities of Donetsk and Slovyansk, a hotbed for separatists. Slovyansk itself appeared relatively calm, though there was a real potential the area could erupt at any moment with military and separatist positions separated by less than 1 kilometer. In nearby Krasny Liman, a Ukrainian flag flew over City Hall after government troops took over that community from separatist forces. This turnover followed two days of heavy fighting, with residents reporting they heard firing overnight. Still, any celebration had to be muted by the fact that militants remain close by, dug in on a main road several miles east of the city. These tensions simmered while, hundreds of miles away in Brussels, Belgium, the situation in Ukraine dominated a meeting of G7 leaders. U.S. President Barack Obama threatened more economic sanctions against Russia -- which many in the West accuse of fomenting instability and violence in Ukraine by allowing weapons into the region and supporting separatists -- unless it takes key steps in the coming weeks. Obama warns Russia about continued meddling . Those include recognizing Petro Poroshenko, who recently won the first national election since the unrest began last November, as Ukraine's President when he is inaugurated Saturday. Until now, the Kremlin has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Kiev-based government that took over after the ouster of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Neither Poroshenko nor his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, ruled out the possibility of meeting when they are in France over the coming days. If they do, they'll have their work cut out for them, given the deep divisions about what's happened in Ukraine and what should happen next. Still, the two countries appear to be coming together at least in one respect: Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, Mikhail Zurabov, will attend Poroshenko's inauguration, according to state-run RIA Novosti. ""[Zurabov] is returning to Kiev in order to continue executing his functions,"" added Russian foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich.

"New York (CNN) -- An education advocacy group has filed a lawsuit against New York City and state education officials challenging teacher-tenure laws, on the heels of a watershed case in which a California judge ruled that state's tenure laws unconstitutional. The lawsuit filed Thursday in State Supreme Court on behalf of 11 New York City public school students claims that tenure laws can prevent students from receiving a ""sound basic education,"" according to a statement from the New York City Parents Union, of which parents of the plaintiffs are members. ""Teachers in New York City are more likely to die on the job than be replaced because of poor performance,"" the lawsuit said. The lawsuit is framed similarly to a case brought in California, in which a judge in June deemed teacher tenure unconstitutional, saying it kept bad teachers in the classroom and forced out promising good ones. That landmark ruling was hailed by the nation's top education chief as opening opportunities across the nation to ""build a new framework for the teaching profession."" The decision represented ""a mandate"" to fix a broken teaching system, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said. In New York, the lawsuit claims that under city law an educator who obtains tenure is shielded from dismissal, no matter how incompetent they are or how poorly their students perform. ""The state requires a quality-blind approach to layoffs that considers only years of service -- and completely ignores job performance and the ability to deliver a sound quality education,"" the lawsuit said. But the New York State United Teachers union said tenure laws are ""wildly misunderstood"" and claimed teacher tenure does not ensure a job for life, as is commonly believed. ""Earning tenure in New York simply means that, if a teacher is accused of incompetence or wrongdoing, she is entitled to a fair hearing before she can be fired,"" NYSUT President Karen E. Magee said in a statement last week. CNN was unable to reach the union for comment Friday about the lawsuit. Magee called the process for removing teachers ""due process of law."" The Parents Union, however, called the process rare. The lawsuit said only 12 teachers between 1997 and 2007 in the New York City school system were formally replaced because of poor performance. The New York City Department of Education has 75,000 teachers in any given year, working in the largest school system in the country. Mona Davids and Sam Pirozzolo -- the parents union's president and vice president -- said in a statement that the legal action was not an attack on teachers or unions, but rather an attempt to give their children a voice and establish a system that ""rewards and retains excellent teachers"" while providing appropriate resources to struggling teachers. Reforming teacher tenure and firing laws is a hotly debated issue in American education, with the California case widely seen as setting the stage for similar action nationally. Reformers say tenure laws and union protections make firing a bad teacher almost impossible, but teachers and their unions argue that school boards and their firing criteria have unfair, overtly political standards. The NYC Department of Education is the largest system of public schools in the United States, serving about 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 schools.","New York student plaintiffs claim teacher-tenure laws are flawed .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday declined to get involved in a dispute over a public high school's efforts to hold its student graduation ceremonies in a church. The justices, without comment, rejected the appeal from the Elmbrook School District outside Milwaukee, which had said its campus gymnasium was not large enough to accommodate those seeking to attend. They had contracted with a local ""megachurch"" to hold the events there, for what officials termed ""secular convenience."" Several students and their families had sued, saying that the rented venue ""coerces"" religious activity and that all Christian symbols and imagery should have been removed to make it fit for public, secular events. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say they wanted the court to decide the matter. They said a lower federal court ruling favoring the students was ""decided incorrectly."" The case is Elmbrook School District v.

"(CNN Student News) -- Students will explore contemporary applications of the U.S. Constitution. Procedure . As a class, read out loud the Preamble to the Constitution. Have students dissect the Preamble into its words and phrases, and hold a class discussion on the original intent of the U.S. Constitution. Remind students that in 1787, the framers of the U.S. Constitution established a federal system of government that divided power between the national and state governments. It also established the three branches of government: the legislative, the executive and the judicial. Federal powers listed in the Constitution include the rights to collect taxes, declare war and regulate trade. The national government also has implied powers that allow it to respond to the changing needs of the nation. Reserved powers belong to the people or the states. State powers include the right to legislate on marriage and divorce, public schools and the state's militia. The right to freedom of speech, the right to own property and the right to be tried by a jury are examples of the powers reserved for the people of the United States. The Supreme Court has the final authority to interpret the Constitution. It can overturn any law that conflicts with any part of the Constitution. Ask students: Why do you think that the framers of the Constitution organized the U.S. system of government this way? Next, organize students into five groups representing the following: the legislative branch, the executive branch, the judicial branch, the states and the people. Have each group investigate and list its powers as outlined in the U.S. Constitution: . Then, have the students consider their groups' constitutional powers in a modern-day context. Ask: How might the system of government outlined in the U.S. Constitution be used to address current events? Brainstorm with students a list of topics in the news, such as the War on Terror, gun control or immigration. For each issue, have students generate critical questions that address what role, if any, government should play. (Note: The questions will vary depending on the grade level and interest of the students.) Reorganize students into groups of five, with each group having one representative from the executive, legislative and judicial branches, the states and the people. Then, assign one of the critical questions posed above to each group. Have groups prepare diagrams to illustrate what powers, if any, the federal or state governments or the people have in responding to these critical questions.

"(CNN) -- Evidence in the case of a Michigan boy who vanished for nearly two weeks before turning up in his father's basement will not be turned over to prosecutors until at least next week, authorities said Wednesday. The information being presented to Detroit prosecutors includes allegations that the 12-year-old boy, Charlie Bothuell, made to county child welfare authorities. Sgt. Michael Woody had earlier said the evidence could be handed over as early as Wednesday. The agency opened an investigation of the family June 23 after FBI agents looking into the boy's disappearance interviewed his grandmother. That same day, the boy's father allegedly told investigators that he used a PVC pipe to discipline him, leaving a scar on the boy's chest, according to a petition filed with the Wayne County Department of Health & Human Services. There was blood on the pipe, and old scars on the boy's buttocks, the petition said. The timing of the injuries is unclear, police said. ""We are close to getting ready to submit our package to prosecutors,"" police Sgt. Michael Woody told CNN, adding the evidence could be turned over Wednesday. The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office will decide whether criminal charges will be filed. Mark Magidson, an attorney for the boy's father and stepmother, did not immediately return calls Wednesday seeking comment. Charlie Bothuell IV told authorities his son ran away after being scolded for not exercising or doing his chores. The FBI interviewed the boy as part of the investigation. The petition quoted the boy's grandmother as saying that he appeared thin and sickly when she last saw him. ""He had marks all over his arms and chest,"" the grandmother is quoted as saying. The FBI declined comment beyond acknowledging that agents met with the child. Charles Bothuell IV, and stepmother, Monique, have two other children. Both were taken into protective custody, investigators said. The child's father is not allowed to have any contact with Charlie while the investigation continues. The boy was discovered June 25 in the basement of his father's home, behind a barricade after numerous searches of the home in the days following his disappearance on June 14. Police said the boy had snacks and a sports drink in the basement. He told police his stepmother allegedly told him to hide there and ""not to come out, no matter what he hears,"" according to court petition. Charlie Bothuell IV learned his son was found during a taped interview last week with HLN's Nancy Grace, when he said he no idea the boy was in the basement. The boy's stepmother, charged with an unrelated probation violation involving a gun, pleaded not guilty in that case. A lie detector test taken by the father was inconclusive, police said. The boy's stepmother declined to take a polygraph. The tests are not permitted to be used as evidence at trial. Charlie is staying with relatives, police said.

"(CNN) -- Modern football is a melting pot of cultures, as players from a variety of ethnic backgrounds share top billing as superstars. It is not always a comfortable mix, as can be seen by the recent racism rows involving John Terry and Luis Suarez. But football's pantheon of stars has not always been such a rich multicultural tapestry. Far from it. Back in the sport's infancy in the late 1800s, in its homeland of white-dominated Britain, there were no official leagues and only a handful of domestic cup competitions. International matches were the pinnacle of competition, with England and Scotland contesting the first in 1872 -- and few were played outside the UK and Ireland until the formation of FIFA in 1904 . And it was Scotland which, in 1881, provided football with its first black international player -- British Guiana-born Andrew Watson. ""He was the son of a Glasgow merchant who traded out in the West Indies and parts of South America as well,"" curator of the Scottish Football Museum Richard McBrearty told CNN. ""It's a story of the time, I suppose. Andrew would've been born out of wedlock to a wealthy white merchant and his mother who was native to British Guiana."" Social attitudes of the time meant that Watson, while enjoying financial support and a good education, was never truly recognized and acknowledged by his father. ""Anything that had to be signed, due to school or education, was usually done through an intermediary,"" McBrearty explained. ""So he was recognized as being of the blood, but there was a distance."" Early records of Watson show him joining Glasgow team Parkgrove -- which at the time enjoyed a higher profile than now-famous neighbors Glasgow Rangers -- in both a playing and off-pitch capacity. In his role as match secretary, Watson created history by becoming the first black football administrator. In 1880 he joined Queen's Park, the biggest of the Glasgow clubs and Scotland's preeminent football power. The following year he represented Scotland in his first of three international outings, captaining the country in a landmark 6-1 victory over England at London's Oval ground -- now an international cricket venue. ""Even to this day with some of the fantastic teams England have played over the years, such as the Hungarians of 1953 and Pele's Brazil, that victory for Scotland remains England's heaviest defeat on home soil,"" said McBrearty. The Scotland team led by Watson pioneered a revolutionary passing game at a time when football was played in a very individual manner. ""He is a hugely important figure within football. He captained Scotland against England, which was absolutely the highest accolade you could have at the time. It was also at a time when Scotland were very successful in international football,"" McBrearty said. ""The way the game was played at that time, Scotland were devising a short passing game. The margin of victory was because Scotland were the first to promote a real team-based passing ethos. Watson was right at the forefront of that."" Despite his prominent role in the national team, Watson still occasionally encountered abuse which was symbolic of a less enlightened age. ""What we come across in a very polite article about Watson is that he encountered 'splenetic players' on the field. Now that suggests to me that the color of his skin was a subject of attack,"" McBrearty said. ""That's an insight into the fact that, even in that time, this was clearly happening and Watson had to rise above that as a footballer and more widely as a human being."" Watson's demeanor off the pitch is something McBrearty believes is also of note, saying he had a reputation as a gentleman. ""Certainly there is widespread praise that he wins. The adoration that he has is clearly because he manages to rise above the difficulties that he encounters on the field of play."" After leaving Queen's Park, Watson headed to England to play for the now-defunct Swifts club in London. McBrearty believes Watson became the first black player to play in the English FA Cup during the 1882-83 season. Watson passed away in Sydney, Australia in 1902 aged 44, but McBrearty thinks the contribution he made to football has paved the way for the big-name black players we see in the game today. ""He's massively important to global football, not just Scottish football, not just British football. He's one of the first few pioneers. He played international football, he captained the international team and they happened to be the best there was at that time. ""As football spreads across the globe with black players who are now among the best in the world, and you look at the legacy of fantastic Brazilian players like Pele and Garrincha, it really stems back to guys like Watson.""","Andrew Watson was the first black player to play international football .

"(CNN) -- Alana ""Honey Boo Boo"" Thompson and her family came out of a car crash without serious injuries Monday night, but ""Mama June"" says they're ""really sore today."" The reality TV stars' Chevrolet Suburban collided with a pickup at an intersection in Milledgeville, Georgia, Police Maj. John Davis told CNN Tuesday. ""It was really scary for us, since it was the first time any of us had ever been in a wreck,"" ""Mama June"" Shannon said in a statement sent to CNN by TLC, the channel that carries the series. ""Sugar Bear"" Thompson -- Alana's father -- was driving the SUV when the crash happened, Davis said. None of the family was taken to a hospital although there were complaints of pain, he said.

"(CNN) -- Imagine a place where police use online dating services to entrap and arrest gay men. Or a country that arrests a 14-year-old girl for adultery and then performs an invasive ""virginity test"" on her. Or where a woman is sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. Hollywood celebrities are rightly outraged to discover that places like this exist, and they're showing it by boycotting the Beverly Hills Hotel, owned by an investment group of the Sultan of Brunei's, to protest his country's new Sharia laws against homosexuality and adultery. Brunei is merely a newcomer on the scene. It joins 81 other countries where homosexuality is illegal. And, sadly, it's hardly the only place in the world where adultery is punishable by death. But the place I was talking about before, where homosexuals are arrested and deported, and adulterers are sentenced to stoning, wasn't Brunei. It was the United Arab Emirates, a favorite destination and filming location for wealthy Hollywood celebrities. Remember ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol""? That was filmed in Dubai. Justin Timberlake will perform in Abu Dhabi this month. Jennifer Lopez performed in Dubai in March. The last ""Fast & Furious,"" No. 7, is reportedly filming there right now. George Clooney, Ben Affleck, the Kardashians -- have all been popular guests of the money-soaked Emirates. Opinion: Why stone them for who they love? And the money flows both ways. Abu Dhabi Media, wholly owned by the United Arab Emirates, has invested hundreds of millions in American film companies. In 2012, for example, its subsidiary, Image Media Abu Dhabi, financed a new movie starring Matt Damon called ""Promised Land,"" about the evils of hydraulic fracking. That's right -- an anti-fracking movie was subsidized by the oil-rich UAE. You gotta love Hollywood. It's unclear how far Brunei will go in enforcing its newly adopted Sharia lawâ€”and there are few instances in recent years of the UAE actually carrying out Sharia punishments, such as flogging. But the laws allowing such sentences are on the books. Whereas it's unlikely most Hollywood celebrities could locate Brunei on a map (it shares the huge island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia), I bet many know their way to Dubai. Will they boycott the United Arab Emirates, with its glitzy, Hollywood-friendly hotels, star-studded film festival, picturesque shooting locations and oil-rich investment money, if they know its politics are similarly intolerant? Brunei is a little too exotic, far away and easy to avoid. And while much closer to home, so is the Beverly Hills Hotel. I'm sure there are plenty of other venues willing to host movie premieres, record launch parties and Lindsay Lohan's entourage. So rather than Hollywood celebrities boycotting a Los Angeles hotel -- in the town where they live, no less -- putting hundreds of American workers out of work, they should get to know the inconvenient truths about the world they live in and put their money where their mouths are.","SE Cupp: Celebrities boycotting Beverly Hills Hotel owned by Brunei sultan's investment group .

"(CNN) -- They are the world's cultural capitals, the nerve centers of innovation and the engine rooms of economic growth, but could cities also hold the key to cutting  carbon emissions long-term? A 2010 study from the World Bank found that the 50 largest cities and urban areas on the planet are now home to roughly 500 million people and spew out some 2.6 billion tons of greenhouse gasses every year. As urban migration continues apace, these figures are only expected to rise in the short term. While this may initially lead to more pollutants being pumped into the earth's atmosphere, some experts believe it could work out better in the long term. They say that the ecological efficiencies cities can offer, aligned with their financial and political influence, could lead to the development of more effective ways to curb carbon emissions. As the world's leading environmental figures gather in Durban, South Africa for the 2011 United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP17), CNN asked two urban climate change experts to explain the complex role of cities. Dr Stephen Hammer is co-director of the Urban Climate Change Research Network, a consortium of academics and institutions dedicated to the analysis of climate change mitigation, and an adviser to New York City's Energy Policy Taskforce. Mike Hodson meanwhile is a senior research fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Urban and Regional Futures at the University of Salford and co-author of the book, World Cities and Climate Change. How much do cities contribute to climate change? Stephen Hammer (SH): Cities are the where the majority of global energy use occurs, by far. The irony is, however, that the dense nature of cities can actually reduce the level of carbon emissions by introducing different kinds of efficiencies. The sheer number of people, however, just means that you just end up with a large volume of energy use and emissions. Mike Hodson (MH): Cities are increasingly being characterized as significant producers of climate change. Just over half the world's population lives in cities, around three-quarters of global energy consumption is linked to cities and around four-fifths of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked to cities. In what ways can cities help to address the issue of climate change? SH: Cities are often the laboratories for central government policies. Central governments don't often create these things on their own. They're looking at what others have done including sub-national governments and saying ""well if it worked there, we can make it work nationally."" Therefore, in the absence of national-level action, it is possible for cities to take very concrete steps to influence overall emission levels. MH: The biggest cities are pretty powerful in terms of positions within their national economies. They've got pretty well-developed government structures; they've got mayors and related agencies. But not only have they got those sorts of resources -- and therefore the ability to lobby and influence central government -- they also encompass quite significant national resources, whether it's financial centers, centers of business and centers of media. Given that they've got that range of expertise, knowledge, social networks and financial resources ... they can start to paint that picture that they are the places that can actively and effectively start to build (climate change) strategies and deliver on them. Why is it in cities interest to act in a way that negates the impact of climate change? SH: I think it's very safe to say that climate change threatens the long-term economic viability of many cities in addition to creating public health risks. Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans is a great example of that ... although not an event that was necessarily caused by climate change. The city suffered hugely in terms of the economic impact of an extreme weather event ... and these types of events are assumed to become more commonplace as the climate changes. MH: I think the flipside of this sort of argument about cities being producers of climate change is that they're also increasingly being seen as victims of climate change. This is particularly the case with rising sea levels, coastal cities and riverside cities that are at risk from rising sea levels but also those susceptible to drought or urban heat islands. What can cities do to negate or prepare for the impact of climate change? SH: It becomes particularly important for cities, as they expand rapidly, to make the decisions today that will constrain emissions in the future. So, again, going back to some of the first things I was talking about, the way the city is designed, having it so that it promotes density that that then supports public transportation ridership; designing the city in a way that makes it bicycle-friendly or eco-friendly or pedestrian friendly, so you're not always forcing people into automobiles. You must make the right decisions right now and as the city expands going forward you must constantly revisit them to see how can we be changing the old city to be more efficient but also how it can maintain efficiency when we are designing the expanding city or the new city. MH: One of the things that strikes me is that, whether it's global cities or more ordinary cities, to different degrees they have started to get their strategic act together by developing strategies, setting targets, setting timelines. But as of yet, they've not managed to translate that into any sort of effective way. They've really got to get to the more practical elements of how to translate that into tangible actions and deliver on them.","World Bank: Cities produce roughly 2.6 billion tons of carbon emissions each year .

"(CNN) -- Want space travel but don't have pockets deep enough for Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic or the courage levels to match Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil space-jumper? A balloon trip to (almost) space and back might just be the answer. Arizona-based space travel company World View Enterprises says it plans to offer a trip to the edge of space in a luxurious eight-seat capsule for $75,000 per ticket. It's somewhat more affordable considering Virgin Galactic charges $250,000, which also includes three days of training and two and a half hours in space. The capsule will be lifted by a high altitude balloon that will rise up to about 30 kilometers (98,425 feet or almost 20 miles) and stay aloft for two hours before returning back to Earth, according to a company press statement. Quiz: Do you have the smarts to be a space tourist? That is not as high as Baumgartner's jumping point (128,100 feet or around 39 kilometers) last year but much higher than one can usually reach -- the average altitude for commercial flights is about nine or ten kilometers above ground, or 30,000 to 40,000 feet. ""Passengers will be among the few to have seen the curvature of the Earth with their own eyes,"" the statement touted. ""They will be able to gaze at the astounding views, the blackness of space, the brilliance of stars and the thin veil of atmosphere enveloping our planet."" The first flight is planned for 2016. Component testing has already begun and sub-scale testing will soon be carried out as well, the company says. The space capsule will be developed by Paragon Space Development Corporation, which is developing technology for Inspiration Mars, a 501-day mission around Mars.

"(CNN) -- He has been in a medically induced coma for over a month, but former Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher's sedation is being reduced to start the ""waking up process,"" his agent said Thursday. Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29. The announcement marks a key change to Schumacher's condition, which has been routinely described as ""stable"" by agent Sabine Kehm in recent weeks. ""Michael's sedation is being reduced in order to allow the start of the waking up process which may take a long time,"" she said in a statement on Thursday. ""For the protection of the family, it was originally agreed by the interested parties to communicate this information only once this process was consolidated. ""Please note that no further updates will be given."" Kehm went on to repeat previous requests for the media to respect the privacy of Schumacher's family. ""The family of Michael Schumacher is again requesting to respect its privacy and the medical secret, and to not disturb the doctors treating Michael in their work. At the same time, the family wishes to express sincere appreciation for the worldwide sympathy."" A seven-time world champion whose F1 career ended in 2012, Schumacher has been treated in Grenoble since his accident. Neurosurgeons there operated twice to remove blood clots on the brain and reduce swelling, the reason he has been kept asleep since the surgery. The German has been inundated with support from around the world during his stay, with his former stable Mercedes running the message ""Keep Fighting Michael"" on its silver livery when they revealed their new car for testing on Monday. The Ferrari team, who Schumacher raced for between 1996 and 2006, also showed their support for their five-time world champion this week in the Spanish city Jerez, where teams are conducting winter testing ahead of the new F1 season. On the eve of the first day of testing, the team's crew posed with a pit board showing the message ""Forza Michael"" while the new F14-T scarlet racer made its track debut with the same words of encouragement. On Tuesday, the team published a note from Niki Lauda, who won two world championships for Ferrari in the 1970s, which read: ""Michael, every day I follow your improvements and every day I am close to you. I hope I can speak to you very, very soon!"" Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso told CNN that F1 was ""still in shock"" over Schumacher's accident and condition. ""The day that I received the news I could not believe it to be honest,"" Alonso, who was speaking in Madrid on Wednesday at an exhibition that charts the course of the driver's career. ""He was the man that can beat anything and can win any race and can do anything without any worries, so to see him and to see the accident ... ""We're all hoping every day to have some good news coming from the hospital,"" added Alonso. In early January, a French prosecutor investigating the accident said that speed was not a reason for Schumacher's fall. His investigative team believe the experienced skier hit a rock hidden beneath the snow, while traversing an area between two marked pistes, which catapulted him face first onto another rock. Schumacher ended up 9 meters (30 feet) from the edge of the piste, said prosecutor Patrick Quincy. Footage filmed on a small camera attached to Schumacher's helmet has been used to help the investigators' analysis.","Doctors reduce Michael Schumacher's sedation to start 'waking up process'

"(CNN) -- The head of a football anti-racism group has called for the English Football Association to charge Liverpool with bringing the game into disrepute over the club's response to Luis Suarez's eight-match ban for using racist language at Patrice Evra. On the day that Suarez issued a brief apology over the incident, Piara Powar, executive director of European football's anti-discrimination body FARE, spoke of his disappointment at Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish's attitude to the suspension. ""Kenny Dalglish's comments over the affair have been undignified and their reaction has damaged the club's brand across the world,"" Powar told the Professional Footballers' Association's official website. Suarez gave 'unreliable' evidence . ""This is a lack of respect for the governing body by Liverpool and the FA should charge them and manager Kenny Dalglish."" Powar continued: ""Liverpool have been too keen to support their man and in doing so have whipped up a sense of paranoia amongst their fans. ""For the club to be so aggressively militate against what looks to most people a considered judgment from the English FA leads to a potential for anarchy."" The comments came after Suarez issued a brief apology on the official Liverpool website, saying: ""I admitted to the FA commission that I said a word in Spanish once and only once. ""I told the panel members that I will not use it again on a football pitch in England. I never, ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then I want to apologize for that."" Suarez pointedly did not apologize to Evra, or mention the Manchester United defender in his statement, prompting Lord Ouseley, the chairman of British football's anti-racism group Kick It Out, to call the apology ""lamentable."" ""Suarez's attempt at a belated apology is nothing short of lamentable,"" Ouseley told the Guardian newspaper. ""I cannot believe that a club of Liverpool's stature, and with how it has previously led on matters of social injustice and inequality, can allow its integrity and credibility to be debased by such crass and ill-considered responses."" Although Liverpool decided not to appeal against Suarez's suspension, Dalglish has publicly expressed his disappointment over the ruling and questioned the FA's reasoning for its ruling. Suarez's Liverpool teammates also courted controversy before it was announced, publicly supporting the Uruguay striker by wearing t-shirts bearing his name prior to the match against Wigan.","An anti-racism chief has called for Liverpool to be charged over Luis Suarez affair .

"(CNN) -- The thing that is hard to miss in Ted Olson's Washington office are the quills. They're in a mug, all 56 of them, each commemorating an appearance before the Supreme Court. In many of those cases, he was the standard bearer for conservatives. And a successful one; he won 44 times. In fact, one of his most satisfying and famous wins was against Al Gore, the Democrats and super-attorney David Boies in the contested 2000 election. Olson represented George W. Bush. The rest, as they say, is history. Olson won, Boies lost. That is except in the movie ""Recount,"" as they both joked to me. Boies won the docudrama. On Wednesday, the two men won, this time together. They teamed up to argue against Proposition 8, which bans gay marriage in California. The legal team won in a stunning and clear decision. The plaintiffs, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker wrote, ""demonstrated by overwhelming evidence that Proposition 8 violates their due process and equal protection rights,"" ruling it unconstitutional. Now, the case will work its way up to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and then to the high court. Only Olson and Boies will be on the same side this time. In this case, Olson has been at the center in so many ways. Disdained by many conservatives for arguing for gay marriage, some openly calling his decision as an act of pure ego or even treason. Indeed, conservative legal analyst Ed Whelan told me, ""It really is a betrayal of everything Ted Olson has purported to stand for in his legal career in terms of constitutional principles."" But if you listen to Olson, his constitutional principles are exactly what this case -- and his decision to take it on -- is all about. ""The Constitution trumps everything,"" he told me. ""The Constitution provides that equal protection of the laws shall be guaranteed to all citizens."" Never mind that more than 40 states have voted against gay marriage or that a majority of the American public doesn't support it. That was the case, he says, with a ban on interracial marriage struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court more than 40 years ago. ""Civil rights battles are won by fighting for civil rights. ... We're representing real people, who are being deprived of their constitutional rights, and we tell them to wait? For what? For how long?"" It's interesting, in a way, because opposition to gay marriage increasingly looks like it cuts along a generational divide. One recent study showed that 58 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 support gay marriage, while only 22 percent of those 65 and older feel the same way. So if the issue will gradually resolve itself, some say, why take it to court now? ""Our choice is yes we will go to court to fight for you because your constitutional rights are being ignored. ..."" Olson told me. ""Or we could tell [gay couples] why don't you wait for years, why don't you wait for another generation?"" Even some pro-gay marriage groups were skeptical at first, worried that Olson and Boies were setting the cause up for failure. Still other legal scholars say that the two super-lawyers are driven by ego and relish that one last shot at arguing an historic case before the court. Both men cringe at that. And what about the charge that the two lawyers figure they can game the high court -- even a conservative one? Ah, says Olson. ""We're not taking for granted any votes on the Supreme Court. We have so much respect for the judges that are hearing this case and the justices of the Supreme Court that will hear this case, none of whom have made up their minds."" Is he sure? ""Yes,"" he smiles. ""They have not heard the arguments."" Now they almost certainly will. And Olson will get his 57th quill. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Ted Olson is noted conservative advocate before U.S. Supreme Court .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man arrested in connection with the stabbing of two children in Brooklyn may be linked to another stabbing in a Manhattan subway, a law enforcement official told CNN Thursday. Police believe Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was out on parole when he stabbed two young children inside an elevator -- killing one of them. St. Hubert was arrested by detectives around 8 p.m. Wednesday. He was arrested around the same time that Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce identified St. Hubert by name for the first time as the suspect in the attack. Detectives were obtaining evidence Thursday that could link him to a fatal stabbing on the subway in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, the official said. Investigators were executing search warrants to see if he is linked to additional stabbings since his release from prison on May 23, a law enforcement official said. Law enforcement has been involved with St. Hubert plenty in the past, including nine arrests, though police did not specify all the outcomes. The most recent instance was May 23, when, Boyce said. St. Hubert was released on parole in connection to a domestic assault case. Nine days later, police believe he encountered 6-year-old Prince Joshua ""PJ"" Avitto and 7-year-old Mikayla Capers inside an elevator at a public housing complex in Brooklyn. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the two children were ""on their way to get ice cream"" at the time. For reasons authorities haven't yet explained, the two children were stabbed -- both in the torso. PJ Avitto was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. ""These parents are in such pain now,"" de Blasio said. ""... I ask all New Yorkers to help in this investigation any way you can. Do it for this grieving family. Do it for all of us."" Police initially said Mikayla was in critical condition. Speaking Wednesday about her current state, the mayor said, ""She's doing much better. She's a strong young lady."" A knife believed to have been used in the attacks was recovered at the scene. A law enforcement official said Wednesday that DNA evidence from that knife helped police identify the suspect. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, however, added later in the day that police ""said nothing about DNA"" while insisting forensic evidence more generally helped lead them to the suspect. As the investigation continues, families of the two stabbed children struggled with the senselessness of the attack. ""Pray for her, and us. And pray for PJ's family. This is senseless. I don't know what monster would do something like this,"" said Regenia Trevathan, the girl's great-grandmother, to CNN affiliate WCBS. Scott Avitto, PJ's uncle, similarly said the violence ""doesn't make any sense."" ""We're all just struggling, we're trying to pull it together,"" he added. ""Our family is strong, but we just want justice to be done."" Avitto was related to Taj Gibson, a forward for the Chicago Bulls. Gibson tweeted Monday morning: ""They killed my lil super man. #rippj only two more weeks until your 7 birthday. Tears forever."" Gibson also posted a picture of Avitto to his Instagram account. PJ's godfather, Henry Alston, said the boy's funeral will be Friday. Investigators are considering the possibility the suspect may be responsible for another fatal stabbing that occurred just two days earlier and blocks away. Tanaya Copeland, 18, was found in the same neighborhood Friday night, unconscious and unresponsive with multiple stab wounds to her torso. Copeland was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, police said. The close proximity of the incidents, as well as similarities in the type of weapons used, have led detectives to believe the two cases may be related. ""We have to proceed as if they are aligned,"" Boyce said. ""The knives are very similar. The proximity is four blocks. We have a basic description of the male."" 12-year-old girls accused of stabbing friend .

"(CNN) -- Former Minnesota Viking and outspoken same-sex marriage supporter Chris Kluwe said Monday he is encouraged the NFL team is looking into his claims that he was released in May because he is an LGBT activist. Kluwe told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 in his first television interview since being kicked off the team that he is confident an investigation will uncover the truth. Over the past couple of years, the former punter has become known for his gay-rights activism, and in an article published Thursday on the website Deadspin he claimed he was fired by ""Two Cowards And a Bigot"" for his stance and not entirely for his performance on the field. ""I don't have anything against the Vikings organization itself. I had eight wonderful years with the Minnesota Vikings,"" Kluwe told CNN. ""I had a problem with three individual people within the Vikings, and the fact remains is that I did everything my coaches wanted me to do (on the field). ... No one ever told me that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do. ""The only thing that changed from Year 8 to when I got cut is that I started speaking out on same-sex rights."" The three individuals Kluwe referred to are Mike Priefer, the Vikings special teams coach; former head coach Leslie Frazier and Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman. Priefer, the man Kluwe labeled a ""bigot,"" denied the former player's claim in a statement to the StarTribune of Minneapolis. Kluwe: An openly gay player in the NFL is not a distraction . ""I want to be clear that I do not tolerate discrimination of any type and am respectful of all individuals ... The comments today have not only attacked my character and insulted my professionalism, but they have also impacted my family,"" said the coach, who has been with the team for two of his 11 years in the NFL. Kluwe said that he decided when he began to work with Minnesotans For Marriage Equality was that he wasn't going to back down from people who told him to keep his views to himself. He never thought about stopping even after Frazier requested he stop speaking out. When football, same-sex marriage and politics collide . ""I said, 'Well, no. That's not the right thing to do. We are all American citizens. We all deserve to live our lives free of oppression,'"" Kluwe told CNN. The Vikings said in a statement Thursday: ""Any notion that Chris was released from our football team due to his stance on marriage equality is entirely inaccurate and inconsistent with team policy. Chris was released strictly based on his football performance."" In his final season, Kluwe, 31, ranked 17th among punters in the 32-team league, averaging 39.7 net yards per punt. This season, the Vikings' Jeff Locke, a fifth-round draft pick, was 18th with a 39.2 yard average. Are athletes who speak their minds out of bounds? Kluwe said that after the Vikings drafted Locke in April he knew he was done with the team so he kept notes of his interactions with team officials. ""I realized I need to get all this stuff down now while it's fresh and make sure I have it because this is a story I would like to tell later,"" he said. As a result of telling his story in the Deadspin article, Kluwe believes his time in the NFL is over. After he was cut, he had a tryout with the Oakland Raiders but didn't get the job. He said speaking publicly about team matters was, in this case, like throwing a stick of dynamite on a bridge -- one that can never be crossed again. But he thinks the Vikings investigation will reveal the truth, if his former teammates are given the opportunity to maintain anonymity when they are interviewed about what they witnessed. He likely won't sue the team, he said, reiterating that he believes it was Priefer, Frazier and Spielman that moved to get rid of him. And the Vikings have ""a good track record of getting to the truth,"" he said. The team said Friday the investigation in under way and the two attorneys heading the probe will interview current and former members of the organization.

"(CNN) -- As the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) continues to capture and control more territory in Iraq and Syria, it is important to realize what is at stake in the region and for the American people. The challenge that ISIS poses is not just to Iraq's stability but also to U.S. security. ISIS is a terrorist group with their own army and bank account that has a clear and growing ability to conduct terrorist attacks against the Iraqi government, Americans and U.S. interests, and even the U.S. homeland. ISIS, although loosely affiliated with al Qaeda, is in many respects even more extreme in its methods and its brutality than the terrorists who plotted and carried out 9/11. Although until now ISIS has focused its military goals on Syria and Iraq, its ranks include thousands of jihadists who have streamed into Syria and now into Iraq from around the globe as well as known terrorists who have been released or freed from Iraqi prisons. ISIS's goal is to secure its hold over large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, to establish an Islamic state or ""caliphate"" that stretches across the heart of the Middle East. As we have learned in the past, terrorists seek safe havens from which to operate, often in failed or failing states. They use this territory to train and equip themselves, raise funds and plot attacks. In addition to the threat to the U.S. homeland, we also need to be concerned that if Iraq begins to fragment, the resulting chaos and instability will ripple throughout the region. ISIS has sown incredible instability in Syria and is now seeking to do the same in Iraq. If we allow ISIS to spread further, their next targets will be U.S. allies and partners already under sufficient strain from the ongoing conflict in Syria, such as Jordan and even Saudi Arabia. We have an imperfect partner in Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who has shown himself unable to govern inclusively. We need to make clear to Baghdad that significant U.S. assistance will not be possible unless a national unity government is formed that does not include al-Maliki. Iran has already entered the fight on behalf of the al-Maliki government in Baghdad. But if we delegate this problem to Iran, we are likely to see the creation of a Shiite rump state that would effectively become an Iranian proxy and extend Iran's reach and influence from the Gulf of Oman to the Mediterranean Sea. So, what should we do? First and foremost, we need to move now to degrade ISIS's capabilities. The President's decision to send 300 advisers to Iraq is a good first step, but their ability to deter ISIS will be limited unless we eventually engage in airstrikes to target their leaders as well as the supply lines that they use to transfer weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq. We know where these supply lines are, we should not hesitate to halt the ISIS resupply to their strongholds in Anbar, Ninawa and Salah ad-Din. Second, we also need to understand that our lack of an effective Syria strategy has allowed ISIS to take hold and flourish in the region. ISIS has been able to develop its capabilities, increase its ranks, and obtain combat experience for its fighters over the last 18 months in northern Syria. We need to begin to tackle the root causes of the problem in Syria by overtly arming the moderate Syrian rebels that are fighting ISIS in that country even as we simultaneously tackle the challenge they currently pose to Iraq. The U.S. and allies should consider additional counter terrorism measures in Syria, perhaps working with regional partners. This is all a response to the same problem, and must be part of a unified strategy. The President's long overdue announcement on Thursday of an overt plan to train and equip moderates in the opposition is a welcome development, but we need to do much more to finally deal with the threat that the Syrian conflict poses to regional stability and ultimately, to U.S. security. Third, as ISIS has gained ground in Iraq, its wealth and ability to make money have increased. We need to stop their ability to sell the Syrian and Iraqi oil they attempt to market to the outside world. We also need a new diplomatic strategy to counter ISIS funding and support. Unfortunately, some of our partners in the Gulf have contributed to this problem. Others in the region have turned a blind eye to foreign fighters flocking to the fight. This needs to end. Finally, our partners in the region need our support. Jordan deserves special attention and assistance. Jordan is already dealing with an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the conflict in Syria. Jordan is a close partner of the United States and a likely target of ISIS's attention. In recent days, the group captured the border crossing between Iraq and Jordan. The United States should find ways to make clear that the United States will defend Jordan's security, including militarily if necessary. Some will argue that the challenges faced by Iraq or countries such as Jordan are none of our business. That we have spent too many years, lives, and dollars trying to make Iraq and the broader Middle East a better place. None of the options before us are ideal, but the question is whether we take action against ISIS now or deal with the consequences later here on U.S. soil. The stakes are too high for us to continue to ignore this problem. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Sen. Marco Rubio is worried about the growing threat of ISIS in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky could get his pension back, if Pennsylvania's pension board agrees with a recommendation to resume the almost $5,000-per-month checks that he used to get. A state arbitrator made the recommendation Friday after Sandusky appealed a ruling that he lost the right to his pension -- from working as an assistant football coach at Penn State University -- when he was convicted in 2012 of sexually assaulting 10 young boys. The arbitrator's recommendation will probably go before the state board in the fall. Both sides will first have a chance to respond to the recommendation. The arbitrator wrote in his opinion that Pennsylvania law did not allow for someone to lose a pension for Sandusky's crimes until 2004, long after Sandusky's 1999 retirement from the university. Before 2004, people could lose their state pensions only if they'd been convicted of financial crimes. Since Sandusky was retired when the change was made, his lawyer appealed the ruling to stop his pension checks. It has no legal bearing that Sandusky was convicted of molesting several of the boys while he was employed by Penn State, and on the campus where he worked. The recommendation has outraged some close to the case. ""He shouldn't be receiving any benefits, especially benefits related to Penn State,"" said Jennifer Storm, an advocate who has been working with Sandusky's victims. ""I think it's absolutely outrageous that he's entitled to any benefits associated with the place where he offended upon so many young men."" Attorney Ben Andreozzi, who has represented several of Sandusky's victims, called on lawmakers to change the law and make it retroactive. ""I'm disgusted by the fact that he's going to continue to be paid by some form of taxpayers' money,"" Andreozzi said. A jury found Sandusky guilty of 45 counts of child sex abuse in June 2012, in a case in which the crimes were committed from the early 1990s through late 2009.","The ex-Penn State assistant coach appealed a ruling that he lost the right to his pension .

"(CNN) -- Our world has rapidly gone from being connected to interconnected to interdependent. When the world is tied together this intimately, everyone's values and behavior matter more than ever, because our actions affect more people than ever and in ways they never have. Such was the case when one banker exposed his company's culture in the New York Times and as a direct result his bank reportedly lost $2.15 billion overnight in market value and a debate erupted on social media over banking industry practices. Today, ""how"" we do what we do -- our behavior individually and organizationally -- not only matters more than ever, it matters in ways it never has before. The fact that customers can instantly compare price, features, quality and service requires leaders to fundamentally rethink how their organizations operate and how their people conduct business. Competitive advantage has shifted from what we do to how. Further, we are now asking more of our employees than we ever did in the past. We ask employees to represent their company and nurture its brand, not only when they're on the job, but whenever they publicly express themselves in tweets, blog posts, emails, or any other social interaction. We're asking for distinctly human qualities and behaviors and how leaders elicit and guide those inspired behaviors must shift accordingly. Here are steps you can take to become a more inspired leader. Connect and collaborate, don't command and control . The days of leading companies via a one-way conversation are over. Power has shifted and our leadership must shift with it. The old system of ""command and control"" to exert power over people is fast being replaced by ""connect and collaborate"" -- to generate power through people. Leaders and managers cannot just impose their will. Now you have to have a two-way conversation that connects deeply with your colleagues, customers and other stakeholders. Netflix found this out the hard way last year when they lost 800,000 subscribers after arbitrarily increasing prices and splitting up their distribution channels without explaining their actions. Inspire, don't only motivate or coerce . There are three ways to get people to do things: coercion, motivation or inspiration. Leaders need to focus more on inspiration and less on coercion and motivation, since external rewards and carrots and sticks have limitations, particularly in hard times when there are fewer carrots to go round. See also: Want to be a leader? Act like one . Those who have flown on Southwest Airlines can testify how flight attendants are encouraged to flex their creativity and sense of humor when walking passengers through the mundane process of safety procedures. There is no rule book; rather Southwest's culture inspires its employees to innovate in their behavior. Yet Southwest is the exception rather than the rule. Business today faces an inspiration deficit as demonstrated recently by ""The How Report,"" an independent study that my company LRN conducted with the Boston Research Group and Research Data Technology. The report found that CEOs are six times more likely than ""average workers"" to believe they work in a company where people are inspired. Employees said they were primarily coerced (84%) or motivated (12%) by carrots and sticks at work rather than inspired by values and a commitment to a mission and purpose (4%). Yet the study reveals that companies that do inspire their people through values significantly outperform those who don't. These companies experience higher levels of innovation, employee loyalty, and customer satisfaction, and lower levels of misconduct, employee fear of speaking up, and retaliation. Behavior as offense, not defense . The most successful sports coaches have shown that behavior is no longer a defensive tactic. Instead, behavior is now an offensive strategy that inspirational leaders need to deploy all over the pitch to create the conditions that result in the game being won, not just being played. There are simply too many shots on goal for them to block in our radically interconnected world. The best defense is to keep the ball. Behavior has become a powerful source of excellence and competitive advantage. Bosses can no longer get away with telling subordinates, ""Just get it done -- I don't care how."" Today's successful leaders are those who flip the switch and replace task-based jobs (which are about what people must do) with values-based missions (how we get things done). Extend trust, don't inspect for it . We live in an era when trust is the currency of the age and the key to a winning business strategy. But the value of trust lies in finding ways to give it away. A New York City donut maker boosted his productivity and profits through trusting his customers to make their own change, illustrating in practice the inspired behaviors that flow from extending trust. The extension of trust is the key enabler that inspires others to take the risks that are so essential to spurring innovation. It is in this innovation that real performance and, most importantly, real progress are seen. This is the basic formula for thriving in our hyperconnected, hypertransparent world. See also: Why we pick bad leaders . Recognize and reward for ""how"" and not ""what"" Leaders and managers should go out of their way to recognize employees for how they do what they do, not for what they do or how much they get done. This could consist of starting their next meeting not by asking ""What is on the agenda?"" but ""How are we going to connect and collaborate to make a difference?"" Or it could be emphasizing a principled decision that a colleague has made for their company in the interests of long-term sustainability at the expense of short-term expediency. Today's most successful leaders realize the need to relinquish traditional modes of control and set an example to their employees for how they lead, speak and manage performance. Hire for character, not just skill . ""Who"" is an anagram of ""how"" and in a world where ""how"" matters more than ever, it takes ""who"" to do ""how."" The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, ""Character is fate"" and it is the responsibility of leaders to enlist employees who can contribute their full character and creativity to perform their best work and whose reason and purpose for going to work every day extends beyond their paycheck. By inspiring their employees to pursue a higher, more meaningful purpose and achieve real sustainable value, leaders can achieve significance, not just long-term success. Confucius said over 2,000 years ago: ""The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."" The leaders who commit their companies to go on a journey to find new ways to innovate in ""how"" will be those whose organizations thrive, not just survive, in the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dov Seidman.","In the interconnected modern world, our behavior matters more than ever, argues Dov Seidman .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz.  This is CNN Student News. First Up: Purple Heart . AZUZ: First up, Congress considers a new bill that would make some soldiers eligible for the Purple Heart. Representative John Carter introduced the new legislation yesterday. The Fort Hood Army Post is located in his home district in Texas, and this bill is focused on the victims of the recent shooting there. The Purple Heart, first created in 1782, is given to any U.S. service member who is wounded or killed while serving in action against an enemy or in a terrorist attack. Representative Carter says the Fort Hood victims deserve the Purple Heart because he considers the shooting to be an enemy attack. Asia Trip . AZUZ: China has a big role on the international scene. The country is a major part of the talks about North Korea's controversial nuclear program, and it holds one of the five permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. Ed Henry fills us in on what happened when President Obama met with Chinese President Hu Jintao yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO) HENRY: In Beijing's bitter cold, President Obama was all about showcasing a new warmth with China as he toured the historic Forbidden City and its Hall of Supreme Harmony. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's beautiful. What a magnificent place to visit. HENRY: By the end of this week, Mr. Obama will have visited 20 nations, the most in the first year of any American president, though he told Chinese President Hu Jintao in the ornate Great Hall of the People their relationship may be most pivotal of all. OBAMA: In this young century, the jobs we do, the prosperity we build, the environment we protect, the security that we seek, all these things are shared. HENRY: It was not, however, all sweetness and light. While Mr. Obama avoided a meeting with the Dalai Lama in Washington last month to not ruffle feathers before this visit, here in Beijing, he gently but publicly pushed the Chinese to cool tensions with the Tibetan spiritual leader. OBAMA: While we recognize that Tibet is part of the People's Republic of China, the United States supports the early resumption of dialogue between the Chinese government and representatives of the Dalai Lama to resolve any concerns and differences that the two sides may have. HENRY: And while they spoke of broad economic cooperation, Hu slapped at the U.S. for recently hitting Chinese tires and steel with new levies. PRESIDENT HU JINTAO, CHINA [TRANSLATED]: Our two countries need to oppose and reject protectionism and all its manifestations in an even stronger stand. HENRY: But the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases vowed to work together to get concrete action on climate change at a summit next month in Copenhagen. OBAMA: An accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational affect. This kind of comprehensive agreement would be an important step forward in the effort to rally the world around a solution to our climate challenge. HENRY: But the Chinese president stopped far short of endorsing tough new sanctions against Iran, though both sides are pledging cooperation to stop North Korea's nuclear program just a couple of days before Mr. Obama visits South Korea, the final stop on this long Asian journey. Ed Henry, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO) Nuclear Concerns . AZUZ: All right, Mr. Henry there mentioned Iran's nuclear program. That includes a facility that was made public just recently. A new report from the International Atomic Energy Agency says the fact Iran kept the facility a secret brings up some serious questions. For example, are there other facilities Iran hasn't made public? Under a previous agreement, the country is required to tell the energy agency about them. Iran says its nuclear program only has peaceful purposes; other countries believe Iran may be trying to build a nuclear weapon. That is why the U.S. is concerned about the program and why it is making this: a massive ordinance penetrator. This is a 30,000-pound bomb that could blast through 60 feet of concrete and potentially damage underground weapons factories. The military says it's building the bomb; it doesn't have any immediate plans to use it. Shoutout . MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What is the name of the student-led demonstration that took place in Prague in November 1989? If you think you know it, shout it out! Was it the: A) Cultural Revolution, B) Boxer Rebellion, C) Velvet Revolution or D) Industrial Revolution? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Velvet Revolution took place about a week after the fall of the Berlin Wall. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Velvet Revolution . AZUZ: Thousands of marchers went out in Prague yesterday, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the peaceful uprising. It looked something like it did in 1989, when citizens of Czechoslovakia demonstrated against the country's communist government and eventually helped to bring it to an end. Czechoslovakia would later split into two countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Musicians and other artists played major roles in the Velvet Revolution, and yesterday's rallies in Prague wrapped up with a massive concert. Blog Report . AZUZ: How do you feel about the government's decision to try five suspected 9/11 terrorists in a New York civilian court instead of a military tribunal? Monday's show at CNNStudentNews.com has a refresher if you need it. Sara believes the suspects should be tried in a military court. ""They are not U.S. citizens and should not be entitled to the same privileges. They would still be given a fair trial,"" she says.  ""The wounds from 9/11 run deep,"" Kreven says, ""and by bringing these suspects back to New York, it would re-open some of these harsh wounds."" From Nicole: ""Bringing them to America shows that we are giving them a fair trial... it's important to give them the same justice that's given to everyone."" And Billy doesn't think it matters where they're tried, just as long as they get tried. He thinks they should've gone to trial years ago. The government's decision, not a popular one: In a recent CNN poll, 64 percent said that confessed 9/11 planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- one of the suspects -- should be tried in a military tribunal, not a civilian court. Rebirth of Space . AZUZ: NASA isn't going anywhere, but its space shuttle program is about to be a thing of the past. It's scheduled to end next year. The future of space travel will include private companies that could take you on a trip out of this world. One business has already sold 200 tickets for $200,000 a each! Don't know where you're going to get that, but Bill Tucker takes us to New Mexico for a look at what could be America's launch pad. (BEGIN VIDEO) BILL TUCKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Out here in the vast desert of southern New Mexico is where America's space program was born with pioneers like Joe Kitinger and Robert Goddard. And it is here that some believe it is being reborn. New Mexico is investing almost $300 million in a project known as Spaceport America, an airport for commercial space exploration. STEVE LANDEENE, EXEC. DIRECTOR, SPACEPORT AMERICA: It's about being visionary, and I think of the state of New Mexico back from the early days of Goddard, Von Braun, Kitinger, space has always been in the mainstream of what New Mexico is all about. And this is just one more step. TUCKER: Virgin Galactic will use Spaceport America to launch its space tourism business, offering wealthy clients rides into spaces, carried aloft by the White Knight II. Virgin Galactic is the largest private partner in this futuristic and futuristic-looking venture in the desert, committing more than $200 million in technological development. The project broke ground in June; construction contracts have been awarded. Over the next year and a half, the state expects construction will provide between 400 and 600 jobs in the middle of nowhere. In this field where there is nothing but grassland, cactus and mesquite bushes, a year from now there will be a runway, 10,000 feet by 200 feet, with the spaceport hangar located just over there. Virgin Galactic is attention-getting, the headline grabbing stuff. But space tourist rides are still a couple of years away. Small entrepreneurial companies are already busy changing the face of space exploration. JERRY LARSON, UP AEROSPACE: I think any time you get entrepreneurs getting into the space business or any business, actually, you'll see some real innovation, because entrepreneurs and companies have to make money with it. So, that's what's exciting about this. You start to see small companies like mine that are actually in this business for money. TUCKER: His company is Up Aerospace, providing low-cost launch facilities at the spaceport to clients like Moog FTS, a company involved in space research and manufacturing. His launch costs are one-tenth of those of a standard facility, and there's a fast turnaround time between launches. Which means engineers like Ray Nielson can get away from their desk and on to the launch pad. RAY NIELSEN, MOOG INDUSTRIES: That's huge. So, if you can do ten of these vehicles for what it costs to do one mission on a sophisticated military test range, it's an amazing simplification of your life, just to go out quickly, get the data you need, build another one and try it again. TUCKER: Up Aerospace is just one of several small companies with big ambitions and dreams. Lockheed Martin is one of the not-so-small names at Spaceport America.

"(CNN) -- Even in death, peace seemed to elude little Myls Dobson. On Wednesday evening, one week after the badly beaten and burned boy was found in the apartment of the woman caring for him, his body was claimed at the morgue in New York. Authorities said the boy was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of the bathroom at The Ritz Plaza, a luxury high-rise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday. She has been charged with first-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful imprisonment. A prosecutor told the court last week that King also was being investigated on suspicion of murder and faced additional charges. The indictment will be unsealed February 5. In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: ""My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her. I would tell everyone not jump to any conclusions at this time."" On Wednesday, Konoski did not return a call seeking comment. Myls' father, Okee Wade, who has a lengthy arrest record, was jailed in New Jersey on conspiracy, theft and money laundering charges just days after dropping his son off with King in mid-December, authorities said. He pleaded not guilty. The boy's mother, Ashlee Dobson, who faced abuse and neglect charges in both South Carolina and New York City before ultimately losing custody of Myls in 2011, plans a memorial service for her son in Harlem on Tuesday night. ""We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect,"" said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson. In the final weeks of his brief life, Myls suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence, according to a criminal complaint. The boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles, court papers said. There were bruises and numerous marks made by an object on his abdomen and legs and wrists -- bruises consistent with being restrained -- lacerations to his fingers, abrasions to his armpit, and bruises and scars on his back. The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said. King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the ""child's primary and sole caretaker"" until the time of his death, the complaint said. At a news conference Friday, Herbert said that Dobson lost custody of her son for financial reasons. Herbert and Dobson demanded answers from child welfare authorities. ""The city of New York put the child in the care of the father, who they knew was a felon,"" Herbert said. ""You open up a case and then you close it thinking everything is fine? No. That has to be answered. Who did that, who authorized that?"" Referring to child welfare authorities, he added, ""She was in a shelter, they didn't think it best that she would be in that shelter with a baby, so they gave him to the father."" David Bookstaver, a family court spokesman, said Wednesday that the mother's financial straits or stay at a shelter had nothing to do with her losing custody of the child. ""The record reflected serious mental health issues that would have prevented her from properly caring for the young boy,"" he said. ""In fact, she consented to have the father be Myls' custodian, as did the child's lawyer and the Administration for Children's Services."" At the New York family court hearing, it was mentioned that Ashlee Dobson was arrested after an emergency room nurse at a South Carolina hospital spotted lacerations on the boy and called the police, according to an April 8, 2011, police report from the Colleton County Sheriff's Office. She told police the injuries happened when Myls ran into traffic in the parking lot of a supermarket. She claimed she scratched the boy when she grabbed him and then fell on top of him, the report said. ""When they got up she stated that she slapped the child with a closed fist on his face because she was mad,"" the report said. Dobson told police that Myls later fell down stairs and struck his head. Philip Lights, Dobson's lawyer, said the case was later dismissed after his client agreed to counseling and treatment under the supervision of child welfare authorities. Last week, Dobson told reporters that she was turning her life around in hopes of regaining custody of her son. She had weekly visitation rights but last saw her son in November. In tears, she said, ""I love my son. He always loved me. He always gave me kisses."" The complaint portrays the finals weeks of Myls' life as a living hell. King, the baby-sitter, told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said. The next day, she told police, she allegedly struck him about his body five or six times with a belt, leaving bruises and scars. The complaint said King admitted that from December 30 to January 4, she allegedly tied the boy's wrists and feet together with shoe laces and gagged him with a piece of cloth. She told police that treatment resulted in scaring on his wrists and ankles. On the day she freed him, the complaint said, King allegedly beat him 12 to 13 times with a belt. On January 7, during subfreezing temperatures, King told police she allegedly locked the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said. That same day, she allegedly locked the boy inside a dark bathroom for about three hours. King told authorities that the boy was ""being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food,"" the complaint said. The last time the boy ate or drank anything was on January 3. Aside from her comments about the child not eating well, King gave no indication in the complaint of what might have prompted her purported actions. After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds. Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office, said an autopsy was performed Thursday, but the cause of death is pending further study. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called Myls' death tragic and ordered a full report on what happened by the end of this week. ""Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop,"" he said. ""And god forbid when they happen, it is our job to learn from them and try to every time do better so we can reach more children.""","A week after horrific death, boy's body claimed at New York morgue .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: What happens when history and controversy come together on a field trip? We'll explore the answer on today's show. I'm Carl Azuz, and this is CNN Student News! First Up: Ford Hood Charges . CHRIS GREY, U.S. ARMY CRIMINAL DIVISION: U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan, a 39-year-old psychiatrist assigned to Darnell Medical Center here at Fort Hood, has been charged with 13 specifications of premeditated murder. AZUZ: That is the headline out of Fort Hood today: 13 counts of premeditated murder. The charges have been made against Major Nidal Hasan. He's the suspected gunman in last week's attack. Army officials say Hasan could face more charges, as well. Hasan's lawyer says that given the nature of the charges, he expects the legal process to be a ""long and difficult road."" H1N1 Update . AZUZ: And in health news, the impact of the H1N1 virus may be more widespread than originally thought. The Centers for Disease Control believes that the virus has caused nearly 3,900 deaths in the U.S. in the first six months since the thing showed up. Tha is a significant increase from earlier government reports. As of last month, officials estimate that 22 million people in the U.S. had contracted H1N1. The government has ordered 75 million doses of the vaccine for the virus. A little more than 40 million of those are currently available. Spoken Word . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's important that we don't make any ill-considered decisions, even with the best of intentions, particularly at a time when our resources are so limited. But it's just as important that we are open to any demonstrably good idea to supplement the steps we've already taken to put America back to work. Jobs Forum . AZUZ: President Obama talking about the state of the economy and explaining some of the reasons why he's planning to hold a meeting about jobs. The forum is scheduled to take place next month. It'll include representatives from large and small businesses, as well as workers and financial experts. The country has seen some recent economic growth, but as the president pointed out yesterday, it has not led to an increase in jobs. Right now, the U.S. unemployment rate is 10.2 percent. That is the highest it's been in decades. APEC SUMMIT . AZUZ: After making that announcement, President Obama headed to Asia. It's his first visit to the region since he was elected. He's going to a meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC. It's a group of 21 countries that are responsible for more than half of the world's economic power. The goal of the organization is to encourage economic growth in the region, something that's been tough given recent, global financial problems. Andrew Stevens looks at some of the topics on this weekend's agenda. (BEGIN VIDEO) ANDREW STEVENS, CNN ANCHOR, WORLD BUSINESS TODAY: Before the APEC summit in Singapore, and security is tight. Organizers leave nothing to chance as they prepare for one of the biggest events in the city-state's history. It may look calm enough on the surface, but the undercurrents in the world trade are dangerous. It was only a year ago that this city was slammed by the global economic storm. ROBERT PRIOR-WANDESFORDE, HSBC, SENIOR ASIA ECONOMIST: It was huge. Singapore exports collapsed. Singapore GDP showed its largest ever decline. STEVENS: This is one of the busiest shipping channels anywhere in the world. Not surprising, really, when you consider that trade export is the lifeblood of this small Southeast Asian economy. Now, it's only fitting really that APEC gathers here this year to talk about the critical issue of global trade. PRIOR-WANDESFORDE: I think probably the most concrete thing we'll see out of APEC this week is a recommitment to free trade and the importance of free trade. STEVENS: That is exactly what business people like Tan Pheng Hock are hoping for. His Singapore-based ST Engineering builds aerospace and transport systems and electronic equipment. Most of the group's $4 billion in revenues come from exports. TAN PHENG HOCK, ST ENGINEERING: The economy, the global economy, is still very soft, still very uncertain. Is it a V or a U, I wouldn't guess which way. What it means is that there's lots more work. STEVENS: He wants APEC to move faster to liberalize trade, but his key concern is protectionism. HOCK: When you have protectionism, it breeds disease whereby people will be so dependent on it. And the moment you remove it, you get lots of resistance. STEVENS: World leaders have already pledged to fight the rise of protectionism, and it will be on the APEC agenda as leaders look to U.S. President Obama to help forge global agreements. PRIOR-WANDESFORDE: With the crisis we've been through, there have obviously been some protectionist tendencies beginning to rise, particularly in the western world. I hope we will see those quashed during the course of this week. (END VIDEO) Controversial History Lesson . AZUZ: As we promised you at the beginning of today's show, we're gonna take you on a little field trip now. Teachers often use these trips to give you experiences you just can't get in the classroom. At one former plantation in North Carolina, you can experience a time when cotton was king and slavery was the law. Tenikka Smith from affiliate WSOC explains how a lesson about the past raised serious concerns in the present. (BEGIN VIDEO) TENIKKA SMITH, WSOC REPORTER: Ian Campbell gives historical tours and lessons at the Latta Plantation. IAN CAMPBELL, HISTORIAN, LATTA PLANTATION TOUR GUIDE: I am very, very enthusiastic about what I do in trying to get kids to think about how people did things during 1860, 1861, even before that period. SMITH: But one Union County parent says Campbell took his enthusiasm too far when he picked three black elementary school students out of a group of mostly white students to play the role of cotton picking slaves during a class trip. CAMPBELL: I was trying to be historically correct, not politically correct. SMITH: Charlotte NAACP President Kojo Nantambu disagrees. KOJO NANTAMBU, CHARLOTTE NAACP PRESIDENT: There is a lingering pain, a lingering bitterness, a lingering sense of insecurity and a lingering sense of inhumanity since slavery. Because that's still there, you want to be more sensitive than you want to be politically correct or historically correct. SMITH: Although Campbell defends his decision, he says in the future he will take a different approach. CAMPBELL: I'm going to actually start asking for volunteers instead of calling people from the audience. I think that would make it a lot easier. That way, if there's someone who is afraid of public speaking or getting up in front of their peers, it wouldn't embarrass them. NANTAMBU: Even if the black children had volunteered, I probably would have tried to use all of the children, for the effect that would have made them all feel equal in the experience. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: Historically correct or politically correct? Which do you think is more important? Or maybe you have another way you would look at this whole topic. We want to know what you think. We'd like you to share your thoughts on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com! But please remember, we only want your responses and your first names. Please, only give us your first names on that. Shoutout . NINETTE SOSA, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to the teachers and students at Chestnut Ridge Middle School in Washington Township, New Jersey, who are celebrating their school's 20th anniversary! What is the world record for the amount of time it takes to eat a 12-inch pizza? Is it: A) 30 seconds, B) 1 minute, 45 seconds, C) 2 minutes, 10 seconds, D) 3 minutes, 15 seconds? You've got three seconds -- GO! A New Zealand man set the mark in 1 minute, 45 seconds. That's just one of the amazing feats you'll find in the Guinness Book of World Records. For some other entries... Off the Beaten Path . (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: Oh boy. It's another hands-on competition for a world record! Usain Bolt may be the fastest man on two feet, but in terms of the human wheelbarrow, he's neither as fast nor as loud as these fanatics in Finland. They had a hand in Guinness World Records Day 2009, what the organization called a ""celebration of all things superlative,"" including everyone from daredevils to dancers to dune riders to cowpunchers. Yes, there's a record for most people lassoing, and it's 23! In Italy, pasta played a record role. In Finland, people of 76 different nationalities sweated out a superlative in a sauna. But it was the UK that hosted a record that's indisputably hair-raising. A very headstrong competitor dragged an eight-ton bus by his hair! ZAIN VERJEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT, LONDON: He did it by tying a screw at the back of his head and attaching that orange lead to the bus itself. It took a few minutes; he seemed like he was in a little pain. AZUZ: Of course, it's painful to look at! But the 70-foot distance was enough for a record and a headache, tying up our latest trip Off the Beaten Path! (END VIDEO) Goodbye . AZUZ: The bus probably deserves as much the record as much as the guy does, but who are we to split hairs. We'll brush that one off and return on Monday. We hope you have a great weekend.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Today's show is dedicated to Ms. Willard's world geography classes at Lumberport Middle School in Lumberport, West Virginia! Welcome everyone! First Up: Financial Markets . AZUZ: An overhaul of the rules for the country's banks. President Obama says that's what's needed to avoid another economic crisis. He made the statement during a speech on Wall Street yesterday. But some lawmakers and economic experts disagree with some of the president's proposals, like a federal agency that Mr. Obama says would be responsible for protecting consumers. Ben Bernanke, who heads up the country's central bank, says that's what his organization does, so a new agency isn't necessary. The timing of the speech came on the one-year anniversary of the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history! President Obama says America's financial industry needs to learn from past mistakes to avoid future crises. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: One year ago, we saw in stark relief how markets can spin out of control, how a lack of common-sense rules can lead to excess and abuse, how close we can come to the brink. One year later, it is incumbent upon us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this kind of crisis from ever happening again, reflecting painful but important lessons that we've learned and that will help us move from a period of reckless irresponsibility, a period of crisis, to one of responsibility and prosperity. H1N1 Vaccine . AZUZ: From regulation to inoculation, health officials say a vaccine for the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, could be ready in a few weeks. That's earlier than expected. More good news: Researchers say one shot should be enough; originally, they thought it would take two. Experts say certain groups, including students, should get the vaccine. It takes a little more than a week for it to take effect. Shoutout . GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which of these bodies of water is located in northern Israel? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it the: A) Sea of Galilee, B) Dead Sea, C) Red Sea or the D) Caspian Sea? You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find the Sea of Galilee in the northeast part of the Middle Eastern nation. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Ancient Discovery . AZUZ: And that's where archaeologists have made a religously significant discovery. Today, the Galilee region is known as a tourist spot with a lot of resorts. But a couple thousand years ago, it played a big role in two world religions. And now, scientists have uncovered a piece of that history. Here's Paula Hancocks... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: On the shores of the Sea of Galilee, a discovery that should excite both Jews and Christians. Israeli archeologists say they've found one of the world's oldest synagogues, from the time of Jesus and in the neighborhood of Jesus. DINA AVSHALOM-GORNI, EXCAVATION DIRECTOR: It is possible to think that Jesus was sitting here with his community in this synagogue, praying together with Mary Magdalene. HANCOCKS: The Bible documents Jesus' time at the Sea of Galilee, and Mary Magdelene is believed to have lived close by this site. The ruins date back some 2,000 years, and may not have been unearthed at all if it weren't for construction starting on the foundations of a hotel planned for this spot. For these archaeologists, the date is crucial, as they believe this synagogue was operational at the time of the Second Temple, the main synagogue in Jerusalem, and has a preserved, seven-branched menorah. AVSHALOM-GORNI: We can see very nicely the curve of the menorah, which would presume exactly in the right temple, at the temple at this time. HANCOCKS: Excavation is continuing, and already plans are underway to open the synagogue to the public. YOSSI STEPANSKI, ARCHAEOLOGIST: This is certainly the most elaborate one, with a mosaic floor with frescoes. We have walls here that are painted with frescoes. This is really the first time that an elaborate, beautifully decorated synagogue from that time has been discovered. HANCOCKS: Building plans for the hotel have obviously had to change, but this discovery could well attract far more visitors than a hotel ever could. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEO CLIP) Word to the Wise . RAMSAY: A Word to the Wise... matriculation (noun) enrollment, especially in a college or university . source: www.m-w.com . Detour to College . AZUZ: This year, matriculation has come at a higher price, literally. The average cost of tuition at a four-year public college is up more than six percent. Public versus private, in-state versus out-of-state: Different schools come with different price tags. And for many families, college choices can mean tough choices. Fredericka Whitfield has one student's story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR, CNN NEWSROOM: Move-in day for college freshman Pressley Chakales to a place she never expected would bring so much happiness and harmony. PRESSLEY CHAKALES, UGA FRESHMAN: I've been working all day getting my room together. But I like it, I'm excited . WHITFIELD: Also excited: her parents Peter and Ann. PETER CHAKALES, FATHER: This is like a ride to a suburb when you live in Atlanta, so she's close. WHITFIELD: But the hour-long ride to the University of Georgia in Athens didn't come without detours. Like thousands of American households on tighter budgets, savings and 401Ks taking double digit losses, family plans are forced to be flexible. PRESSLEY CHAKALES: I was really, really completely set on going out of state. WHITFIELD: Oh, we remember. We first met the Chakales last spring. College acceptance letters were coming in, along with the prospect of a full scholarship available to Georgia students with a 3.0 GPA or higher planning to attend an in-state school. But at the time, Pressley and her parents were not seeing eye to eye. WHITFIELD: So, your heart tells you one thing, but the purse strings tell you another. PRESSLEY CHAKALES: Yeah, definitely. WHITFIELD: So, what are these conversations like with mom and dad when you all try to come to grips about a happy medium? PRESSLEY CHAKALES: They can get heated. WHITFIELD: That was last March. Now? PRESSLEY CHAKALES: I ended up getting into UGA off the wait-list, and my decision immediately changed to back in-state, because I was going to UNC Wilmington, but I switched back to UGA to save an indescribable amount of money. WHITFIELD: A huge relief for her parents. Even though they spent years saving for her higher education, the thought of unloading at least $25,000 a year for four years of out-of-state undergrad was stressful beyond words. PETER CHAKALES: Well, it would have been very tough. It was frightening. The financial part was absolutely frightening. WHITFIELD: Staying in-state, able to benefit from that Georgia full academic scholarship cut their expenses by more than half. Out of pocket now: $10,000 a year for Pressley's housing, books and other fees. The benefits of their family decision: endless. ANN CHAKALES, MOTHER: I think she'll be able to study abroad for a semester if she wants to, and that probably would not have happened if she had gone out of state. WHITFIELD: The Chakales are confident Pressley will maintain a 3.0 or better to keep the state scholarship until graduation. But the family savings plan continues. In three years, it'll be Pressley's younger brother's turn. ANN CHAKALES: We will probably start prepping our son a little bit earlier. WHITFIELD: In hopes that he, too, qualifies for the same kind of in-state help. Fredricka Whitfield, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEO CLIP) Public Outbursts . KANYE WEST: I'm really happy for your, I'm gonna let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time! AZUZ: The most talked-about moment from the MTV Video Music Awards was not part of the script: Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift's acceptance speech to announce who he thought should have won. The backlash against West has been fast, and heated. This isn't the only recent outburst from people in the public eye. You might have heard about tennis star Serena Williams being docked a point for her outburst during the U.S. Open, and U.S. Representative Joe Wilson yelling out during President Obama's recent address to Congress on health care reform. Promo . AZUZ: All three have apologized; Kanye did it on his blog. But what we're asking on ours is, are these outbursts appropriate? Are they disrespectful? When and how is it okay to express your disagreement with something? Tell us your opinion at CNNStudentNews.com. Before We Go . AZUZ: Finally, mark your calendars: CNN Student News is celebrating its 20th anniversary on September 25th. As a sneak preview for you, here's a look back at the past two decades.

Making the Vaccine - Visit a Chinese laboratory to see how an H1N1 vaccine is produced. Constitution Day - Test your knowledge of some facts found in the U.S. Constitution. Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A big day for democracy. The reason why is coming up in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hi, everyone. I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care Debate . AZUZ: We start in Washington, where the release of a new proposal is giving a boost to the debate over health care reform. Senator Max Baucus, who heads up the Senate Finance Committee, unveiled a long-awaited plan yesterday after months of negotiations. Check out some of the details: It would cost $856 billion over 10 years, and it would require that every American have insurance coverage by the year 2013. It does not include a government-run insurance program, the so-called ""public option."" Instead, it focuses on the idea of health care cooperatives, which would give coverage to members. This is just one of the proposals that's been offered by lawmakers. You can compare some of them by checking out our home page, CNNStudentNews.com. Sen. Baucus thinks his proposal does have the best shot at getting passed. SEN. MAX BAUCUS, (D) MONTANA: No Republican has offered his or her support at this moment. But I think by the time we get the final passage in this committee, you'll find Republican support. AZUZ: That might be a challenge. House Minority Leader John Boehner said the proposal ""is the wrong prescription during these tough economic times."" Some Democrats are split on the plan as well. One said the proposal ""takes real steps to bring down the cost of health care."" But another argued that any plan that doesn't include the public option would be considered ""dead on arrival."" Blog Report . AZUZ: Your voices now. Last week, we asked you after the president's health care speech -- and the Republican response -- to weigh in on this debate. Kirby believes that ""public health care should be as much a right for every citizen as education and the ability to vote."" But Brittany writes that ""the money for reform would be coming out of people's taxes, and in the end, that means we're the ones paying for everyone else's health care."" From Steve: ""Many Americans don't have the money to pay for good health insurance. President Obama's address gave Americans an idea of how a government health plan could help alleviate the stress of dealing with insurance companies."" From Nicole: ""There are people out there that don't work and don't care if they have any health care. Making the hard-working, middle-class people pay taxes to cover those people just isn't fair."" Strong comments all around, y'all! Is this Legit? MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Japan's prime minister is usually determined by the country's parliamentary elections. This one's true! Japan's constitution requires that the prime minister be in charge of the majority group in parliament. Japan's Prime Minister . AZUZ: And since a recent election changed which party is in power, the country has a new prime minister: Yukio Hatoyama, whose Democratic Party of Japan claimed a huge victory in last month's vote. This win marks the first time in nearly half a century that control of Japan's government is changing hands. Hatoyama, who was officially named prime minister yesterday, promised change during his campaign. He says he knows he is taking on an immense responsibility. Japan's economy is coming out of its worst recession in decades. Afghan Vote Recount . AZUZ: Heading to Afghanistan, where current President Hamid Karzai appears to have won more than 54 percent of the vote in last month's presidential election. We say ""appears"" because, while the votes have been counted, they haven't been certified, and that means the results aren't official. The Afghan Electoral Complaints Commission threw out 200,000 votes. And an outside group of observers says more than a million others, most of which are for Karzai, are suspicious. Karzai has criticized the outside group for making the announcement. He says it's not their responsibility to address electoral complaints. Making the Vaccine . AZUZ: From votes to vaccines. We've reported on the government's efforts to produce one for the H1N1 virus and this week's news that it should be ready sooner than expected. However, the U.S. isn't the only country preparing to fight a potential outbreak. A lab in China is already developing doses of the H1N1 vaccine. Emily Chang takes us through the process. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMILY CHANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT, BEIJING: This is Sinovac headquarters, the first company in the world to successfully complete clinical trials for an H1N1 vaccine. They've taken our temperatures, we've been asked to wear these lab coats and shoe covers, and we're going to go into the production line and see exactly how this vaccine is made. This is the very first stage of the process. Every day, tens of thousands of fertilized eggs come in. They're incubated for a certain period time, then they are inspected, and then they are infected with the H1N1 virus. After three more days, the virus is then extracted and used to make the vaccine. All of the infected eggs come in on a conveyer belt. They are sliced open and then the virus is harvested. The virus is then rendered inactive and stored for the next part of the process. Inside all these jugs is the H1N1 virus. At this stage, they're collecting the virus and preparing it for purification. And here is the final product. Inside this vial is a vaccine for the H1N1 virus. It's a one-time vaccine. And right here, they are being bottled and labeled and boxed. All of the vaccines will be sent in refrigrerated trucks across China to fulfill government orders. They do need to be kept at a certain temperature, between two and eight degrees Celsius. So far, millions of vaccines have been ordered, and there's more on the way. Emily Chang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout . WRIGHT: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Shadid's U.S. government class at Clark High School in Las Vegas, Nevada! About how many people live in the United States? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) 276 million, B) 307 million, C) 368 million or D) 412 million? You've got three seconds -- GO! There are an estimated 307 million people living in the U.S. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Facebook . AZUZ: Believe it or not, that's about the same number of people who are on Facebook... give or take a few million. Holy cow! The social networking site announced that it crossed the 300 million mark this week. It added that about 70 percent of those users actually live outside the U.S. Even bigger news: Facebook has turned a profit for the first time in the company's history. It didn't expect to do that until 2010. Pretty impressive for a Web site that started out just for college students. Promo . AZUZ: We're not up to 300 million fans -- yet -- but our Facebook page is growing, and it's all thanks to you. If you haven't had a chance to stop by recently, head to Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews. Constitution Day . AZUZ: ""We the people."" Simple words, but they're the start of one of the most important documents in American history: the U.S. Constitution. Who can be elected to office, how laws are made, what rights we have as citizens: This thing is basically the guidebook for our government. And today is its birthday. To celebrate, we're giving a pop quiz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ: The U.S. Constitution turns 222 today, so we should all know it pretty well by now. Let's find out just how well! First up: Which part of the Constitution gives all lawmaking powers to Congress? Article II, section I; the Second Amendment; Article I, section I or the Tenth Amendment? It's the first section of the first article that gives legislative powers to Congress and establishes the Senate and the House of Representatives. Here's another shot: What's the minimum age of the U.S. president? 21, 26, 30, 35? Article II, Section I says you've got to be at least 35 years old. Who has the power to set and collect income taxes? The president, the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, Congress? It was the 16th Amendment that gave Congress the power to tax, though those taxes were a lot less when that amendment was ratified than they are today. When does the Constitution say that court judges will hold their offices? After working as lawyers, during good behavior, while in good health, in even-numbered years? Article III, Section 1 says that court judges ""shall hold their offices during good behavior."" Okay, last one! Which of these phrases doesn't actually appear in the Bill of Rights: ""separation of church and state,"" ""cruel and unusual punishments,"" ""unreasonable searches and seizures,"" ""right to a speedy and public trial""? The phrase ""separation of church and state"" doesn't appear in the Constitution; it was how Thomas Jefferson described the First Amendment. That completes your Constitution Quiz! Before We Go .

Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. NATISHA LANCE, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A member of the military is making history. We'll explain how in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hi, everyone. Carl Azuz is off this week. I'm Natisha Lance. First Up: Afghan Crashes . LANCE: First up, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The countries share a border, and they also share a common problem: threats from militant groups and terrorists like the Taliban and al Qaeda. It's an issue facing both nations' governments, and one that the U.S. government is concerned about as well. That's why President Obama has been holding a series of meetings with some of his advisers. They're reviewing the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Samantha Hayes has the latest on those meetings and on the violence in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Two helicopter crashes make it the deadliest day in four years for Americans in Afghanistan. While a NATO security force spokesman says enemy fire is not to blame, the loss of 14 Americans comes while President Barack Obama is considering a request to send thousands more troops to the region to fight al Qaeda. The president addressed service men and women in Jacksonville, Florida Monday, after a White House meeting with his national security team. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Fourteen Americans gave their lives, and our prayers are with these service members, their civilian colleagues and the families who loved them. HAYES: The deadliest of the two crashes happened following a raid on suspected drug traffickers, and three DEA agents were among those killed. Also among the dead, three U.S. civilians, members of the embassy community. The State Department says the efforts of civilians and other nonmilitary personnel are essential to the overall mission. JACOB LEW, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: Improving Afghan governance, providing security, justice, jobs and services, and giving the Afghan people a meaningful alternative, as much as possible, to the Taliban's recruiting. HAYES: Democratic Senator John Kerry, off of a recent trip to the region, addressed those efforts and the U.S. relationship with the Afghan government in a Washington speech. SEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: The fact that the Afghan government has not prosecuted a single high level drug trafficker damages all of our efforts because it goes to the fundamental question of credibility. HAYES: President Obama's White House meeting was the sixth in a series of high-level discussions about what to do in Afghanistan, as the administration awaits results from that country's November 7th presidential runoff. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes. (END VIDEO) I.D. Me . CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in 1939 in Searchlight, Nevada. I was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, and I'm currently the Senate Majority Leader, which means I'm the highest ranking member of the Senate's majority party. I'm Harry Reid, a Democrat who is the senior senator from Nevada. Public Option . LANCE: And in that role as majority leader, it's Sen. Reid's job to help combine health care bills from different committees into a single bill that can be presented to the entire Senate. Yesterday, Sen. Reid announced that the combined bill will include a government-run health care program; what's been called the public option. During his announcement, Reid also said that the bill will let individual states choose not to take part in the public option. They would have until the year 2014 to make that decision. This has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate over health care reform. Critics argue that if companies use the public option, then some people might lose the health care coverage that they currently have and are happy with. But Sen. Reid believes it's an important part of the reform. SEN. HARRY REID, (D-NV) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I believe that the public option can achieve a goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system. It will protect consumers, keep insurers honest, ensure competition, and that's why we intend to include it in the bill that we submitted, that will be submitted to the Senate. Tea Party Protests . LANCE: Meanwhile, the Tea Party Express is back on the road, protesting issues like government involvement in health care. The Express, which is named for both the organization and its bus, launched a new tour Sunday in California with rallies in San Diego and Los Angeles, where some people actually showed up to protest the Tea Party protesters. The Express plans to hold demonstrations in dozens of cities over the next several weeks. One of the group's main goals is the push for less government involvement, and these rallies also aim to give people who feel that way an opportunity to express their views. CHRIS KEAYS, TEA PARTY PROTESTER: We need to get back to the days when we were responsible and we assumed the responsibility of ourselves and our families, and the government is not a part of my daily life. I really resent the government taking up so much of my time that I'm down here having to protest right now. New Jobs Outlook . LANCE: And some potentially good news for the U.S. economy: A new survey indicates that companies are planning to hire more employees in the very near future. The report from the National Association of Business Economics says for the first time since the recession started nearly two years ago, the number of employers planning to hire workers over the next six months is higher than the number of jobs that are expected to be cut during that same time. The country's current unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. That's the highest the statistic has been in more than a quarter century. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What base is home to the U.S. Army's Drill Sergeant School? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Fort Bragg, B) Fort Hood, C) Fort Jackson or D) Fort Knox? You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find the Army's Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Top Drill Sergeant . LANCE: Drill sergeants are responsible for training tens of thousands of soldiers every year. And the head of the Drill Sergeant School, its commandant, is responsible for training them. The current commandant broke new ground when she took over the position last month because she's the first she to head up the school. Jason Carroll introduces us to this trailblazing soldier. (BEGIN VIDEO) JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Historically, this is the image of the military drill sergeant: a tough guy. That was then; this is now. At 48, Command Sergeant Major Teresa King is the first woman to lead the Army's Drill Sergeant Training School. What are you looking for? I mean, because it all pretty much looks like everybody's exercising to me. CMD. SGT. MAJOR TERESA KING: I'm looking for attention to detail, conformance. CARROLL: Before sunrise at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, King readies her drill instructor candidates for a rigorous run. What's wrong with that? KING: That's too big, Top. You need to break it up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fall out! CARROLL: She leads by example. King runs the five-mile course from the front of the pack, outperforming men half her age. STAFF SGT. LERON DELANEY, U.S. ARMY: She's older than me, so if I fall out and she's still running, I feel bad. CARROLL: Extinguishing those who think a woman can't be commandant. SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL CHILDS, U.S. ARMY: We've got to stay on top of our game even more than we used to with her, because she's that sharp. CARROLL: King says she wakes up some mornings still shocked she is commandant. KING: I had never considered it, although I've been in training for about seven years. But I never considered it, the Drill Sergeant School. CARROLL: King's first Army job some 30 years ago was postal clerk, but her hero, General George Patton, inspired her. KING: I saw that he had the respect of his men. And I saw he was resolute. CARROLL: King eventually rose through the ranks, excelling at training infantry men and paratroopers alike. KING: I'm doing what I've always done. It's just now, people are paying attention to it. CARROLL: And to her opinions. The military prohibits women from serving in front line combat roles. King trains men for combat and thinks it's time to train qualified women. KING: I think if they can do it, they should be allowed to do it. CARROLL: The reality: Women make up 14 percent of active soldiers in the Army. Some women question how many others will follow in King's footsteps. OPERATIONS SGT. ANGELA ANDREWS, U.S. ARMY: I wouldn't say it opens the door, but it may crack it somewhat. CARROLL: King says she will continue to lead by example. KING: I have vision. And I believe I can cause people to do some things that they thought they never could do. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, some science projects can balloon out of control. Which was the whole point of this experiment in Indiana. College students filled this high altitude balloon with helium and then let it fly away. The thing actually climbed 90,000 feet before... awww. Looks like their bubble burst. Actually, they knew it would. The cameras and sensors inside the balloon gently parachuted back to the ground. So in the end, the experiment was a total success. Goodbye . AZUZ: Just don't tell that to the students. We wouldn't want them to get an inflated ego. That's all the time we have for today.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: On HLN, online, on iTunes. However you're watching us, thanks for checking out CNN Student News. Bringing you today's headlines, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Terror Charge . AZUZ: First up, authorities have charged a man in Massachusetts with planning to provide material support to terrorists overseas. The U.S. attorney for Massachusetts says Tarek Mehanna tried to get training from the Taliban and hoped to attack members of the U.S. government. The official added that those people were never in any danger. The U.S. attorney claims that Mehanna, who you see in this file video, was involved in this conspiracy that lasted for about seven years. If he's convicted on the material support charge, Mehanna could face up to 15 years in prison. TARP Report . AZUZ: A new report says last year's $700 billion could cost the government more than just money. Neil Barofsky, who oversees the program for the Treasury Department, says it could damage the government's reputation with taxpayers, and there's also a risk of rewarding companies that took big chances. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, was passed following last year's financial crisis. Its goal was to help struggling banks and companies. So far, about 17 percent of the loans that were given out as part of TARP have been repaid. IAEA Talks . AZUZ: Iran has signed off on an agreement to send some of the uranium it makes to other countries for further enrichment. This was the result of talks between Iran, the U.S., France, Russia and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran says part of the reason it accepted the deal was to prove that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful purposes. Other nations have accused the Middle Eastern country of trying to develop nuclear weapons. Afghan Runoff Problems . AZUZ: President Obama says that the U.S. will continue to work with the Afghan government no matter who wins that country's runoff election next month. As we told you about yesterday, the leading candidates from August's election are going to take part in the runoff on November 7th. But as Chris Lawrence explains, there are some potential problems in putting together an election that soon. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Afghanistan is trying to pull off an election on little more than two weeks' official notice. And these are the problems it's facing: logistics, lack of awareness, fraud and fear. DR. ABDULLAH ABDULLAH, AFGHANISTAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The people of Afghanistan were threatened. They lost their fingers in the last round of elections. LAWRENCE: Ink-stained fingers were proof of voting, which made them targets of the Taliban. But a U.S. defense official says there are more American and Afghan troops in place now than in August. And a U.N. official says they're reducing the number of polling stations so security teams won't be spread so thin. On Thursday, the U.N. is launching TV and radio spots, trying to make voters aware there is another election. It's not a given that people know; less than 30% of Afghans can read. A high turnout and a safe election. Those are fine goals for politicians and officials to have. But what about the Afghan people, the ones who may be risking their lives to come out again to cast their vote? We found mixed opinions in this crowded Kabul market. MAN ON THE STREET: We want to build up our country. So despite the problems, I will go to vote in the next election. LAWRENCE: Officials threw out more than a million votes because of suspected fraud. And now, a European Union official says there will be far fewer election monitors for the runoff because the EU can't deploy them all on such short notice. LAWRENCE: Do you trust that your vote will be counted fairly? HABIB HAKIM, KABUL RESIDENT: Uhhh, I don't think so. LAWRENCE: And Habib Hakim can't see how President Karzai or his challenger will improve security. HAKIM: And I'm not sure Dr. Abdullah Abdullah will be able to stop the insurgency in Afghanistan, or at least to limit the level of insurgency in Afghanistan. LAWRENCE: At the least, they want to limit the reach of that insurgency on election day. Chris Lawrence, CNN, Kabul. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Who is the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Kathleen Sebelius, B) Thomas Vilsack, C) Janet Napolitano or D) Timothy Geithner? You've got three seconds -- GO! Kathleen Sebelius heads up the Health and Human Services Department, which is responsible for protecting Americans' health. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! H1N1 Response . AZUZ: And that puts Secretary Sebelius in charge of the U.S. response to H1N1. Sebelius, who was recently treated for skin cancer above her eye, talked to a Senate committee yesterday about some of the differences between H1N1 and the seasonal flu. U.S. SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: Half the hospitalizations for flu-like illness are for people under the age of 25; very different picture than seasonal flu. Nearly 90 percent of the deaths from H1N1 are among people under 65. Again, a very different picture than seasonal flu, where 90% of the deaths year in and year out are for Americans over the age of 65. AZUZ: The World Health Organization has classified H1N1 as a pandemic because of how far this thing has spread around the world. CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen shows us how germs like the H1N1 virus can transfer from person to person. (BEGIN VIDEO) ELIZABETH COHEN, SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Let's pretend that you and I are going to get on the subway. We stand in line at this kiosk, and let's say I'm sick. I go like this, I touch this, you're right behind me, now it's your turn. DR. RHONDA MEDOWS, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH: And I'm not so happy with you right now. What happens is, and commonly it happens every single day, is that people who have different illnesses, different symptoms, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sinus infections, whatever, do the same thing you just did without even thinking about it. H1N1 virus can live on an inanimate object for 2-8 hours. This is a virus that our bodies have never seen before, so all those people who have touched it, if they have H1N1, they have no immunity and neither do you. And this is where the adventure actually starts . COHEN: So, we are now standing behind a whole bunch of people. If one of them were sick and sneezed, could we get sick? MEDOWS: Yes, we can. COHEN: Even at this distance? MEDOWS: It's less than six feet. So that spray, the air droplet spray, could actually come into your being. You're inhaling, you're breathing respiratory droplets. (END VIDEO) No More Fountains . AZUZ: A few moments ago you heard Secretary Sebelius mention it. The H1N1 virus seems to be affecting large numbers of people your age. In order to keep it from spreading, some schools have temporarily shut down, while one Kansas school district is planning to shut down drinking fountains. Students are being urged to bring their own water to class. School officials are even propping doors open to try and keep the handles and the students germ free. Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... tuition (noun) a charge or fee for instruction, specifically at a private school, college or university . source: www.dictionary.com . College Costs . AZUZ: You know you have to pay tuition when you go to college. But universities get money from alumni and states as well. And when that money decreases, due to a recession, for example, the tuition you pay can increase. For a lot of people, what you can afford is a big part of determining where you're gonna go. And right now, tuition costs are higher than ever. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: Higher education is coming with a higher price tag. Unlike housing in America, college is a serious seller's market. PATRICK CALLAN, NATIONAL CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY & HIGHER EDUCATION: Both the cost and price of higher education have gone up faster than almost anything else in the American economy for 25 years. AZUZ: So, how much money are we talking? According to a new survey by the College Board, if you're planning to go to a public, four-year university in your own state, you're looking at a 6.5 percent increase to around $7,000 dollars per year just for tuition and fees. Public schools in another state: 6.2 percent increase, or more than $18,500 tuition. Private schools: 4.4 percent increase, more than $26,000 per year, tuition. I keep saying ""tuition"" because room and board in each of these categories is also going up, making the yearly totals even more expensive. There is a silver lining, though. About two-thirds of full-time students are getting help in the form of financial aid. And that doesn't have to be paid back. Fine. But what about the third that doesn't get financial aid? Student loans often come into play here, and not surprisingly, borrowing went up five percent for the '08-'09 academic year. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go today, we're talking about video games. They're not just for young people. This bowling tournament is strictly for seniors and it's all about the Wii. About 600 older rollers took to the virtual lanes at this tournament recently in Texas. The goal of these gamers wasn't just to set a world record -- which they did. The event was also designed to encourage seniors to stay fit in order to avoid injuries. Goodbye . AZUZ: Plus, it looks like everyone had a Wii-ly good time. Aw yeah, that's how we roll.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong is on high alert after an Indonesian domestic helper contracted the city's first human case of H7N9 avian flu, the city's government says. The 36-year-old maid is in hospital in a critical condition, Ko Wing-man, Hong Kong's secretary for food and health said in a statement. The woman had recently traveled to Shenzhen, the mainland Chinese city nearest to Hong Kong, where she bought, slaughtered and ate a chicken, Ko added. Her close contacts have also been isolated in hospital. What to know about avian flu . Ko said that Hong Kong had raised its level of preparedness for an influenza pandemic to ""serious."" Human infections from the H7N9 strain of bird flu first emerged in Shanghai in March this year and within weeks more than 100 cases were confirmed, according to the World Health Organization. Study finds evidence of first human-to-human transmission of H7N9 bird flu . However, the number of cases dropped dramatically after the closing of live poultry markets in affected areas, the WHO said. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, it added. As of November 6, the WHO said it had been informed of a total of 139 laboratory-confirmed human cases of the H7N9 virus, including 45 deaths. From ducks to chickens to deadly virus . Ko said Hong Kong said it had suspended the import of live chickens from three farms in Shenzhen and would inspect Hong Kong chicken farms and poultry wholesale markets. Hong Kong takes the threat of new disease extremely seriously after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS first emerged in the city in 2003. The outbreak went on to infect 8,096 people and kill 744 worldwide.

"(CNN) -- When the Environmental Protection Agency announces new rules to protect the nation from the effects of carbon pollution on Monday, I'll take it as a walloping dose of hope. I say that not just because I'm the executive director of a national environmental organization, but because, like too many Americans -- like too many people worldwide -- I've already witnessed the effects of climate disruption. A month after Superstorm Sandy battered the eastern seaboard, I returned to Chadwick Beach, New Jersey. The quiet town where I grew up and my family still lives, was hard to recognize. Surging tides had flooded the first floors of almost every home and yards were piled high with storm-ruined couches, chairs, toys and appliances. The EPA's proposed first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants represent not only a huge step toward curbing the climate disruption that spurs this sort of mutant weather, but also an important milestone on the way to powering the nation with energy that will make our air and water cleaner and our families safer and healthier. It's no secret why these standards are urgently needed. The National Climate Assessment released last month laid out in sobering detail the range of problems the climate crisis is already triggering. We can still temper the severity of those problems, but only if we dramatically increase the pace of cutting carbon pollution during the next couple of decades. Focusing on power plants, which are our nation's single largest source of carbon pollution, is a common-sense and essential step that we can take right now. The urgency of avoiding the most severe problems for our climate is underscored by the disruption we have already seen. The effects of carbon pollution are no longer an abstraction. Heat waves, historic droughts, unprecedented wildfire seasons, and destructive storms have become the new norm, and the climate scientists and insurance companies that study these patterns meticulously aren't the only ones that have noticed. Real people are being hurt, and serious economic consequences are being felt -- whether you're talking about how drought threatens farmers in California and Iowa or how superstorms like Sandy have devastated entire communities (including my hometown in New Jersey). The unfortunate reality is that if you haven't already experienced extreme weather, odds are that you soon will. Robert Redford: Take the path to clean energy . Most Americans are unaware that the coal- and gas-fired power plants that emit such a huge percentage of our nation's carbon pollution currently have no limits whatsoever on how much carbon they can dump into our atmosphere. Thanks to the Clean Air Act, we currently limit how much mercury, arsenic, soot, and other air pollution power can come from power plants, yet when it comes to carbon pollution, power plants have been given a free pass. Common sense demands that we close that loophole as fast as possible, which is why a February 2014 poll found that 7 of 10 Americans are in favor of setting limits on carbon pollution from power plants. The EPA is now acting to curb this pollution because the Clean Air Act (which was passed by Congress) requires that it do so (as confirmed by the Supreme Court). But just because something is required by law (not to mention morally mandated) is not enough to guarantee it will actually happen. President Obama deserves huge credit for making these pollution limits part of his Climate Action Plan and directing his administration to act. As Obama has said, our responsibility doesn't end with cleaning up carbon pollution. We must also ensure that the transition from the most polluting power plants to cleaner technologies does not harm the working families and communities that may depend on them for jobs. Fortunately, we know that the same clean energy technologies that produce less carbon pollution can also create a new generation of clean energy jobs. The benefits of investments in wind and solar, for example, create three times as many jobs as investments in fossil fuels. We also know that controlling air pollution has historically more than paid for itself by reducing sick days, crop damage, health disasters and hospital visits. Since 1970, every dollar invested in compliance with Clean Air Act standards has yielded $4 to $8 in economic benefits. Some day soon, actuaries no doubt will put a dollar figure on the huge economic benefit of moving away from fossil fuels and toward a future that is powered entirely by clean, renewable, carbon-free sources. In the meantime, we know that coal pollution alone is responsible for more than 12,000 emergency room visits per year. Fracking for natural gas damages the land, pollutes our water and air, and risks the health of surrounding communities. Fortunately, renewable energy is up to the challenge of replacing those dirty fuels. In just the last three years, solar panels have gotten 60% cheaper and the price of wind energy has fallen more than 40%. Far from being expensive, clean energy is already beating both coal and natural gas on price in many parts of the country. Without question, curbing carbon pollution is an obligation that we owe to all the generations that will be forced to live with the consequences of the decisions we make today. Beyond that, though, it is an amazing opportunity to prosper right now. Already, far-sighted investors are recognizing the obvious -- that coal, oil and gas are 19th century fuels whose time has passed -- and putting their money into the renewable energy sources that are increasingly powering the 21st century. By creating these first-ever standards to clean up carbon pollution and make polluters take responsibility for the harm they cause, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving our nation toward the cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous future today's workers need and our children deserve.","Michael Brune: Many Americans have already witnessed effects of climate disruption .

"(CNN) -- From the moment I was admitted to my first psychiatric ward, I was desperate to get out. I hated the smell, the food, most of the staff, the routines, the magazines. I hated the sagging mattresses, the glassless funhouse mirrors, the furniture, the isolation rooms. But as much as I despised the place, there was one saving grace for me there: the other patients. Many had absolute horror stories. Stories of abuse, self-mutilation, combat, rape, starvation. Stories that made this liberal lawyer reconsider taking up criminal prosecution. But others had stories like mine. Happy childhoods. Mild traumas possibly but nothing extreme. In the end though, we were all the same. We were all seriously ill; we all desperately needed help, and we all resented the fact that we needed it. What's more, we were all acutely aware of the classified, top-secret nature of our conditions and whereabouts. This wasn't paranoia. It was self-preservation. People tend to look unfavorably upon the mentally ill, especially those of us who've ever been hospitalized. Nevertheless, some of the most brazen, brave and brilliant figures in history have struggled with sickness of the mind. Sadly, many have also died at their own hands because of those same sicknesses. From Vincent van Gogh to Sylvia Plath to Kurt Cobain to countless others. Like them, roughly 90 percent of those who take their own lives suffer from psychiatric illnesses. Thus, any efforts to combat suicide promise to fail miserably unless and until we begin to engage in more open and honest discussions surrounding mental illness. Not in whispers and not as gossip, but in strong and steady voices and as an issue that deserves as much attention, compassion and funding as cancer or HIV/AIDS or any other deadly disease. So on Friday, which is World Suicide Prevention Day, I am addressing the living in an effort to honor and respect the dead. I am asking those of you who have experience with mental illness to speak up, and I am asking those of you who have no such experience to hear us out. I know that it's not easy to speak in the midst of so much stigma or listen amid so much misinformation, but I assure you that it's worth it. The true sin of suicide is not the act itself. Rather, it is the insidious silence and insensitivity that surrounds so many of the most excruciating diseases of the mind that so often trigger suicide. The dangerous thing about silence is that it breeds shame and isolation, both of which can be much more devastating than any singular psychiatric condition alone. It's one thing to be crazy. It's quite another to think that you're the only crazy person on the planet. By the time I made it to the hospital, I felt more alone than ever. After months of unsuccessfully wrestling with a seemingly relentless bout of depression, I finally just gave up. Within a few days, I had a well-planned exit strategy in place: go far away from home, leave a note full of love and apologies, take a sharp knife to a femoral artery and do it outside so that no one would have to clean up the mess. But, as with most events involving life and death, things did not go according to plan. The reality of my suicide attempt couldn't have veered any further away from the fantasy of that clean, controlled and speedy departure. Ultimately, I slit my wrist on the floor of my psychiatrist's waiting room with a dismally dull pocketknife. Having bipolar disorder (also known as manic-depression) means not only that you can experience the opposing poles of mania and depression, but also that you can experience aspects of both concurrently. Translation: The ""poles"" don't always stay in place. In my case, my manic impulsivity had shattered the careful plans of my depressive deliberations and left me bleeding from the wrist on the floor of my psychiatrist's waiting room instead of from the leg on the floor of some faraway forest. Whatever the case, plan or no plan, by the grace of God, I failed miserably in my attempt. And today, thanks to a proper diagnosis, medication, therapy, health insurance, faith and a supportive family, I am well. And by that, I do not mean that I am cured. There is no cure for bipolar disorder, although there are many excellent treatments. Even with medication, therapy and lifestyle adjustments, I still have highs and lows that extend far beyond those of most everyone else I know, and I still occasionally suffer from acute bouts of depression, mania and mixed episodes that can and have landed me in the hospital. Nevertheless, since my unfortunate encounter with that pocketknife, I've yet to make any more attempts on my own life. Nor have I ever felt nearly as alone as I did upon my first hospitalization. Speaking openly about my mental illness and meeting other talented, creative and productive individuals who also happen to share similar circumstances has played an invaluable role in my healing. Entering that first psychiatric ward, I felt cut off from the earth, drowning in a sea of despair. All the people I loved -- all the sane, strong and sturdy people who wanted to save me -- were stuck on steady shore. But getting to the hospital was like noticing all these other people drowning around me -- all within reach. It wasn't just me in the abyss anymore, and now that I knew I wasn't alone, I had a reason to tread water. Killing myself meant I couldn't save them. Killing myself meant killing them. Suddenly, I had no choice. I had to swim. So, I swam to save the others, only to find, upon reaching the shore, that they had saved me. If you or someone you know is experiencing thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255.","Melody Moezzi writes about trying to kill herself .

"(CNN) -- Interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour sent a letter to the family of jailed Al Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy on Sunday telling him that Fahmy ""will enjoy all his rights guaranteed by Egyptian law."" Mansour also ordered Egypt's interior minister to follow up on Fahmy's health condition and ""to provide all possible care."" Fahmy, a former CNN producer, injured his shoulder before his arrest in December while working as bureau chief for Al Jazeera English in Cairo. He's complained about not getting proper medical treatment while in prison. He says that because of the lack of treatment, he no longer has full use of his right arm. On Saturday, Fahmy, escorted by heavily armed, balaclava-wearing guards, arrived at a civilian hospital for the first time for a shoulder scan. Friends and family talked to him through the steel mesh of a prisoner transport vehicle before he was taken inside, where they had more access. The visit by family and friends ""put him in a good mood,"" said Fahmy's fiancee, Marwa Abdel Magid. ""It's the first time I've seen him smile since he got arrested."" Fahmy, who was seen barely able to lift his arm during his examination, had MRI and CT scans at the hospital. He said he and his colleagues -- Al Jazeera correspondent Peter Greste and producer Baher Mohamed -- were in good spirits. They also now receive daily newspapers to alleviate the boredom while they wait for their trial to end. Fahmy said he wanted more time outside his windowless cell with his colleagues. He also wants his case resolved faster and more time with his lawyer than the 45 minutes he receives before each session. In the letter, the interim President promised to ""make sure the case is resolved quickly and that justice is achieved according to the law."" Fahmy, Greste and Mohamed have been detained for almost three months after security services raided their workspace at the Marriott hotel. The Egyptian government says they distorted their coverage in favor of ousted President Mohamed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood, which is designated a terrorist group in Egypt. They are on trial, charged with spreading false news and belonging to a terrorist organization, which Al Jazeera strongly denies. The case has been widely condemned internationally as an attack on free speech. Their trial will resume on March 31.","In a letter, Egypt's interim President reassures Mohamed Fahmy's family .

"(CNN) -- Tennis star Maria Sharapova has been handed the honor of becoming the first woman to carry Russia's flag at the opening ceremony of an Olympic Games. The 25-year-old will be competing in her first Olympics at London 2012, where she will play in the women's singles tournament. ""I wasn't aware that I am the first woman but what a personal honor to be representing Russia,"" she told CNN. ""I am grateful for the sincere support from my family, friends and fans from home and across the globe. I'm truly proud and humbled to represent a country that is full of hopes and dreams."" Sharapova has battled her way back to the top of women's tennis after two years of shoulder problems, returning to No. 1 in the world rankings after completing a career grand slam by winning last month's French Open. She lost top spot to Victoria Azarenka of Belarus this week after a surprise defeat in the fourth round at Wimbledon dropped her to No. 3, but has the chance to make amends as the Olympic event will also be held at the famous grass-court venue. ""This year's upcoming Olympics in London holds special meaning to me as this will be my first foray into the Games,"" Sharapova said. ""It's a remarkable opportunity to not only compete in such a historically prestigious sporting moment, but I am looking forward to sharing this Olympic experience with fellow athletes around the world."" Sharapova, who will reportedly marry basketball star Sasha Vujacic in November after the end of the tennis season, has been based in the United States for most of her life. She has played three times for Russia's Fed Cup team, all in quarterfinal ties, winning three of her four singles rubbers. Sharapova did not qualify for the 2004 Olympics in Beijing, despite winning her first grand slam title at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old. She missed out in Beijing in 2008 due to injury, and compatriot Elena Dementieva -- who has since retired -- won the women's gold. Russia first took part at the Summer Olympics in 1912, but did not appear again until 1952 as the Soviet Union. Since then the honor of carrying the flag has usually gone to male gold medal-winners. This year, Serbia and Spain will also have a tennis star as flag-bearer as men's world No. 2 Novak Djokovic and Beijing champion Rafael Nadal have been given the role by their respective countries.","Maria Sharapova named as Russia's first woman flag-bearer at Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Typhoon Megi marched toward southern China on Wednesday after leaving 11 people dead in the Philippines, prompting Chinese authorities to close train services in the region, state media said. Trains from Sanya to other provinces were canceled until Thursday, while trains heading from other provinces to Sanya will stop at Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, the Xinhua news agency reported. Megi may be the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, Xinhua said. It is expected to make landfall in Hainan or Guangdong province on Saturday, Xinhua said. The death toll in the Philippines from Megi has climbed to 11 as the powerful storm moved away from the country. According to civil defense officials, the fatalities were for various reasons, including falling trees, drowning and lightning. Parts of the Philippines could still be vulnerable to mudslides and landslides. The typhoon could approach Hong Kong and mainland China in the next few days. Megi is expected to lash Hainan and Vietnam. Southern provinces such as Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian are gearing up for heavy rains and strong winds, state media said.","At least 11 killed after the typhoon struck in the Philippines .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A former Whole Foods Market employee says he was fired because he is Muslim. Glenn Mack Jr. told reporters Tuesday that he experienced harassment by his supervisors because of his Islamic faith, resulting in his termination. A spokeswoman for the natural-food supermarket chain said the company denied Mack's allegations. Mack, 24, started working for Whole Foods in 2008. He was terminated in February 2011 for absenteeism, said his lawyer, Amara Chaudhry, with the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March, Chaudhry said, adding she will file an amended complaint in the next few weeks. Whole Foods Market spokeswoman Kate Lowery said the company ""cannot give out details about current or former team members due to privacy, but we deny these allegations."" ""It's well known that Whole Foods values and celebrates diversity,"" Lowery said, adding, ""We have a zero-tolerance discrimination policy, zero tolerance."" Mack said he had been well-liked at the Whole Foods location on Pennsylvania Avenue in Philadelphia. He said he was the community service liaison and had been chosen to run the employees' assistance fund designed to help ""team members in need."" Mack added he was also selected to meet Whole Foods Market co-founder and CEO John Mackey. The problems began, he said, after his supervisors learned he was using his approved vacation time for Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia during the last month of the Islamic calendar. Hajj represents the fifth and final ""pillar"" of Islam. Every Muslim who is physically and financially capable is expected to make the pilgrimage once in their lifetime. Mack said he had kept his Islamic faith a secret after overhearing comments that disturbed him. He said he requested time for the vacation two months in advance of the November 2010 trip. Prior to his vacation, his supervisors gave him a choice of keeping his job or going on the trip, he said. Mack was downgraded from full-time employment to part-time employee upon returning from the pilgrimage and before being terminated, he said. While working, he said he was followed by supervisors and watched when he went to pray in a storage room, and so began to complete his daily prayers outdoors near a trash dumpster. ""The fact that Glenn felt pressured or compelled to pray in the location that he did is not insignificant. A Muslim wouldn't do so unless under compelling circumstances or in a state of duress,"" Chaudhry, his attorney, said. Whole Foods works with its employees to accommodate special requests and has an open-door policy, Lowery said, adding the company has many Muslim employees in the Philadelphia and Mid-Atlantic regions. ""We are looking at this from every angle possible,"" Lowery said. A formal lawsuit has not been filed; however there is a pending matter before the EEOC and that has been cross-filed with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, Chaudhry said. Mack is seeking reinstatement and compensation for his termination, plus mandatory tolerance training for employees, Chaudhry said.","Glenn Mack Jr. worked at a Whole Foods Market store in Philadelphia .

"(CNN Student News) -- The foundation of a democratic republic is suffrage: the right to vote. Universal suffrage extends this civil right to all adults without distinction to race, sex, belief, intelligence or economic or social status. In the United States, almost all adult citizens over the age of 18 may vote in the presidential election. To this day, U.S. citizens who reside in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other U.S. territories do not vote in presidential elections, but may vote in local elections. Throughout America's history, certain groups of citizens were disenfranchised. Poll taxes, literacy requirements and physical barriers effectively removed these individuals from the voting pool. Court decisions, local legislation and Constitutional amendments overturned many of these conditions for voting. Milestones in American Suffrage . 1787 - The U.S. Constitution The Constitution, as originally written, did not define a citizen. Any citizen of a state was deemed a citizen of the nation. At the time, most states only granted the right to vote to white male property owners. By 1850, most landowner requirements were eliminated. 1865 - Amendment XIII In the aftermath of the Civil War, three amendments were ratified that expressly addressed the role of blacks in America: the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The Thirteenth Amendment was the first step towards full suffrage for black adult males, as it abolished slavery in the U.S. 1868 - Amendment XIV The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution defines the U.S. citizen, and thus clarifies who may vote: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" Children of immigrants, even illegal immigrants, are citizens and may vote when they come of age. However, this amendment does not expressly grant suffrage to non-whites and women. It does set the legal age for voting at 21. This amendment also allows a state to remove the right to vote for ""participation in rebellion, or other crime."" As a result, most states still ban incarcerated felons from voting, and several states extend that ban to ex-felons. 1870 - Amendment XV The Fifteenth Amendment forbids the federal government and the states from using a citizen's race, color or previous status as a slave as a disqualification for voting. By this amendment, suffrage is granted for black adult males, but not females. Many in the women's suffrage movement condemned the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments as unfair to women. 1920 - Amendment XIX By the turn of the century, women were voting in many western states, but most states still banned them from the voting booth. In 1920, after several failed attempts, the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. This amendment prohibits states or the federal government from restricting suffrage based on gender. 1961 - Amendment XXIII This amendment finally granted District of Columbia voters the ability to participate in presidential elections. 1964 - Amendment XXIV In the century that followed the Civil War, racial tension persisted. Five southern states still had a poll tax, which was eliminated by this amendment. The Supreme Court declared that even a $1.50 poll tax was an unfair burden. 1965 - The Voting Rights Act After blacks were granted the right to vote in 1871, literacy requirements, physical violence, property destruction, hiding the polls and economic pressures still kept many blacks from voting, particularly in the South. In some states, a voter could vote in primary elections only if his grandfather had been able to vote in primaries; other states only allowed whites to vote in the primaries. In the largely Democratic South, these laws prevented descendants of slaves from having an effective vote. The Voting Rights Act was enacted in direct response to the Civil Rights movement. The act bans literacy tests and provides federal enforcement of voter registration and voting rights. 1971 - Amendment XXVI During the Vietnam War, many Americans felt it was unfair to send citizens to fight a war without the right to vote. This amendment sets the voting age at 18 across the nation for all elections. 1975 - Voting Rights Act Reauthorization By 1972, most adult citizens of the U.S. had the right to vote based on provisions in the Constitution. Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1975 to include language assistance for minority voters, who often could not vote if ballots and instructions were only available in English. 1990 - Americans with Disabilities Act The ADA addressed the need for physical access to the ballot box for all Americans.

"(CNN Student News) -- World AIDS Day is observed around the globe on December 1. Since the first World AIDS Day in 1988, governments, organizations and charities have worked to raise awareness of the global AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection. Use the information in this One-Sheet to provide students with an overview about HIV and AIDS. How widespread is HIV/AIDS? The UNAIDS/WHO 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update notes that since 1981, when HIV/AIDS was first identified in the U.S., more than 25 million people worldwide have died from AIDS-related illnesses. It estimates that today, nearly 33.2 million people throughout the world are living with HIV. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that includes more than one million Americans. In 2007, more than 6,800 people around the world were newly diagnosed with HIV each day, and of those new cases, approximately 1,150 were children under the age of 15, according to the UNAIDS/WHO report. What is AIDS? AIDS is the acronym for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is a disease of the body's immune system that is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV. Having HIV is different from having AIDS. A person can have HIV for many years before developing AIDS. However, as HIV progresses, it kills off the body's CD4 cells (also known as T-cells or T-helper cells), a type of white blood cell that helps fight infection. When the immune system loses too many T-cells, it doesn't function normally and it can't fight off infections. As a result, people become vulnerable to many serious and often deadly infections and cancers. These types of illnesses are called ""opportunistic infections"" because they take advantage of the opportunity to attack the body's compromised immune system, the CDC says. You may have heard that people die from AIDS, but this isn't technically the case. People with AIDS die from the opportunistic infections that AIDS allows to take hold, not from AIDS itself. How are HIV and AIDS diagnosed? While some people who are infected with HIV experience chronic symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, weight loss, night sweats and swollen lymph nodes, others may not develop symptoms for many years, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The only way to tell if someone has HIV is with a blood test. If a person becomes infected with HIV, his or her body will try to fight the infection by making antibodies. If a blood test shows the presence of these antibodies, then the person is diagnosed as having HIV, and is considered ""HIV positive."" Likewise, you can't rely on symptoms to determine if someone has AIDS, because the symptoms of AIDS are similar to the symptoms of other diseases. In order to be diagnosed with AIDS, a person must be HIV positive and have a T-cell count below 200 (a normal count ranges from 500 to 1,800 per cubic millimeter of blood), or have one or more opportunistic infections, according to the CDC. How is HIV transmitted? HIV is found in blood, semen, vaginal fluid and breast milk. HIV can only be transmitted if one of these infected fluids enters the blood stream through contact with the mucous membranes, such as the mouth or vagina, or through direct contact, such as needle sticks or injections. According to the CDC, most people get HIV by: . What treatments are available? In the early days of the AIDS pandemic, patients were unlikely to live longer than two years after developing the disease, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. By studying the way that HIV attacks immune cells, scientists have developed drugs to fight both HIV and its associated infections and cancers. Used in combinations known as ""cocktails,"" these drugs have helped patients live much longer after being diagnosed with HIV. However, while these drugs can slow down HIV and damage to the immune system, there is no way to get rid of HIV. Though researchers are now testing vaccines to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, no vaccines have been approved for use outside of clinical trials, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. What can people do to prevent the spread of HIV? While there isn't a vaccine to prevent HIV infection or a cure for AIDS, people can protect themselves and others from infection. Experts from the Mayo Clinic recommend that people learn about how HIV is transmitted and avoid any behavior that allows HIV-infected fluids to get into your body. If you are HIV positive, it is important to refrain from unprotected sex and other high-risk behaviors that could infect others, according to the Mayo Clinic. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, experts recommend that you consult a doctor and get tested for the virus as soon as you are likely to develop HIV antibodies, which is within 6 weeks to 12 months after exposure, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Revolutionary forces attacked loyalist strongholds Friday in a failed attempt to snuff out continuing resistance from forces loyal to ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. In the fallen leader's hometown of Sirte, along the Mediterranean coast, anti-Gadhafi fighters pulled back Friday night after a day of chaotic, fierce street fighting. The number of casualties was unclear. A brigade of fighters from Misrata wrested control of the Al-Gurdabia military base and a civilian airport near the western edge of Sirte, according to the Misrata Military Council. Ali Gheliwan, a spokesman to the Misrata Military Council, said seven anti-Gadhafi fighters were killed and 31 wounded in Friday's fighting in Sirte. From the central city, anti-Gadhafi fighters retreated to the outskirts after troops loyal to Gadhafi put up strong resistance. Expected support from residents of Sirte did not materialize as loyalists fought house to house with an intensity that had not been anticipated. Revolutionary forces said they would try again Saturday. One of Gadhafi's sons, Mutassim, the regime's national security adviser, may have been coordinating the fighting in Sirte, according to Alm Hashi, a revolutionary fighter. He said Mutassim Gadhafi's voice crackled on the radio with orders for troops loyal to his father. The Syria-based pro-Gadhafi Arab channel al-Rai aired a phone call Friday from a man it identified as Musa Ibrahim, the Gadhafi spokesman, who said forces loyal to Gadhafi were prepared for a long war. ""We have the equipment and weaponry,"" he said. Meanwhile, in neighboring Niger, the government refused to heed the demand of Libya's National Transitional Council that it hand over regime officials who had fled there, including another of Gadhafi's sons. Saadi Gadhafi arrived Sunday in Niger, accompanied by eight regime officials ""of minor importance,"" Niger Justice Minister Marou Amadou said this week. Saadi Gadhafi is believed to be in a safehouse in the center of the capital, Niamey. Amadou said a transitional council delegation had yet to show up in Niger and his government was awaiting a ""specific"" request from the Libyans. The Niger government believes Gadhafi's family and loyalists could face the death penalty if they are returned to Libya, Amadou said. He said Niger is honoring its international obligations in accordance with the Geneva conventions. At least three convoys have entered Niger recently from Libya carrying family members and Gadhafi regime military and security personnel, officials in Niger said. And more than 200,000 Libyan refugees have crossed the border, the Niger government said. Amadou said his government is concerned that weapons from Libya could destabilize the region. The whereabouts of Moammar Gadhafi, wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity, were not known, said Ben Rhodes, the administration's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. ""I think our estimation is that there's no indication that he's left Libya,"" he told reporters Friday. ""I think what's perfectly clear is that that regime has collapsed, that they control very, very little territory in Libya. The opposition has fully consolidated control of Tripoli, for instance, and other major population centers. So we're confident that the Gadhafi regime has come to an end, but we'll continue to work with the TNC as they seek to bring Gadhafi to justice."" In Bani Walid, anti-Gadhafi forces launched an assault and, as in Sirte, the loyalists put up stiff resistance, said Hobab Jomaa, the media center director in Zawiya. Residents of the city, southeast of Tripoli, had been fleeing after being given 48 hours to leave. In southern Libya, convoys of pickup trucks loaded with arms and ammunition barreled toward Sabha  -- and the nearby towns of al-Birak and al-Qira, the hometown of Gadhafi's brother-in-law and intelligence chief Abdullah Al-Senussi. Al-Senussi and another Gadhafi son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, also are sought by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. Fighting was also fierce outside the southern city of Sabha. Two anti-Gadhafi fighters were killed, 22 were wounded, and nine Gadhafi fighters were captured, said Abdelssalam Khamis, head of the transitional council's medical mission around Sabha. An NTC fighter was killed and at least three were wounded Friday by a sniper in Birak, just north of Sabha, doctors said. Opposition commander Hmaida Al-Majri said NTC forces were in talks with anti-Gadhafi elders from villages around Sabha to arrange for an orderly and peaceful entry of NTC forces. He said field commanders had not decided when to move on Sabha. The fighters are facing dwindling ammunition supplies, particularly for the Soviet-era 14.5 anti-aircraft guns. The nearby airbase, variously known as Al-Jaloud or Al-Birak, has thousands of rounds for tanks and mortars, but not for the weaponry the anti-Gadhafi forces have. Supplies had been shipped from Tripoli and elsewhere in the north, but had not yet arrived. Commanders, including Al-Majri, told CNN they believe Gadhafi intelligence chief Abdallah Al-Senussi had left his hometown of Al-Gira, which was under NTC control, and moved to Sabha. The battle for Libya raged as the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution establishing a U.N. Support Mission in Libya. The mission's mandate is to help Libya extend state authority, protect human rights, support justice and take the steps needed to get the nation back on its feet economically.

"(CNN) -- The blue Chevy Cobalt broke down amid the mountains of Montana in an area where there was no cell phone reception. The Muslims in the car, on a cross-country journey for the holy month of Ramadan, approached a bushy-bearded fisherman. It would be another test of a question they wondered when they first set off from New York three weeks earlier: Is America still the accepting nation that embraced our forebears or has it reached a new level of intolerance? Far from the media frenzy dominating headlines, from the so-called ""ground zero mosque"" to a pastor's planned Quran burning, Aman Ali and Bassam Tariq traveled more than 13,000 miles into the heart of America over the last month, visiting 30 mosques in 30 days for Ramadan. They began in New York, headed south and then cut across the country to California before making their way back, ending today in Michigan in the nation's largest Muslim community. The fisherman in Montana became the embodiment of their trip -- Ali and Tariq were embraced nearly everywhere they went, from a Confederate souvenir shop in Georgia to the streets of Las Vegas, Nevada, to the hills of North Dakota where the nation's first mosque was built in 1929. Like any road trip, there were strange moments along the way: A Mississippi police officer quizzed them about their beliefs on the ground zero mosque and they were asked to leave a mosque in Mobile, Alabama. They chuckle about those experiences now and emphasize it shouldn't overshadow the whole trip because, ultimately, they discovered that America still embraces immigrants and the nation is filled with welcoming and loving people. Ride along on the Ramadan road trip . ""After 13,000 miles, I think that America still exists, and I'm happy to know that it does,"" said Tariq, a 23-year-old American of Pakistani descent. ""It's really made America feel like home to me in a way that I've never felt before. The America that we think about [as immigrants] is still actually there. I've seen it! And I'm seeing it still."" When he approached the fisherman after their car broke down, Tariq says, he didn't know how he'd be received. He asked if he could hitch a ride to town and the fisherman ""happily does it."" When the man asked Tariq what he was doing in Montana, he told him about their 30 mosques journey. ""And he doesn't flinch and doesn't get worried,"" Tariq said. ""For me, it was like, 'Wow! That America still exists.' "" He had a similar experience among Bosnian Muslims in Boise, Idaho, where it took 12 years for the community to build a mosque there ""with their bare hands."" He saw one man cry on entering the mosque. An elderly couple hugged each other when they walked inside. ""It means so much to these people who've been displaced from their own country, and they come here to this place of worship,"" he said. ""That, to me, is really what this country is about."" For Ali, his favorite moment was Ross, North Dakota, a blip of a town with a population of 48 people. He knew little of the town's rich Muslim history, and it was difficult to try to find someone in the town who did. A pastor directed them to a woman, who kindly pointed them down a dirt road to where the nation's first mosque once stood. It's no longer there. It's been replaced by a tiny cement block mosque, complete with a gold dome. Nearby, there's a cemetery marking the pioneering Muslims of America, with birth dates of 1882, 1904, 1931. Follow CNN's Belief Blog . Ali stood in awe. As he approached the mosque, his heart pounded. ""I knew our roots went deep in this country, but it was great to truly experience it. Praying in there was like hopping in a time machine,"" said Ali, a 25-year-old Muslim who was born in Columbus, Ohio. ""I literally felt like I was plummeting and falling."" His takeaway from the trip, he says, was seeing how Muslims in America have assimilated in their communities, from Jacksonville, Florida, to Wichita, Kansas, to Oklahoma City. ""It was really cool and refreshing to see people who genuinely love the communities they're in and they're there to stay,"" Ali said. ""They're involved in the community, not just the mosque."" It was also remarkable to have people, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, ""just bend over backwards and be friendly to us,"" he said. Tariq said their blog also helps the rest of America realize ""you have to accept Muslims are here in America to stay, and we've been here for awhile. Even the most bigoted person has to accept that."" As for what's next for the young men, they plan to celebrate Eid with their Muslim brethren in Dearborn, Michigan -- happy to have discovered an America that still embraces them, even if that's not always portrayed in the news media. ""It's a small but vocal group of Americans in this country pushing this anti-Muslim rhetoric,"" Ali said. ""And unfortunately in our society, whomever shouts the loudest is going to get the most air time.""","Two Muslims travel 13,000 miles to 30 mosques in 30 states for Ramadan .
They discover a nation -- not of intolerance -- but one that embraces them .

"Mesa, Arizona (CNN) -- It's been 26 days since the candidates left the stage at the last CNN debate in Jacksonville, Florida, and the growling hunger pangs of the media have grown louder even as the candidates grow weary. There have been 19 Republican presidential debates so far, and while some may have debate fatigue -- including a few candidates -- the forums have nevertheless proved to be illuminating experiences. They have garnered sky-high TV ratings and have become ""event"" television. They have helped to define several candidates while others fall from grace in front of the live cameras. But for many voters, it has been the debates -- especially those that have preceded a primary or caucuses -- that have become the deciding factor when they choose who they want as the GOP nominee. They have provided a window into each would-be nominee, and offered insights into how they act under pressure. According to exit polls, many voters make up their minds after watching a debate. What has made the debates the fuel to feed the media's insatiable yearning for political fare? The storylines that have emerged have made the events essential viewing for political junkies and casual observers alike. Remember a fiery Newt Gingrich pushing back on marriage accusations, a tough Mitt Romney hitting Rick Santorum hard on social issues, a passionate Ron Paul pressing the Obama administration on foreign wars. Michele Bachmann and the HPV vaccine. And then there was Herman Cain and 9-9-9 ... The debates return Wednesday night in Mesa, Arizona, as CNN partners with the Republican Party of Arizona to bring America the final debate before Super Tuesday, and what may be the final debate of the season. Ahead of Wednesday's showdown, here's a recap of the last six major CNN debates, and what they could mean for this week's episode: . Manchester, New Hampshire, June 13 . Biggest storyline: Before Rick Perry had even entered the race, seven GOP candidates debated in the first offering to feature all major candidates. Rep. Michele Bachmann established herself as a major player, while former Gov. Tim Pawlenty gave a subdued performance, refusing to attack Mitt Romney. Key moments: ""Using the term 'Obamneycare' was a reflection of the president's comments that he designed Obamacare on the Massachusetts health care plan."" -- Pawlenty. ""I filed today my paperwork to seek the office of the presidency of the United States today."" -- Bachmann. Post-debate fallout: Bachmann's strong performance started a surge that culminated with the Iowa straw poll victory. Pawlenty's weak showing started his spiral downward, ending with him dropping out of the race and endorsing Romney. Tampa, Florida, September 12 . Biggest storyline: In a debate co-sponsored by elements of the tea party movement, Perry may have been the front-runner coming in, but he was hammered by Bachmann and Rick Santorum over the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Key moments: ""To have innocent little 12-year-old girls to be forced to have government injections through an executive order is just flat-out wrong."" -- Bachmann . Post-debate fallout: Perry's standing as the front-runner took an immediate and dramatic hit, with Romney taking over. Perry fell from 41% before the debate to 14%, with Romney moving from 28% to 51%. Las Vegas, October 18 . Biggest storyline: Herman Cain's sudden surge to the front of the pack was set in stone as he hammered home the 9-9-9 plan. His rivals attacked. Key moment: ""The reason that our plan is being attacked so much is because lobbyists, accountants, politicians -- they don't want to throw out the current tax code and put in something that's simple and fair."" -- Cain. Post-debate fallout: Cain's surge came to an end, as far more scrutiny came to the 9-9-9 plan directly after the debate (as well as other, personal, issues). Also, the sparring between Romney and Rick Santorum was a sign of things to come between the two. Washington, November 22 . Biggest storyline: A debate that focused on foreign policy saw Newt Gingrich open himself up to a potential problem over amnesty, while his rivals pounced. Meanwhile, Rep. Ron Paul established himself as the man on an island when it came to some major GOP issues. Key moment: ""I am prepared to take the heat for saying let's be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship, but finding a way to give them legality so as not to separate them from their families."" -- Gingrich. (He did.) Post-debate fallout: Gingrich's surge continued, but rivals focused on this perceived weakness going forward. Meanwhile, Cain established a new nickname: ""Blitz."" Charleston, South Carolina, January 19 . Biggest storyline: What may be one of the most memorable debate moments of the cycle occurred right off the top, with Gingrich attacking the media over claims made by his ex-wife. Santorum also took an opportunity to take on Gingrich over his ""grandiose"" ideas. Key moments: ""I am tired of the elite media protecting Barack Obama by attacking Republicans."" -- Gingrich. ""Grandiosity has never been a problem with Newt Gingrich."" -- Santorum. Post-debate fallout: A standing ovation from the crowd signaled the wave of support that was to come for Gingrich, as he easily won the South Carolina primary and forever changed the race, largely thanks to this single debate. Jacksonville, Florida, January 26 . Biggest storyline: Romney went on the attack, battling Gingrich at every twist and turn. Santorum knocked Gingrich again for a particular grandiose idea, about space. Key moments: ""My father was born in Mexico. My wife's father was born in Wales. They came to this country. The idea that I'm anti-immigrant is repulsive. Don't use a term like that."" -- Romney . ""Those are things that sound good and maybe make big promises to people, but we've got to be responsible in the way we allocate our resources."" -- Santorum . Post-debate fallout: Gingrich slipped, and Romney won Florida. But the steady Santorum performances in these debates opened the door for the former senator to take the role of the non-Romney. He has ridden the wave to huge success and currently sits atop the national polls. --- . And now we head to Arizona, a crucial state to the GOP in 2012 (and currently going through its own political sex scandal). Wolf Blitzer tweeted this week: ""Just boarded flight to Phoenix & someone said: 'Thanks for all the good entertainment over the years.' Entertainment?"" The debates have been substantive, politically relevant and issue-based. But they have been, maybe more so than other cycles, entertaining as well. On Wednesday, you don't want to miss the season finale.","The 19 GOP presidential debates have become key moments in the campaign .

"(CNN) -- A British man convicted of having sex on a Dubai beach was re-arrested as he prepared to board a flight back to the UK, according to media reports. File image of one of the co-accused -- Vince Acors -- arriving at court in Dubai in September. Vince Acors, 34, from London, was due to fly to Heathrow Monday following his deportation from the Gulf state. But he was detained at Dubai Airport and returned to jail as his flight confirmation was allegedly ""not in order,"" the British Press Association said. Acors and fellow Briton Michelle Palmer, 36, were initially given three-month jail terms for unmarried sex and public indecency, but these were suspended on appeal. Acors had been due to return last Friday but a hold-up in the deportation process meant he was unable to board a UK-bound plane and spent the weekend in jail, PA said. His lawyer Andrew Crossley said: ""The return of Vince Acors has been delayed yet again and he will not be returning to the UK. The situation is close to becoming farcical and Vince is severely disappointed. ""After having booked and confirmed his return flight on three separate occasions through the course of the day Vince was re-arrested at Dubai Airport, as his flight confirmation was allegedly not in order. He has been returned to jail, his precise return is now unknown."" Palmer and Acors were arrested on a public beach shortly after midnight on July 5. Police charged them with illicit relations, public indecency, and public intoxication. A court found them guilty in October and fined them 1,000 dirhams ($367) for the charge of public indecency. Both denied they had intercourse. And during the trial, Mattar argued that the public prosecutor failed to produce corroborative evidence against his clients on the first two charges, though he said both tested positive for liquor. The United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, is home to thousands of expatriates and is among the most moderate Gulf states. Still, the oil-rich kingdom adheres to certain Islamic rules.","Michelle Palmer and Vincent Acors, faced three-month sentence .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- This just in: Male Beliebers Exist. I know this thanks to a monitor installed in the newsroom that flashes the very latest trending topics on Twitter. What's trending, as I write this sentence? A few hashtag games like ""#OverusedWords,"" a tribute to former teen queen Hilary Duff, ""Hilary is our Cinderella,"" and ""Male Beliebers Exist,"" a reference to obsessive fans of Justin Bieber. On my desk I have a multitude of networked devices -- PC, iPhone, BlackBerry, iPad. No surprise there. The Internet dominates our workspace. But it literally owns our life space as well. Americans -- and that includes me -- spend at least eight hours a day staring at a screen. And more than one-third of smartphone users get online before they get out of bed. We all know by now that the Internet is not just a means of communication. It's a parallel ecosystem, our digital state of nature. But how much of our Internet-based time is wasted time? And how much is absolutely integral to our daily lives? Read more posts from Kristie Lu Stout . DARPA may not have intended the Internet to be used this way, but I regularly find myself online to settle nagging pop culture questions. When was The Smiths' first concert appearance? Who wrote ""Before Sunrise?"" Did Gilda Radner ever guest star in ""The Muppet Show?"" A swift surf of IMDB.com or Wikipedia and *score* -- I have the answer. But then I end up wandering through various hyperlinks and suddenly it's 3:30 am and I'm watching back-to-back episodes of the Muppets in bed. I often wonder what blogger Paul Miller would do. As he's on a year-long Internet fast, Miller would have to go to a local library and microfiche his way to pop culture know-how. Pulling the plug on the Internet . During his self-imposed Internet exile, Miller cannot browse the Web -- not even over someone's shoulder. He cannot access NetFlix or other forms of streaming media. Nor can he pay bills online or send a text message. One month into his fast, I asked him why he decided to give up the Net for an entire year. ""I just wanted some time to myself and do some personal study,"" he said. ""I know I am most productive when I don't have the Internet on. I disconnect, I unplug at a coffee shop with no Wi-Fi to get something done. So why not spend a year getting stuff done?"" He describes his first day off the Net as calm and Zen-like: ""For me, it's such a relief. No one can get hold of me. No one can infringe on my time -- text message me, email me or pull me out of my head space."" But perhaps the greatest takeaway from talking to Miller and reading his regular updates, is knowing that the first generation to come of age on the Internet is becoming the first generation to realize that the Internet ain't all that. ""Maybe a generation before me or my parents see the Internet as this perfect modern convenience of getting things done. But I know a lot of people my age just live on the Internet, and it fills all their free time,"" he added. ""The big thing I'm trying to do is reclaim my free time. Right now, I'm bored a lot. I'm a little lonely too. But I'm learning to fill that in with things that are not like browsing Reddit or hanging on the Internet."" The Internet has become our hedge against solitude. I admit, I have been guilty of glancing at my smartphone to scroll down a social media feed and thus feel immediately plugged in. But over the years -- and especially since I've become a parent -- I've learned to wean myself away from an always online life to spend more face time with family, friends and real world things like parks, picnics and play dates. And yet the Internet is just so seductive. Some crave the sweet lightness of an Instagram sunset. Many are addicted to social media's short-term rewards like scoring a re-tweet. And yes, a few of us enjoy an occasional hit of downward comparison by laughing at the mishaps of others on FAIL blog. But in addition to the fluff and frivolity, our lives require meaning and significance. Thankfully, that does happen -- and often -- on the Internet. Collective action online has launched groundbreaking new projects, saved women from human trafficking and sparked a revolution. The faces of Egypt's 'Revolution 2.0' But as much as we want to give our modern lives weight, it can't be just that. We desire the sweet frivolities of the Internet as well. And like real world junk food, a spoonful of click-through sugar can be good for the soul every now and then. This just in: CNN anchor looks at FAIL blog. Occasionally. Only on Fridays.","Kristie Lu Stout: The Internet dominates our workspace and owns our life space as well .

"(CNN) -- NASA scientists revealed Friday a first-of-its-kind image from space showing reflecting sunlight from a lake on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. It's the first visual ""smoking gun"" evidence of liquid on the northern hemisphere of the moon, scientists said, and the first-ever photo from another world showing a ""specular reflection"" -- which is reflection of light from an extremely smooth surface and in this case, a liquid one. ""This is the first time outside Earth we've seen specular reflection from another liquid from another body,"" said Ralf Jaumann, a scientist analyzing data from the Cassini unmanned space probe. Jaumann said he was surprised when he first saw the photos transmitting from Cassini, orbiting Saturn about a billion miles from Earth. ""It was great because if you look at photos of planets, you mostly see nothing is happening. But in two hours we saw a glint of light getting brighter."" Titan's similarities to Earth have attracted NASA's attention for decades. It's the only body besides our own in the solar system that is believed to have liquid on its surface. Like Earth, Titan has an atmosphere which is mostly nitrogen. Experts believe the presence of liquid on a planet or moon improves the chances that some kind of life could develop there. The photo comes from the spacecraft Cassini, which has been searching for this kind of reflection since it began circling Saturn in 2004. Scientists with the University of Arizona were able to use previous data from Cassini to learn details about the reflection's location on Titan. The glint appears to be coming from the southern edge of a lake called Kraken Mare -- a massive body of methane that covers about 150,000 square miles (400,000 square kilometers). That's larger than the Caspian Sea, which is the largest lake on Earth. The hunt for the specular reflection took five years, NASA said, because the moon's northern half had been shrouded in winter darkness. ""Next, we want to find out more about Titan's liquid,"" said Jaumann. ""Do we have some kind of weather there? Do we have changes with seasons? Does it rain? How does the liquid methane run across the surface?"" But Jaumann sounded a note of caution regarding the prospect of life in this case. ""The temperature on Titan's surface is something like minus-180 degrees Celsius,"" he said. ""That means it's very cold. But you never know."" The project is based out of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This is not the first evidence of liquid on Titan. In 2008, project members used infrared technology to discover a large lake in the moon's southern hemisphere. But this recent discovery is a sure sign that liquid exists on the moon's northern half. That region is believed to include larger basins that could hold more liquid.","NASA photo from Cassini probe is first-ever of liquid on another world, says scientist .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 65 years after his demise by his own hand in a bunker beneath the streets of Berlin, Adolf Hitler is still managing to cause controversy. The latest dispute has pitched U.S. researchers against the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in a debate over the authenticity of fragments of skull and jawbone said to belong to the Nazi dictator. The origins of the dispute date back to 2000 when Russian officials put the fragments on public display in Moscow. The skull fragment has a hole near the temple. Proof, said officials, that Hitler had committed suicide by putting a gun to his head. But earlier this year, researchers from the University of Connecticut released the results of a DNA test on the skull which they say proves not only that it didn't belong to the Nazi leader, but the remains were that of a female aged between 20 and 40 years old. The findings might have encouraged one of the wilder conspiracy theories about Hitler to flourish, but researchers were not claiming that Hitler was a woman. Nor do they think that the remains are likely to be those of Hitler's long term partner Eva Braun, who, so the story goes, killed herself at the same time and place as the Fuehrer in 1945. Yet despite the new evidence, Russian officials remain adamant that the remains are Hitler's and, in their defense, have released archive documents in an attempt to prove the bones are authentic. A report published by Russia's Interfax news agency this week quotes the head of the FSB archives saying Hitler's remains, except parts of his skull and jaw, were burnt in 1970 and thrown into the Biederitz River in what was then East Germany. FSB archives' chief Lieutenant-General Vasily Khristoforov told Interfax that the decision to destroy Hitler's remains and those of Eva Braun and the Goebbels family was ordered by the head of Russia's KGB -- forerunner to the FSB -- Yury Andropov [who briefly became Soviet leader in 1982]. ""Andropov clearly listed the plan: To remove and destroy the remains of the war criminals, buried in Magdeburg [Germany] on February 21, 1946..."" Khristoforov told Interfax. Khristoforov said Andropov's decision to dispose of Hitler's ashes in the river nearly 40 years ago was ""motivated by the KGB and Communist Party leaders' fears that the place where Hitler was buried could become a place of attraction for supporters of his ideas."" Interesting though they are, the Khristoforov's revelations don't shed any more light on the authenticity of the skull. For now, U.S. researchers stand by their evidence saying the skull fragment is definitely from a female, while Russia insists that the jawbone -- which the U.S. researchers didn't test -- is most definitely male. Whatever the eventual outcome is, in this, the latest in a long line of investigations into the most reviled figure of the 20th century, it seems certain that experts and conspiracy theorists alike will be picking over the bones of Hitler's life and legacy for decades to come.","Debate over authenticity of the remains of Adolf Hitler's skull continues .

"(CNN) -- Howard Stern said he almost retired a few months ago because he felt he'd proven everything he needed to in radio. In an interview on Tuesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" Stern said he knew he had been wildly successful, and said to himself, ""Really, why am I doing this anymore? It makes me crazy. I hate getting up early in the morning, and I don't particularly like doing the show."" But, Stern told Morgan, he is ""driven by a neurotic compulsion"" to do his show. He also told Morgan about his desire to please his parents and says he was ""rocked"" a few years ago when his father, who worked in the radio business, called him a genius. But Stern said despite his father's praise he remains driven. ""I think it's my identity,"" Stern said. ""Like, this is who I am. This is what I do."" Stern said he feels like he ""hit a home run"" after a particularly great show. ""Like I'm Babe Ruth, you know?"" Morgan also touched on the early days of Stern's radio program, when the show's outrageous stunts had never before been considered for -- and didn't necessarily translate to -- radio. ""It occurred to me that to have a naked woman on the radio would be outrageous,"" said Stern. ""And yet really who would it offend? It's all theater of the mind. You don't even really know if she's naked or not."" Stern also pointed out that people often tell him that his program was the introduction of reality television. Despite naked women frequenting his studio, however, Stern confessed to being a homebody. ""I don't like to go out,"" Stern said. ""I don't like to leave the house. I like to stay home, but I'm fascinated by human behavior."" One person's behavior he doesn't approve of is Jay Leno's. He said Leno ""did a terrible thing to Conan O'Brien"" when he went back to the ""Tonight Show."" ""Jay (Leno) is insane,"" Stern told Morgan. ""He's not fit to scrub David Letterman's feet. Yes, I don't know why he's beaten David Letterman in the ratings. It's beyond my comprehension. America must be filled with morons who at night lay in bed -- the ones who are watching him. They must be in a coma."" When the discussion turned to politics, Morgan asked Stern what he thinks of the United States and what America has come to. ""I love America,"" he said. ""I love our freedom. And nowhere could a guy like me, a schlub like me have success with -- where would I get this freedom of speech? They don't allow this anywhere.""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. NASA MISSION CONTROL: Three... two... one... zero. And liftoff of space shuttle Atlantis on a mission to build, resupply and to do research on the international space station. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: The space shuttle Atlantis taking off, and so is this edition of CNN Student News. Here to pilot you through today's commercial-free headlines, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Obama Town Hall . AZUZ: Dining with dignitaries and town halls about Twitter? Part of President Obama's time in China. Today, he's scheduled to hold official meetings with the country's leader, President Hu Jintao. But yesterday, President Obama was in Shanghai, where he took part in a town hall meeting with local university students. During the event, he said that while the two countries sometimes disagree, they don't necessarily have to be at odds with each other. He also took questions from the audience. One of them about Twitter. A student asked if Chinese residents should be able to use the site freely. China -- a communist country -- has routinely blocked its citizens' access to certain Web sites. President Obama used his answer to talk about censorship and said that he believes when information flows openly, it makes a society stronger. GM Results . AZUZ: In America, General Motors says that better results might help it pay back government loans sooner rather than later. But ""better"" is the key word here. From July, when GM came out of bankruptcy, through the end of September, the company's North American operations lost 651 million dollars. Still, that's better than the $2.1 billion it expected to lose. GM has received a total of $50 billion dollars from the U.S. government since the end of last year. Some experts ask how much of that money will ever be repaid. Fast Facts . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for some Fast Facts! The Hajj is an annual journey to the Muslim holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Islam requires all Muslims who are able to make the journey at least once in their lives as it's one of the five pillars, or requirements, of the Muslim faith. The Hajj includes five days of ceremonies and rituals and takes place two months and ten days after the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. More than two million Muslims take part every year. Hajj H1N1 Concerns . AZUZ: There are some concerns about this year's Hajj and how it might help spread the H1N1 virus. Think about this: millions of people gathered together and the possibilities of a contagious flu. Saudi Arabia says it won't turn anyone away, but it's encouraging other countries not to let people in high-risk groups -- for example, pregnant women, anyone under 12 or over 65 -- make the ritual pilgrimage. It's suggesting that people who do travel to Mecca for the Hajj get the H1N1 vaccine before they come and to wash their hands regularly once they get there. Detainees in the Heartland? AZUZ: The town of Thomson is about 150 miles away from Chicago, Illinois. And that is one reason why some people are against a proposal that would move Guantanamo detainees into the town's prison. We're talking about dozens of suspected terrorists that are being held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. One U.S. congressman argues that moving them to Thomson would turn metro Chicago into ""ground zero for terrorist plots."" Officials toured the Thomson Correctional Center yesterday. Elaine Quijano talked with some of the town's residents about this idea. (BEGIN VIDEO) ELAINE QUIJANO, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: At the Maximum Security Thomson Correctional Center in Northwest Illinois, federal officials from a host of agencies poured in. Representing the departments of Homeland Security, Defense and Justice, and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the officials got a close-up look at the 1,600 cell jail that could one day house dozens of Guantanamo terror suspects. Tara Kleckner can see the Thomson Prison from her backyard. She understands the security concerns about the increased threat that would come with having terror suspects in her home town. But she insists the community's 600 residents deserve a chance at the prison jobs that would also come if the detainees are moved here. TARA KLECKNER, THOMSON RESIDENT: If they can boost our economy and give our people the opportunity to prosper and make more money and make a better living for their families, I think the risk is worth it. QUIJANO: Both the Democratic Senator and governor of Illinois agree. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D) OF ILLINOIS: We have a chance to bring more than 2,000 good-paying jobs with benefits to this region. QUIJANO: Yet Illinois House Republicans, like Congressman Donald Manzullo, who's district includes Thomson, warned that bringing terror suspects to U.S. soil would invite a terrorist attack. REP. DONALD MANZULLO (R) OF ILLINOIS: That's all we need in northern Illinois, is to be known as the Gitmo North. The place that replaced Gitmo. QUIJANO: While Thomson resident Randy Stricker likes the idea of jobs, he wonders at what cost. RANDY STRICKER, THOMSON RESIDENT: Kind of leery a little bit, I guess. It makes you nervous. Yeah a little bit. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Miss Hill's social studies classes at Madison County Middle School in Comer, Georgia!

That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Tracking Trash . AZUZ: All right... but once we toss it, where does all that trash go? And I don't mean just some landfill somewhere.  That was a group a group of researchers that wanted to find out exactly where trash goes. So, they're tracking it down, from the time it gets tossed until it reaches its final destination. As Patrick Oppmann explains, the goal of the project is to get people thinking about what they throw away. (BEGIN VIDEO) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN ALL-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, SEATTLE: The waste of our lives: newspapers, empty milk cartons, plastic bottles. Many people throw out an aluminum soda can like this and never give it another thought. But if you knew how far this can will travel and the cost involved, you might think twice about what you're throwing out. Call it tracking trash. That's what a group of MIT researchers are doing. ASSAF BIDERMAN, MIT SENSEABLE CITY LAB: When you throw it away, it sends a message. It gets picked up by the truck, it sends another message. OPPMANN: They are attaching 3,000 electronic trackers like this one to the trash of people who volunteered for the study. BIDERMAN: What would it be like to live in an environment where every object is addressable? You know what it is, you know where it is in real time. Can we create a situation of minimum waste? CARLO RATTI, MIT SENSEABLE CITY LAB: Today, we know a lot of things about the global supply chain. And that's how everything comes together on the planet. Goods are moved and they come together; are produced, assembled and sold. But we know very, very little about what you could call the removal chain; and that's about trash. STEPHANIE CHANG, STUDY VOLUNTEER: Steel can, old ziplock... OPPMANN: That removal chain starts on the houseboat of study volunteers Ethan O'Connor and Stephanie Chang. Researcher Malima Wolf shows them how to put a tracker on their trash where it won't be seen or fall off. MALIMA WOLF, MIT SENSEABLE CITY LAB: We don't want to put it right on the fold. We want to put it kind of near this fold. So, let's tape it in there. OPPMANN: So, there's a strategy element in all this. WOLF: Yes, absolutely. I mean, you do have to think it through with each piece, unfortunately. Some of them you're not going to have a lot of choice. Like this metal pipe. If we want to tag this, we're just going to have to tape something on the outside. And unfortunately, it's going to look like you taped something to a metal pipe. But with this cardboard box, we can actually hide it on the inside. OPPMANN: The study isn't complete, but the tracking technology shows the couple's trash has already traveled tens of miles. Some may end up in landfills, some in recycling plants, some even thousands of miles away. Tossed in the trash, but not forgotten. Patrick Oppman, CNN, Seattle. (END VIDEO) Promo .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 150 years after it was left behind at a Civil War prison camp, the 3-inch clay pipestem still shows a Union soldier's teeth marks. The pipe, whose stem features the name of its manufacturer, proves the resourcefulness of a prisoner who really wanted his tobacco. He fashioned the bowl from lead, possibly by melting rifle bullets. No one knows what became of the unknown soldier at Camp Lawton, which during its short existence in south Georgia was the Confederacy's largest prison camp. ""His name his been lost to history but his story has not,"" said Kevin Chapman, who led a group of college students that found the exact location of the camp's slave-built stockade and, in the soil beneath tall pine trees, nearly 200 artifacts. Those are the first of what is expected to be a treasure of artifacts that will bear witness to the lives of prisoners and the horrors they endured. The find was detailed Wednesday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Southern University. The artifacts were found this spring on federal property, the currently closed Bo Ginn National Fish Hatchery. The camp's location also extends into state property, the adjoining Magnolia Springs State Park. Visitors got a chance to learn more about the dig in Wednesday's open house at the state park. Only archaeologists and other officials are allowed on the actual dig site. This discovery of so many Civil War-era items -- including the smoking pipe, uniform buttons, a picture frame, coins, utensils, bullets and objects fashioned by Union prisoners -- is unparalleled for many reasons, archaeologists said. And the prisoner belongings from little-known Camp Lawton are believed to represent just a fraction of what will be uncovered, cleaned and analyzed for up to 30 years. With the exception of a farmer's plow 100 years ago, the 42 acres near Millen, Georgia, have been largely free of human touch. That includes being missed by relic hunters and looters who, said Rick Kanaski, regional archaeologist and historic preservation officer for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, ""are both thieves of time."" Over the years, people have picked clean known Civil War sites, including the notorious Andersonville prison in west-central Georgia, about 120 miles away. Camp Lawton was built to help ease Andersonville's overcrowding. ""This site is unusually undisturbed,"" said Kanaski. ""For Civil War sites, this is an amazing thing."" The site's remote location and maps describing it as brushy and overgrown likely saved it from relic hunters, archaeologists said. Still, that hasn't stopped some relic hunters from trying to reach the fenced-in site. About a half dozen have been stopped by state park officials, said Natural Resources Commissioner Chris Clark, who said they were released with a warning. Prosecutions may follow for violators now that the dig is public knowledge, he said. Some of the artifacts will go on display starting October 10 at the Georgia Southern University Museum in Statesboro, about 40 miles south of the camp site. Officials said the public eventually will be able to watch excavations at Camp Lawton, which was described after the war as ""foul and fetid."" Using modern technology along with shovels, prisoner drawings and topographic maps, the Georgia Southern archaeology students found the stockade site at one of four investigative sites they studied at the federal hatchery and state park. They believe excavations will produce finds that will surpass their initial modest expectations of finding the rectangular stockade's perimeter. ""Even in the short term, the site will provide a glimpse into the trials and tribulations of Civil War soldiers,"" said Kanaski. Early this spring, team leader Chapman found a U.S. cent of a type that was last manufactured in 1858, six years before Camp Lawton opened for its brief but deadly six-week existence. Students then began finding other precious objects. ""When I picked up things, literally the hair stood up on my neck,"" said Sue Moore, an anthropology professor in the School of Anthropology at Georgia Southern. She served as adviser to the dig crews. Nails and other items showed that the sloped camp was the living area for nearly 10,000 men who built shelters and lean-tos near Magnolia Springs. Having just survived the scorching 1864 summer, they dug into the earth to shelter them from a cold winter, which included a November snowfall. Then, suddenly, in late November 1864, the camp was abandoned. The prisoners were taken to other camps as the Yankees approached during the famous March to the Sea. Archaeologists think that prisoners may have been taken to the depot in Millen in the middle of the night, and were forced to leave behind their camp belongings and keepsakes from their homes up north. The items, possibly numbering in the thousands, were eventually swallowed up by the earth. ""It's been a series of 'Oh my God this is huge' moments,"" Chapman, 36, said of the archaeological dig. Between 725 and 1,330 men died at the prison camp in its six weeks. Officials said they know the ""general vicinity"" of soldier graves, but have no plans to disturb them. Conditions in Northern POW camps often weren't much better. About 3,000 imprisoned Confederates, for example, died in Elmira, New York. ""Some of the saddest part of our history was the handling of prisoners on both sides,"" said John Derden, professor emeritus of history at East Georgia College in Swainsboro. Wednesday's announcement couldn't come at a better time for Millen and Jenkins County, where unemployment hovers near a staggering 20 percent. Most of the town's manufacturing jobs are gone. ""We have an incredible opportunity for heritage tourism in this community,"" said Clark. ""I've never lost hope"" about bringing in jobs, said Mabel Jenkins, chairwoman of the county's development authority. She said she hopes a museum related to the archaeology and perhaps a re-creation of a section of the prison stockade will be erected. Once the digs resume, Magnolia Springs State Park, which had 114,000 visitors in 2009, also could get a needed boost. ""We see the park as growing,"" said Becky Kelley, Georgia parks director. There are no known photos of Camp Lawton and few details of the stockade, but a Union mapmaker painted watercolors of the prison. He also kept a 5,000-page journal that included descriptions of the misery at the camp. ""The weather has been rainy and cold at nights,"" Pvt. Robert Knox Sneden, who was previously imprisoned at Andersonville, wrote in his diary on November 1. ""Many prisoners have died from exposure, as not more than half of us have any shelter but a blanket propped upon sticks. ... Our rations have grown smaller in bulk too, and we have the same hunger as of old."" Among Sneden's watercolors from Lawton are two depicting the stockade wall and a brick oven with a tall chimney. Chapman and about eight other Georgia Southern graduate students used the painting to help locate the dig site. They found bricks that may be remains of one of the camp's ovens depicted by Sneden, Moore said. The land slipped into obscurity for about 70 years, when some of it became part of Magnolia Springs State Park. Until this spring, a few entrenchments were the only signs of Camp Lawton. That began to change in late June, when federal officials erected a locked and guarded fence to safeguard the artifacts found at its hatchery, which will reopen in spring 2011. They will work with their Georgia counterparts to ensure the site is not touch by unauthorized individuals. ""The illegal antiquity marketplace is a global marketplace,"" Kanaski said. Although the public is mesmerized by artifacts, historians and archaeologists consider them mainly as tools to understand the past. ""What's important is not just the artifacts but the context,"" said Kanaski. What, they wonder, were these soldiers like? How did they adapt to their harsh environment, where disease was a deadly companion? How did they organize camp life? Some coins, tokens and other objects that have been found were made in Europe, and indicate Union regiments made up of soldiers with Irish and German ancestry, Chapman said. One of the dig sites was open to the public over several weekends during the spring. Chapman recalls one ""magical day' when a descendant of a Union prisoner and a descendant of a Confederate guard stopped by to observe. The government and Georgia Southern are not currently digging the site. They are devising a comprehensive plan of research, excavation and conservation. The next dig is expected to begin this fall on the state park side of Camp Lawton. Students will try to find the stockade's corners and evidence of the camp commandant's headquarters and other buildings. ""We found more than we ever dreamed of,"" said Kanaski. ""This is truly a unique site, one that belongs to all Americans."" Like other speakers Wednesday, U.S. Rep. John Barrow of Georgia talked about Camp Lawton's legacy. ""It's one of those places where triumph and tragedy are mixed,"" he said.","About 200 artifacts were found in early archaeological investigations .
The site is unusual in that it has not been picked over by relic hunters .
Some of the items will go on display in October at Georgia Southern University ."
"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, the state of Michigan, the birthplace of the UAW and the nation's organized labor movement, became the country's 24th right-to-work state. Michigan joins Indiana, which passed right-to-work legislation in February, to become the second right-to-work state in the heavily unionized Midwest. The legislation marks a monumental shift away from union power to ""open shop"" free labor. Right-to-work laws prohibit workers from being forced to contribute mandatory dues to labor unions in order to gain employment, regardless of whether or not they are members of a union, and prohibit employers from firing workers if they don't join a union. With workers no longer obligated to pay union dues, union membership, revenue, and strength decline. Predictably, there was no shortage of outrage from union workers this week as they stormed the capital building in Lansing to protest. Teachers walked out of schools and Democratic state senators even walked out on the final vote to approve the initial bills. Union workers and their Democratic allies realize that the transition from a ""closed shop"" state to a right-to-work state is the second in near fatal blows to Michigan's entrenched union interests. The first blow came this past November when unions spent tens of millions of dollars in Michigan pushing Proposal 2, a ballot initiative that would have written collective bargaining into the state constitution and in essence outlawed a right-to-work law and limits on union power. Michigan voters defeated the proposal 58% to 42%. Proposal 2 was defeated because the unions had overreached their hand. Decades ago, unions were important to workers because America's emerging labor markets were less predictable and less safe. But much of the American public now realizes that labor unions are no longer needed in the way they once were, and they don't need to be enshrined in state constitutions. What's the 'right-to-work' battle all about? What's more, many unions have deviated from their original purpose and warped into powerful special interests rather than true representatives of workers' rights. There is a growing public consensus, seen most recently in Wisconsin, Indiana and now Michigan, that non-right-to-work states can stifle private labor competition and give too much power, politically and financially, to the unions. What right-to-work states have found is that, if given the choice, some, or even many, workers will chose not to join the union. In other words, many workers themselves no longer see the need for mandatory dues and labor union representation. On Monday, President Obama pushed back and blasted right-to-work laws during a visit to Michigan. He said, ""These so called right to work laws, they don't have to do with economics -- they have everything to do with politics. What they're really doing is trying to talk about the right to work for less money."" Video: 'Unions are the problem' Despite the protests by the labor unions and their Democratic allies, it should be noted that Michigan's legislation does not end collective bargaining nor does it increase pension contributions or health care benefit payments from union workers. And contrary to President Obama's thinking, right-to-work laws are directly related to economics. Right-to-work laws give employers the freedom to hire non-union workers and negotiate contracts with more than one party. For this reason, right-to-work states are more attractive to private business than non-right-to-work, and could increase private-sector wages. For example, on CNBC's annual list of the best states for business, nine of the top 10 states are right-to-work states. It's no coincidence that foreign automobile manufacturers often build new plants in right-to-work states like Tennessee and Alabama, rather than Detroit -- the ""Motor City."" Analysis: Why America's unions are losing power . Perhaps Michigan's new right-to-work status will unlock employers from burdensome union contracts and attract new private enterprise to Detroit, which is predicted to go bankrupt by the end of this year. After all, Gov. Scott Walker's union reforms in neighboring Wisconsin helped eliminate the state's budget shortfall. Twenty, 10, or even five years ago, few people would have predicted that Michigan would become a right-to-work state. Adding Michigan to the expanding list of right-to-work states only hastens to a close the days of labor union monopolies over state governement and businesses. Could California, New York, or Illinois be next? The question doesn't seem so farfetched now. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","On Tuesday, Michigan became the country's 24th right-to-work state .

"Editor's note: John Feehery has worked as a staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients including News Corp., Ford Motor Company and the United States Chamber of Commerce. He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America. John Feehery says the way to oppose President Obama is with new ideas, not with rhetoric. (CNN) -- As I watched President Obama conduct a town hall meeting in Strasbourg, France, the other day, a chilling realization crossed my mind: I like the guy. This might be a surprise coming from a partisan Republican who also does some work as a lobbyist. (Obama seems to dislike my profession with special intensity.) But it shouldn't be. There is much to like about him. He has a winning smile. He is unself-consciously hip. He is smart. He has self-confidence without being overly smug. He has married well and has two ""perfect"" daughters (his words, not mine). Obama also has an inspiring life story, and his election to the highest office in the world represents the best possibilities of the American dream. I also want Obama to succeed. Unlike Rush Limbaugh, if Obama can get my 401(k) back to life, if he can get health care costs under control, if he can stop pollution, if he can get the manufacturing sector back on its feet, if he can make our country more secure while regaining for America the moral high ground, if he can find the cure for cancer and bring peace, love and understanding to the world, I am all for it. I am also willing to pay a few extra bucks in taxes for that success, if I can get some economic growth in return. And I am not alone in my feelings. Obama's personal approval ratings are still high, and most Americans simply love his family. Internationally, the president's ratings are off the chart. So, how do I square my approval of the president personally with my disapproval of his policies? How can I like Obama but not the Obama White House? For example, I think the president's budget will lead to inflation or even possible bankruptcy for the nation. I understand the difficult choices that he has tried to make, and I understand the desire to get everything done right now. But governing is about choosing, and the system can't do everything at once. I also disagree with his attack on the lobbying profession. Lobbying the government is protected under the Constitution, because what lobbyists do is petition their government on behalf of the people. Are there some lobbyists who are corrupt or crooked? Sure there are. But most lobbyists, like most politicians, do it the right way, and they serve a vital function of providing expertise to both the private sector and to the public sector. Philosophically, I don't agree with the president. He is a collectivist, where I believe more in individual responsibility. He is a Keynesian, where I am a supply-sider. He is pro-choice. I am pro-life. But I still like him. And I think many of my fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are stuck in the same trap. They like the man, but don't like the policies. They hope, for the sake of the country, that he is successful, but have their real doubts that his policies will work. And because they are the loyal opposition, they are stuck, in this 24-hour cable news and talk radio culture, saying things about him that make them seem shrill and out of touch. What makes it worse is that, according to the polls, Americans have much more faith in Obama and the Democrats now than they do in the GOP. Here are some suggestions about how Republicans can square the circle, how they can express their admiration for the man and even some of the goals of this administration, without rolling over on the policy front: . 1) Accept every social invitation from the president. When he invites you to watch the Final Four, go the White House and watch the Final Four. When he wants to buy you a beer, go ahead and buy him a beer back. Let the public know that you appreciate their appreciation for the president, and that while you might disagree with him on policy, you like hanging out with him on occasion. 2) Never miss an opportunity to compliment the president and his family for something they have done that puts America in a good light. Root for them. If the first lady represents the country well when she meets the French premier's wife, or if the president does a good job talking to students overseas, applaud them. Don't look for reasons to pick on things that don't matter. 3) Agree with certain policy goals. Yes, all children should have access to health care. Yes, we need to have 21st-century schools. Yes, we should have clean water and clean air. Yes, we need to create more jobs. We may have a different approach, but we agree with the goals to make America a better place to live. 4) Create and then market your own ideas. The key to beating Obama is not by vilifying him (in my opinion). The key to beating Obama is in coming up with superior ideas to transform the government and to make America a better place to live. Republicans should come up with plans that insist on transformational change of the government bureaucracy, that require greater accountability from failing school districts, that target the high costs caused by frivolous medical lawsuits, that highlight job-killing union contracts and that insist on total transparency in government spending. Reacting to the president's proposals puts Republicans in a tough spot. Having the president react to our proposals puts him on the defensive. Some will say that this ""play nice"" strategy will backfire on Republicans; that the only way to beat Obama is to stoke fear and attack his character. Others will accuse me of going soft on a Democrat who quite clearly doesn't share the values of most Republicans. But I think there is far greater risk for the Republican brand in not acknowledging what Obama's election means historically, and not appreciating how his example is not only good for Democrats but for the country at large. Tearing this president down is not the way for Republicans to regain a majority coalition, although some pundits and talk show hosts will be tempted to do just that. Instead, Republicans should allow themselves to like the president, just as they fight against his policies. And as they fight his policies, they should do all that they can to market their own ideas so that the American people understand that the Republicans have positive alternatives that will make our country stronger, safer and more prosperous in the future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery.","John Feehery: Most Americans like Obama and his family .

"(CNN) -- Seattle's CenturyLink Field was shaking Saturday. Scientists have verified this. Nearly 70,000 of the Seattle Seahawks' famously vocal fans registered on two seismometers, devices that measure motions of the ground, typically for earthquakes, installed for an NFL playoff game against the New Orleans Saints. It helped, of course, that Seattle won 23-15. The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network webpage explained why the seismometers were placed in the stadium: ""This is an experiment to investigate how an excited crowd energizes the stadium structure to shake, and how that shaking propagates into the surrounding ground."" The stadium set a Guinness World Record for noise at an outdoor stadium last September, and went seismic last month in another game against New Orleans, registering at a recording station about a block from the stadium. Seattle fans also shook the earthquake recording station during a game in 2011. Once again, the opponent was the New Orleans Saints. Last month's game hit in the magnitude 1-to-2 range, John Vidale, a professor at the University of Washington and the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, said at the time. The magnitude for the playoff game was a little higher, he said Saturday, going on to explain that the instruments responded to the stomping and yelling of the fans. ""This game outclassed the game of a few weeks ago and was comparable to the game from three years ago,"" Vidale said. Seismometers respond to vibrations, not noise, he said. ""We measure what you can feel as vibrations,"" he said. ""We don't read high frequency, as what people can hear."" It's happened before, in Louisiana, of all places. In 1988, fans at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge rocked the bayou in a come-from-behind victory over Auburn, registering on the campus seismograph.","Stomping and yelling of fans register on devices .

We're gonna explain what you should watch out for. I'm Carl Azuz, and you're tuned in to CNN Student News! First Up: Afghanistan Elections . AZUZ: If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, then a runoff election will be held. That is what it says in Afghanistan's constitution, and that's why the country could be looking at the runoff scenario. Unofficial results from August's election showed that the current President Hamid Karzai with 54 percent of the vote. But the Afghan Electoral Complaints Commission threw out ballots because of fraud. And when an independent group checked the final tally, it found that President Karzai only had 48 percent of the vote. The only group that can order a runoff: the Independent Election Commission.  There was no immediate reaction from them yesterday. The situation isn't just affecting Afghans. It could impact U.S. troops, as well. President Obama is reviewing a military request to send 40,000 additional forces to Afghanistan. But on Sunday, a White House official said it would be ""reckless"" to deploy more troops without knowing what kind of government Afghanistan's going to have. The service members who are there are battling the Taliban and the al Qaeda terrorist group. But as Atia Abawi explains, those aren't the only enemies facing U.S. forces. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ATIA ABAWI, CNN CORRESPONDENT, KABUL: Coalition forces are fighting fierce enemies in Afghanistan, facing daily attacks by different groups with differing ideologies. And contrary to popular belief, it's more than just the Taliban and al Qaeda. Captain Richard Vickery's job is to help distinguish the various groups pitted against the coalition: . CAPTAIN RICHARD VICKERY, U.S. AIR FORCE: The biggest issue that you are dealing with when you're dealing with the different insurgent groups is that they all have different motivations for wanting to fight. And that causes where we have a lot of problems with how we engage them. Are they groups that we can engage and have them cease and desist through peaceful means? Are they groups that we have to engage kinetically? ABAWI: This map shows the greatest areas of concern. In the west of the country, the insurgent groups entail more of a criminal element, some with ties to the drug trade. In southern Afghanistan you see the traditional Taliban, a group that Mullah Omar still has some influence over. The groups and alliances become more complicated as you move east. In southeastern Afghanistan bordering Pakistan, the dominant militants are from the Haqqani group headed by Jalaludin Haqqani; it's an outfit more inclined than others to use suicide attacks. In the northeast, among the many groups is another major player: Gulbideen Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizbi-Islami-Gulbideen, more commonly known as HIG. And many of these groups have cross-border ties with Pakistan. They are funded mainly by elements within Persian Gulf countries. PROFESSOR NASRULLAH STANAKZAI, UNIVERSITY OF KABUL [TRANSLATED]: These are the most dangerous fighters because they have the foreign connections with their strong ideologies and refuse to make peace with democracy, liberalism and freedom. ABAWI: Professor Stanakzai believes that there are groups and militant fighters that can be reconciled, but many will continue to use Afghanistan as their ideological battlefield. And as long as Afghanistan remains poor and undeveloped, these groups are likely to have a strong sway over the population for some time to come. Atia Abawi, CNN, Kabul. (END VIDEO CLIP) H1N1 Vaccine Delayed . AZUZ: Are you and your parents considering whether or not to get the H1N1 flu vaccine? You might have some more time to decide. Some deliveries of the shot are going to be delayed. Officials say that is because production of the vaccine is taking longer than they had hoped. About 40 million doses were expected to be ready by the end of this month. Now, it looks like that number will be closer to 30 million. As of yesterday, 11 and a half million doses were available. About eight million of those had been ordered. Health Care Talks . AZUZ: And in Washington, D.C. the debate over health care reform has moved behind closed doors, at least for a while. That's where lawmakers are working to combine different versions of health care bills passed by two separate committees, into this one single bill that will be presented to the entire Senate. That could be ready by later this week. Iran Nuclear Program . AZUZ: And U.S. officials involved in another set of talks taking place in Austria. This one is about the future of Iran's nuclear program. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who's hosting the meeting, said it got off to a good start yesterday. Participants talked about how nuclear materials made in Iran would be sent to other countries for further development and then sent back to Iran to be used in medical facilities. The hope in all of that is that the materials would only be suitable for medicine, not weapons. Is this Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The state of Louisiana doesn't have counties. This one's true. Louisiana's local government districts are referred to as parishes, not counties. Racial Controversy . AZUZ: Keith Bardwell, a judge in Louisiana's Tangipahoa Parish, has caused a national controversy after he refused to marry an interracial couple. The National Urban League calls that ""a huge step backward in social justice."" And the newlyweds, Beth and Terence McKay, who were married by a different judge in the parish, are fighting to have Judge Bardwell dismissed from his job. Bardwell insists he is not a racist and says he's performed marriages for black couples in his house. However, he doesn't perform interracial marriages because he believes most of them don't last, and he says he's concerned about the couples' children. Bardwell says he has no regrets about his decision, since it's ""hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong."" Cyber Crime Concerns . AZUZ: Social networking sites let us connect with friends, but they can also potentially connect us with criminals. According to the FBI, popular sites like Facebook and Twitter are also popular among cyber thieves. Last year, the Internet Crime Complaint Center got more than 72,000 complaints about Internet fraud involving more than $260 million in losses. How does that happen? You click on what looks like an innocent link or video, or you answer an online request for money from a friend stuck somewhere overseas. Once thieves have access to your account, they can run the same scams on people who are connected to you. Some simple ways to protect yourself: Read up on sites' security policies, be careful what you click on, and change your password regularly. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! About how many U.S. students ride the bus to school every day? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it around: A) 12 million, B) 24 million, C) 36 million or D) 48 million? You've got three seconds -- GO! Approximately 24 million students take the bus to school. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! School Bus Safety . AZUZ: By now, most of you have probably seen the effects of this global recession in your schools. There may be fewer field trips, less money for activities, fewer bus routes. We blogged about that awhile back, and some of you argued that it's dangerous to walk to school, or that you couldn't get to school without the bus. It's something a lot of us take for granted. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: They're big. They're yellow. The sound of their engines is the last thing students want to hear when they're not ready for school. One question during National School Bus Safety week is are they safe? According to the Committee on School Transportation Safety and the National Research Council, yes, especially when compared to cars. There are 800 students killed every year going to and from school. 98 percent of those deaths involve passenger cars, bikes, motorcycles, pedestrian incidents. Only two percent involve school buses. The problem with buses is... ROBIN LEEDS, NATIONAL SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION: We're seeing a lot of school districts cutting back on their transportation because their budgets are tight and they're looking for ways to save money. AZUZ: So, what can be done about that? LEEDS: If parents get up in arms and say we can't afford to let our children face the kind of risks they have to face when they don't have school buses, then the school board will make the decision that they'll keep the buses. AZUZ: Beyond that, Robin Leeds of the National School Transportation Association suggests contacting state lawmakers, because many local school districts get budget money from state legislatures. If elected officials realize how important bus funding is to voters, they're less likely to eliminate bus routes. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: Veterans Day is just around the corner, and we want to give you a chance to take part right here. Send us an iReport giving a shoutout to someone who's served in the Armed Forces, and you might see yourself on our show. If you want your own Shoutout, have your teacher send in an iReport with a photo of your school. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, it's about time to go pumpkin picking. That one didn't make it. But no one in the crowd is disappointed. That's because they're all here to watch these pumpkins plummet. It's actually part of a science lesson for students in West Virginia. The whole point is to plunge the pumpkins off the roof and see just how far the guts of the gourds go when they fall. Goodbye . AZUZ: Based on the reaction of the crowd, the event was a smashing success.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- FEMA gave away about $85 million in household goods meant for Hurricane Katrina victims, a CNN investigation has found. These items, stored by FEMA, were meant for Katrina victims but were given to state and federal agencies. The material, from basic kitchen goods to sleeping necessities, sat in warehouses for two years before the Federal Emergency Management Agency's giveaway to federal and state agencies this year. James McIntyre, FEMA's acting press secretary, said that FEMA was spending more than $1 million a year to store the material and that another agency wanted the warehouses torn down, so ""we needed to vacate them."" ""Upon review of our assets and our need to continue to store them, we determined that they were excess to FEMA's needs; therefore, they are being excessed from FEMA's inventory,"" McIntyre wrote in an e-mail. He declined a request for an on-camera interview, telling CNN the giveaway was ""not news."" Photos from one of the facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, show pallet after pallet of cots, cleansers, first-aid kits, coffee makers, camp stoves and other items stacked to the ceiling.  Watch dismay over ""out of touch"" FEMA » . FEMA said some of the items were donations from companies after Katrina, but most were purchased in the field as ""starter kits"" for people living in trailers provided by the agency. And even though the stocks were offered to state agencies after FEMA decided to get rid of them, one of the states that passed was Louisiana. Martha Kegel, the head of a New Orleans nonprofit agency that helps find homes for those still displaced by the storm, said she was shocked to learn about the existence of the goods and the government giveaway. ""These are exactly the items that we are desperately seeking donations of right now: basic kitchen household supplies,"" said Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans. ""These are the very things that we are seeking right now. FEMA, in fact, refers homeless clients to us to house them. How can we house them if we don't have basic supplies?""  Watch the great FEMA giveaway » . Kegel's group works with FEMA and other local organizations to rehouse victims of Katrina, the 2005 hurricane that flooded New Orleans and killed more than 1,800 people along the Gulf Coast. Community groups say thousands of people are still living in abandoned buildings in the city, though fewer than 100 people remain housed in tents. Kegel said FEMA was told in regular meetings that Unity was desperate for household supplies and that the group has been forced to beg for donations. But she said FEMA never told Unity and other community groups that it had tens of millions of dollars worth of brand-new items meant for storm victims. She said she learned of it from CNN, which found that those items never made it to people such as Debra Reed. ""An honest person like me didn't get nothing,"" said Reed, 54, who recently moved from a tent beneath a New Orleans bridge to a home with the help of Kegel's group. ""I'm gonna turn, 'cause I'm gonna cry. I didn't get nothing. I fought to get my money, but they wouldn't give it to me. So I ended up going under the bridge."" FEMA confirmed that it had kept the merchandise in storage for the past two years and then gave it away to cities, schools, fire departments and nonprofit agencies such as food banks. In all, General Services Administration records show, FEMA gave away 121 truckloads of material. McIntyre said that most of the items given away were not ""standard-issue type supplies"" that FEMA would have distributed after other disasters. He said that using the GSA, which manages federal property, to get rid of those stockpiles was ""standard process."" Asked whether FEMA believed that Katrina victims no longer needed the items, McIntyre wrote: ""If the state did not request the supplies, then FEMA would not know.""  Watch Kegel describe ""the needs are just overwhelming"" » . Pallets at the Fort Worth warehouse were piled high with boxes of buckets, boots, cleansers, mops and brooms. There were stacks of tents, lanterns and camp stoves for people still displaced, as well as clothing, bedding, plates and utensils. Meanwhile, Kegel said, Unity's clients can take only ""one fork, one spoon, one knife; they can only take one plate. We don't have enough to go around."" But FEMA said the items were no longer needed in the stricken region. So it declared them ""federal surplus"" and gave them away. Federal agencies such as the Bureau of Prisons, Postal Service and Border Patrol got first dibs on the material when FEMA started giving it away. Other agencies that received items include the National Guard, U.S. Marshals Service, the Air Force and Navy and the departments of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security, according to a list the GSA provided to CNN. These items also were offered to all states -- yet Louisiana, where most of the people displaced by the storm live, passed on taking any of them. John Medica, director of the Louisiana Federal Property Assistance Agency in Baton Rouge, said he was unaware that Katrina victims still had a need for the household supplies. ""We didn't have anybody out there who told us they wanted it,"" Medica said. Instead, 16 other states took the free items. ""Louisiana Recovery Authority Director Paul Rainwater is taking the lead on determing where this serious breakdown in communication occured and ... is working to pursue options for the state to still make use of these important supplies,"" said Michael DiResto of the Division of Administration. DiResto said Rainwater has already taken up the issue with a FEMA official. Kegel said she could not understand how Medica could not be aware of the need in the New Orleans area. She said she had not heard of the agency and was not registered with them, but after CNN's interview, the agency contacted her about registering Unity of Greater New Orleans so it could qualify for available supplies in the future.","Bureau of Prisons, Postal Service and other agencies get free Katrina goods .

"(CNN) -- France will send approximately 1,000 more troops to the Central African Republic, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tuesday in a radio interview. Speaking on Europe 1 radio, he said the mission would last about six months and would be coordinated with the United Nations and African Union. About 400 French troops are already in the Central African Republic, the French Defense Ministry said, where they are deployed to protect French nationals and help secure the airport in the capital, Bangui. France is a former colonial power in the Central African Republic. Former leader Gen. Francois Bozize fled the country in March of this year, after a coup led by rebel leader Michel Djotodia. A transitional government was put in place, headed by Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, but the country continues to be wracked by unrest and new elections have yet to be held. In a piece published Monday by French newspaper Le Figaro, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the troubled Central African Republic was facing its worst crisis yet. He highlighted the threat to peace posed by growing tensions between the country's Muslims and Christians, which have already led to a number of deaths. 'Suffering beyond imagination' U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson warned Monday that the situation in the country was deteriorating rapidly and called on the international community to act swiftly to turn it around. ""The population is enduring suffering beyond imagination,"" he told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. ""As we see far too often, women and children are bearing the brunt. Human rights violations are mounting. The use of child soldiers is rising. Sexual violence is growing. ""There are widespread reports of looting, illegal checkpoints, extortion, illegal arrests and detentions, torture and summary executions."" Eliasson also highlighted the worsening humanitarian situation in the country, saying that as much as a third of the population is in need of food, health care, clean water and shelter. He suggested that a U.N. peacekeeping force should eventually replace the current African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic, known as MISCA. That potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel, he said. In the meantime, however, he called for the international community to give its full backing to the efforts of the current mission. A new leadership team for the mission was announced Saturday, with retired Maj. Gen. Jean Marie Michel Mokoko of the Republic of Congo at its head. Humanitarian crisis . Adonia Ayebare, ambassador for the African Union's permanent mission to the United Nations, warned Monday of ""disastrous"" humanitarian consequences, with hundreds of thousands of civilians either internally displaced or refugees in neighboring countries. He called on transitional authorities to ""fully assume their responsibilities,"" particularly the protection of civilians and the transition to an elected government. As many as one in 10 people have been forced from their homes since March, humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said Tuesday. Recent clashes in the town of Bouca, in the northeast part of the country, have only added to the problem, the organization said. ""The fighting in Bouca is indicative of how horrific violence is engulfing the Central African Republic,"" said Sylvain Groulx, head of the group's mission there. ""We are extremely concerned about the living conditions of the displaced, who are overcrowded in churches, mosques or schools, or living in the bush with no access to health care, food, or water, and are threatened by epidemics. Much more needs to be done, and it needs to be done now.""

"(CNN) -- The global appeal of football can hardly be doubted. It is said the membership of ruling body FIFA exceeds that of the number of member countries in the United Nations. Furthermore, football is attributed the status of being one of only two entities that are truly global languages. Music is the other. The passion of this sport has been known to halt armed conflicts and to unite rivals, all for the good of the ""Beautiful Game."" I venture that there is nothing within the sphere of the human social arena that can transcend or perhaps even challenge the passion and fixation associated with this truly global sport. More than a kick in the universal grass, football is a script that translates without interpretation, that amends without severe changes, that entertains an informed audience, and pleasures even the most casual and naive observer merely through its grace and simplicity. Aside from its widespread appeal and acceptability, football provides opportunities for personal development, social exposure and travel. It is a tool for product marketing and even tourism. It is participatory with no regard to social and economic status. The impact of this great and wonderful sport is evidenced in the excitement of the pauper and through the accolades from the palaces of the royal fans. It is because of all these things, and more, that the ""Beautiful Game"" deserves to be respected, preserved and immortalized. Arguably those players and administrators who have emerged as notables should be lionized; some may even revere them as icons and deified gods. I will not lend myself to such lofty thinking. I am a mere lover of the ""Beautiful Game"" -- one who has trotted through the athletic portals and has been blessed to perform on its many green expanses. Discipline is integral to successfully achieving in this sport. Discipline to get there, discipline to maintain your performance, and discipline to sustain your humbleness as the benefits accrue. There is even the element of self-discipline to accept when your role alters, and to accept that neither you nor anyone else is bigger than the ""Game."" Challenges have always been present in this sport, and although some have mutated over time as the game became more global, others remain problematic. Perhaps it is symptomatic of modern society that despite the diversity of practitioners and the potpourri of fans, the ugliness of racism seeps through. Is it so ominous that we should shudder in fear? Is it so idiotic that we can attempt to minimize it by not diverting great resources towards its eradication? After all it is only the ignorant and the inebriated that dare spoil this pristine scene. I offer this explanation: The ""Beautiful Game"" is not immune from the variances and the often pejorative behaviors that inculcate the minds of many in our community. The same unpredictability that causes people to riot at an event celebrating Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. -- the same mob mentality that sends fans crashing and burning all in their paths after their favorite team has triumphed in some distinguished competition -- is the same uncontrollable factor that leads to much of the racial abuse. We can do much in terms of our formal response. We can be infinitely creative in proactive initiatives. However, what has never been done -- and what will never be accomplished -- is to legislate an attitude. The hallowed sanctums of the ""Beautiful Game"" will survive because it is the ""Beautiful Game."" It is neither the cause nor the panacea of society's ills. It is an avenue that has shown that it offers resiliency and relief come what may. Respect it, enjoy it and it serves us well.","Clyde Best is known as one of the first black players to establish himself in England .

"(Health.com) -- Every year, sneeze sufferers swear: ""This is the worst allergy season ever."" And they're right. ""Pollen levels are increasing, pollen seasons are getting longer, and more people are developing allergies,"" says Estelle Levetin, Ph.D., chairwoman of the aerobiology committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. In fact, this year's fall allergies (affecting at least 12 million Americans) will most likely last up to 27 days longer than average in the northernmost parts of North America, going even into November in some spots, a new study suggests. While spring and fall allergies cause the same symptoms (sneezing, itchy eyes, and runny nose), their triggers are different. Spring allergies, which run from February to late July, are brought on by pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds. Fall allergies go from mid-August through the first autumn frost, and are chiefly set off by pollen from the ragweed plant, mold, and dust mites. Health.com: 20 ways to stop allergies . Read on to learn what's making both seasons so unbearable—and the best ways to survive them. The seasons are longer . Spring allergies now start sooner and fall allergies end later, thanks to global warming, says Jeffrey G. Demain, M.D., director of the Allergy, Asthma & Immunology Center of Alaska. We're using more and more carbon-based fuels, generating greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) that trap heat from the sun in our atmosphere. This makes temperatures rise, prompting plants and trees to flower—and release pollen—earlier each spring; in the fall, they delay the death of ragweed plants from frost, extending the pollen season, Levetin explains. End result: ""Fall"" allergies may go practically into winter. Health.com: The worst plants for your allergies . There's more pollen than ever . Higher amounts of carbon dioxide not only kick-start pollen production, they also boost the amount of pollen each plant generates, too -- especially in urban areas, where the gas is more plentiful. To add insult to injury, CO2 is making pollen more potent, too. ""There's more allergen now in each grain than there used to be,"" Demain says. And pollen isn't the only allergen on the rise. Increasingly balmy temperatures mean more moisture in the air, which creates mold. ""The higher temperatures and gas may increase not just the growth of mold but also its spore production—which is how it distributes allergens—both indoors and out,"" Demain says. Health.com: Protect your home and family from dangerous mold and mildew . More people are developing allergies . The number of Americans with allergies is two to five times higher now than it was about 30 years ago, according to surveys from the National Institutes of Health. Genes play a role in your susceptibility, but the blooming allergy boom is most likely due to the longer, more intense pollen seasons — plus these expert-supported theories: . We're too clean. Now that we're exposed to less dirt and bacteria (thanks in part to our obsession with antibacterial everything), and have fewer scourges like polio and parasites to fight, our immune systems are quicker to overreact to otherwise harmless substances like pollen, says Levetin. At the same time, our environment is too dirty: Studies show that pollution (such as exhaust fumes) can trigger allergic flare-ups. Our modern diet is hurting us. Today's processed, preserved foods lack the tough fibers of the plants and grains our ancestors feasted on, throwing off the delicate balance of bacteria in our guts and setting us up for allergic sensitivity, says University of Michigan professor of internal medicine Gary Huffnagle, Ph.D.. Studies suggest, too, that as use of antibiotics — which also disrupt bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract — has surged, so have allergies. Health.com: Your secret allergy triggers revealed . The good news: Even if we're now more prone to sniffling, sneezing, and itchy eyes, ""there are many more treatment options on the market now,"" says Levetin. ""The current medications are so much better than they used to be."" A potent mix of non-sedating antihistamines, steroid sprays, and eyedrops help target today's stepped-up symptoms. And in the end, simply getting back to nature—by skipping the hand sanitizer from time to time and eating whole, fresh foods—may just be a crucial defense against, well, nature.

"(CNN) -- Score another win for the power of music -- and Bruno Mars gets the assist. Medical personnel at a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, are crediting the ""Just the Way You Are"" singer with helping the recovery of 11-year-old Zumyah Thorpe. According to reports from CNN affiliate WKYC, Thorpe was severely injured in a March 2013 car accident that killed her pregnant mother and two sisters. Thorpe suffered horrific brain swelling that required the removal of part of her skull. While she recovered, nurses played songs by Mars every day. ""I asked her who her favorite singer was and she said 'Bruno Mars' as quick as anyone would say any singer,"" Nancy Bass, a pediatric neurologist at UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, told the station. ""And she just started singing every single word. It definitely brought a tear to my eye."" ""I am absolutely convinced that singing those Bruno Mars songs and being able to say 'Bruno Mars' is in itself a miracle, and knowing all the words to the songs has helped her recover,"" Bass said. Mars himself was touched by the girl's recovery and his role. When he played Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena Saturday night, he invited Thorpe to visit him and gave her a number of gifts, including his hat, a guitar and a tour jacket. Mars also called attention to Thorpe's story on his social media accounts. ""Zumyah tonight you gave my band and I something we've never felt before. you're an inspiration to the world! #WeLoveYouZumyah,"" he posted. Thorpe repaid the compliment. ""He means a lot to me, he put a lot of hope into my heart,"" she said. ""If I want to be a dancer when I get older, I can. I can do whatever I want to accomplish, I can.""","Medical personnel credit Bruno Mars' music for helping injured girl .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The world's oldest known Christian Bible goes online Monday -- but the 1,600-year-old text doesn't match the one you'll find in churches today. The British government bought most of the pages of the ancient manuscript in 1933. Discovered in a monastery in the Sinai desert in Egypt more than 160 years ago, the handwritten Codex Sinaiticus includes two books that are not part of the official New Testament and at least seven books that are not in the Old Testament. The New Testament books are in a different order, and include numerous handwritten corrections -- some made as much as 800 years after the texts were written, according to scholars who worked on the project of putting the Bible online. The changes range from the alteration of a single letter to the insertion of whole sentences. And some familiar -- very important -- passages are missing, including verses dealing with the resurrection of Jesus, they said. Juan Garces, the British Library project curator, said it should be no surprise that the ancient text is not quite the same as the modern one, since the Bible has developed and changed over the years. ""The Bible as an inspirational text has a history,"" he told CNN. ""There are certainly theological questions linked to this,"" he said. ""Everybody should be encouraged to investigate for themselves."" That is part of the reason for putting the Bible online, said Garces, who is both a Biblical scholar and a computer scientist. ""Scholars will want to look very closely at it, and some of the Web site functionality is specifically for them -- the ability to search the text, the ability to highlight a word, the degree of detail is particularly interesting for scholars interested in the text,"" he said. But, he added, ""It's for everyone, really a wide audience, because of curiosity, because they appreciate the value of it."" By the middle of the fourth century, when the Codex Sinaiticus was written, there was wide but not complete agreement on which books should be considered authoritative for Christian communities, according to the Web site where the Codex is posted. The Bible comes from the Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai desert, where a scholar named Constantine Tischendorf recognized its significance in 1844 -- and promptly took part of it, Garces explained. ""Constantine Tischendorf was in search for ancient manuscripts, so he appreciated the age and value of it,"" Garces said. He took a handful of pages to Germany to publish them, then returned in 1853 and in 1859 for more. On that last trip, he took 694 pages, which ended up in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet government decided to sell them in 1933 -- to raise money to buy tractors and other agricultural equipment. The British government bought the pages for £100,000, raising half the money from the public. Garces called that event one of the first fundraising campaigns in British history. Film footage from the time shows crowds of people turning out to see the manuscript, which was considered a national treasure, he said. Though the Bible has been reassembled online, in the real world it remains scattered. Most of it is in London. Eighty-six pages are held at the University Library in Leipzig, Germany, parts of 12 pages are held at the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg, and 24 pages and 40 fragments remain at St. Catherine's Monastery, recovered by the monks from the northern wall of the structure in June 1975. The manuscript contains the Christian Bible in Greek, including the oldest complete copy of the New Testament. (A copy held at the Vatican dates from about the same period.) Older copies of individual portions of the Christian Bible exist, but not as part of a complete text. The Codex also includes much of the Old Testament that was adopted by early Greek-speaking Christians. That portion includes books not found in the Hebrew Bible and regarded in the Protestant tradition as apocryphal, such as 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 & 4 Maccabees, Wisdom and Sirach. The New Testament portion includes the Epistle of Barnabas and The Shepherd of Hermas. As it survives today, Codex Sinaiticus comprises just over 400 large leaves of parchment -- prepared animal skin -- each of which measures 15 inches by 13.6 inches (380 mm by 345 mm).","Handwritten Codex Sinaiticus is more than 1,600 years old .

"(CNN) -- Seventeen people in five states have been sickened by E. coli after eating clover sprouts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's up from the 10 cases reported by the CDC in late May. No deaths have been linked to the E. coli outbreak, the CDC says, but nearly half of those sickened were hospitalized. Three cases were identified in Idaho, one in Michigan, two in Montana, one in Utah and 10 in Washington state. The CDC said the source of the E. coli outbreak is likely Evergreen Fresh Sprouts, LLC of Idaho. Twelve of the patients whom health officials interviewed reported eating raw clover sprouts from the company in the week before they became ill. Evergreen owner David Scharf told CNN affiliate KREM-TV that U.S. Food and Drug Administration tests from his farm came back negative for the strain of E. coli involved in the outbreak. ""The FDA came in looking for proof and they got proof,"" Scharf told the station. ""And we are free from the disease."" KREM reported Tuesday that FDA officials had recently found ""objectionable conditions"" at the farm despite the negative test results. Evergreen has not issued a recall, the CDC said, so the sprouts may still be available in stores. The CDC, Washington State Department of Health and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare are advising people not to eat any raw clover sprouts produced by the company. Escherichia coli is a large group of bacteria; most are harmless, while some can cause serious illness. The strain involved in the sprout-linked outbreak is Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O121. E. coli infection can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting, according to the FDA. Most people recover within seven days, but some have severe complications, the CDC said. A type of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome may result; the elderly and children under 5 are most at risk. Evergreen Fresh Sprouts was also involved in a 2011 salmonella outbreak. Consumers then were discouraged from eating the brand's alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts. Sprouts have a history of being involved in bacterial infection outbreaks. According to a study commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the warm, moist conditions that are conducive to growing bumper crops of sprouts are also an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. In the study, Kevin Allen, a microbiology professor at the University of British Columbia, tested 44 samples of prepackaged sprouts (as well as 48 samples of leafy greens and 58 samples of various herbs) and found, ""Over 78% of sprouts had levels of microorganisms too numerous to count.""

"(CNN Student News) -- Students will explore contemporary applications of the U.S. Constitution. As a class, read out loud the Preamble to the Constitution. Have students dissect the Preamble into its words and phrases, and hold a class discussion on the original intent of the U.S. Constitution. Remind students that in 1787, the framers of the U.S. Constitution established a federal system of government that divided power between the national and state governments. It also established the three branches of government: the legislative, the executive and the judicial. Federal powers listed in the Constitution include the rights to collect taxes, declare war and regulate trade. The national government also has implied powers that allow it to respond to the changing needs of the nation. Reserved powers belong to the people or the states. State powers include the right to legislate on marriage and divorce, public schools and the state's militia. The right to freedom of speech, the right to own property and the right to be tried by a jury are examples of the powers reserved for the people of the United States. The Supreme Court has the final authority to interpret the Constitution. It can overturn any law that conflicts with any part of the Constitution. Ask students: Why do you think that the framers of the Constitution organized the U.S. system of government this way? Next, organize students into five groups representing the following: the legislative branch, the executive branch, the judicial branch, the states and the people. Have each group investigate and list its powers as outlined in the U.S. Constitution: . 1. Legislative Branch -- Article I . 2. Executive Branch -- Article II . 3. Judicial Branch -- Article III . 4. States -- Article IV, Amendment 10 . 5. People -- Bill of Rights, Amendments . Then, have the students consider their groups' constitutional powers in a modern-day context. Ask: How might the system of government outlined in the U.S. Constitution be used to address current events? Brainstorm with students a list of topics in the news, such as the economy, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, health care and the environment. For each issue, have students generate critical questions that address what role, if any, government should play. (Note: The questions will vary depending on the grade level and interest of the students.) Reorganize students into groups of five, with each group having one representative from the executive, legislative and judicial branches, the states and the people. Then, assign one of the critical questions posed above to each group. Have groups prepare diagrams to illustrate what powers, if any, the federal or state governments or the people have in responding to these critical questions. Students should include the relevant text from the U.S. Constitution in their diagrams. After each group has presented its diagram, hold a class discussion on the following: . 1. Has the original intent of the Constitution changed since it was written in 1787? 2. How might the story of the U.S. read in the absence of a Constitution? 3. Why do you think that the framers of the Constitution organized the government into three branches? 4. What powers does the federal government have? What powers are reserved for the states?

"(CNN) -- Southwest Airlines was inspecting 44 planes Wednesday after an ""ambiguity related to required testing"" was found during a review of records, the airline said. Earlier this week, Southwest placed three employees on administrative leave and began conducting an internal investigation into the allegations that it flew planes without proper inspections. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which initiated an investigation months ago, issued a statement on Southwest's decision. ""This action by Southwest Airlines raises serious questions about whether [the Federal Aviation Administration] adequately followed up on the discovery a year ago that Southwest had failed to make required inspections,"" the statement said. The FAA should have ""immediately undertaken a review of the airline's records."" ""Had such a review been conducted, FAA would have found or prevented the 'ambiguity' in Southwest's maintenance, which Southwest has discovered after its own review of its records this week,"" the committee statement said. The 44 planes included five that were already out of service for scheduled maintenance checks plus one that ""was already retired,"" the company said in a news release Wednesday afternoon.  Watch what's to be expected » . Taking the other 38 planes out of service for inspection resulted in the cancellation of ""approximately 4 percent of today's Southwest flights,"" the release said. ""Due to good weather conditions, the decision caused minimal schedule disruptions and the airline is running more than 90 percent on time,"" it said. By midafternoon, it said, ""a portion of the aircraft have been inspected, cleared, and returned to service. The airline expects to have all of these aircraft inspected by early this evening."" It said other such service interruptions could occur in coming days because of ""the ongoing internal review of Southwest's maintenance programs, policies, and procedures."" Linda Rutherford, another Southwest spokeswoman, said the inspections take 90 minutes. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement released Tuesday: ""Upon learning last month of an investigation with respect to our handling of this inspection and an airworthiness directive, I immediately ordered an independent and comprehensive investigation by outside counsel."" Southwest did not say whether the inspections were of the plane's fuselages or rudders, both of which were mentioned in a CNN exclusive investigation released last week. According to detailed congressional documents obtained by CNN, Southwest Airlines flew some planes in violation of mandatory safety checks. Last week the Federal Aviation Administration initiated actions to seek a $10.2 million civil penalty against the airline for allegedly operating 46 airplanes without conducting mandatory checks for fuselage cracking. The amount of the proposed penalty ""reflects the serious nature of those deliberate violations,"" the FAA said in a statement. The FAA has said Southwest operated 46 Boeing 737s on nearly 60,000 flights between June 2006 and March 2007 while failing to comply with an FAA directive requiring repeated inspections of fuselage areas to detect fatigue cracking. The FAA also alleges that after Southwest discovered it had failed to comply, it continued to operate the same planes on an additional 1,451 flights in March 2007. The airline later found that six of the 46 planes had fatigue cracks, the FAA said. Documents provided to CNN show that another 70 Southwest jets were allowed to fly past the deadline for the mandatory rudder inspections. Those documents also say that 47 planes -- one more than reported by the FAA -- flew without their mandatory fuselage inspections. In some cases, according to the documents the FAA provided to congressional investigators, the planes flew for 30 months past government inspection deadlines and should have grounded them until the inspections could be completed. The documents were prepared by two FAA safety inspectors who have requested whistle-blower status from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Both inspectors have been subpoenaed to testify before the committee. Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minnesota, who heads the committee and who has called the situation ""one of the worst safety violations"" he has ever seen, is scheduled to hold a hearing April 3 to ask why the airline may have allegedly put its passengers in danger. The whistle-blowers say FAA managers knew about the lapse in safety at Southwest, but decided to allow the airline to conduct the safety checks on a slower schedule because taking ""aircraft out of service would have disrupted Southwest Airlines' flight schedule."" ""I am concerned with some of our findings as to our controls over procedures within our maintenance airworthiness directive and regulatory compliance processes,"" Kelly said Tuesday. ""I have insisted that we have the appropriate maintenance organizational and governance structure in place to ensure that the right decisions are being made."" In addition to putting three employees on administrative leave, Southwest has hired a consultant to review its maintenance program controls and is working closely with the FAA on its current audit of the fleet. ""These are important and necessary steps,"" Kelly said. ""We have been a safe company. I believe we are a safe company. I am committed to making sure we become safer still."" The mandatory checks for fuselage cracks were required after the cabin of an Aloha Airlines 737 tore apart in midair in 1988, killing a flight attendant. The incident was blamed on cracks in the fuselage that grew wider as the plane underwent pressure changes during flight. Southwest Airlines has never had a catastrophic crash. E-mail to a friend .

"London, England (CNN) -- A law banning the use, production, and stockpiling of cluster munitions came into effect Thursday in Britain. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged other countries to enact similar legislation, saying a global ban is needed to fight such ""cruel and indiscriminate weaponry."" The Cluster Munitions (Prohibitions) Act received royal assent Thursday after it passed through both houses of Parliament. ""Cluster munitions cause immense suffering to civilians caught in conflict zones, and leave a deadly post-conflict legacy for future generations,"" Brown said in a statement. ""I am hugely proud that with this bill receiving royal assent, Britain is leading the world in banning the use of these munitions and moving to end the harm they cause."" The act also bans direct financing of cluster munitions production. The British government has already said it plans to work with the financial sector, non-governmental organizations and others on a voluntary code of conduct to prevent indirect financing of the weapons. Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are described by the International Committee of the Red Cross as a ""persistent humanitarian problem."" Most of a device's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Credible estimates show the weapons fail between 10 percent and 40 percent of the time, leaving civilians at risk of harm from unexploded ordnance, the ICRC says. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the ICRC. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting ""no-go"" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country, where millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later. Britain is among 104 nations that have agreed to a treaty banning all cluster bombs. Thirty of those nations have ratified it, and Brown said he hoped passage of the new law would pave the way to U.K. ratification of the ban. Four of the world's biggest cluster bomb makers -- Russia, China, Israel and the United States -- have not signed the ban, claiming the devices are a vital part of their defense strategy. ""We want all other users and producers of these munitions around the world to follow in our footsteps,"" said Brown. ""We want nothing less than a full global ban on cluster munitions, with all countries signing up to the international convention. There can be no place in the international community for cruel and indiscriminate weaponry such as cluster bombs."" In addition to calling for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, the treaty calls for strong standards to protect those injured. It urges that contaminated areas be cleaned up quickly and weapons immediately destroyed, the Cluster Munition Coalition has said. The agreement, due to come into force in August, also requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, the coalition has said .","New UK law bans use, production, and stockpiling of cluster munitions .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A few days ago we observed the two-year anniversary of the earthquake that devastated Haiti, killing an estimated 220,000 people, injuring 300,000, and leaving more than 1 million homeless. Since that day, blame for Haiti's acute vulnerability and subsequent slow recovery has been traded among the government, international donors and humanitarian organizations. But for Haitians, placing blame is useless. Even the day after the earthquake, beneath the rubble and dust, still lay the joy of our people -- our beloved Haiti was still there, waiting to be rebuilt. Today, while many bemoan the slow state of recovery, communities all over Haiti are working hard, transforming the disaster into an opportunity. To be sure, there is much rebuilding work to be done, but strong Haitian women are critical to the effort and leading the way. Photos: Haiti's children, two years later . Yes, progress is slow. The statistics are staggering. More than 500,000 people are still living in tents in an estimated 758 camps. Too many families are suffering without access to clean water and health care, and a devastating cholera outbreak has killed 6,700 Haitians, with more getting sick every day. An estimated 70% of the population do not have regular employment; job opportunities remain very scarce. But two years is hardly enough time to rebuild a country that was hit so badly, and already so crippled. Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Americas, with almost 80% living below the poverty line. But now, there are very visible signs of hope: Nearly half of all earthquake rubble has been removed, for example, and some 430 kilometers (270 miles) of roads have been rebuilt or repaired. For families and communities fractured by the earthquake, progress has been less visible. They have had to come together to rebuild lives and livelihoods, often in new and creative ways. Children are going back to school and learning how to protect themselves against cholera, parents are creating small businesses and adapting to new farming methods, and community groups are developing systems to access basic services like clean water. These innovations and rebuilding strategies, which began as means of survival, are laying the groundwork for a new Haiti. Much of this groundwork is being laid locally, and by women. There are so many Haitians who are eager to do more to help their communities; they just need a small window of opportunity. There are many organizations helping to create those opportunities. Oxfam alone has seen more than 1,600 women receive literacy and budget training, and small grants to start businesses to help support their families. In the rural area of Nippes, farmers have developed 4,748 plots of land on which trees, crops, fruit, and livestock are raised together in order to maximize productivity and land use. Local groups also led an effort to rebuild a workshop in the Martissant neighborhood of greater Port-au-Prince to help more than 200 artisans restart their work as steel-craft and construction material workers. One amazing Haitian is Kenia LainÃ©, a young woman in the Artibonite River valley of northern Haiti. She is one of 4.5 million Haitians who earn their living as small-scale farmers or part of the agricultural sector. Kenia recently decided to try her hand at growing rice using a new technique called the System of Rice Intensification. SRI uses less seed, less fertilizer, and less water, and grows more rice. So Kenia found a landowner near where she lives who would allow her to experiment on a small, 100-square-meter (1,100-square-foot) plot. The other farmers teased her when she transplanted her seedlings individually in rows, spaced farther apart, instead of in clumps of four or five, which would allow them to grow stronger roots and better resist pests and diseases. Several weeks later, a heavy rain flattened the rice growing near Kenia's plot, but hers survived. By the end of October, Kenia was expecting a strong harvest, and there is suddenly a lot of interest in SRI in her community. There is now a pilot project to teach 135 farmers the SRI system. Esline Belcombe, who lost her husband in the earthquake, lives in Corail Camp with her 2-year-old daughter, her mother, and a nephew. Esline is the president of one of several water committees in Corail, a large camp of 20,000 people, where Oxfam has installed about 1.6 kilometers (a mile) of new underground piping to deliver clean water. She received training from Oxfam to manage water and sanitation facilities in her area. Her committee purchases water from a supplier and sells the water at designated kiosks, where camp residents are taught how to buy from safe sources. The profits are used to help the community buy more water and storage supplies. Esline says the key to the committee's success is managing its own system. She said, ""We want to form our own company to collect and remove rubbish, and then to employ young people who can't find work. This is our community now, and we should be responsible. I feel happy and proud to be involved in this work."" Two years later, as we commemorate the lives of family and friends lost, we begin a new chapter with much work ahead of us. For Haitians to truly survive and build a stronger country, they must be empowered. Resilience is not enough. Resilience can become resignation -- and we should fight any resignation to conditions that are unacceptable for human life. Citizens like Kenia and Esline are not ""victims"" of the earthquake. They make up a new Haiti, an aspect of life that you may not see in many of the news stories about this second anniversary. But to us, they represent the promise of a vibrant Haitian future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yolette Etienne.","Yolette Etienne: Haitians not blaming others for earthquake ruin, they're working to rebuild .

"London, England (CNN) -- The days of discussions have ended, demands issued, concesssions made and a decision finally reached -- but even before they formed a government, the UK's political parties must wait for approval from one more person: The queen. Labour leader Gordon Brown on Tuesday announced his resignation as prime minister and said he was recommending his Conservative rival David Cameron as successor. As a head of state, Queen Elizabeth has numerous traditional roles when it comes to elections and government. Although these are usually no more than ceremonial, they are a key part of the protocol without which nothing can happen. Before he could fully resign Brown asked the queen's permission. Likewise, David Cameron -- whose Conservative party is trying to form an alliance with the third placed Liberal Democrat to secure a parliamentary majority -- had to be invited by the queen to replace Brown. Full story: Political rivals jockey for power . The queen is the embodiment of Britain's constitutional monarchy and everything is done in her name. No laws can be passed nor parliaments opened or dissolved without her approval. Such strict protocols bind all stages of the process to install a new prime minister -- often with a pomp and grandeur far removed from the boisterous world of British politics. The 2006 film ""The Queen"" offered insight into this when Helen Mirren, playing the monarch, invites a nervous and kneeling Tony Blair to become prime minister after his 1997 landslide victory. In her six decade reign, Queen Elizabeth has dealt with 11 prime ministers, including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, who reputedly had a tense relationship with the monarch during the weekly audiences that are also a traditional necessity. Typically, although it is her role to anoint prime ministers, the queen does not get involved in the political process, remaining above the fray. After an election, the queen will wait to see if the current prime minister gets a majority or assembles a coalition before inviting them to form a government. Only if they admit defeat and resign can she start to look elsewhere. As negotiations to form a coalition progress, the queen will be kept informed from a distance, avoiding any direct involvement in the decision. A high level group including her private secretary and the Cabinet secretary will brief her, but she will not be drawn into controversy. But, in the unlikely event that no decision can be reached among the parties over who should become prime minister the queen does have powers to intervene. She can, in theory, call a fresh election or stop a new election being called if she thinks there is another solution. The queen has faced election hiccups before. The last was in 1974 when after days of party negotiations, she invited Labour to form a minority government. That administration lasted less than a year before Britain was back at the polls. It usually falls to royal advisers to ensure the rules work and that the queen is kept well away from the political wheeling and dealing.","British prime ministers must be invited to take up the role by the queen .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova suffered a shock defeat in the second round at Wimbledon Wednesday after being beaten by Portuguese qualifier Michelle Larcher De Brito. Third seed Sharapova, who won the tournament in 2004, was brushed aside 6-3 6-4 by a player ranked 131 in the world. The Russian appeared to be unhappy with the conditions of the grass court and fell during the second set and appeared to tell the umpire that ""this court is dangerous."" But after receiving treatment for her fall, she was unable to stave off one of the biggest Wimbledon upsets in recent years. ""I just tried to stay calm,"" Larcher De Brito told the BBC. ""I was playing so well I thought I could keep it up and I just hung in there. She's a fighter, she just wouldn't give up for anything. ""There's lot of grass that's been cut and not been swept up so there's a lot of dead grass so it's not been easy. It's a tough court to play on."" Sharapova slipped and fell on Court Two on a couple of occasions and needed a time out to receive treatment to her left hip after the eighth game of the second set. ""It was a combination of everything,"" World No. 3 Sharapova told the BBC. ""I give her a lot of credit, she played extremely well today, really solid from the baseline, I don't think I was aggressive enough. I just wasn't there."" When asked about the slippery nature of the court and her comment about the surface being dangerous, she added: ""I don't think I've ever fallen three times in a match before in my career, so that was a little strange. ""Well, after I buckled my knee three times, that's obviously my first reaction."" Sharapova also believes that players should be entitled to practice on the main courts in order to prepare for the tournament. She added: ""The first few days, you just know that they're going to just be really different."" The victory is De Brito's greatest yet with this win representing the first time she has beaten a player ranked inside the top five. The 20-year-old, who will play Karin Knapp of Italy for a place in the last 16, has never progressed past the third round of a grand slam. De Brito courted controversy in 2009 when she was criticized for her fierce shrieking and her form suffered as a result following mocking by fans. But encouraged by her father, Antonio, who also doubles up as her De Brito's coach, she bounced back with the love and help of her family. ""If you lose enough times, you think, What am I doing? That's where my family stepped in and helped me get pumped up,"" she said. ""I've been working extra hard in these practices, giving 120% in practices. My dad really pushed me a lot. ""When I was 16 I was in the top 100 and everybody was comparing me to Martina Hingis, expecting me to win a Grand Slam at that age. ""But that doesn't happen anymore, winning Grand Slams so young. Tennis is so competitive now and so hard, it's hard to stay there. ""I can't say enough good things about my father because he helped me a lot. It's easy to lose motivation. But with these wins, it's definitely going to help."" Elsewhere, ninth seed Caroline Wozniacki crashed out following a 6-2 6-2 defeat by Czech Petra Cetkovska, while former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic was beaten by 2012 junior champion Eugenie Bouchard. The Canadian prevailed 6-3 6-3 on Centre Court and will play Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro in the next round. Monica Puig is through to the third round where she will play Czech Eva Birnerova. Puig, 19, built on her first round win over fifth seed Sara Errani by defeating Silvia Soler-Espinosa of Spain 6-2 5-7 6-4. U.S star Sloane Stephens defeated Andrea Petkovic of Germany in three sets, winning 8-6 in the decider.","Maria Sharapova crashes out of Wimbledon at second round stage .

"(CNN) -- Congratulations, Jimmy Fallon. You've won the ""Tonight Show."" You start Monday. Now, what are you going to do with it? A lot is riding on the answer -- especially viewers. Jay Leno hosted ""Tonight,"" the jewel of NBC's late-night lineup, for 22 years, and though he was regularly criticized for lacking the comedic sting and interviewing skills of rival David Letterman, he topped the ratings for almost his entire run. On the other hand, Conan O'Brien, who held the job for just nine months in 2009-10, was quickly removed when his numbers didn't measure up to his sometimes out-there humor. Now comes another change, with Fallon taking Leno's spot and Seth Meyers becoming the host of ""Late Night."" Fallon is facing a much different landscape than Leno did in 1992, however -- or even the one that O'Brien dealt with in 2009. There's more competition, for one thing. Fallon's late-night rivals include Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Chelsea Handler, Arsenio Hall (again), Keith Olbermann, Bill Maher and O'Brien, among others. Also, for some viewers, not to mention the news media, there's still the shadow of the Big Man, the long-time king of ""Tonight,"" Johnny Carson. That's a lot to deal with. It's no wonder Fallon posed for New York magazine wearing -- literally -- big shoes. Having watched other late-night masters do their work through videos at New York's Paley Center for Media, he treats the job with respect. But now that he's entered the golden club of talk-show hosts, does it really matter? ""The late-night genre is the only one whose legacy means more to the on-camera talents than it does to the audience, at least on a conscious level,"" wrote TV critic Ken Tucker last year after Leno announced his retirement. ""Where the actors in sitcoms, dramas, and daytime talk shows are forever trying to justify, alter, or subvert the old forms, only talk-show hosts take upon themselves the burden of history, vowing to carry on the tradition of Carson (who is most frequently cited), even as the demo they seek to reach says, baffled, 'Carson? Carson Daly?' "" The Carson legacy . Indeed, it says a lot about the late-night landscape that there's now a whole generation who barely remembers who Johnny Carson was. When baby boomers celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Beatles on ""The Ed Sullivan Show,"" at least their children and grandchildren have some familiarity with the Fab Four, whose songs have become part of the pop cultural tapestry. Memories of Carson, on the other hand, are disappearing faster than the colors on an old 8-millimeter home movie. It's no wonder that his estate launched a YouTube channel in 2011. ""You talk to someone under the age of 25, and they've heard the name and most of them know he was on the 'Tonight Show,' but his star is fading as the people who remember him go,"" says Robert Thompson, the head of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. Which is ironic, because it was Carson who really established the template for the late-night talk show. Though he wasn't the first to host ""Tonight,"" it was Carson who became the security blanket for America for three decades, thanks to his skillful monologue, his way with guests, even his corny skits. His ""Tonight"" was also hugely popular: According to a 1978 New Yorker profile of Carson, in the mid-1970s it was attracting close to 20 million viewers. That's twice as much as the combined average audience for Leno, Letterman and Kimmel this season -- and about the same as the top-rated prime-time entertainment show of 2012-13, ""The Big Bang Theory."" But Fallon says he has a different model in mind for his ""Tonight"": the original host, Steve Allen. 'What I do is more a variety show' Allen is even less remembered than Carson these days, but his ""Tonight"" was a free-wheeling hodgepodge of chat, skits, piano-playing (Allen was a prolific composer who wrote ""This Could Be the Start of Something Big""), ad-libbing, man-on-the-street interviews and loopy stunts. In one of them, he persuaded the Marines to stage an ""invasion"" of Miami Beach. Fallon probably won't do that -- it's a different world -- but his show already has some of the qualities that Allen employed. He's a capable guitarist and musical mimic who has done dead-on parodies of Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young, among others. Bits with guests such as Michelle Obama and Justin Timberlake have gotten millions of views online, and segments such as ""Slow Jam the News"" have some of the whimsical quality that Allen was fond of. Fallon invites the comparison. ""What I do is more a variety show. It's always been older in style. I'm an old soul,"" he told The New York Times. ""I would love for Steve Allen to still be around, because I think he would say, 'This guy gets it.' "" Youthful energy . Moreover, by late-night standards, Fallon isn't ""old,"" which is another quality he has going for him. Ol' David Letterman, inspiration for so many of the current hosts, is now Old David Letterman -- he'll be 67 in April. Leno is 63. Even Stewart, 51, and Colbert, 49, are on either side of 50. Fallon, on the other hand, is 39. (Carson, incidentally, was about to turn 37 when he took over ""Tonight"" in 1962; Allen was 32 when the national ""Tonight"" started in 1954.) He's intimately familiar with the short attention spans of the Internet age and has aimed his ""Late Night"" at the sharable tendencies of the social-media cohort. That's a plus at a time when ABC's Jimmy Kimmel -- who's 46 but still has the attitude of the snarky 30-year-old he was on ""Win Ben Stein's Money"" -- was running even with Leno in the advertiser-desired 18-49 demographic. Fallon also has the hipness of his support band, the Roots, in his favor. And he's moving ""Tonight"" back to New York for the first time since Carson took it to Los Angeles, land of the cut-off Slausons, in 1972. The Michaels factor . If Fallon has a challenge, it's the crowded and splintered competition in which there's a late-night show for every taste. Like tart political monologues? You're probably watching Stewart and Colbert on Comedy Central. Fond of Hollywood dish? ""Chelsea Lately"" on E! is your spot. Love Dick Cavett- or Tom Snyder-like in-depth interviews? ""Charlie Rose"" is there for you on PBS. But he and his old ""SNL"" friend Meyers have another secret weapon: their producer, Lorne Michaels. Michaels, in fact, may be the real new king of late night. He now controls NBC's three biggest late-night shows: ""Tonight,"" ""Late Night"" and ""SNL."" He's even familiar with the new ""Late Night"" bandleader, ""SNL"" alum Fred Armisen. (Don't laugh -- Armisen is a fine musician.) Meyers, the former ""SNL"" head writer and ""Weekend Update"" anchor, may be an unknown quantity as talk-show host, but Michaels has faith. ""In my opinion, he has until next fall to find that show. He should be taking chances. It can't spring full-blown from Zeus' thigh,"" Michaels told New York magazine. Fallon, of course, has already established himself. And though he'd like to continue Leno's ratings lead, he doesn't plan on changing much from the guy who made ""Late Night"" his own. ""I don't think we have to win,"" he told The New York Times. ""I just think we have to keep doing better.""","Jimmy Fallon takes over ""Tonight Show"" on Monday .

"(CNN Student News) -- Introduction September 17, 2008 marks the 221st birthday of our government. On this date in 1787, 39 men changed the course of history by signing the U.S. Constitution. But this document is not just some relic of the past -- it continues to guide the way we live our lives. Each time there is a case that addresses the roles of the U.S. government or the rights of its people, the courts interpret the words written in the U.S. Constitution to determine whether the law is in accordance with the Constitution. . This CNN Student News One-Sheet examines some connections between four contemporary issues and the U.S. Constitution. Federal Elections and Office Requirements  In November, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 35 seats in the Senate, and the presidency are up for election. Can just anyone run for these offices? No. To serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, a person must be at least 25 years old, be a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and live in the state he or she will represent. To serve in the Senate, a person must be at least 30 years old, be a citizen for at least nine years, and live in the state he or she will represent. To serve as president, a person must be ""a natural-born citizen"", at least 35 years old, and be a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years. This year's race for the White House has produced several milestones. Hillary Clinton is the first woman to win more than one state in the primaries. Barack Obama is the first black Presidential nominee. Sarah Palin is the first Republican female vice-presidential candidate. If John McCain wins the presidency, he will become the oldest non-incumbent ever elected president. U.S. Constitution Connection: Which part of the U.S. Constitution tells us the qualifications for members of the House of Representatives and the Senate? Article I. It also tells us how long the terms are for each office and its duties. Which section of the U.S. Constitution describes the qualifications and duties of the executive branch? Article II. It also defines the Electoral College, which selects the president. Immigration One of the constitutional issues that you've heard a lot about in the news lately is immigration, or the process of coming into the U.S. Immigrants come to the U.S. for a variety of reasons: Some want to escape political or religious persecution; some come to the U.S. to work; others come here for an education. Some immigrants enter the U.S. through legal means, with the paperwork that the U.S. government requires. Others enter illegally. The main difference between an immigrant and a U.S. citizen is that a citizen can vote and hold office. But an immigrant can become a citizen through a process called naturalization. Who decides what rights immigrants have and what laws restrict immigration? That's up to Congress. This past spring and summer, there was much debate in Congress over immigration, and there were demonstrations around the U.S. on both sides of the issue. U.S. Constitution Connection:  Which amendment to the U.S. Constitution defines citizenship? The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, defines U.S. citizens as ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States."" Gun Control From 1976 until this year, Washington, D.C. did not allow residents to own handguns. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in June with the District of Columbia v. Heller decision. The Court decided that the U.S. Constitution does guarantee an individual the right to own firearms. However, this does not mean that all gun regulation is unconstitutional. U.S. Constitution Connection:  What part of the U.S. Constitution is at the heart of the gun control debate? The Second Amendment states, ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Many who favor gun control interpret this amendment to mean that states shall keep militias, but that an individual's rights to own firearms may be restricted. Gun rights advocates argue that this amendment ensures individuals the right to own firearms without restrictions. Habeas Corpus  Habeas corpus provides detainees with the right to question the reason for their detention. Do suspected terrorists and foreign fighters held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay retain this right? In 2006, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act that stripped detainees of their habeas corpus rights by declaring that these prisoners are not within the federal courts' jurisdiction, and that the leased military base in Cuba is outside U.S. borders. Federal courts affirmed the MCA. In June, the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision, ruling that Guantanamo Bay is within the jurisdiction of U.S. law, and that foreign prisoners held by the U.S. military do have a right to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts. U.S. Constitution Connection:  What part of the U.S. Constitution rules on habeas corpus? Article I not only defines the duties of Congress, but also the limitations placed on it.

"(CNN) -- Sheikh Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the head of Sunni Islam's top learning center, died of a heart attack on Wednesday in Saudi Arabia, Egyptian state-run television reported. He was 82. Tantawi, considered a moderate, was the grand imam at Al-Azhar -- an Islamic center and university in Cairo, Egypt. He played a similar role in the Sunni Muslim world as the pope does for Catholics, involving life issues. The center's importance in Islam is such that in June when U.S. President Barack Obama gave his one-and-only speech solely directed to Muslims, he delivered it from Al-Azhar. Tantawi was appointed by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak in 1996. Although appointed by the Government, Tantawi was regarded as the spiritual leader of about one billion Sunni Muslims worldwide. His mainstream Islamic views, such as those on suicide bombing, were criticised by Islamists. He condemned suicide bombing during speech in 2003 at a conference in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. He attacked Islamists for using Islam and jihad, or holy struggle, for their own ends and called on Muslims to open themselves to dialogue with the West. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .","Tantawi was the grand imam at Al-Azhar Islamic center in Cairo, Egypt .

"(CNN) -- Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to spend $50 million of his own money to build a state-by-state grass-roots network focused on stemming the tide of gun violence by expanding the background check system for gun buyers. His new organization, Everytown for Gun Safety, will bring together Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Actions for Gun Sense in America, two gun control groups he already funds. Everytown for Gun Safety will focus on 15 states because, Bloomberg says, we've got to work at gun control ""piece by piece."" There's no disputing that gun violence in America needs to be tackled. Bloomberg is making a sizable investment, $30 million more than what the NRA -- the largest U.S. lobby group for gun rights -- spent in the 2012 election cycle. But there are two problems. First, do we want mega-rich individuals to influence public policy or sway voters with their wealth? And, second, just as we need a federal immigration policy instead of piecemeal state legislation, don't we need a federal gun control policy? I grew up in a family that owned guns. My father was a homicide detective and a member of the police department's SWAT team. He was also a hunter, as was my maternal grandfather. My stepfather, as a member of the Air Force, was well-trained in firearms. As a child, I was taught the basics of gun safety, and I often accompanied one of these men when they honed their hunting skills through target practice or skeet shooting. Even though I was familiar with guns, they scared me, and I often worried that my father would be fatally shot by a criminal. This worry ended when he retired from the police force, but my fear of guns persisted. The recent fatal shootings at Fort Hood and the Jewish Center in Kansas City have again brought my gun fears to the surface. I do not welcome the fears, but I do appreciate how the shootings have renewed the debate about gun control in Washington. Perhaps Bloomberg's new gun control group will fuel the debate further. Bloomberg isn't the only one who cares about this issue, but he may be the most prominent. We need more big voices to get involved in solving the problem of senseless gun violence in America. But we also need to get some basic facts straight. -- Guns kill. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reports that an average of 86 people are killed by guns every day in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that between 2000 and 2010, more than 300,000 people died from guns. -- Guns are the most common weapon used in murders and manslaughters. Handguns comprised 72.5% of the firearms used in murder and non-negligent manslaughter incidents in 2011: 4.1% were with shotguns, 3.8% were with rifles,18.5% were with unspecified firearms. -- Children are often victims of gun violence. Eighty-two children under 5 years old died from firearms in 2010, and half of all juveniles killed in the same year were killed with a gun. As reported by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, nearly three times more children were injured by firearms in 2010 than the number of U.S. soldiers wounded in action the same year in the war in Afghanistan. -- Guns kill young African-American men more than anything else. In deaths of 15- to 24-year-olds, firearms homicide rates in the United States are about 43 times higher than in other developed countries, and for young African-American men ages 15-24, it's the leading cause of death. For African-American male youth, firearms homicides surpass unintentional injuries, cancer, HIV and other diseases combined. Of course, gun rights advocates often point out that people don't need guns to kill. They can use other weapons such as knives. This is true, but in practice people are nowhere near as likely to get killed with a knife. In America, of 14,022 homicides in 2011, 11,101 were committed with firearms. The rate of fatality is nearly four times higher when someone uses a gun rather than a knife to assault another person. Stronger background screenings of potential gun owners would be a good start to curtailing firearm deaths. A study to be published in a forthcoming issue of Journal of Urban Health shows that when Missouri repealed a handgun law in 2007 that required all handgun purchasers to verify that they had passed a background check, the murder rate increased by 16%, adding 55 to 63 murders per year. Even before the results of the study were released, many Americans -- including most gun owners -- supported universal background checks. That's just one reason for Congress to pick up the issue of gun control again. Another is that since the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which was the last time there was a serious debate about gun control, there have been 44 more school shootings and 28 deaths. Now that the debate has again been sparked, let's try to find ways that would both preserve individual rights and make guns less responsible for deaths. A common sense approach is offered in the 2013 book ""Reducing Gun Violence in America: Informing Policy with Evidence and Analysis"" by Daniel Webster and Jon Vernick, with a forward by Michael Bloomberg. We should strengthen background checks, ban assault weapons and magazines that fire more than 10 rounds, and fund research on what actually works to end gun violence. If you agree, please follow something my father, an avid gun lover, liked to say: We need to make it tough to get guns because too many careless people use them to end petty arguments and squabbles. Let's not try to do it state by state. Let's take a stance as a nation.","Michael Bloomberg is spending $50 million to stem the tide of gun violence .
