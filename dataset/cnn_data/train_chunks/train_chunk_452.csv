"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:25 PM on 20th August 2011 . Egypt says it will recall its ambassador from Israel in protest over the deaths of Egyptian troops reportedly killed by Israeli soldiers. Israel has pledged to investigate the incident and this afternoon its defence minister Ehud Barak said it deeply regretted the deaths. Today crowds have gathered outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo in protest. The deaths occurred on Thursday when militants from Gaza crossed . into southern Israel through the Egyptian desert and launched a deadly . attack that killed eight Israelis. Wounded Israeli soldiers are treated at the site of a shooting attack along the border between Israel and Egypt on Thursday . At least three Egyptian troops were . killed in a subsequent shootout in the Red Sea resort of Eilat between Israeli soldiers pursuing the . militants along the Israeli-Egypt border. Officials in Egypt have demanded an apology saying the country was 'politically and legally responsible' for the deaths. The decision to recall envoy Yasser Reda has escalated tensions between the two neighbouring countries. Their landmark 1979 peace treaty is being tested by the fall of Egypt's longtime autocratic leader, Hosni Mubarak. Egypt's interim government accused . Israel of violating that treaty with its raid that killed the Egyptian . troops in the Sinai Peninsula. Israeli emergency personnel stand near a bus after it was ambushed about 30 km north of the Red Sea resort of Eilat on Thursday . Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Israeli government was holding consultations on the Egyptian move. While relations between the two countries have been chilly since Egypt became the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel in 1979, Israel valued Mubarak as a source of stability with shared interests in containing Iran and its radical Islamic proxies in the region - including Hamas. Several political parties issued statements condemning the Israeli raid and calling for changes to the peace treaty, which regulates the number of Egyptian troops allowed in the Sinai Peninsula. The Muslim Brotherhood, which is Egypt's best-organized political force, said 'this crime should be dealt with in an appropriate way,' adding that 'what was possible before the revolution, will not be tolerated to continue after the revolution.' Israeli officials insisted the peace treaty was 'stable' despite the rocky developments. The agreement called for Israel to return the captured Sinai to Egypt. In return, Egypt agreed to certain restrictions on the number of troops placed in Sinai. 'No one had any intention to harm Egyptian security personnel,' Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli Defence Ministry official who works closely with Egypt, told Israel Radio. 'The question is what happened in the field and that is what is being investigated.' The cross-border attack has raised concerns about the increasingly lawless northern Sinai Peninsula, whose borders with both Israel and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip make it an attractive staging ground for Palestinian militant attacks on Israel. Egypt last week moved thousands of troops into the Sinai Peninsula as part of a major operation against al-Qaeda inspired militants who have been increasingly active since Mubarak's ouster. A security official said 22 Islamic militants have been arrested. Israel says Gaza militants armed with guns, explosives, mortars and an anti-tank missile, killed eight Israelis in a roadside ambush after infiltrating Israel through Sinai. The Egyptian troops were killed as Israeli soldiers went after suspected militants who fled back into Egypt. Israel has offered conflicting accounts about how the Egyptians were killed. But the Egyptian Cabinet, in a strongly worded statement, held Israel 'politically and legally responsible for this incident,' saying lax security on its side allowed the ambush to take place. 'The Egyptian ambassador to Israel will be withdrawn until we are notified about the results of an investigation by the Israeli authorities,' the Cabinet statement said, demanding an immediate probe. It said Egypt would take all measures and send reinforcements to protect its borders and 'to respond to any Israeli military activity at the Egyptian borders.' It was the first time in nearly 11 years that Egypt decided to withdraw its ambassador from Israel. The last time was in November 2000 when the Egyptians protested what they called excessive use of violence during the second Palestinian uprising.",Israel 'regrets' the deaths and promises an inquiry .
"By . David Derbyshire . Last updated at 10:38 PM on 18th July 2011 . Animal testing for household products such as bleach, washing-up liquid and air fresheners could soon be banned. Ministers yesterday took the first steps towards ending experiments on rabbits, mice and other laboratory animals. Testing of cosmetics on animals has been illegal in Britain since 2008. 'Unacceptable': Testing on animals often causes illness or even death . Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said inflicting pain and suffering on animals to manufacture household products was ‘unacceptable’. The tests involve giving animals toxic doses of chemicals or  rubbing irritants into their skin. Unacceptable: Lynne Featherstone said that testing on animals was wrong . The Government had previously said it wanted a ban, and yesterday announced it was consulting with companies, trade bodies and other interested parties to draw up a detailed proposal. Mrs Featherstone said: ‘We believe it is possible to sell household products  without inflicting pain and suffering on  animals, and it is unacceptable that  testing in this area continues. ‘We propose to implement a ban through our licensing powers, and we are inviting stakeholders to share their views so we can end this practice as soon as possible.’ The move was given a guarded welcome by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) which has campaigned to end animal testing for cosmetics and household products. Chief executive Michelle Thew said: ‘The BUAV welcomes the reaffirmation of the intention to ban testing on animals for house products, although we are concerned by the Government’s continued uncertainty about which products will be covered and the absence of a firm date to implement the ban. ‘It is unacceptable for animals to  continue to suffer and die for a new  washing-up liquid or air freshener.’ It is likely to be several months before the ban is brought in. The consultation will last 12 weeks. More than 7,000 animals were used for testing of household products like air freshener between 1997 and 2006 . The proposal is part of wider plans to reduce the use of animals in research – and switch to tests on laboratory grown cell cultures and computer modelling. If there are no alternatives, the Government wants to reduce suffering. Last week the Home Office revealed that the number of animals used in scientific and medical experiments has gone up by one million in the past decade. Most of the rise is caused by the creation of genetically modified mice and fish for medical research.","After cosmetic ban, Home Office to outlaw 'unacceptable' tests for household products ."
"By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 6:18 PM on 19th August 2011 . Banking stocks suffered a day of volatility as the morning's wave of market turmoil wiped 2.5 per cent from the value of the FTSE 100 Index. Recession fears and speculation of a short-term funding crisis in the European banking system ensured the top flight index remained under pressure after losing £62 billion or 4.5 per cent yesterday. The FTSE 100 fell as low as 4929.5 before steadying later in the session to stand 129 points lower at 4963.1. Traders were braced for another slump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after it closed more than 3 per cent lower last night. And despite a hint of an afternoon rebound, the London market closed 49.46 points (or 0.97 per cent) down, at 5,042.77. The tumbling figures were mirrored by European markets, with Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan stock markets, also showing losses. Wipe out: The FTSE plummeted today to 4,935 points as panic rippled through the banks . The latest downturn for world markets . followed a gloomy report from economists at investment bank Morgan . Stanley, which slashed its forecasts for global growth. But eurozone debt fears, poor . economic data in the US, and fears over China raising interest rates and . limiting its demand, all played their part in Thursday's rout. Banking stocks were again the major . casualties as the FTSE 100 Index slipped down again to below  the 5,000 . barrier, tumbling to 4,935 points. The volatile FTSE opened at 5,083 and after fluctuating, sank to 4,935 points. Last night the US benchmark Dow Jones . Industrial Average sank 3.7 per cent after London's FTSE 100 fell 4.5 per cent - the . 12th biggest points fall in its history - and wiping more than £62 . billion off the value of leading shares. Oil . prices fell to near $79 a barrel in Asia, extending a major sell-off . fueled by investor fears that slowing global growth will undermine . demand for crude. Despite the plummeting figures, there was still a willingness to invest, with U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard buying Cambridge-based data . search specialist Autonomy in a deal worth £7.1billion. The dollar was higher against the euro but down against the yen. Wall Street was headed for a slide, . with Dow Jones industrial futures down 1.5 per cent to 10,849 and S&P 500 . futures slipping 1.7 per cent to 1,123.80. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index . was the worst performer in Asia, falling 6.2 per cent, its lowest . close in nearly a year. A trader in Germany reacts the slump on European markets continued today . Plummeting: This graph shows how the FTSE crashed yesterday by 5 per . cent yesterday against a backdrop of the euro zone crisis and damaging U.S. unemployment figures . In the last five years, the lowest ebb of the FTSE was on March 9, 2009, when it plunged to 3,493 points. Today's drop to 4,935 is the second lowest. Yesterday the stock market suffered . its biggest collapse as the global economy . plunged deeper into crisis, wiping billions off the value of Britain's . leading companies. Every blue-chip firm listed in London . fell in the worst single day of trading in three years, since the dark days of 2008 when . investment bank Lehman Brothers imploded. As . analysts spoke of 'a tidal wave of selling', the FTSE 100 index fell . 239.37 points to 5092.23 – a drop in value of £62.3billion. These graphs show how global markets sharply dropped yesterday, with the FTSE plummeting to 5,092 points . Despair may have engulfed the markets, but one British entrepreneur found himself £300million richer yesterday. Dr Mike Lynch, the son of an Essex fireman, saw his software firm Autonomy sold to U.S. giant Hewlett-Packard for £7billion. The deal values his 8.1 per cent stake in the FTSE 100 firm at £567million. It was worth just under £284million before the takeover bid was announced. It is an extraordinary success for Dr Lynch, who began work on the firm when he was writing his post-doctoral thesis at Cambridge University on 18th century theologian Thomas Bayes, who tried to prove the existence of God through mathematics. Autonomy now has more than 16,000 clients worldwide including Nasa, Procter & Gamble, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The technology Dr Lynch developed allows computers to analyse data across a range of media, making it useful for tracking down fraud or even searching for terrorists. And Europe followed suit yesterday, with the German stock market . fell 5.8 per cent, Paris dropped 5.5 per cent and the Dow Jones . Industrial  Average dropped 3.9 per cent in  New York. The Lehman debacle tipped the global . economy into recession – and fears are mounting that the developed world . is on the brink of another devastating downturn. One reason for the panic was the . revelation that a lender in the eurozone was forced to go cap in hand to . the European Central Bank for £300million in emergency funding. Analysts said the 'worrying' development showed banks are too nervous to lend to each other – just as . they were at the height of the financial crisis. Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley . warned that the United States and the eurozone are 'hovering . dangerously close to recession'. Investors are also increasingly . concerned about the health of the banking system in Europe as the . debt-crisis crippling the single currency bloc rumbles on. Officials at the Bank of England said the exaggerated sense of fear in the markets may be holding back the recovery. As investors panic about the markets, they have turned to gold. The precious metal has hit a new record above $1,860 as investors reach for the safety of bullion amid a worsening economic outlook for the United States and fears about the health of Europe's banks. After opening this morning at $1,823, the spot gold price reached an all-time high of $1,867 shortly after. Yesterday, it had reached a new high of $1,826. The metal had hit nine record highs, and risen nearly 14 per cent so far this month -- its best month since September 1999. Damaging confidence: Analysts say German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's plans to bail out debt-ridden eurozone members would disproportionately hit the UK . The man who became a hate figure to . many in Britain for designing the modern European Union yesterday . admitted that it was now 'on the edge of the precipice'. Jacques Delors, 86, a federalist . Frenchman, used his time as European Commission chief in the 1980s to . expand its power over national governments and pave the way for the . single European currency. Dark days: Today's jobless figures have done nothing for Barack Obama's domestic standing . Will Hedden, at IG Index in London, said: 'Panic selling accelerated in the biggest losing day yet of this summer sell-off. 'The fear factor has reached boiling . point. Banking stocks have been decimated across Europe, with . indiscriminate selling even in banks that maintain that their exposure . to the crisis is slim. 'No sector is surviving this tidal wave of selling.' The financial markets have been rocked . by a crisis of leadership in recent weeks as politicians on both sides . of the Atlantic failed to come up with policies to tackle debts and . promote growth. The FTSE 100 index has lost 1,000 points, or £260billion of its value, since its 2011 peak in February. The majority of the slump has taken place this month in one of the most bruising episodes in stock market history. It has hit the value of retirement . pots for millions and left investors across the country nursing heavy . losses. UK bank shares were the worst hit in London yesterday with . taxpayer-supported Royal Bank of Scotland down 11.3 per cent and Lloyds . Banking Group down 9.3 per cent. The shares are worth less than half . what they were when the Government bailed the banks out – meaning UK . taxpayers are sitting on losses of £34.5billion in the two companies. The European banking sector has lost . 30 per cent of its value this year. French banks were back in the firing . line yesterday with Societe Generale down 11.6 per cent. It came after . the ECB provided more than £300million of emergency funds to an unnamed . lender – the first such loan since February. 'This shows that the situation has escalated,' said Citigroup analyst Juergen Michels. Morgan Stanley cut its global growth . forecasts for this year from 4.2 per cent to 3.9 per cent and for 2012 . from 4.5 per cent to 3.8 per cent. 'The path now looks even more bumpy, . below-par and brittle than previously thought,' said Joachim Fels, who . co-heads Morgan Stanley's global economic team.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:41 PM on 19th August 2011 . Anders Breivik flanked by police officers arrives at a court hearing in Oslo today . Mass killer Anders Breivik was due in court today as relatives of the 69 people he gunned down gathered on the island of Utoya to pay their respects. Breivik arrived at the Oslo courthouse for a closed hearing to discuss the conditions of his detention. He had asked to wear a black tuxedo to the session but the request was rejected by the Oslo District Court, which described it as 'unnecessarily disturbing and provocative'. Police, who have so far stated they believe he acted alone, say they want to prevent him communicating with any potential accomplices  . Officers are understood to be asking for an extension of terms allowing them to hold Breivik in isolation. A four-week limit on solitary confinement is due to expire on Monday. Police say the isolation conditions are helping them find out just what happened. Meanwhile about 500 relatives of the 69 people killed on Utoya gathered on the island to mourn their losses and to hear from police exactly where and how their loved ones were killed. Paying their respects: Relatives of many of the victims arrive on Utoya. Breivik shot 69 people at the youth camp. A further eight were killed in a bomb attack in central Oslo . Procession: Around 500 relatives made the trip to hear from police exactly where and how their loved ones were killed . Accompanied by police officers and a team of psychiatrists the group, many of whom donned white disposable rain wear to protect them from the bad weather, made a sombre procession across the island. They were shown the exact spots where their loved ones were brutally gunned down by Breivik during the massacre last month. Some of the terrified victims tried to hide under beds or in the woods while others jumped into the lake and attempted to swim to the mainland. Ketil Haukaas, deputy director of . Norway's National Investigation Service, said: 'We will show them . exactly where the people were found and give them details from the . forensics investigation. Some of the teenagers who survived the attack are due to visit the . island on Saturday and on Sunday a large memorial service will be held . in Oslo's Spektrum. Last week Breivik, accompanied by a police team, retraced the route he took across the island on the day of the killings. If found guilty on terrorism charges he faces 21 years in prison. Breivik has admitted killing 77 people last month, including eight in a bombing in central Oslo. The 32-year-old right-wing extremist . denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to . save Norway and Europe. Earlier this week it emerged he had . prepared a second bomb that was bigger than the one which detonated in . Oslo killing eight people. A boat carrying the relatives of the 69 people killed on Utoya arrives at the island. A team of psychiatrists were on hand to offer support . At a court hearing today Breivik was due to find out whether he will have to spend also the next four weeks in isolation at Ila prison near Oslo . Military sources discovered a 3,300lb device at his farm around 85 miles north of the city. By comparison, the bomb which went off in the capital weighted 2,095lbs according to estimates. Yesterday authorities released the contents of two phone calls that Breivik made to police during the island massacre. In the first call he describes himself as 'commander Anders Behring Breivik, of the Norwegian anti-communist resistance movement'. In his second, made one minute before his arrest, he tells the police operator: 'I have completed my operation and want to give myself up.'

"By . Ross Mccarthy . Last updated at 7:45 AM on 19th July 2011 . Cheslin is seen leaving court following the surprise verdict . A bogus model agent who urged a 12-year-old to pose for pictures in her underwear has avoided a jail sentence despite being branded a danger to young girls. Nathan Cheslin called himself 'Emily' to reel in the schoolgirl with a discussion about becoming a model through the MSN online message service. He later reverted to the name 'Nathan' and checked she had a webcam before asking her to put on a 'party dress' and high heels. Birmingham Crown Court heard Cheslin then sent her pictures of another girl in her underwear as an indication of how he wanted her to pose. The 21-year-old, of Lindridge Drive, Sutton Coldfield, had previously admitted inciting a child to participate in child pornography, seven charges of making indecent photos and six of distributing them. Judge William Davis QC said he constituted a danger to teenage girls. But he handed Cheslin a three-year community order, saying he believed that was the best way of addressing his problems and protecting the public. Paul Dhami, prosecuting, said the police were called after the 12-year-old told Cheslin she felt uncomfortable with the underwear request. He begged her not to alert the . authorities and, a short time later, contacted the girl as 'Emily' saying 'Nathan' had been sacked. A police investigation later revealed both user names were registered to Cheslin's home address. His home was raided and officers recovered a number of items including a laptop which held evidence of several webchats, along with indecent pictures and films of children - one of a 13-year-old girl carrying out an indecent act over a webcam. Cheslin escaped a prison sentence after his hearing at Birmingham Crown Court . Mr Dhami said it was also discovered that some photos and films had been uploaded to a site that could be shared by others. Phillip Brunt, defending, said Cheslin had a difficult educational history and had recently been diagnosed with Aspergers.","Nathan Cheslin called himself 'Emily' on internet chat to lure victims .

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 1:30 PM on 19th July 2011 . A battle of the banking giants has begun . after Barclaycard introduced a record 24 months of interest-free credit for . balance transfers. The move by the UK's biggest credit card . provider comes in response to a 20-month interest-free card launched by . Halifax. The deals could offer a lifeline to . thousands of Britons who are being saddled with punishing interest bills due to . large credit card debts. Balance transfer war: Barclaycard has launched its Platinum card with a two-year 0 per cent transfer period . However, there are questions over how many . customers will be accepted by the credit card providers. And critics have argued that the lengthy . interest-free deals could encourage the reckless 'spend now, pay later' attitude that leads shoppers into debt in the first place. The new Barclaycard Platinum Extended . Balance Transfer Visa carries a fee of 2.8 per cent of the sum being moved on . to the card, but offers £20 cashback for customers who transfer a balance of . more than £3,000 directly through the Barclaycard website. Michelle Slade, of personal finance . website Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: 'At 0 per cent for 24 months, the new deal from . Barclaycard is the longest balance transfer deal ever offered on the market. 'In the last year, the number of longer . term balance transfer deals has soared as competition has returned to  the . credit card market.' MBNA and Virgin Money already offer 0 per . cent for 19 months. Miss Slade pointed out that while there is . no interest on the balance transfers, any new purchases made with these cards . will attract interest at an average rate of 18.7 per cent. Hannah-Mercedes Skenfield, credit card . spokesman at Moneysupermarket.com, said: 'Over the last week, we have seen the . credit card wars really hotting up with Halifax introducing a 20-month balance . transfer deal. Temptation: Critics have argued lengthy interest-free deals could encourage the reckless 'spend now, pay later' attitude that leads shoppers into debt in the first place. (Posed by models) 'However, Barclaycard has responded immediately with a deal that . blows all others out of the water, a staggering two-year interest-free on . balance transfers - a UK first. 'It is difficult to see how this deal can . be bettered. Barclaycard's latest 24-month product charges a competitive 2.8 . per cent balance transfer fee. 'This means a consumer making just the . minimum payments on a UK average card balance of £2,221 could save up to £597 . over the lifetime of the promotional deal, even once the balance transfer deal . has been factored in. 'This is a fantastic deal for consumers . looking to consolidate existing credit card debt, but anyone going down this . road needs to remember to avoid making purchases on the card or . they risk losing their promotional zero per cent rate and could end up . getting stung with hefty interest payments. 'To avoid this, customers should set up a . direct debit to pay off at least the minimum amount each month.' Stefan Maryniak, personal finance expert . at uSwitch.com, said the competition among card companies would benefit . consumers who are trying to clear their debts. However, he warned: 'The devil lies in the . detail. Having a market leading product is only great for customers if they can . get it. 'Barclaycard's previous 20-month balance . transfer proposition proved hard to get for customers without a squeaky clean . credit rating. 'Having now stretched the balance transfer . period to a staggering two years, it remains to be seen just how many of those . who apply for the card will actually be accepted.

"By . David Williams . Last updated at 8:52 AM on 20th July 2011 . Muammar Gaddafi gave the go-ahead for a Libyan delegation to meet U.S. representatives in Tunisia yesterday . American officials have held a secret meeting with Colonel Gaddafi’s aides, telling them he must go before there can be an end to Nato bombing raids. After the first face-to-face contact between the two sides since the start of the four-month war, the U.S. said there had been simply the delivery of a ‘firm message that the only way to move forward is for Gaddafi to step down’. The move was seen as increasing the pressure on the beleaguered Libyan leader at a time when rebels are said to be making ‘firm progress’ in their military operations. Rebels are said to have taken over the oil hub of Brega following intense fighting over the weekend that left at least 40 dead. France has also held talks with Libyan officials and demanded that Gaddafi not only step down but go into exile. But French Defence Minister Gerard Longuet said: ‘I am cautious because Gaddafi is not rational and he could opt for a bunker strategy, taking the whole civilian population of Tripoli hostage.’ In response to international demands, Libyan government spokesman Ibrahim Moussa said: ‘Any dialogue with the French, Americans, British is welcome... we will discuss everything, but do not condition your peace talks. 'Let Libyans decide their future.’ Last week more than 30 nations, including the U.S., dealt Gaddafi a major blow by recognising the rebels’ National Transitional Council as a legitimate government, releasing billions of pounds in assets that had been previously frozen. However, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday that he believes compromise between Libyan rebels and the government is still possible. He criticised Western states for taking sides by recognising the rebel leadership as legitimate government, emphasising that Moscow is in contact with both groups. Rebel forces fire artillery guns at Gaddafi's troops 37 miles west of Ajdabiyah, in eastern Libya, yesterday . Rebel fighters, who claim to have taken the oil port of Brega, take a break in fighting to pray yesterday . After a long period of stalemate in . the desert along the eastern front, the rebels said they had routed most . of Gaddafi's troops in Brega to the west, which has an oil refinery and . terminal, and encircled the town. Rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said its streets were strewn with landmines, making it hard to secure full control. 'The main body (of Gaddafi's forces) retreated to Ras Lanuf,' which lies to the west, he said by telephone . from the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Plumes of smoke rise into the air after rebels fire on government forces near Ajdabiyah yesterday . The government denied the claim. Spokesman Ibrahim Moussa said: 'Our brave soldiers are in Brega in their thousands and control it completely.' He said the government had lost 30 soldiers over five days of fighting, but rebels had lost many times more.

"British boy, 16, arrested in south London . Arrests made across 10 states in the U.S . Raids on three New York homes of hacking suspects . By . Rebecca Camber . Last updated at 11:59 AM on 21st July 2011 . A British schoolboy of 16 has been arrested as part of a global crackdown on two computer hacking groups that laid siege to the CIA and PayPal. Police have carried out dozens of raids in Britain, Holland and America in a dramatic swoop on those suspected of masterminding attacks by hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec. Fourteen people were arrested in the U.S. by the FBI and four were held in Holland on Tuesday over a cyber attack on the online payment service PayPal, used by millions of British consumers to make secure money transfers for purchases. Stepping up the fight: FBI agents with search warrants take away items from a home on Long Island where a suspected member of the hacking group Anonymous lives . The attack was believed to have been motivated by the company’s decision to stop processing donations to WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange. Yesterday detectives were quizzing the 16-year-old boy who was arrested in south London on suspicion of involvement in attacks by both Anonymous and LulzSec. Officers from the Met were last night analysing computer equipment seized from his address. Anonymous, which formed in 2003, is a loosely organised group of hackers sympathetic to WikiLeaks. It has claimed responsibility for attacks against corporate and government websites worldwide. Shadowy figures: A member of the Anonymous at work with two laptops . Targeted: PayPal payment service was hit by the attacks . The group claimed credit for disrupting the websites of Visa and MasterCard in an operation named ‘Operation Avenge Assange’. It came after the companies stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks following its release of thousands of classified U.S. State Department cables in November last year. Police believe the British teenager may also be involved in LulzSec, a smaller hacking group which splintered from Anonymous in April this year and embarked on a two-month spree of cyber attacks on bodies including the CIA, the U.S. Senate and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. Public face: Anonymous members have become known for wearing the Guy Fawkes masks on outings . The shadowy group has also targeted the NHS, the games firm Sony, Telecoms giant AT&T and most recently the website of The Sun newspaper, publishing a spoof story that claimed owner Rupert Murdoch was dead. Yesterday FBI agents executed more than 35 search warrants as part of its investigation into the hacking of major companies and government organisations. In the U.S., 14 people were indicted for involvement in a ‘denial of service’ attack on the PayPal website in early December 2010. The accused, including 11 men and two women aged between 20 and 42, were arrested in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio. The charge of intentional damage to a protected computer carries a maximum penalty of ten years in jail and a $250,000 fine in America. The FBI also arrested a customer support contractor who was charged with stealing confidential business information on AT&T’s servers. A man suspected of involvement in LulzSec’s attack on a security website linked to the FBI was also held. The 16-year-old is the second British teenager to be held recently over allegations of cyber-crime. Last month Ryan Cleary, 19, was charged with five counts of hacking related to a series of attacks against Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry and the British Phonographic Industry. He is also suspected of involvement in hacking attacks on the CIA. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Officers from the Met Police’s computer e-Crime unit arrested a 16-year-old male on suspicion of breaching the Computer Misuse Act 1990. ‘He was arrested at an address in south London and remains in custody at a central London police station.’ Suspect: Ryan Cleary pictured with with his mother Rita outside Southwark Crown Court on June 27th after being charged with hacking .","British boy, 16, arrested in south London .

"By . Jenny Hope . Last updated at 8:09 AM on 22nd August 2011 . The indignity of mixed-sex hospital wards may at last be coming to an end after a startling fall in the number of patients put in them. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the Health Service had done a 'fantastic job' after it was revealed that numbers accommodated on such wards fell by 90 per cent in the space of a few months. The news follows years of broken  promises by Labour and is a dramatic victory for the Daily Mail which has consistently fought to bring to an end the NHS practice of mixing men and women patients. No longer the norm: Mixed sex wards are now in the minority . Backed by patients' groups, the Mail . has argued that being forced to share wards with the opposite sex is . undignified – and puts women at risk. Figures show that last December more . than 11,000 patients were forced to share wards with the opposite sex, . when the monthly collection of mixed-sex accommodation data was first . introduced. Since then the number of reported . breaches – when a patient stayed overnight in shared accommodation – has . fallen by 90 per cent. Just 1,126 in England were made to sleep on mixed sex wards last month – a record low. More than two thirds of hospitals reported zero cases, with the North-East becoming the first region to report none at all. Of the 167 trusts that reported, 115 (69 per cent) had no breaches in July. Shortly after the Coalition came to . power, Mr Lansley announced tough new measures to stamp out the . humiliation endured by thousands of patients having to share wards, . toilets and bathrooms with the opposite sex. In April he brought in fines of £250 . for each day a patient had to sleep in a mixed-sex ward, which appears . to have galvanised NHS managers. Previously, the levels of fines varied considerably and were inconsistently levied. Fighting for dignity: How the Mail's campaign led the way . It is 15 years since Tony Blair first . called for the abolition of mixed wards – a year before he became prime . minister – saying it should not be 'beyond the collective wit of . ministers' to achieve. However, despite a pledge to ban them . in its 1997 and 2001 election manifestos, and a fining system, Labour . eventually concluded it would be too expensive to get rid of them all. It was agreed that in some cases men . and women could share a ward if they were separated using partitioned . bays. In recent years, a number of female patients have been assaulted . by men on such wards. When the Coalition came to power last . year, it promised to scrap mixed accommodation in all trusts from acute . hospitals to mental health units. Only intensive care and A&E units have exemptions. 'Fantastic job': Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, hailed the NHS for 'getting to grips' with the problem . Mr Lansley said: 'The NHS has done a fantastic job getting to grips with this.' He said any future capital investments . in NHS hospitals – whether brand new developments or refurbishments – . should look to ensure a minimum of half their beds in single en-suite . rooms. He said: 'Single-sex accommodation is . what people can now expect. By introducing greater transparency, this . Government has driven down breaches by 90 per cent in eight months.' The . rules do allow wards to be segregated into distinct bays as long as . they have separate facilities. Katherine Murphy, director of the . Patients Association, said; 'It's embarrassing that it took the threat . of fines to get managers to respect the human rights of individual . patients. 'Ideally the number of breaches should . be at zero everywhere. On occasions mixed-sex accommodation may be . necessary, but it should be a rarity not the everyday occurrence it was . in the past.' The Daily Mail has been campaigning . for 17 years to scrap mixed-sex wards – the use of which has continued . despite a series of Labour pledges. Distressing calls to the Patients . Association helpline told of elderly women being forced to share . toilets, bathrooms and sleeping areas with men, with only a curtain for . privacy and safety. Help the Aged backed the campaign, . highlighting the humiliation felt by older men and women dressed only in . hospital gowns having to use unisex toilets. In 1996, as leader of the Opposition, . Tony Blair said abolishing mixed sex wards was 'not just a question of . money, but a question of political will'. Broken promise: Tony Blair vowed to get rid of the indignity of mixed-sex wards in 1996, when he was leader of the Labour party in Opposition . A year later Baroness Jay, his Health . Minister, said authorities would be expected to get rid of mixed sex . wards within the next two years. Further promises that they would disappear followed – until Health Minister Lord Darzi changed tack in January 2008. He said: 'The only way we're going to . have single-sex wards within the NHS is to build the whole of the NHS . into single rooms. That is an aspiration that cannot be met.' But in January 2009 the then Health . Secretary Alan Johnson admitted Labour had 'got it wrong'  and . introduced fines for hospitals that breached a commitment to 'virtually . eliminate' mixed wards.","Record low 1,126 slept on mixed-sex wards last month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:57 AM on 19th July 2011 . Jailed: Nathan Phipps claimed the attack was 'an accident' An off-duty policeman was mown down by a motorist he had confronted about sounding his horn at 6am. Detective Inspector Peter Howarth collapsed in a driveway screaming 'Don't let him kill me' after 22-year-old Nathan Phipps ran him down and then reversed back over him in a revenge attack. The 53-year-old, a keen marathon runner and triathlete, had to undergo emergency surgery for a double fracture to his leg and had a metal frame attached to his limb to aid his recovery. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard Mr Howarth has returned to work following the incident on November 21 last year but was unable to use public transport and faced daily reminders of the 'catastrophic' injuries. Phipps was convicted by a jury of inflicting grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving. He was jailed for three years and six months. The court heard how DI Howarth had approached Phipps to ask him to stop sounding his horn and, when he thought he was reaching for a weapon, the police officer punched him. Phipps then retaliated by mowing him down in his car. Jailing the trainee electrician for three-and-a-half years, Judge Inigo Bing described the events as 'appalling'. He said: 'You then drove both dangerously, recklessly and deliberately towards Peter Howarth and the group that were nearby and took the obvious risk that injury would result, and very catastrophic injury did result. 'There are elements of a revenge attack, because you were so angry by what had happened to you. 'You then abandoned a gravely injured man who was screaming in agony from what you had done to him.' The judge said the effect on Mr . Howarth was 'devastating', as he had to cut his athletic career short as . well as enduring extreme pain and a long period of treatment. The . jury heard Phipps had driven to an address in Wanstead, East London, at . about 6am where his girlfriend was staying after the couple split up. After driving up and down the street . repeatedly sounding his horn to get his girlfriend's attention, he was . challenged by Mr Howarth along with several other neighbours. Mr . Howard asked Phipps to wind down his side window but fearing the driver . was reaching for a weapon, smashed the glass and pulled him from the . vehicle. They spoke briefly, after which Phipps got back into the car as if to drive off. As the car went back I heard him shout 'Don't let him kill me' But Phipps aimed the car at the pavement, 'floored' the accelerator and careered straight into his victim. He then reversed over the stricken detective after he collapsed in a driveway. Neighbour John Woolnough, who was woken by the car horn said he remembered hearing a 'dull thud and a piercing scream,' after Phipps mowed down Mr Howarth for the first time. He said Phipps then turned his car around and 'floored it' in reverse towards the driveway where Mr Howarth had collapsed. Timothy Downes, who watched the incident from a first-floor bedroom in the street, added: 'As the car went back I heard him shout ""Don't let him kill me"".' Phipps was arrested two days later. During his trial he claimed Mr Howarth did not identify himself as a police officer and said he was 'in a panic' and 'very afraid' as he tried to drive off following the altercation. He said he was unaware he had hit anyone, though when he returned home, he noticed his car bumper was hanging off. Asked he if deliberately drove at Mr Howarth, he replied: 'I would never do that. It was an accident what happened.' Phipps of East Ham, East London, was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm and dangerous driving but cleared of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He was jailed for three years and six months for inflicting grievous bodily harm and 15 months, concurrently, for dangerous driving. He was also disqualified from driving for five years.","Nathan Phipps jailed after running down DI and then reversing over him .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:10 PM on 23rd August 2011 . A doctor who is being sued for amputating a truck driver's penis without his permission during a supposedly routine circumcision has defended his actions by claiming he saved the man's life. Dr John Patterson, who performed the surgery in 2007, said that during the operation on Phillip Seaton, 64, he discovered a rare and deadly cancer. 'What I saw was not a penis. What I saw was cancer,' Dr Patterson told the court in Shelby County, Kentucky. 'Loss of service': Phillip Seaton and his wife Deborah are suing a doctor who removed part of his penis without permission during surgery . Life saver? Dr. John Patterson (right) talks to his lawyer Clay Robinson during the trial at Shelby County Courthouse in Shelbyville, Kentucky . Dr Patterson said he removed less than an inch of Mr Seaton's penis. The rest of the penis was amputated by another doctor later, said the doctor's lawyer, Clay Robinson. However, Mr Seaton was appalled at the doctor's decision to amputate without consulting him, or giving him the opportunity to seek a second opinion. His wife Deborah is also a plaintiff in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages for 'loss of service, love and affection.' In earlier testimony, Mr Seaton described the moments after being told part of his penis had been removed. 'I pulled the dressing down, and I didn't see nothing,' said Mr Seaton. 'Then I came out of the restroom and I said, ""I'm getting the hell out of this damn hospital.""' Evidence: Hundreds of medical documents have been filed with the court for the jury to examine . The hospital where it happened: Mr Seaton and his wife are suing Dr Patterson after he removed part of the trucker's penis . Dr Patterson testified that the cancer prevented him from inserting a catheter into Mr Seaton's urethra, and he was concerned about the possibility of kidney damage from urinary retention. Although Mrs Seaton was in the hospital waiting room, the doctor said he did not consult her because she had not accompanied her husband to office visits or into the pre-operation area, which he thought was unusual. 'My impression was she would not be someone I would ask what he would want,' Dr Patterson testified. Mrs Seaton testified that if the . doctor had consulted her after finding the cancer, she would have . advised him to halt the surgery and wake up her husband. 'It's his body,' she said. 'He should have a say in it.' Love lost: Mrs Seaton is also suing Dr Patterson for loss of 'service and affection' Mr Seaton had earlier testified about his emotional state since the surgery, saying he was a 'bad case'. 'I didn't have no say in it,' he testified. 'I wasn't told what had to be done. It was just done.' Mr Seaton testified that Dr Patterson had told him he would cut foreskin during the circumcision and described it as 'more or less in and out.' He said he had even joked with the doctor about the procedure. During opening arguments, Robinson said Mr Seaton had before the surgery initialed a document authorizing treatment in unforeseen circumstances. Mr Seaton's lawyer, Kevin George, said the document had been read to Mr Seaton because he cannot read. The jury of eight-women and six-men was shown graphic images. Mr George presented four photographs of Mr Seaton's groin saying, 'You can see there's nothing there.' He also told jurors that Mr Seaton 'doesn't feel like a man' anymore. Mr Robinson offered up a photograph of the cancerous tip of a penis - not Mr Seaton's. Mr Seaton's brother, David Seaton, testified that Phillip Seaton has been depressed and angry since the surgery. 'The spark is gone out of his life. He used to be such a happy person,' David Seaton testified. The case continues.","Dr John Patterson discovered rare and deadly cancer during procedure on Phillip Seaton .

A U.S. tourist detained in Aruba . after the suspected death of his travel companion is facing fresh questioning after a witness told police that the couple did not go into the sea. Gary . Giordano, 50, claimed that Robyn Gardner disappeared two weeks ago . as they snorkelled off an isolated beach. But a man who was fishing at the spot at the time the Maryland woman is claimed to have vanished said that the pair left the beach without going into the water. Scroll down for video . Facing questions: Gary Giordano arrives at a police station in handcuffs and without a hair piece as a witness disputes his account of how Robyn Gardner disappeared . Missing: A witness told police that Robyn Gardner, who was claimed to have disappeared while snorkelling off Aruba, did not even go in to the water . The witness told police that he saw the tourists walking on the beach at 4pm, but that they drove away without swimming in the ocean, reported ABC News. He said that after they left, he never saw the couple again. The witness statement is yet another piece of evidence that points to inconsistencies in Giordano's account of events. The new evidence came as another woman said that Giordano had told her that he could make her 'disappear' without a trace after she rejected his proposal to take her teen model daughter to Aruba. Giordano allegedly telephoned Carrie Emerson claiming to be a producer in late July after seeing pictures of her daughter on the Internet and told her that he wanted to take her 18-year-old daughter to the island for a swimwear photo shoot. 'He made the offer sound so wonderful that . anyone needing the money or the modeling job would have gone,' she told Fox News. Shackled: Giordano was not wearing one of his toupees. Police had said they had struggled to trace the suspect's movements on the island because he kept changing hair pieces . Insurance: Gary Giordano tried to redeem accidental death policy on missing woman Robyn Gardner, which named him as a beneficiary, days before their trip to the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba . 'Thankfully it was me who answered the phone and not my daughter. 'During the conversation, he told me that he could make me disappear and no one would ever look for me.' Also speaking on Fox News, the Aruba . Solicitor General Taco Stein last night denied reports that a blood . handprint had been found on a rock near where Giordano was last seen . with Ms Gardner. 'The detail about the hand print and blood is not true,' he said. 'That is not something that we have found,' adding, 'Let me put that to rest as that only hinders the investigation.' Meanwhile, graphic, disturbing and . 'beyond pornographic' images are believed to have been found on . Giordano's camera of Ms Gardner, calling into question the relationship . between the pair, who were at first believed to simply be travelling . companions. Inconsistencies? Gary Giordano, left, speaks with detectives at Baby Beach on the day after Robyn Gardner disappeared . Being held: A judge on Monday granted a request from Aruban prosecutors to extend the detention of Giordano for 16 days . Giordano's camera, as well as his laptop and cell phone, have been sent away for analysis. Solicitor general of Aruba Taco . Stein - who called the 50-year-old a 'mean b******' - could not confirm . the nature of the images to the Today Show but would only say it did not . look like she was under any duress. Meanwhile . it emerged that the Maryland businessman tried to collect the . $1.5million accidental death policy he took out on her just two days . after he reported her disappearance to police. Giordano, . who purchased the accidental policy shortly before travelling to the . Dutch Caribbean island with the 35-year-old, tried to begin redeeming . the American Express policy, which he took out just days before their . trip and unusually only covered the trip to Aruba. According to a police source, Giordano . purchased a more expensive one-year policy instead of a more commonly . purchased five year policy. Giordano - a twice divorced father-of-three -  is still fighting the accusations and is being held in an Aruban prison. Trouble in paradise: Robyn Gardner was seen at this restaurant on the afternoon that she vanished . The scene: The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino in Oranjestad, where Ms Gardner and Mr Giordano were reportedly staying during the holiday . He still denies anything to do with Robyn's disappearance and claims she vanished while they were out snorkelling. Police . are looking at a rock which is said to have a full hand print and blood . on it that was found behind a restaurant that the pair were said to . have dined in before her disappearance. On . Monday Giordano was ordered to remain in an Aruban jail for another 16 . days while police investigate 'serious inconsistencies' in his account . of events. The American Express accidental policy is currently being investigated by the FBI. Court . documents show the 50-year-old has a history of domestic violence, has . not been charged but remains the only suspect in the case. His attorney has said he had nothing to do with her disappearance and has called for his release from jail. Officers . having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms . Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him . in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees. Video shows the pair at the Rum Beef Bar & Grill in the Baby Beach area of the island where Ms Gardner went missing. Restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate. Surveillance footage also shows Giordano in his rental car at the back of the restaurant, but the car had tinted windows so no one else in the vehicle can be seen.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 9:54 PM on 22nd August 2011 . It's been a bad few years for the disgraced Eliot Spitzer - but things could be about to get worse. Now the former New York governor has been hit with huge libel lawsuits totalling $90million over a column he wrote for a magazine website about an insurance bid-rigging scandal. Marsh & McLennan Cos former executives William Gilman and Edward McNenney are suing him over a column from August 2010 suggesting corporate wrongdoers should be prosecuted. 'Defamation': Eliot Spitzer, pictured in 2003 during his days as New York state attorney general, has been hit with libel lawsuits totalling almost $100million over a column he wrote about an insurance bid-rigging scandal . The Slate.com piece - ‘They . Still Don't Get It’ - also defended the former New York state attorney general's own enforcement activity . against Marsh and insurer American International Group (AIG). Former executive marketing director Mr Gilman and global placement director Mr McNenney claim the column defamed them, although they are not named. It appeared soon after a judge threw out their convictions on felony antitrust charges. Slate.com is owned by Washington Post Co, and its parent group is a defendant in both cases. Mr Gilman filed his $60million lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, while Mr McNenney filed papers seeking $30million with the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Mr Gilman had worked at Marsh for 28 years and Mr McNenney for 14 years when Mr Spitzer, former New York attorney general, in 2004 opened a probe into the company's practices. This included alleged kickbacks for steering of clients to favoured insurers, by the then-largest U.S. insurance broker. Money demands: Marsh & McLennan Cos former executives William Gilman, left, and Edward McNenney, right, have filed the lawsuits although neither of them were directly named in the Slate.com article . Marsh agreed in 2005 to pay $850million in a civil settlement with Mr Spitzer, and eight insurance executives including Mr Gilman and Mr McNenney were indicted eight months later in the probe. 'Mr Spitzer was well aware of his own . allegations as attorney general and the resolution of those allegations . in favour of Mr Gilman and yet, recklessly disregarded these facts' Lawsuit from William Gilman . Both men were found guilty in February 2008, but the presiding judge threw out that conviction in July 2010, citing new evidence. That case was dismissed in January. The other indicted executives either were acquitted or had their cases dismissed and 21 others pleaded guilty. In his complaint, Mr Gilman said Mr Spitzer stated ‘Marsh's behaviour was a blatant abuse of law and market power: price-fixing, bid-rigging and kickbacks all designed to harm their customers and the market while Marsh and its employees pocketed the increased fees and kickbacks.’ Mr Gilman also said Mr Spitzer defamed him in writing by stating that ‘many employees of Marsh’ have been ‘convicted and sentenced to jail terms’, when none had. Article controversy: The Slate.com piece, entitled 'They Still Don't Get It', also defended Mr Spitzer's own enforcement activity against Marsh and insurer American International Group (AIG) Mr Spitzer had written the column shortly after an editorial critical of him in The Wall Street Journal. ‘While Mr Spitzer's statements do not . refer to Mr Gilman by name, Mr Gilman is readily identifiable as the . subject of the defamatory comments,’ Mr Gilman's complaint said. ‘I don't know what possessed him to make the statements that he made’ Jeffrey Liddle, lawyer for Mr Gilman and Mr McNenney . ‘Mr Spitzer was well aware of his own allegations as attorney general and the resolution of those allegations in favour of Mr Gilman and yet, recklessly disregarded these facts,’ the complaint said. Punitive damages account for half the amounts sought in each lawsuit. ‘I don't know what possessed him to make the statements that he made,’ Jeffrey Liddle, a lawyer for Mr Gilman and Mr McNenney, said in an interview, referring to Mr Spitzer. Humiliation: Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer addressed the media with his wife Silda Wall in March 2008 to announce his resignation from office after revelations that he had been a client of a prostitution ring . In June, Mr Gilman and Mr McNenney accused Marsh in a separate lawsuit of colluding with Mr Spitzer to make them ‘scapegoats’ and avert potential criminal charges against the company. That case seeks to recover unpaid compensation and other damages. Last month, CNN cancelled Spitzer's low-rated television talk show ‘In the Arena’ after less than one year on the air. Mr Spitzer resigned as New York's governor in March 2008 after a scandal in which it was revealed that he had hired a high-priced prostitute. Neither Mr Spitzer nor the Washington Post have yet commented on the new lawsuits.","Criticism relates to 'They Still Don't Get It’ in August 2010 on Slate.com .

A feud between a husband and the parents of his missing wife has escalated after he threatened to release her diaries, claiming they prove that she was promiscuous and had run off with another man. Josh Powell has maintained that he and the couple's two sons were camping in the middle of a blizzard on the night his wife Susan went missing from their West Valley, Utah, home in December 2009. Mr Powell, 34, who is the only person of interest in the case, claims  that 28-year-old Susan left of her own accord and has described her as 'extremely unstable'. Family: Susan Powell with her two young sons and husband Josh . The void left by a lack of credible leads in the case has been filled by several public feuds between the two families. Josh Powell's father Steve . read his daughter-in-law's diaries and came to the conclusion that an emotionally turbulent . upbringing led to her running away with another man. He told ABC4 News: ‘Susan led a very . troubled childhood where there was emotional abuse at her family's home. It affected her and her older sister.’ Now he and his son are considered publishing extracts from the diaries online. Steve Powell has said that the . journals, which stretch back to when Susan was a teenager, show that . she attempted to commit suicide and was 'lustful', and therefore could . have run off with another man. The allegation brought a furious . response from Susan’s father, Chuck Cox, who said he would fight the release of the pages. He told the ABC news channel: 'We . deny all allegations, they are just totally ridiculous and we’re very . disappointed and believe it’s unconscionable that he would first read . those journals and then think he had the right to publish them.' He said: 'They don't have authority to do it. If she is alive, . which they claim, she then still maintains control over her writings, copyright-wise. 'If they publish it, I'm prepared to take action. I have an attorney and we're waiting.' Mr Powell (left) is the only person of interest in the two-year investigation. Susan Powell (right) was last seen in December 2009 . The . diary extracts show seven handwritten pages on what appears to be . school notebook paper, detailing events from Susan's life in 1996 . and 1998. Steve Powell . said that the documents prove that 'Susan is a lot more vulnerable . emotionally than Chuck and Judy Cox (her mother) would like people to . believe'. Further, the diary extracts show 'that Susan led a double-life from the time she was 13, 14, or possibly even 12,' Mr Powell claimed. Police widened their search to a network of abandoned mines in Ely, Nevada, but have not revealed any new evidence . The debate comes days after authorities searched a sprawling network of abandoned mines outside Ely, Nevada, but did not reveal any new evidence. The renewed interest into Susan Powell's disappearance comes after a remembrance rally for her descended into chaos on Friday as family members traded allegations in public. Tensions reached a boiling point between the feuding families as . loved ones gathered in Puyallup, Washington to pass out flyers and comb . for leads. Steve Powell confronted Mr Cox, calling him a 'liar' and a 'cyberbully'. The families are scheduled to meet in court today when Josh Powell will request a restraining order against Mr Cox. Chuck Cox has said that he will fight the release of his daughter's diaries . Mrs Powell was last seen at her home on December 6, 2009. She was reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for her job in West Valley City, Utah. Her husband recently told the Salt Lake Tribune that he is willing to talk with federal authorities, but not West Valley City police. He told the newspaper that he considered the search in Ely an opportunity for authorities to set him up. 'It occurred to me,' he said, according to the paper, 'they were planting something in Ely so they could magically show it to the media.' The FBI Utah office's spokeswoman, Debbie Dujanovic Bertram, declined to comment yesterday.","Susan Powell has not been seen since 2009 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:53 AM on 20th June 2011 . A Nato air strike hit a civilian house in Tripoli and killed nine residents, the Libyan regime said yesterday. Nato admitted on Sunday that its weapons destroyed a house in Tripoli in an incident likely to sow new doubts inside the alliance about its mission in Libya. The strike on the house was the clearest case yet of a bombing causing multiple civilian casualties, and comes at a time when the alliance is already under strain from a campaign that is taking more time and resources than its backers had expected. Scene of destruction: Members of the media and others examine the remains of the residential building damaged in this morning's airstrike . Nato last night admitted that a ‘weapons system failure’ may have been responsible for a missile going astray. Nato spokesman Wing Commander Mike Bracken said: 'The intended target was a military missile site. 'However from our initial assessment of the facts it appears that one weapons did not strike the intended target due to a weapons system malfunction. ‘Nato regrets the . loss of innocent civilian lives and takes great care in conducting . strikes against a regime determined to use violence against its own . citizens. ‘Although we are still determining . the specifics of this event, indications are that a weapons system . failure may have caused this incident.’ Nato did not disclose which country’s . aircraft were involved, although the Ministry of Defence said RAF . warplanes were not operating in the area at the time. Libyan government officials took . reporters to a residential area in Tripoli’s Souq al-Juma district, . where they saw a body being pulled out of the rubble of a destroyed . building. Later, in a hospital, they were shown . the bodies of a child and two others who, officials said, were among a . total of  nine people killed in the strike.

"By . Sara Nelson . Last updated at 5:59 PM on 22nd August 2011 . Thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets across Syria today after a televised appearance by President Bashar Assad, shouting for him to step down. Security forces opened fire in the central city of Homs, killing at least one person. Crowds there and in several other cities were angered by Assad's remarks on TV and taunted him with warnings that his regime would be the next to unravel, as Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule was crumbling under a rebel advance in Libya. In this image from amateur video a man is carried bleeding from a square in Homs today, after shots were fired at protesters against the regime of President Bashar Assad . Further amateur footage filmed today reveals a youth lying bleeding in the Syrian city of Homs . President Assad, pictured delivering a televised speech on Sunday, has insisted he is not concerned about security in his country . Human rights groups say more than 2,200 people have been killed in the government's crackdown on a five-month-old uprising. The regime has unleashed tanks and snipers in an attempt to stamp out the revolt. In a now-familiar refrain, Assad on Sunday promised imminent reforms - including parliamentary elections by February - but insisted the unrest was being driven by armed gangs and Islamic militants, not true reform seekers. He also said he was not worried about security in his country and warned against any Libya-style foreign military intervention. Seemingly spurred by the imminent toppling of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, rebels are taunting the Syrian President (pictured here alongside Gaddafi in 2005) that his regime will be the next to fall . A Syrian girl shouts in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad after he gave an interview on state-run TV, in Omawiyeen Square, Damascus, on Sunday . An urgent session of the U.N. Human Rights Council began in Geneva today, which saw the U.S., the E.U. and Arab nations call for an international inquiry into atrocities by Syrian government forces . The United States, the European Union (EU) and Arab nations have demanded an international inquiry into atrocities by Syrian government forces. An initial United Nations investigation said the government's five-month crackdown on opposition demonstrators -- marked by killings, disappearances and torture - may amount to crimes against humanity. ‘We have credible allegations, documented evidence, that Assad has used tanks, machine guns, grenades and snipers against peaceful protesters and human rights defenders. Innocent civilians are being massacred,’ U.S. ambassador Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe told reporters in Geneva today. Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, Syrian ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, is set to defend his government at the 47-member forum, whose session was delayed by technical problems and is likely to carry over to tomorrow. U.S. President Barack Obama has called for Assad to step down because of the crackdown, in which the United Nations says around 2,200 civilians have died. 'It is clear that Assad is isolated and I think that today's session will underscore that point,' Donahoe said. 'We see an emerging consensus in the international community, there is growing unity and resolve that Assad must go.' A draft resolution presented by some 25 members, including all four Arab members (Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) as well as non-member Tunisia, would set up an international commission of inquiry on alleged crimes against humanity. It would report back by the end of November and its findings would be sent to the U.N. Secretary-General and 'relevant bodies'. His remarks appeared designed to portray confidence as the regime comes under  international condemnation. Syria's state-run news agency said Assad formed a committee to pave the way for the formation of political groups other than his Baath party, which has held a monopoly in Syria for decades. The opposition rejected Assad's remarks, saying they have lost confidence in his promises of reform while his forces open fire on peaceful protesters. Thousands of people across several Syrian cities took to the streets after the interview. In the flashpoint central city of Homs, a hotbed of dissent against the regime, protesters shouted that Assad will follow Gaddafi, whose whereabouts was unknown as rebels claimed to be in control of Libya's capital. 'Gaddafi is gone, now it's your turn Bashar!' they shouted. Syria granted a U.N. team permission to visit some of the centres of the protests and crackdown to assess humanitarian needs, but activists and a Western diplomat have accused the regime of trying to scrub away signs of the crackdown. In Hama, another central city that has been a hotbed of dissent, pro-regime gunmen fired their guns in celebration after Assad's appearance, killing two people overnight. The head of Jordan's largest opposition group says the imminent toppling of Colonel Gaddafi is a lesson for the rulers of Syria and Yemen. Muslim Brotherhood leader Hammam Saeed says Arabs should celebrate Gaddafi's ouster because it paves the way for democracy in the north African nation. Saeed described Gaddafi as a 'tyrant who used unjustified force against his people, just like the Yemeni and Syrian presidents, who should draw lessons that their end is near and would be similar.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:37 AM on 23rd August 2011 . Gunman: Darren Williams injured three Women including his wife in Newport, Wales . A heroic 92-year-old was blasted in the neck with a shotgun when she leapt in front of a gunman who opened fire in a crowded Wales hairdressers, it was revealed today. The woman sprang into action after Darren Williams, 45, burst through the doors of Carol Ann’s Salon in Newport, brandishing the double-barrelled gun. The courageous widow was hit in the neck as she tried to protect hairdresser Rachel Williams, 37, from the attack by her estranged husband. She first kicked a table towards the 16-stone bodybuilder before stepping between the gunman and his intended victim as he raised the weapon. But Darren still fired both barrels of the shotgun - hitting his wife in the leg, the pensioner in the neck and another customer in the arm – before fleeing to woodland where he was later found dead. Neighbouring vet Peter Heathcoate told how he ran to the salon after hearing the shots fired - and helped the injured women. Mr Heathcote said: ‘I have never seen anything like it. I did not know what I was going in to - whether people had been shot and whether they were still alive. ‘Rachel Williams was lying on the floor and the older lady had blood coming from her head. ‘She was very shocked but said she was trying to protect the woman who was shot, which is amazing. ‘She had tried to kick over a table towards him and it was still there broken on the floor. ‘The old lady was worried about where she had been shot because she didn't want surgeons to shave her hair - because she'd just had it cut. ‘Rachel was very calm and I was trying to reassure her as she was laying on the floor. Crime scene: Armed police arrived at the scene within minutes, but the gunman had already fled . ‘She told me how she had been shot in the leg and that it was her ex-husband who had come into the store. ‘The gun was right there next to me. It was an antique shotgun and looked very elaborate.’ Mr Heathcote said how his team of vet surgery staff helped to patch up the wounded women until the ambulance service arrived. He said: ‘They did tremendously well, while so many people will run away from this type of scene they ran towards it to help. ‘The police and paramedics arrived about two minutes after this happened and the firearms police were also there very quickly.’ The brave 92-year-old, who hasn't been named, was released from Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after being treated for the shotgun wound. Shooting: Malpas Road, in Newport, South Wales where the 92-year-old was blasted in the neck with a shotgun by Darren Williams . Police are still investigating Williams' friends involved in hunting and shooting to discover how he managed to get his hands on the illegally-held shotgun. Williams is believed to have used another weapon to shoot himself dead after escaping from the hairdressers salon in the attack in broad daylight on Friday afternoon. Rachel was today still receiving treatment for her wounds at the Royal Gwent Hospital. She is stable and is expected to need plastic surgery. Military and shooting enthusiast Williams was jailed for four months in 2004 after police discovered the ‘arsenal of weapons’ in his bedroom at their home in Newport, Gwent. It included a stun gun, a .22 pistol, a machete, a hunting knife, cannisters of CS gas and bullets. But Williams is believed to have kept up his interest in guns and weapons after being released from prison. Neighbours said the couple were parting - and decided to sell the property for £129,000 because of the impending divorce. The couple married five years ago but have lived together at the house for about ten years. They have a son, 15, of their own and Darren has another son, 21, from a previous relationship. At the scene: Police at the scene of a shooting at Carol-Ann's Hairstylists on Malpas Road, Newport in South Wales . An inquest is expected to be opened tomorrow by Gwent coroner David Bowen. Mr Williams, 45, from Cwmbran, South Wales, went on the run for five hours before he was found dead in the woods. Police have confirmed he went to the hairdressers to confront his ex-wife over their separation. His family have now said he had been suffering in recent weeks because of the 'traumatic break-up of his marriage'. They said he had 'desperately needed professional medical attention'. Mr Williams was found at 8.15pm on Friday at Brynglas Woods in the Newport area. Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with his death. Superintendent Dave Johnson, local commander for Newport Police, said that Mr Williams ‘enjoyed hunting and the outdoor life’. He said the double-barrelled shotgun that Mr Williams fired twice at the salon where his ex-wife worked had been recovered but that Mr Williams did not have a licence for it. Anwar Ul Haq, 60, who lives above and . works at Malpas Convenience Store - two doors down from Carol-Ann's . Salon, said he heard about three shots and a woman in her 50's ran into . his shop asking for help. He said: 'A woman came out . shouting ""help, help""... she went to another shop and asked for help, in . the mean time the police vans came. 'That . woman was frightened, scared, she was when she came out. The police . said to go inside and close the doors. We didn't go outside then as the . police blocked the road and after four o'clock the police said to us . close the shops and so we closed the shop.'.","Pensioner tried to protect hairdresser from her ex-husband Darren Williams .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 2:25 PM on 23rd August 2011 . 'Unfounded': Planning minister Greg Clark hit back at the National Trust's Green Belt concerns . The National Trust has become locked in a war of words with a planning minister over the charity's 'risible' claims that Green Belt land will be threatened by Coalition planning reforms. Conservative MP Greg Clark accused the charity of 'nihilistic selfishness' after the trust dared to voice concerns over 'damaging development in undesignated countryside'. The planning minister branded the National Trust's claims as 'unfounded' in arguing that new houses are needed to solve the housebuilding 'crisis' and help young people onto the property ladder. Mr Clarks comments came after the trust revealed its 'grave concerns' over the Coalition's draft National Planning Policy Framework published last month. The National Trust's Director-General Dame Fiona Reynolds said the proposed changes could 'lead to unchecked and damaging development in the undesignated countryside on a scale not seen since the 1930s'. She argued that the reforms focused too heavily on stimulating economic growth meaning that far more developments would be approved. But Mr Clark responded by saying the Government's position had been misrepresented. He added that those who sought to 'preserve in aspic' their towns were guilty of 'nihilistic selfishness'. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'The principal campaigning point seems to be the loss of the Green Belt. 'There is nothing in the policy that would lead to a significant loss of Green Belt. 'The National Trust had on their website an aerial shot of Los Angeles in some risible idea that this was the future of Britain.' Mr Clark insisted that Green Belt, national parks and areas of special scientific interest in this country would remain protected. Under threat: The National Trust claimed Green Belt areas similar to this one in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, could be subject to 'damaging development' Vision of the future: Mr Clark claimed the National Trust used a picture of urban sprawl in Los Angeles to depict how Britain could look in years to come . The MP added that the only way in which new homes would be built on Green Belt land would be under a new 'community right to build' scheme, allowing small developments of up to 12 homes to be built if supported by 90% of locals. He added: 'If you can square a village voting for 10 new homes for its parishioners with the sprawl of Beverly Hills or Santa Monica, I fail to see it.' The proposed streamlining of planning rules surrounding new developments aims to reduce the current 1,300 pages of national planning policy to just 52. The Council for the Protection of Rural England has also spoken out against the planned changes. Opposed: The National Trust had voiced 'grave concerns' on their website about the Coalition's draft National Planning Policy Framework . Councils will be told there should be a 'presumption for development' when they write their local planning strategies. Mr Clark added: 'Last year was the lowest level of housebuilding since World War II, which means the problem is getting worse and worse causing more misery for more people for as long as this isn't addressed. 'People do have an interest in the future - to not care shows a degree of nihilistic selfishness which is quite rare.' A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said that the Green Belt will not be threatened by the proposed changes. 'We have made our commitment to the Green Belt crystal clear. It is in the Coalition Agreement, and our proposed abolition of the unpopular regional strategies through the Localism Bill will stop the top-down pressure to remove the Green Belt in 30 areas across England,' said the spokesman. A National Trust spokesman hit back at the Planning Minister, saying: 'Greg Clark and his colleagues at DCLG seem to think that greenbelts and other designated areas of countryside are all that anyone cares about. 'They are not, as the Government should have realised from the forestry debacle earlier this year. We've not even mentioned them as part of our campaign. 'Our primary concern is what the Government's reforms threaten to do to the everyday places in and around cities, towns and villages that are hugely valued by local communities. 'To say we have a nihilistic view on housing is equally odd. We have developed hundreds of homes ourselves and have existing permission to build hundreds more on land that we own. 'We believe strongly that any development must meet the needs of people, the environment as well as the economy. 'The Government has failed to do this in its reforms. It has put short-term financial gain ahead of everything else. 'It has failed to protect the everyday places that local communities love. It has given the power in planning to the already powerful. 'Whilst the Government is making warm noises about local communities, in practice the dice are heavily loaded to favour development and local people simply won't get enough say.'","Charity criticised for 'unfounded' Green Belt claims .

"Taylor Armstrong 'dreads' seeing family of suicide husband Russell at memorial service . Family of tragic Real Housewives star pick up his belongings from coroner . By . Mike Larkin . Last updated at 7:03 AM on 24th August 2011 . Russell Armstrong had stopped taking anti-depressant drugs a fortnight before he committed suicide, it has been claimed. The venture capitalist is said to have been taking the prescription medication to control his rage issues. He had been taking the drugs for several . months, and it later emerged his wife Taylor was leaving him after . accusing him of domestic abuse. Tragic: Russell Armstrong is said to have stopped taking anti-depressants two weeks before he committed suicide . An insider told RadarOnline: 'Russell had been doing so well when he was on the anti-depressants. 'He was prescribed the meds to control his rage issues. Russell stopped taking the meds two weeks before his suicide. 'Taylor was very supportive of him taking the meds. 'All of a sudden about two weeks ago, Russell stopped taking the meds though.' Ed Winter, Assistant Coroner for Los Angeles said: 'No medication bottles for Mr. Armstrong were recovered from the scene.' Collection: The family of Russell Armstrong picked up his possessions from the LA coroner's office today as it emerged he had stopped taking anti-depressant drugs weeks before his suicide . It has also been revealed Taylor Armstrong is terrified of meeting the family of her dead husband Russell at his memorial service this week. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star thinks his family blame her for the venture capitalist committing suicide in Los Angeles last week. And she is scared of conflict in front of her daughter at Wednesday's event with his family, who collected his possessions from the coroner's office in the California city today. A source told RadarOnline: 'She feels that they all hate her, and that they blame her for Russell's suicide. 'Taylor just wants to get through the memorial on Wednesday. 'She hopes that Russell's family doesn't try and cause a scene. Checking out: His relatives looked over their paperwork as they left their heartbreaking appointment . This is a memorial service for the father of her daughter, Kennedy will be at the service as well.' The 40-year-old reality television has been staying out of the public eye at a rental house in plush  Bel Air Crest with her daughter since news of her husband's death emerged. The Mail Online had previously revealed Russell's mother John Ann Hotchkiss will not be attending the memorial. Meanwhile Russell's family were picking up the 47-year-old's possessions from the LA coroner's office today. They looked glum faced as they left with the jewellery and other personal items they had been holding. Following their appointment they checked paperwork as they sped off in a waiting vehicle. It has also emerged the broke banker had splurged $60,000 on a 40th birthday party for his wife as he attempted to woo her weeks before his death. An insider told Celebrity News and Style: 'On the surface both Taylor and Russell looked happy and were all smiles. 'He was very attentive to her, maybe even more than usual and I found that to be a bit odd. He followed her around and was by her side the entire time.' He spared no expense in throwing the special party at Beachers Madhouse at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, despite the fact he was hugely in debt. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills that he invited were co-stars Kyle Richards, who was out of town, Lisa Vanderpump and husband her Ken Todd. The new developments follow revelations he had slammed Real Housewives bosses in one of the last interviews he conducted. He said: 'Everything you see on that show is bull****. 'Those Bravo b*****ds take every little argument out of context and magnify it for the cameras.' 'That's not me': Armstrong said of his onscreen portrayal, 'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords' Speaking exclusivity to TheFix.com Armstrong added: 'The Russell you see on TV has nothing to do with my real personality. 'He's just a stock character created by Bravo's evil overlords. That's not me you see up there. It's just a character I play on TV.' Last week Armstrong's 69-year-old mother John Ann Hotchkiss threatened the network with legal action if they proceed with plans to air footage of her son. She told Headline News: 'Before the new . season even started, before he took his life, he said, ""Mom, they’re . just going to crucify me this season"".' 'He said, ""I don’t know what to do. I’ll never survive it"".' She has also said that the TV network: 'Better not air one frame of my son... or else!' Legal . action: Armstrong's mother has threatened Bravo not to show any footage . of her son in the upcoming season of Real Housewives . During his TheFix.com interview, the businessman appeared to change his tune at one point. 'At first I was a little annoyed about all the bull****, but then I realised it's not so bad to be a celebrity,' he said. 'The thing is, all the publicity has been great for my business.' Armstrong's statement is contrary to the widespread reports that he was in hot water financially at the time of his death. In the interview Russell also appeared to deny the highly-publicised rift with his wife Taylor, whom he was estranged from. 'She is the most sensitive, sweet woman I've ever met. Taylor's kind of like an angel,' he told TheFix.com. 'She really is everything to me. 'We watch these stories about our terrible marriage, and we lie in bed and laugh. The truth is we are really, really happy.' Representatives for Bravo are yet to respond to Mail Online's request for comment on Armstrong's claims. 'She an angel;': Despite being estranged from his wife, Russell sang Taylor's praises and said all was well in their marriage . Armstrong was found dead last Monday after hanging himself at a home he was staying at on Mulholland Drive. The Mail Online revealed on Saturday that John Ann Hotchkiss will not be attending the planned memorial service for her son in LA this Wednesday  after tension with Taylor Armstrong boiled over. Instead she will remember her son at a . separate memorial service, which is due to be held next week as well, in . either Evergreen or Benton, Texas, just outside of Houston. Meanwhile, sources close to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast have claimed that Taylor failed to go to the police over her husband's alleged abuse because she wanted to protect their daughter Kennedy. 'She said that she didn't want Kennedy to know and she knew that Russell would never harm their daughter,' the source told Radar Online. 'Kennedy would hear them yelling behind closed doors but she didn't witness any violence.' Do you have a story about a celebrity?

He is the 17th person this year whose death was caused in the California park, which is on track for one of its deadliest years in recent memory. A group of rock climbers saw him tumble down the granite outcropping's sheer face on Monday evening and he was recovered the next day. Another fatality: A climber fell more than 4,000ft to his death while ascending the iconic Half Dome summit in Yosemite National Park . A rescue team of rangers was not dispatched until Tuesday morning because of nightfall, a park spokesman said. A helicopter crew found the man's body in the morning during an aerial search, reported the San Francisco Chronicle. Rangers reached him on a talus slope soon after and recovered some personal items they believe were his nearby as well as from the summit. But officials are so far baffled as to who he is as no identification has been found - and they also don’t know whether he fell or jumped. However a park spokesman said it ‘looks like it was accidental at this point’ and investigators think he was properly equipped. ‘Chances are he went up the cables and then went down the face, either accidentally or by suicide,’ he told the Sacramento Bee. Deadly year: Yosemite National Park officials in California are so far baffled as to why so many people have died there in 2011 already compared to other years . An autopsy is expected to be performed on Wednesday by Mariposa County medical examiners. As the park continues a deadly year, it . is the 17th death in 2011 either to occur in Yosemite itself or due to . injuries sustained there. ‘Chances are he went up the cables and then went down the face, either accidentally or by suicide' Yosemite park spokesman . It’s the second death in a month on Half Dome after Hayley LaFlamme, 26, died last month after falling 600ft in difficult weather conditions. The park has averaged around a dozen deaths each year over the last decade, park officials told the San Francisco Chronicle. Half Dome now limits climbers to 400 each day, which is a significant cutback from the 1,200 a day who used to get onto the cables. Park officials are so far baffled as to why so many people have died there this year. ‘There has been no definitive explanation,’ a spokesman said.","Man fell off iconic summit of Half Dome in California .

A male member of the jury that . acquitted Casey Anthony of the murder of her daughter has said that she . was a 'horrible person' that none of the jurors liked at all. Revealing details from inside the . jury room for the first time, the juror speaking on the condition of . anonymity said that the 25-year-old 'probably did something wrong'. He said that if he was able to vote . again, knowing what he knows about the case now, he would vote for her . to be convicted of manslaughter. Emotional: Casey Anthony (C), with her attorneys Jose Baez (L) and Dorothy Clay Sims, reacts to being found not guilty at the Orange County Courthouse on July 5 . 'Generally, none of us liked Casey . Anthony at all,' he told People magazine. 'She seems like a horrible . person. But the prosecutors did not give us enough evidence to convict. 'They gave us a lot of stuff that makes us think that she probably did something wrong, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.' He said that his life 'has been a nightmare' since Anthony has been released from jail. 'I live in fear that someone will find me. I Google my name every day to see if anyone has figured out who I am,' he said. He said that one of his friend's wives has banned her husband from talking to him and that his sister has hurled insults at him. Meanwhile, a Florida appeals court denied a request that would have stopped Casey Anthony from being forced to start a one-year probation sentence for cheque fraud by the end of the week. The Fifth District Court of Appeals disagreed with Anthony's argument that enforcing the probation order would violate the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy. Anthony maintains she already had completed the probation sentence in jail while she was awaiting trial on murder charges in the 2008 death of her two-year-old daughter, Caylee. 'The petitioner and her attorneys were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement,' the appellate court said. The probation order stems from a sentence Circuit Judge Stan Strickland imposed in January 2010 after Anthony pleaded guilty to stealing checks from a friend. At the time, Strickland said Anthony should serve the probation upon her release, but those instructions never made it into a written order. Freedom: Casey Anthony and her lawyer Jose Baez leave the Orange County Jail in Orlando, Florida on July 17 . The jury member who spoke out also revealed the votes taken by the jurors in the case. He said that the vote to convict . Anthony on the four charges of lying to police was unanimous and quick, . but that the other votes took longer. 'We took the first vote on . first-degree murder,' he said. 'We were 10 to two to acquit. So we . talked for about thirty minutes, and the two decided that they were . willing to change their votes, so first degree was off the table pretty . quickly.' Finally the jurors voted on the . manslaughter charge. 'We did our first vote and it came out half to . acquit, half to convict,' he said. 'And we talked about it for a while, . going through the evidence. I'd say that some people got intense, but . there were no personal attacks, no real yelling. Dead: A Florida jury voted to acquit Casey Anthony of the murder and manslaughter of her daughter Caylee, pictured . 'And we talked for a while, then it . was 11-1 to acquit. And the guy who didn't want to acquit basically . looked at us and said, “OK, whatever you all want.” He knew he wasn't . going to convince us.' He said that the jurors then sat there stunned for a few minutes as they realised they were going to set Anthony free. 'Everyone was just stunned at what we . were about to do. [One of the women jurors] asked me, “Are you okay . with this?” and I said, “Hell, no. But what else can we do? We promised . to follow the law”.' The juror said that since the trial . he has learnt more about the case by reading documents and would now . consider changing his vote. 'But when we were sequestered, we could only go by what the prosecution and defence gave us, he said. 'If I had to vote now, I'd probably . vote for manslaughter. But we didn't get the evidence to support it . before. I know people are mad at us, but we did our jobs, and I think we . did them to the very best of our abilities.'","Juror says he lives in fear of being discovered as someone who helped acquit mother .

Home-owners on the brink of having their homes repossessed may be offered an unexpected reprieve, after it emerged it may take up to 62 years for banks and the courts to process the backlog of claims. At the current rate of repossession, analysts calculated it would take lenders in New York state 62 years to process the 213,000 threatened houses - the longest in the country. In New Jersey it would take a staggering 49 years to clear the backlog, while it would take a decade to repossess all the outstanding homes  In Florida, Massachusetts and Illinois - all of which use the courts to process claims. Foreclosure: It would take up to 62 years to clear the repossession back log in New York State . Foreclosure: It would take up to 62 years to clear the repossession back log in New York State . Speaking to the New York Times, Herb Blecher from Real estate data firm LPS Applied Analytics said: 'If you were in foreclosure four years ago, you were biting your nails, asking yourself, ‘When is the sheriff going to show up and put me on the street.' 'Now you’re probably not losing any sleep.' For those in the 27 states who do not use a court based repossession process, the outlook however is not so rosy. LPS calculated that in California it would take just three years to clear the backlog, while in Nevada and Colorado it would take only three. Despite the grim outlook for some, repossessions are down nationally by a third since last fall.

Mortgage lenders also took back fewer properties in May for the second month in a row, foreclosure listing firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday. Many mortgage lenders are still working through foreclosure document problems that surfaced last autumn. The delays continue to push the two million U.S. homes already on banks' books or in some stage of foreclosure further into limbo. They also suggest banks will repossess 200,000 fewer homes in 2011. ‘The problem with that, even though it sounds better, is that all of those foreclosure auctions we should have seen this year roll into next year,’ said Rick Sharga, a senior vice president at RealtyTrac. ‘That means it's going to take that much longer for the housing market to recover.’ The pace of homes entering the foreclosure process and those ending up as bank-owned properties began slowing sharply last autumn.","Analysts examine current rates of repossession .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 12:13 PM on 22nd August 2011 . The mother of a disabled boy who was horrifically beheaded last week has led an emotional candlelit vigil for her executed son infront of 500 people. Wheelchair-bound Jori Lirette was brutally executed and dismembered with a meat cleaver after his mother threatened to kick long term boyfriend Jeremiah Wright, 30, out of their Louisiana home. The seven-year-old's mother Jesslyn, 27, led tearful tributes to the boy on Sunday after his father Wright reportedly confessed to the killing. Devastated: A distraught Jesslyn Lirette speaks during the candlit vigil for her murdered disabled seven-year-old son Jori . Emotional: The tearful 90-minute service for Jori was attended by over 500 people, many of whom raised their hands in honour of the executed disabled boy . Tribute: Jesslyn Lirette told in the service how she hopes there is 'no pain or illness in heaven' for her disabled son . Tragic: Jori's mother Jesslyn listens to community leaders speak during the candlelit service in Louisiana . Disabled Jori, who was wheelchair-bound due to cerebal palsy and heart problems and also had limited speech, was found by a passing motorist after being allegedly decapitated by his father last week. On Sunday the boy's mother led an emotional service in Peltier Park, Thibodaux, Louisiana, where she told an assembled crowd: 'You're walking in heaven now, where there is no pain or illness.' As the boy's mother stepped away from the microphone, the crowd burst into applause and many people wept. Jori's cousins also released 50 brightly coloured balloons above the park, while others lit candles passed from person to person. Police said a stream of over 500 people eventually came to the park to honour the tragic seven-year-old during the 90-minute service. It was revealed at the weekend that Jori's mother Jesslyn had previously warned police that his father wanted him dead. Grotesque: Jeremiah Wright (left) is said by police to have admitted killing his son Jori Lirette (right) by chopping off his head with a meat cleaver . Statement: Jesslyn Lirette (centre) speaks out about how her long term boyfriend murdered her seven-year-old son at her home . The week before Jori was born, she obtained a restraining order against Wright after he 'broke the baby's piggy bank' and 'shoved her onto a pile of CDs on the bed'. Then, when Jori was just six-months-old, she obtained another similar order after he called her and said he 'was tired of seeing the baby suffer' and wanted him dead. Details of the orders, which Jesslyn apparently allowed to lapse, were revealed in sworn statements she made in 2004 and made part of the official court record this week. Jori was wheelchair-bound and needed a feeding tube having been born with cerebral palsy. He had been born three months prematurely and spent much of his first year in hospital in New Orleans. Wright chopped his son's head off with a meat cleaver and left it in the roadside outside his home so that Jesslyn would see it. Appearance: Jeremiah Wright was manacled to his waist as he was brought into court for his hearing last week . Horrific: Jesslyn Lirette held the hands of two guards as she attended the district court where her long term boyfriend was accused of killing her son . The crime scene was so gruesome that some of the police who responded to the emergency call have had to have counselling. Investigators said the grisly killing was carried out over a kitchen sink at the Louisiana home the boy shared with his father and his mother Jesslyn. His hand and feet were also cut off and discovered nearby in plastic garbage bags. A forensic team removed the sink from the house in Thibodaux ,Louisiana, as part of their murder investigation. Thibodaux Police Lt. Kim Favalora said in a statement to a court last week that: 'Wright was very matter-of-fact as he calmly explained that he thought for years that Jori was his son. Scene: A driver spotted Jori's head as he was passing and reported it to the police who called it a heinous crime . According to reports Wright, seen here on Sunday, was sick of taking care of his special needs son . Flowers, balloons and stuffed animals have been placed in a makeshift shrine outside the home . 'Wright said that he recently saw the way the dummy looked at him and there were signs and little things the dummy did to him that let him know that Jori was not his son, but a dummy.' Favalora said Wright told police that 'he was tired of taking care of the dummy. Wright said that as soon as he realized that Jori was a dummy, and not his son, he 'started contemplating on killing him.' The document said Wright admitted to arguing with Jesslyn the previous night and that he expected to be kicked out of the house. Wright, whose criminal history includes arrests for drugs, burglary and contempt, is being held on $5 million bond and could face the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. The murder has sent shock waves through the small town of Thibodaux, where the last killing was three years ago.","Tearful service honours boy brutally executed 'by his own father'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:44 PM on 23rd August 2011 . Scandal: Craig Thomson is accused of using a union credit card when he was a union official to pay for prositutes . An Australian MP has been accused of using an official credit card to pay for prostitutes, sparking a political scandal that could bring down the government. New South Wales state police said they are looking into new evidence that Craig Thomson misused a trade union credit card when he was a senior union official in 2005 and 2007. A conviction for theft or fraud would force Mr Thomson to quit parliament and cost Prime Minister Julia Gillard's year-old government its single-seat majority. With opinion polls showing the government has become deeply unpopular, observers agree that the ruling Labor Party would have little hope of retaining Mr Thomson's seat in an ensuing by-election. Mr Thomson has denied any wrongdoing and Ms Gillard has publicly supported the MP, who was first elected when Labor swept to power in 2007. The allegation, first raised by a Sydney newspaper in 2009, dates back to when Mr Thomson was national secretary of the Health Services Union. He allegedly used his union credit card to pay a Sydney brothel thousands of dollars of union money in two transactions. Mr Thomson has denied the allegation and claimed that an unnamed man had taken his credit card and forged his signature. He also said that that man had repaid the money. Under threat: Julia Gillard, pictured with Prince Charles ahead of the royal wedding in April, could lose her government's one-seat majority . Mr Thomson sued the newspaper's owner, Fairfax Media Publications, but dropped that court action in May. Police have never investigated the allegations because the Health Services Union, which is aligned with Labor, has never made a complaint. But an opposition senator, George Brandis, wrote to Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione yesterday with new evidence he said showed Mr Thomson had committed a range of crimes, including fraud, which is punishable by 10 years in prison. The new evidence included a statement from a forensic handwriting expert who said Mr Thomson had probably signed one of the brothel credit card dockets in question. It also included a bundle of recently released court documents that Fairfax would have used in the defamation trial as proof of many more instances in which Thomson allegedly paid prostitutes with the same credit card. When asked in parliament to comment on the growing scandal, Ms Gillard said: 'It would be inappropriate for me to comment further.' She denied any involvement in a decision by a Labor state branch to pay toward Mr Thomson's legal bills for settling his defamation case, adding: 'Decisions about finances related to the New South Wales Labor Party are for the New South Wales Labor Party to make.' The party will not explain the generous gift, but the opposition is convinced it was to prevent Mr Thomson being bankrupted by his legal bills. Under Australia's constitution, an MP must quit Parliament if he or she is bankrupt or convicted of a crime that carries a potential prison sentence of at least 12 months.","Ruling Labor Party has a one-seat majority .

Bush to bomb Syria and prepared a secret signed resignation letter. These are just three of the explosive revelations from former U.S. vice president Dick Cheney ahead of the release of his highly-anticipated book. Mr Cheney still insists the U.S. invasion of Iraq was the right decision and explained how he was unconscious for weeks after heart surgery last year. Scroll down for video . New book: Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney has 'no regrets' about water-boarding terror suspects and told George W. Bush to bomb Syria . The controversial politician said he . still supports harsh interrogation policies used by the Bush . administration after the 9/11 attacks. Book: 'In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir' by Dick Cheney is scheduled for release next week . ‘I would strongly support using it . again if circumstances arose where we had a high-value detainee and that . was the only way we could get him to talk,’ he told NBC. He also claimed that President George W. Bush rejected his advice in 2007 to bomb a suspected nuclear reactor site in Syria. Mr Cheney said he was a ‘lone voice’ for military action against Syria and other advisers were also . reluctant, reported the New York Times. He claimed this was because of ‘bad . intelligence we had received about Iraq's stockpiles of weapons of mass . destruction’ before the 2003 invasion. The Israelis ended up bombing the Syrian site later in 2007. Mr Cheney bemoaned 'concessions . delivered' to North Korea 'in the naive hope that despots would respond . in kind’, reported the Drudge Report. He also said Mr Bush was given ‘utterly misleading’ advice - but that invading Iraq was the right decision, even considering poor intelligence. Explosive: Mr Cheney's memoir is expected to make many in Washington uncomfortable as it reveals much insider information . Mr Cheney claimed Guantanamo Bay only damages the image of the U.S. abroad because President Barack Obama 'peddles falsehoods about it.' He also prepared and signed a . secret resignation letter in 2001 shortly after taking office and kept . it in a safe, in case of a possible health crisis. Mr Cheney, who has a long history of . heart disease, said concern about health issues was one of the main . reasons he kept the letter. Only Mr Bush and a Cheney staff member knew about the letter. Mr Cheney warned his memoir is going . to be highly controversial, saying: 'There are going be heads exploding . all over Washington.' Mr Cheney said in addition that Mr Bush should not feel betrayed by insider information he reveals in his new memoir. 'If you look at the book there are . many places in it where I say some very fine things about George Bush,’ he said. ‘And believe every word of it.' Mr Cheney was a lightning-rod for . criticism during Mr Bush's presidency and accused of often . advocating a belligerent U.S. stance in world affairs. He also said former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was naïve and Colin Powell was right to resign after the 2004 election. Mr Cheney claimed Mr Powell tried to undermine Bush ‘by criticising administration policy to people outside the government.’ And he said former CIA Director .

She may be the head of  53 states, representing nearly a third of the world’s population, but the Queen has been ranked below Lady Gaga in a list of the most powerful women on the planet. According to Forbes magazine, Her Majesty is only the 49th most powerful woman in the world – down eight places on  her 2010 ranking. The Queen is just two places above BBC News director Helen Boaden – the next highest Briton. Powerful: Lady Gaga beat the Queen by 38 places in the Forbes magazine list of the world's most powerful women, with the singer in at 11, the Queen 49th . Harry Potter author JK Rowling also made the top 100, coming in at No 61. Her Majesty has such a lowly rank because the magazine’s editors believe . she has failed to sustain her influence over the past 12 months. Forbes crowned German chancellor Angela Merkel as its most powerful woman, followed by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff. Harry Potter author JK Rowling also made the top 100, coming in at No 61 . Forbes based its list on a  mixture of wealth, creative influence and entrepreneurship, meaning pop stars and politicians sit side by side at the top. They control £18.5trillion collectively and have an average age of 54. Twenty-nine are chief executives, 22 are single and eight are heads of . state. Ms Merkel is praised as Europe’s ‘undisputed’ leader and takes the . number one spot from First Lady Michelle Obama, who has been relegated . to eighth on the list. Lady Gaga, 25, is the  youngest entry and is ranked at No 11. Fellow U.S. singer Beyoncé is 18th. Beyonce comes it at 18 because she has released her fourth album this . year and ‘is growing up and into herself’, the Forbes editors write. They also praise the 29-year-old for ‘taking control of her own business dealings’ and for amassing 16 Grammy Awards. Others on the list include Angelina Jolie at 29 due to her acting and . humanitarian work and Sarah Palin at 34 who is described as ‘the . unofficial hostess of the Tea Party’. As well as the three British women on the list, there are four other . British based businesswomen including Angela Ahrendts, the chief . executive of Burberry, who is at 58. Top two: Angela Merkel came out as number one on the Forbes list, while U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was second . According to Forbes the most successful women derive their power ‘from money and might, but also (thanks to social media) reach and influence’. These are the planet's ten most powerful women, according to Forbes, with their job titles in brackets: . This was not enough to stop The Queen from slipping down the ranks, even though its editors admit she has been ‘indefatigable’ in recent times. Moira Forbes, President & Publisher of ForbesWoman, said of Her Majesty: ‘Our Power Women’s list is far from static, and the methodology changed a bit over last year, reflecting the new ways in which women are achieving and sustaining influence. ‘Power today, hard or dynamic, is fleeting so this list represents a snapshot in time.’ Ms Forbes added: ‘Our list reflects the diverse and dynamic paths to power for women today – whether leading a nation or setting the agenda on critical issues of our time. ‘Across their multiple spheres of influence, these women have achieved power through connectivity - the ability to build community around the organisations they oversee, the countries they lead, the causes they champion, and their personal brands.’ The Forbes 100 list of Most Powerful Women is worked out by a panel of editors from Forbes magazine.","German chancellor Angela Merkel tops Forbes list .

"By . Allan Hall and Chris Parsons . Last updated at 12:08 PM on 25th August 2011 . A man who imprisoned a woman in his home-made torture chamber rigged with eight bombs may have wanted to get his victim pregnant, it has been claimed. Thomas Fischer, 30, turned his Hamburg flat into a terrifying lair where he had installed an old soundproofed telephone box to lock up his victim. It has emerged that German police who arrested Fischer have since searched the loner's flat and discovered 'more than one' home pregnancy testing kit. Evidence: Police remove the 'cell' from a window of the ground floor flat in Hamburg . Bombs: A German police officer removes a hand grenade from the flat, which had been rigged with eight explosives . Chilling: A newly-released video shows Fischer casually carrying fire extinguishers into his flat to turn into bombs . Fischer is seen on camera going in and out of the building, carrying the fire extinguishers which he had emptied and filled with fertiliser to create the explosives . Fischer snatched a 26-year-old Israeli woman off the street last Friday and kept her as a handcuffed hostage inside the homemade 'cell' in his flat. Although it is thought he had planned to imprison her for a number of months, the woman managed to escape after two hours when he forgot to lock the door to the torture chamber. Having found pregnancy tests inside the apartment, officials now believe Fischer had intended to get his victim pregnant or blow her up if that was not possible. He bought numerous gynaecological devices, surgical implements and dentistry tools which he intended to use on his victim. Fischer also built a special cage for her - a soundproofed telephone box he stole from a street somewhere in Germany. Officers would not reveal how many pregnancy testing kits were found in the apartment, but said it was 'more than one'. Macabre: Fischer was arrested for keeping a woman imprisoned in his Hamburg flat and has not spoken since . 'Cold sadist' Fischer had rigged his apartment with eight bombs which he created by emptying fire extinguishers and filling them with fertiliser. Today a chilling video emerged of Fischer carrying the fire extinguishers into his Hamburg apartment. The footage shown on the website of German newspaper Bild, shows Fischer making repeated trips in and out of the apartment building carrying the red extinguishers which he would later rig as explosives. The fertiliser-based bombs were so volatile police had to evacuate 300 people when his flat was searched. Fischer had apparently made them using recipes he found on the internet. Police said he and the woman knew each other after being introduced by a friend, but that there was ‘definitely no relationship’ and that Fischer had become obsessed with ‘owning’ her and stalked her. She managed to escape his apartment by jumping from a first floor window and running away from the chasing Fischer to a friend's house before informing police, who later arrested him. He rigged up a camera outside the door to his 88 sq ft flat so he could observe who was trying to get in and had huge planks stored in the basement designed to seal the windows. The outside of the windows were criss-crossed with barbed wire and sealed on the inside with baking foil and clingfilm. A hand grenade was discovered in the flat as well as fire extinguishers which had been modified to create home-made bombs. A hand grenade was discovered in the flat as well as fire extinguishers which had been modified to create home-made bombs . A jobless gardener using the pseudonym Holger told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper he has known Fischer for three years. He said: ‘Thommy is a complete cold sadist. I never once saw him smile. He has no heart. This pig has plotted this crime for years.’ The man met Fischer at the Mahlzeit hostel in the Altona district, where Fischer would buy drinks for homeless people. Chilling: Police examine the soundproofed phone box which 'sadistic' Thomas Fischer used as a torture chamber . Desperate: The woman escaped from the apartment by diving through a barbed wire-covered window . Holger went on: ‘He came every Monday wearing a military-style jacket. He drank a coffee and ogled the women. He never said a word about himself.'Fischer has not said a single word since he was arrested. Police are still working on the theory that he had an accomplice who helped him turn the small apartment into a torture chamber. It was also revealed this week that Fischer is already known to police.  He has a record for stalking women, causing bodily harm and swindling.","Officers believe Thomas Fischer wanted to get Israeli captive pregnant .

Those staying in Britain for the bank holiday - so-called 'staycationers' - will have to brace themselves for nightmare journeys as some 16 million vehicles are expected to hit the roads. A number of festivals - including the Notting Hill Carnival in London - and sporting events have been scheduled to take place over the August bank holiday weekend, but those venturing out on the roads can expect major snarl-ups. In addition, those planning on using the . Eurotunnel may also be left frustrated, as the French drivers are . threatening to strike over the weekend, meaning that services between . Folkestone and Calais could be jeopardised. Rain or shine: This group of girls are all smiles, despite reaching the Reading Festival site only to find cascades of water . Prepared for the worst: More festival-goers enter the muddy grounds at Reading, where water has been pumped from the site over the past week . Further, the Meteorological (Met) Office have warned Brits to expect inclement conditions - showers are . forecast and temperatures will be cold across the country. Drivers . will find that a number of roadworks on England's motorways and major . trunk roads will have been completed by the start of the getaway, with . others being suspended over the holiday. But . more than 20 sets of works will remain in place and motoring . organisations are expecting heavy traffic on routes to the coast and in . areas where events are taking place, such as the Reading and Leeds music . festivals.

He said: 'We've worked night and day since [last week] to pump water off the ground, to pump water out of the ditches because we know we are getting more, so we needed to get as much off the ground as possible so that it's got somewhere to go.' Up to 100,000 people were expected to attend the event which will be headlined by bands including My Chemical Romance, The Strokes and Muse. Rainy day: Heavy showers and cold temperatures are expected over the bank holiday weekend, though by Monday there is a chance most of the country will be dry. Meanwhile, to accommodate track works, there will be 3,428 buses laid on over the weekend . FRIDAY: Heavy rain is predicted across the country, and thunderstorms will punctuated the day. While there will be some sunshine, temperatures are not expected to rise above the late teens - 16 or 17 degrees Celsius. SATURDAY: Conditions will slowly improve, those most of the country will still be wet and breezy, particularly in the north. SUNDAY: Expect a brighter day with sunny spells, though it will still be wet, again with the north of the country taking the brunt of the rain. MONDAY: Most of the country will be much drier and clearer. Forecast provided to MailOnline by the Met Office . With so many cars on the road drivers have . been warned to take extra care after a survey showed 71 per cent of . motorists have lost concentration at the wheel in the last year. The poll by road safety charity Brake and insurance company Direct Line . found this was caused by worries about work, tension at home or . inconsiderate road users. Further, motorists are being warned about huge tailbacks tomorrow behind by a convoy of steam engines travelling towards the coast - at 5mph. The 86ft long convoy, weighing more than 75 tonnes, will travel from Sussex to Dorset to take part in a rally next week. But the 115-mile journey will take an estimated 30 hours to complete and cause huge tailbacks for tourists heading for the south coast. Motorists are being warned of major delays on the B2237 and A24 in Sussex, A27 in Hampshire, A36 in Wiltshire and A354 in Dorset. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police warned motorists to allow extra time for journeys and said: 'Due to the size of this ""road train"" it will be extremely slow moving and as it is travelling over a Bank Holiday it will have the potential to create congestion. 'The estimated speed of this convoy will be 5 miles per hour. 'Wherever possible disruption will be kept to a minimum but hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient if they come across this load.' On the move? Heathrow is expecting more than 852,000 passengers to journey through the airport over the weekend . Meanwhile French workers with the Channel .

Over . 25,500 vehicles - and 100,000 people - are scheduled to travel on the . service from France to England during the three-day weekend. And . between 12,000 and 15,000 travellers are expected to journey the other . way, escaping to Europe for some bank holiday sunshine. To . add to matters, rail travellers will have to put up with engineering . work over the weekend, with buses replacing trains on some routes. There will be 3,428 replacement buses running over the holiday weekend, compared with 3,339 last August bank holiday. But Network Rail (NR) said 3.5 per cent more trains would be running over this August bank holiday than operated over the same period in 2010. NR also said that only 4.8 per cent fewer trains would be running over the bank holiday weekend than on a typical Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Even so, around 5.5 million people are expected . to travel by rail over the weekend, according to Michael Roberts, chief . executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies. Travel organisation Abta said around 1.8 million Britons would be heading abroad from Friday to bank holiday Monday - roughly the same number as travelled overseas this time last year. 'This will be one of the busiest weekends of the year with most passengers on Friday,' said a spokesman for Stansted Airport. 'Some people will be going for city breaks over the bank holiday, while . others will be taking the chance for some sun before the kids go back to . school.' Around 250,000 would be flying from Gatwick airport, 260,000 from Stansted, 150,000 from Manchester, 65,000 from Birmingham, 24,000 from Leeds Bradford and 70,000 from Luton. Also, 115,000 will leave from the main Scottish airports of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, while hundreds of thousands will be heading out through regional airports and over or under the Channel. Heathrow is expecting more than 852,000 passengers to journey through the west London airport between Friday and Monday. Heathrow's most popular destinations for the weekend are New York, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt and Los Angeles and Leeds Bradford Airport said around 24,000 passengers were expected to fly off for a break. Top destinations: Over the bank holiday a number of Brits will be heading to Dubai (left) and New York (right) The most popular hot spots for those departing from the Yorkshire airport included the Spanish destinations of Majorca and Alicante, as well as Dublin and the Polish city of Krakow. For those staying at home, the weather picture is mostly doom and gloom, according to forecaster Helen Chivers of the Met Office. She told MailOnline: 'On Friday it looks as though it will be a showery day across the country. There will be some heavy and thundery showers, almost anywhere. 'The heaviest of the rain is likely to be across the eastern side of England. While there will be a bit of sunshine in between there will be predominantly heavy downpours and persistent rain. 'Temperatures will not be brilliant for the time of year, to be honest: they are expected to be in the high teens, so for most places they will be between 17 and 19 degrees Celsius. That is very low for the time of year.' Jam-packed: Some two million people are expected at Notting Hill Carnival this bank holiday weekend . Party time: Revellers dress up for the Notting Hill Carnival, which began in 1964 in London . Music man: Norman Jay MBE plays one of his famous Good Times sets at the carnival, but will the weather be as sunny this year? However, Mrs Chivers believes that the weather will slowly improve of the course of the weekend. She continued: 'We will still see some showers on Saturday, and it will be a breezy day, but there will be a mixture of sunshine and showers across the whole of the country. 'Some of those showers are likely to be heavy, particularly in the east and north. Temperatures will again be in the high teens - we might just get up to 20 degrees in the south. 'As we go in to Sunday and Monday I think we will see things improve a little bit more. Sunday's showers will be much lighter. Temperatures could get up to 21 degrees Celsius, especially in the south. 'The further north you go, the windier it is likely to be, and there is also the risk of rain from time to time. In fact there will be something of a north-south divide, in terms of the weather.' Sunday is also the biggest day of the Notting Hill Carnival, and while 40 people have been arrested by police on suspicion of planning riots at the festival, up to two million revellers are expected. The carnival has been going since 1964 and is thought to be the second most popular street festival behind the Rio Carnival in Brazil, and with luck the weather might be kind. Mrs Chivers said: 'There is a small chance that there will be showers, and it will be breezy. But it should be a bright day with sunny spells. Temperatures should get up to 21 degrees. It is a favourable part of the country. 'And on Monday that slow improvement will continue and for most of the country it should be a bright day with sunny spells, and the winds should ease. 'It will never be particularly warm over the weekend, and it will be very showery, but it will improve by Monday. 'In Scotland, however, particularly on Saturday and Sunday, there will be fairly unseasonable weather with very heavy rain and strong winds. The further north you go, the worse the weather will be.'","Met Office warn that the Bank Holiday weather will be 'cold and thundery'

Police have raided the home of a man and a woman who may be involved in the cold blooded killing of four people in a pharmacy on Sunday. According to witnesses the man escorted out of the house by police resembles a surveillance photo of the gunman. Peter Spano, who was working on the lawn next door, says he saw about 30 to 40 officers converge on the Medford house Wednesday. He said a distraught' man in handcuffs who looked like the man in the police photo, except without a beard. Police and prosecutors declined to say whether the activity was related to the homicide investigation. Scroll down for video . Swoop: Suffolk County police gather near the door of a house before escorting two suspects in Sunday's shooting out . Suspect: The man (centre) is led by police to a waiting car . Tragic: Jaime Taccetta, left, was shot in the head and discovered by her fiancé James Manzella after he dropped her off at the pharmacy in Medford on Long Island, New York . Officers were later seen peering into a storm drain at the foot of the driveway. Police also took a woman from the house. The gunman also stole prescription painkillers Sunday from Haven Drugs in Medford. Today's dramatic events emerged as more details of the victims of the tragic massacre continued to emerge. One of those shot was due to get married in only four months and will be buried in her wedding dress it emerged yesterday. The mother of brutally slaughtered bride-to-be Jaime Taccetta, 33, was keeping the white gown at her house until the wedding in October and has vowed that her daughter’s murderer will be found. Pat . Taccetta, 52, sobbed as she declared ‘justice will be done’ following . the horrific cold-blood killing of her ‘happy’ daughter and three others . in Medford on Long Island, New York, on Sunday morning. Her emotional comments came as police . said they are still searching for the suspect caught on CCTV tape and . consider him an ‘armed and dangerous’ drug user. ‘He was so senseless,’ Mrs Taccetta . told the New York Daily News. ‘He could have stolen the drugs and left . everybody alone. There was no reason to shoot them. He took away four . lives. Motherless: Little Kaitlyn, 5, is now without her mother after she was gunned down on Sunday . 'We’re going to get you. Justice will be done.' Mrs Taccetta’s daughter will be . buried this Saturday at Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Coram. Her family broke news of the death to her when she arrived home from a . holiday in Jamaica. Meanwhile, Miss Taccetta's fiancé has spoken of how he discovered his . girlfriend's corpse. James Manzella went to check on 'the love of his life' Miss Taccetta, after dropping her off at Haven Drugs in Long Island. Incredibly, . Mr Manzella only went to check on Jamie after seeing the bearded killer . leave the pharmacy and calmly walk away from the scene. Speaking to the New York Post, Mr . Manzella said: 'I saw the guy walk out, and I thought something was weird. 'So I turned the car off to check on her [Jamie]. I walked to the front.' He then stumbled upon the horrific scenes inside the store, finding Jamie as well as a second victim Bryon Sheffield, 71, dead. 'Can you imagine sitting there in air conditioning, . listening to music, and then the next minute she's gone,' he said. 'It was horrible, man. It was something I'll never forget. I'll never forget what I saw. It's stuck in me.' Mr Manzella, an electrician, planned to marry physical therapist Miss Taccetta in October. She had two daughters - Miranda, 16, and Kaitlyn, 5. A distraught Mr Manzella said he was haunted by the fact he saw the killer moments after the shooting took place. Junkie: These images, taken from the security camera at the Haven Pharmacy, appear to show the gunman perusing the shelves for drugs . He added: 'I could see the guy clearly, and now I think back if I could have done something. 'That's what messes with you. We were two average people trying to do the right thing, and this is what happens. It's not fair.' It has also emerged that the ruthless . gunman was . hunting for prescription painkillers. In what is thought be the latest in a string of drug fuelled robberies, the killer stormed the family-owned Haven Drugs pharmacy looking for the painkillers, according to police. A massive manhunt for the killer is continuing after Suffolk County homicide . detectives found the bodies at about . 60 miles east of New York City. Shot dead: Jennifer Mejia, who worked at the pharmacy in Medford, Long Island . Shock: The owner of a Pharmacy in Medford, NY collapses when he arrives at the store, following a shooting that killed four people. A pharmacist, a teenage worker, and two customers were killed when the gunman opened fire inside the store at roughly 10am. CCTV footage shows the gunman shooting at close range, before filling his backpack with prescription painkillers. The killing comes as DEA agents have been calling on Long Island pharmacists to boost security after recording a 125 per cent increase in pharmacy hold-ups in 2009 and 2010. Addicts and dealers are so desperate to get their hands on the painkillers they often leave money behind during the raids as they hunt for more drugs. A teenage girl, just days from graduating high school, has been identified as 17-year-old Jennifer Mejia, a senior at Bellport High School in . Brookhaven. Her father, Rene Mejia - an immigrant from El Salvador - described her as a 'wonderful daughter'. She had worked . at the pharmacy for about two years and wished him a happy Father's Day . early Sunday morning as she left for work. Speaking to the New York Post Rene said: 'This morning she told me, 'Happy Father's Day.' 'She was in a hurry to go to work. 'I held her and said, 'It's okay,' because in my country, Father's Day is Friday. I feel better because I held her.' Other victims were reported to be Raymond Ferguson, 45 - who also worked at the store - . as well as customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, a grandfather. Rene, . speaking outside their home, said his daughter was looking forward to . her prom on Wednesday. 'Now I just see the dress inside,' he said. 'You have to remember all of the good things.' His other daughter Leslie, was also supposed to work at the store that day. 'They were supposed to work today, her and my younger daughter. Leslie didn't go to work today,' he said. The 30-year-old drugstore had been robbed before, according to Mr Mejia. He added that despite this, his daughter was not afraid. Speaking to the Post, he added: 'She said people would come in and demand prescription medicine sometimes. People wanted the strong stuff. 'This was a heavy-duty pharmacy, not like Duane Reade.' Innocent beauty: Jennifer Mejia was among the four slaughtered in the suspected robbery on Sunday . Hunted: Surveillance video of the man that police suspect of shooting and killing four people at a pharmacy .

Kimberly Jimenez, 18, a friend and classmate, said Miss Mejia's 'ambition was to help people.' 'She was never a troubled person. For this to happen, it's so random. Crazy - crazy.' Shaken . residents converged on the crime scene and described the pharmacy as a . mom-and-pop shop where employees knew people by name. 'They know you, they know who you are,' said Nicole Kaiser, 27. 'This isn't that type of town. I can't believe it.' A special Facebook page set up to remember the slain high school student was flooded with tributes. Jalissa Ware posted: 'R.I.P Jenn ♥ we love youu and miss youu.

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 5:40 PM on 25th August 2011 . Anyone hoping that the first spaceman to land on Earth is as friendly as ET could be in for a shock. In the latest bid to get us to cut greenhouse gases, scientists have decided that eco-conscious aliens disgusted by mankind's emissions could destroy our planet in disgust. When observed from afar, the changes in Earth's atmosphere could label us as a civilisation that has grown out of control. Anyone hoping for a friendly form of alien life landing on Earth, like ET, could be disappointed. Nasa scientists have decided that aliens looking down on our planet will be less than pleased with our greenhouse gas emissions . Aliens reaching that conclusion may then launch a pre-emptive attack to protect this perceived threat to their own way of life. But that is only one possibility. Scientists are also considering other unwelcome - and far-fetched - outcomes, such as aggressive extra-terrestrials who eat or enslave us, or perhaps they are industrial types who want to improve their own technological infrastructure and so pillage ours. The report's writer Shawn Domagal-Goldman and his . team compiled a list of hypothetical situations to help us should we come into . contact with other life forms. The report, a joint effort between Nasa and Pennsylvania State University, answered the question 'Would Contact With . Extraterrestrials Benefit Or Harm Humanity?' Providing beneficial, . neutral and harmful outcomes, the report is designed to prepare mankind for the possibility of an alien encounter on Earth. BENEFICIAL . NEUTRAL . HARMFUL . In the best case scenarios put forward, the scientists claim that mankind could swap information to overcome hunger, poverty and disease. An alternative scenario could see man triumph over an alien force and learn from their technology. The report says: 'In these scenarios, humanity benefits not only from the major moral victory of having defeated a daunting rival, but also from the opportunity to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial intelligent (ETI) technology.' In the neutral category, it suggests man could feel indifferent towards any alien invaders because useful communication is not possible. There is even the possibility that aliens are too bureaucratic and tedious for us to join the 'Galactic Club'. Echoing the situation in the film District 9, in which aliens are put into a refugee camp in South Africa, they could even become a nuisance to Earthlings. The most harmful outcomes are also suggestions that would fit well in an apocalyptic Hollywood film script, with Independence Day-style attacks, accidental destruction of our planet or diseases wiping out the entire population. Their suggestions to help with our . survival against such events include the issuing of warnings against broadcasts that . might help aliens from learning about our biological make-up. The . first part of our contact, they add, should be limited to maths 'until . we have a better idea of the type of ETI we are dealing with'. The . report adds: 'A pre-emptive strike (by aliens) would be . particularly likely in the early phases of our expansion because a . civilisation may become increasingly difficult to destroy as it . continues to expand. Likely scenario? One of the 'neutral' situations of an alien encounter could involve a situation like that depicted in the film District 9 (pictured), in which aliens are kept in a compound in South Africa . 'Humanity . may just now be entering the period in which its rapid civilisational . expansion could be detected by an ETI because our expansion is changing . the composition of Earth's atmosphere, via greenhouse gas . emissions... 'These . scenarios give us reason to limit our growth and reduce our impact on . global ecosystems. 'It would be particularly important for us to limit . our emissions of greenhouse gases, since atmospheric composition can be . observed from other planets.'","Earth's greenhouse gases could be viewed as a serious threat made by a people that are out of control .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 4:47 PM on 25th August 2011 . Shot: Supporters of Jeremy Hill say he was 'protecting his children' when he shot the bear which had wandered on to his property (file picture) Dozens of supporters have turned out in court to show their outrage after a man was charged with killing a grizzly bear which had wandered into his back yard where his children were playing. Jeremy Hill has been charged with unlawfully taking a federally protected species after allegedly shooting the bear when it ambled on to his rural home in Porthill, Idaho, near the Canadian border. Supporters of the father-of-six say Mr Hill, 33, was doing nothing more than 'protecting his children' when the bear, accompanied by two other bears, wandered on to his property on May 8. It is thought the bear was shot with a bolt-action rifle after approaching an enclosure where Mr Hill's children had been raising pigs. At a hearing in the U.S. District Court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the crowd was so big that the magistrate judge had to move the case to another courtroom. A jury trial has been set for Oct. 4. If convicted, Hill could face penalties of up to one year in prison and fines up to $50,000. Following the hearing, Mr Hill's father, Mike Hill, told CDAPress.com, 'This whole thing is a waste of taxpayer money.' Mr Hill Snr said at least five of his son's six children were at home when the three bears approached his property. Support: Mr Hill's court hearing in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho was attended by so many people it had to be moved to a different courtroom . The Endangered Species Act classifies the grizzly bear as a threatened species in the lower 48 states, and it is protected by federal law. Hill and his wife have six children, and their home is between two federal grizzly bear recovery zones - the Selkirk zone to the west and Cabinet-Yaak zone to the east. Biologists estimate that 100 grizzlies inhabit the zones that include parts of Idaho, British Columbia and Montana.",Jeremy Hill 'killed bear with shotgun' when it wandered on to his property .
"By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 10:56 PM on 26th August 2011 . Cruel: Sarah Semple, from Lancaster, starved and beat the eight-year-old girl. She was jailed for nine months . A girl of eight was starved, beaten and forced to do chores in the freezing cold by her stepmother while her university professor father did nothing. Sarah Semple, 36, pulled out clumps of the girl’s hair and repeatedly slapped her. The child was often left to go hungry and once climbed on a table to grab some chocolates. When Semple noticed she had chocolate on her face she ordered her husband, Professor Kirk Semple, 44, to ‘leather’ his daughter. She then struck the girl repeatedly with a pair of trainers. Bradford Crown Court heard that Semple, a former administrative worker, appeared to care more for the rabbits she bred commercially than the child. In an online advert she wrote: ‘I give my rabbits plenty of daily cuddles. I aim to make sure that each feels loved, safe and happy.’ Last night Semple was beginning a nine-month jail term after she admitted child cruelty and assault. Her husband, who pleaded guilty to child cruelty through wilful neglect, was given a six-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid community work. Judge Peter Benson told the couple: ‘You are both highly intelligent people and that is unusual in a case of this sort because the stereotypical case of cruelty to a child involves quite often inadequate single parents struggling in deprived circumstances. That isn’t the case here. ‘That little girl was treated in a cruel and heartless manner. She looked at both of you to look after and protect her.’ He told the husband: ‘You were aware of the physical abuse and did nothing to prevent this dreadful treatment.’ Kirk Semple, a professor in environmental microbiology at the University of Lancaster, married Sarah Thomas in 2007, two years after the death of his first wife when the girl was three. Heartless: Kirk Semple was given a six-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours of unpaid community work . The couple moved into a £400,000 home in Bentham, Lancaster, with the girl and her 12-year-old brother. There Semple, who has ME, began breeding rabbits. The girl later told police how Semple would accuse her of seeking attention and smack her, often forcing her to stand in the freezing cold to look after the rabbits. Her ordeal came to an end when she was found in the street in January, attempting to walk to her grandparents’ home. Sarah Mallett, prosecuting, said passers-by noticed bad bruising and blood on her face and a bald patch on top of her head. ‘She was crying and shaking and said, “Don’t tell my mummy”. She told them she didn’t want to go home and didn’t want mummy to hit her.’ At a police station she ate four crumpets and drank two glasses of milk before being taken to hospital. Miss Mallett said: ‘A doctor found her to be a delightful, bright girl but she was unkempt, smelly and her hair was greasy. ‘She had bruising to her body, buttocks, legs and swelling and bruising to her nose and eyes. ‘The doctor concluded she had been subject to an extremely severe and frightening assault.’ The girl is now being looked after by her aunt while her brother is believed to be with his grandparents. Semple, who entered the dock with the help of two sticks, showed no emotion as she was jailed. Kirk Semple refused to comment as he left court.","Sarah Semple, 36, jailed for nine months .

"Jason Owen served a reduced sentence after appeal . By . Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 8:57 AM on 27th August 2011 . Strolling in the sunshine as a free man, this is one of the three monsters who killed Baby Peter. Jason Owen is back on the streets after serving just two years for a crime that horrified a nation. The sadistic 39-year-old was jailed over the death, abuse and torture of the 17-month-old. Monster's ink: Owen's right arm is tatooed with 'Only God can Judge me' Monster's ink: Owen's right arm is tatooed with 'Only God can Judge me' Casually walking down the street in smart new clothes, he looked relaxed, slim and fit. On his right arm was a tattoo with the provocative slogan ‘Only God can judge me’. He was heading back to a probation hostel for high-risk offenders. Owen was freed earlier this month and must live at the secret location while adjusting to life outside prison. Sources said he had thrown himself into an extreme fitness regime behind bars, including runs of as long as eight miles. He now bears little resemblance to the scruffy, bloated and hollow-eyed police mugshot taken in 2007 that accompanied the haunting stories of Peter Connelly’s suffering at his home in Haringey, North London. The release of Owen is the latest . painful injustice that has characterised the case. Inquiries, official . reports and court hearings have laid bare how Baby Peter was failed by . the authorities at every turn. Freed: Jason Owen (left) served two years in prison after he was convicted for causing or allowing the death of toddler Peter Connelly . Sharon . Shoesmith, the former Haringey children’s services chief, is even in . line for £1million compensation from the taxpayer over her sacking. She has expressed ‘sorrow’ for Peter’s death but has never apologised for her role in the failings of her department. The toddler suffered terrible abuse with 50 injuries, including a broken back, before he died in August 2007. Owen . and his brother Steve Barker, 35, who was Baby Peter’s stepfather, were . convicted of causing or allowing the child’s death in 2008. Baby Peter’s mother Tracey Connelly, 30, admitted the same offence at the Old Bailey. Evil:  The toddler's mother Tracey Connelly, left, and her partner Steven Barker, both remain in prison . It . emerged that officials assigned to Peter did not ask about Barker, who . was Connelly’s boyfriend, even when she listed him as next of kin. Had they done so they would have discovered he had been suspected of torturing his grandmother. Social workers considered the child’s care to be ‘a routine, low-risk case’. His mother was ‘disorganised, dirty and smelly’ and ‘without much conscience’, but thought too intimidating to ‘confront’. Doctors . also missed signs that the toddler’s injuries were deliberately . inflicted, even though police strongly suspected this was the case. Owen . was freed after serving half of a six-year sentence for causing or . allowing Peter’s death – having spent around 300 days in custody on . remand before his trial. The . convicted arsonist, crack addict and National Front member wanted . plastic surgery and a new identity on his release from Wandsworth. But he was given neither and is struggling to keep a low profile in a bid to avoid reprisal attacks. He also wanted a seaside council house with his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his five children.","Jason Owen served a reduced sentence after appeal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:47 AM on 27th August 2011 . Tragedy: Little Kiran Mir was left with terrible brain damage after choking on the ball . A girl of seven choked to death on a bouncy ball after it hit a wall and flew into her mouth, an inquest heard. Kiran Mir had been playing with the ball at home when it became lodged in her throat. Her mother, Shakeela, was in the room at the time of what was described by the coroner as a ‘one in a million’ chance accident. Her parents desperately tried to dislodge the toy, but the child’s heart stopped and she died in hospital two days later. Her father, Shahid, 45, said: ‘Kiran was such a happy, generous little girl. She had been to the shops with her mum and spent her pocket money on two 20p bouncy balls – one for her, and one for her sister. ‘Suddenly, [my wife] noticed Kiran was unable to breathe. She tried to reach the ball in her mouth, and started slapping on her back. But the ball wouldn’t budge.’ Mr Kir, a community project manager in Birmingham who had been at work nearby at the time, arrived just before paramedics. He said: ‘I tried holding her upside down, putting my hands under her ribs and pulling upwards. She was just floppy.’ Kiran, one of four children, died on March 1 after suffering a heart attack and severe brain damage. Mr Mir said: ‘It has devastated our family. Her siblings miss her every day.’ Birmingham coroner Adrian Cotter recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: ‘This was an unhappy chance in a million. ‘It is quite clear she was being well supervised at the time. It happened in a moment.’ He added: . 'Anyone who has children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces knows that . something like this can happen. 'I . cannot believe there is not a single parent who has not had to fish . something out of a child's mouth. It was a completely freak accident.' Speaking at the family's home in Saltley, Birmingham, Mr Mir said his daughter's death had 'killed all my happiness'. He said he, his wife aged 34, and their son Faris, aged ten, and daughters Danya, nine, and Laiba, three, had all been left devastated by the death. Mr Mir, aged 45, who works as a manager at voluntary organisation East Birmingham Community Forum, said he was at work when the tragedy happened. In a statement read out to the inquest, Mrs Bibi said the day before she had bought two small rubber balls for Kiran and one for her other children, paying 20p each for them. She said the following day she had collected her children from school, taken them back home and was changing their clothes. Mrs Bibi said: 'She was bouncing the ball between her hand and the floor. I suddenly heard Kiran cough and immediately looked towards her.' She said her daughter continued to cough and that she suspected Kiran may have swallowed the ball. She added: 'I immediately approached her and used one hand to smack her gently two or three times between her shoulder blades hoping for the ball to pop out.' Devastated: Kiran's heartbroken parents Shakeela Bibi and Shahid Mir fought to save their daughter after the ball got lodged in her throat . Freak accident: The 20p rubber ball, similar to these, bounced into the little girl's mouth . However, she said, Kiran's lips started to turn blue and she could see she was having difficulty breathing. Mrs Bibi said she took her daughter to the bathroom and that Kiran had tried to vomit. She then took her back in the living room and made further attempts to get the ball out, but realised that matters had gone beyond her control and phoned her husband. Speaking at their home, Mr Mir said he told his colleague to call for an ambulance while he rushed home. He said: 'Me and my wife carried on . trying to dislodge the ball by hitting her on the back of the throat and . also putting our arms around her chest and back and pulling upwards. 'It's killed all my happiness': Grieving Mr Mir with a picture of his little girl . 'By now the ambulance came and they took over. In the ambulance Kiran had a cardiac arrest but the paramedics managed to get her heart started again. 'When she got to Heartlands her heart had been stopped for 29 minutes and they told us she had suffered brain damage so was transferred to another hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. It's just terrible, terrible. It's killed all my happiness.' Mr Mir said his daughter was in intensive care overnight but the following day doctors said the brain damage was so severe she would never recover. He added: 'Then we had to make the difficult decision to turn off the life support machine. 'I was really reluctant to do so but they said that way she could pass away in a dignified way. 'She was always very cheerful, a really happy and loving little girl. We miss her every day - especially her sister who was also her friend and they were always playing together.' He said Kiran was also a popular motivated pupil at school and all the teachers and fellow pupils had been left devastated. Mr Mir said a memorial bench had been put in the gardens of Shaw Hill Primary School in Alum Rock, where his daughter was a pupil.","Kiran Mir was playing with ball at the family home when tragedy struck .

Idaho State Senator John McGee spent Father's Day in jail after being charged with drunken driving and suspicion of felony grand theft. Mr McGee, a past 'Republican Legislator of the Year,' is accused of taking an SUV with a 20ft cargo trailer attached from the Boise area home of a 'complete stranger' after an evening of drinking at a golf course clubhouse. According to the Ada County Sheriff's Office, 38-year-old McGee, who is the Senate GOP Caucus Chairman and the youngest member of Idaho's senate, began drinking at a Boise golf course at about 10pm Saturday. The lawmaker, who lives in Caldwell, left the clubhouse just before 3am and began walking before seeing the Ford Excursion with the 20ft trailer hooked up. The vehicle was unlocked with the keys inside. McGee got inside and drove away, authorities say. Shortly after Mr McGee tried turning the vehicle and trailer around in a driveway. But the move was unsuccessful and the Excursion and trailer jack-knifed and became stuck, Gawker.com reports. According to Sgt. Carlos De Leon with Sheriff's Office, Mr McGee then allegedly left the vehicle and walked back and forth indecisively up and down the street. The laughing lawmaker: Sen. John McGee, holding his two-year-old daughter Madalyn, is seen with Idaho Lt. Gov. Brad Little when the 61st legislative session was adjourned in April . Sen. John McGee's scrape with the law is the latest shocker in what is turning out to be a bumper year for scandals. He follows Weinergate, Anthony's Weiner's cringe-making attempts to cover-up revelations of sending lewd photos to young women and sending racy texts both before and after his marriage last July. In of this year, Republican Chris Lee resigned after he texted a shirtless picture of himself to a woman he met on Craigslist . Mr De Leon said two children at the home where McGee tried to turn the SUV were watching from a window. They called police after Mr McGee allegedly got back in the vehicle and feel asleep. When deputies arrived, Mr McGee told them on he was heading for Jackpot in Nevada, on the border with Idaho. A Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol content to be .15, nearly twice the Idaho state limit. He was booked into the Ada County Jail at about 4.30am. The politician will be arraigned on Monday afternoon. Lt. Kody Aldrich, of the Boise police, said Mr McGee did not know the owner of the SUV and trailer, adding that it was unclear why Mr McGee was in the Boise area. Mr McGee is married and has a daughter. He is deeply involved in transportation issues and has recently supported legislation to outlaw texting and driving. Late night shenanigans: The SUV and trailer John McGee is accused of taking . Because of the nature of the accusations against he will remain in jail until he goes before a judge on Monday. The lawmaker was named the Idaho Young Republican of the Year and Republican Legislator of the Year in 2006. He was first elected to the Idaho Senate in 2004 and is currently in his fourth term. Rising star: John McGee with wife Hannah and daughter Madalyn, as seen on his official State Senate website .

In the last Legislative session, he supported a bonds-for-highways plan called Connecting Idaho, which is aimed at maintaining Idaho's roads and bridges. He also introduced a bill requiring underage drivers to take safety training as part of a compromise to fend off road closures and maintain public access following a U.S. Forest Service plan to close some roads to all-terrain vehicles amid safety concerns over underage drivers.

The 25-year-old who is serving probation for cheque fraud will be educated from the comfort of her own home. As a condition of her probation, which is unrelated to her acquittal of the murder of her daughter, Anthony is required to seek employment. Back to school: Casey Anthony will study online during her one year probation . But because of death threats, she has been granted a waiver allowing her to attend school online instead. It is not known what she will study. Casey Anthony reported for probation in Florida on Wednesday evening, according to her lead defence counsel Jose Baez. 'America's most hated woman' will serve probation 'somewhere in the state of Florida,' though the . exact location of her probation office is being kept secret over . concerns for her safety. 'She . reported,' Attorney Baez told Fox News. 'She told the officer she . understands the conditions of her probation and she was told the date . for her next appearance.' Coming back: Casey Anthony leaves jail in Orlando, Florida, on July 17, after her murder acquittal, but the probation system hasn't finished with her yet . A Florida appeals court had earlier ruled the . 25-year-old must start a one-year probation sentence for cheque fraud . by the end of this week. A judge disagreed with her argument that enforcing a probation order would violate a constitutional block on double jeopardy. Anthony claimed she completed the probation sentence in jail while awaiting trial over the 2008 death of her two-year-old daughter, Caylee. But the ruling upheld a lower court’s order requiring Anthony to report to a Florida probation office no later than 12pm on Friday. ‘The petitioner and her attorneys were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement,’ it said. In court: Casey Anthony, centre, with her attorneys Jose Baez and Dorothy Clay Sims, was found not guilty of murder on July 5 in the death of her daughter . A Florida jury last month acquitted Anthony of murder in the death of Caylee, in a case unrelated to the cheque fraud. After . her release, she vanished from public view amid threats against her and . she has since kept a low profile - but is now back in Florida. The probation order is from a sentence Judge Stan Strickland imposed in January 2010 after she pleaded guilty to stealing cheques from a friend. Judge Strickland said at the time she should serve the probation upon her release, but those instructions were never put in a written order. Corrections officials interpreted the sentence to mean Anthony could serve the probation while she was in jail. Dead: A Florida jury last month acquitted Anthony of murder in the death of her daughter Caylee, pictured, in a case unrelated to the cheque fraud . But in an order this month, Judge Strickland clarified that she must begin her probation now that she is out of jail. He then gave up the case and turned it over to Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over Anthony's murder trial. Judge Perry upheld Judge Strickland's order, but Anthony's attorneys appealed last week to the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Daytona Beach. In a court filing this week, Anthony’s legal team described the probation order as an ‘illegal sentence’. The Florida Department of Corrections has determined that Anthony had already served the probation sentence. Judge Strickland did not have jurisdiction to clarify the order because the probation sentence was terminated, the department said. Earlier a DOC spokesman had told Fox News: ‘We're waiting for her.'","Location will be kept secret over safety concerns .

In scenes reminiscent of The Wire crime show, a desperate man has been caught on camera firing on a store owner and making a dramatic last stand against police. Police say Carl Lastorino, 45, was gunned down after he refused to submit to two police officers in the East New York section of Brooklyn. They said Lastroino pointed his weapon at them and shouted: 'You are not going to take me alive'. So each cop fired a single round, hitting him twice in the chest. Lastorino later died at Brookdale University Hospital. Scroll down for video . Bold act: Dramatic surveillance footage shows what police say is the suicidal son of a Luchese mobster botching a rubout of a Brooklyn merchant with ties to the crime family . Police say Lastorino asked the man if he was 'Pete', then started firing a .38-caliber pistol at him . The desperate man had tried to escape in a taxi yesterday, but after witnesses on the street pointed him out, officers responding to the scene pulled the cab over, and confronted Lastorino. They say he had exited a tyre shop on Linden Blvd 11 minutes earlier, where he took several shots at merchant Peter Argentina, 49. Mr Argentina was struck in the hand and shoulder, according to the New York Daily News, but he likely saved himself by holding his hand in front of his body and by his quick feet. When the shots started ringing out, he ran deep into the shop, down a maze of tires. He told police he was 'trying to run serpentine, but I ran out of room'. Fleeing: Peter Argentina, 49, narrowly escaped alive, after running down a maze of tyres. He suffered injuries only to his hand and shoulder . Hot pursuit: The shooter fires several more times at Mr Argentina, but he got away. Police say Lastorino fled the shop, but was stopped by two officers eleven minutes later, where he was shot and killed . Police say Mr Argentina may have affiliations with the Luchese crime family. They said although Lastorino wasn't a member of the Luchese, his father Frank Lastorino Sr., was, and had been sent to prison in 1993 for conspiracy to commit murder. Police say Lastorino's brother is also in the Mob. But instead of appearing like an orchestrated act of mob violence, police say they think Lastorino acted alone. Getaway: Police say Lastorino tried to get away in a livery cab after shooting at Mr Argentina . Final moment: As a police officer can be seen approaching through the rear window, Lastrorino hesitates a moment. He then steps outside, and police say he shouted he wouldn't be taken alive, then pointed his gun . It may have been a final desperate act of a suicidal man, since police say they found several suicide notes left to his mother and sister. Lastorino, who had been unemployed for three years, wrote: 'I can no longer live as a failure'. And so he walked into the tyre shop around 4:40 p.m. yesterday, armed with two .38-caliber pistols, police say. He asked: 'Are you Pete?' 'Yeah, I'm Pete', Mr Argentina responded. 'This is for you, Pete', Lastorino responded, as he unloaded his weapon, police say. Watch video here .","Carl Lastorino, 45, was killed after pointing his gun at police .

Suspect: A manhunt had been launched to find Captain Leonard Egland who is thought to have killed his ex-wife and her boyfriend . Police say an Army captain being sought in the deaths of four people in Pennsylvania and Virginia has been found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound. Pennsylvania State Police spokesman David Lynch says the body of 37-year-old Leonard John Egland of Fort Lee, Virginia, was found shortly after 3.30pm Sunday in Warwick Township. Egland, who recently returned from war service and fired at officers in suburban Philadelphia, was wanted in connection with the Virginia deaths of his ex-wife, her boyfriend and the boyfriend's young son, authorities said. The soldier's former mother-in-law was also killed. District Attorney David Heckler didn't know when the Virginia deaths occurred, but said Egland's former mother-in-law, 66-year-old Barbara Reuhl of Buckingham, Pennsylvania, was believed to have been killed Saturday night. Later that night, Egland went to St. Luke's Hospital in Quakertown, where he tried to leave his young daughter along with a note, Mr Heckler said. Fears that the combat veteran was on a mission to wipe out his ex-wife's family led to police guards being placed on relatives homes. Police in Church School Road in the Buckingham Township where Egland's mother-in-law is believed to have lived . After a male nurse or orderly confronted him, he allegedly flashed a pistol, and the hospital worker called police with a description of the suspect and his vehicle. Just before midnight, the vehicle was stopped by state and local police in Doylestown Township, where he fired shots from a semi-automatic rifle, hitting a Doylestown officer in the arm and shattering a windshield that sent glass into the face of an officer. The vehicle was later spotted Sunday in Warwick Township, the Associated Press reports. Egland's mother-in-law Barbara Ruehl, 66, was shot dead before she could get out of her chair in Buckingham Township, Pennsylvania, pictured . Local officers reported being fired upon again, but no one was hit. Police issued an alert to residents to consider the suspect armed and dangerous. Mr Heckler said the suspect apparently tried unsuccessfully to break into a home, but was still being sought Sunday by police and a SWAT team. He was believed to be on foot. Egland had recently returned from the latest of three deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr Heckler said.","Leonard Egland was suspected of killing ex-wife, her boyfriend, his son and his former mother-in-law .

The fire in the casino was reported . just before 4pm yesterday - a relevantly quite period of the day when . normally about 80 people played the tables and slots, according to . former security guard Alberto Martinez Alvarado, 30. Mr Martinez, who on his way home from work when he saw the fire, said the casino could hold hundreds, perhaps a thousand people. 'We're lucky we weren't there,' he said. 'Why couldn't the people who did this do some honest work instead?' Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who launched his war on drug cartels in 2006 when he came to power, condemned the attack . The dead who were recovered were . identified by their relatives at the morgue, though thanks to the blaze . it is proving to be an arduous process. Francisco . Tamayo, who lives in Monterrey, said he and family members looked at . some 40 bodies in search of his mother, Sonia de la Pena, 47, who loved . to gamble at the casino and was there on average four days a week. They have yet to find her, the 28-year-old said, after they rushed to the scene having learned of the fire on the television. Last night president Calderon, 49, used micro blogging site Twitter to condemn the attack and tweeted that it was 'an abhorrent act of terror and barbarism' that requires 'all of us to persevere in the fight against these unscrupulous criminal bands'. Attorney General Leon Adrian de la Garza said a drug cartel appeared to be responsible for the attack, though he didn't not identify exactly which one. Monterrey Mayor Fernando Larrazabal . said many of the bodies were found inside the casino's bathrooms, where . employees and customers had locked themselves to escape the gunmen. Maria Tomas Navarro, 42, stood weeping at the edge of the police tape stretched in front of the smoke-stained casino building. She was hoping for word of her brother, 25-year-old Genaro Navarro Vega, who had worked in the casino's bingo area. Mrs Navarro said she tried calling . her brother's mobile phone, 'but he doesn't answer,' she said. 'I don't . know what is happening. There is nobody to ask.' Cartels often extort casinos and other businesses, threatening to attack them or burn them to the ground if they refuse to pay. It was the second time in only three months that the Casino Royale was targeted. Gunmen struck it and three other casinos on May 25, spraying the building with bullets, but no was reported injured in that attack.","Drug cartel blamed for the attack - though which one has not been revealed .

"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 1:53 AM on 27th August 2011 . Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan has stepped down after barely 15 months in office. Kan's announcement comes after his approval ratings plunged over his handling of the country's nuclear crisis that followed the earthquake off Japan in March. In a nationally televised speech, Kan said he was stepping down as chief of the ruling Democratic Party. Stepping down: Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan bows during a press conference at his official residence in Tokyo . He said he will officially quit as prime minister after the ruling party votes to pick a new leader on Monday. The winner will become the country's sixth prime minister in five years. Japan has been plagued by high turnover in political leadership at a time when the country faces huge problems. The country is suffering from an aging . population, bulging debt and a stagnant economy - and now reconstruction . from the worst disaster to hit the country since World War Two. Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda and Trade Minister Banri Kaieda are also seen as contenders. The decision was widely expected because . in June, Kan had promised to quit once lawmakers passed three key . pieces of legislation, the final two of which cleared the parliament . earlier today. Kan managed to survive only a few months longer than the four previous prime ministers, who each lasted a year or less. Addressing the nation: Prime Minister Naoto Kan faced widespread criticism before announcing he will step down . Looking back on his year and three months in office, Kan said he did all he could given difficulties he faced, including the disasters and a major election defeat in upper house elections last summer that left the parliament in gridlock. 'Under the severe circumstances, I feel I've done everything that I had to do,' he said. 'Now I would like to see you choose someone respectable as a new prime minister.' The 64-year-old Kan has seen his approval ratings tumble below 20 per cent amid a perceived lack of leadership after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which led to meltdowns at three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. Only 10 per cent of respondents approved of Kan's job performance, while 69 percent disapproved, in an AP-GfK poll conducted between July 29 and August 10. Some 21 per cent said they neither approved or disapproved. The poll's margin of error was 3.8 per cent. Survivors have complained about slow recovery efforts, and radiation has spread into the air, water and some foods. Devastated: Japan's Fukushima power plant has so far emitted radiation equal to 168 Hiroshima bombs . Radiation leaking from the plant has declined dramatically as workers try to bring the plant to a cold shutdown by January. Many of the 100,000 people who were evacuated from around the plant live in temporary housing or shelter, and have no idea when they will be able to return to their homes. Accumulated radiation in some locations may keep them away for a long time, government officials have said recently. Political commentators say Kan was at least partly undone by persistent political infighting, including within his own party. While the public hungered for political cooperation and vision in the wake of the crisis, parliamentary sessions frequently descended into squabbling matches that have disillusioned the public. It was a no-confidence motion in June submitted by an opposition bloc that prompted Kan in June to promise he would resign in a desperate attempt to keep his own party members from joining the vote. In the wake of the crisis, Kan urged Japan to become less reliant on nuclear energy, but his appeal did little to boost his image. At an evening press conference, Kan said that the atomic crisis made him realize that having so many nuclear power plants in quake-prone Japan 'could endanger the people's future'. Contenders will officially declare their candidacy on Saturday, followed by a debate on Sunday and party vote on Monday. The new Cabinet is expected to be installed on Tuesday. Japan will remove soil, plants, trees and cleaning roofs of buildings in an area spanning thousands of square miles in a bid to halve radiation in places contaminated by the Fukushima nuclear crisis. The cleanup could cost tens of billions of dollars, and thousands of evacuees may not be able to return home for years, if ever. Radiation in a contaminated area is estimated to fall naturally by about 40 per cent over two years, and the government wants to speed up the process by another 10 per cent through human efforts. Yesterday it was revealed the amount of radioactive caesium-137 released by the plant so far is estimated to be equal to that of 168 Hiroshima bombs. Government nuclear experts, however, said the World War II bomb blast and the accidental reactor meltdowns at Fukushima, which has seen ongoing radiation leaks but no deaths so far, were beyond comparison. Today, nuclear crisis minister Goshi Hosono said: 'We aim to reduce radiation levels by half over the next two years in affected areas, and by 60 per cent over the same period for places used by children.' Kan urged the Democrats to seek unity as they pick a new leader. A key player in the process remains party kingpin Ichiro Ozawa, who still wields enormous influence even though he lost to Kan in the party leadership election last September. 'I hope to see this party become one, where everyone from the young to the veterans can discuss policy actively and freely, then cooperate and act as one,' Kan said. Kan, who called off a planned trip to visit President Barack Obama next month due to the political uncertainty, said Tokyo should keep Japan-U.S. alliance as a 'cornerstone' of its security and foreign policy. He also urged his successor to 'not put off any longer' attempts to rein in Japan's public debt, which has grown to more than twice the size of the country's gross domestic product. The idea of raising the country's five per cent sales tax as a way to address this problem and raise money for reconstruction efforts seems to have lost traction.","Polls show 69 per cent wanted him to go .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:18 AM on 23rd August 2011 . A newly-discovered deep, cold current flowing off Iceland's coast may mean the North Atlantic is less sensitive to climate change than previously thought. The North Icelandic Jet feeds the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation - or AMOC - a giant pattern known as the 'great ocean conveyor belt', which regulates North American and European climates. Scientists had previously believed that most of the cold water that formed . that deep south-flowing stream came from off the Greenland coast and was . made up of fresh glacier-melt water. Hit movie The Day After Tomorrow showed how a new ice age overtakes America and Europe in the wake of a catastrophic climatic shift . However, the North . Icelandic Jet appears to contribute more to the deeper part of the AMOC . than the Greenland current does, according to scientists. The 'conveyor belt' current was introduced in the Al Gore environmental film An Inconvenient . Truth, and carries warm surface water from the tropical Atlantic toward the . Arctic. In the process, the water warms the . air in high latitudes, then cools, sinks and returns towards the equator, . flowing as a deep stream at lower ocean depths. Because fresh water freezes at a . higher temperature than salt water, these specialists suggested that . this fresh water from glaciers and other warming-related phenomena would . get into the North Atlantic, where it could freeze and prevent the . water from sinking to make up the bottom of the conveyor belt. If that happened, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation was disrupted or slowed at the place in . the far north where the warm water at the surface cools and sinks - called the overturning - it could eventually lead to a colder Northern . Hemisphere. Study co-author Robert Pickart, of the . Woods Hold Oceanographic Institution, said: 'Present thinking contends that increased . fresh water delivered to the North Atlantic, due to melting ice and . increased precipitation under a warming climate, will slow down or halt . the overturning of the AMOC.' This might not be the case if the . overturning occurs in the interior of the Iceland Sea, which feeds the . North Icelandic Jet, Dr Pickart added. 'It . is not inconceivable that this open-ocean process is less sensitive to . fresh water forcing than the presently accepted mechanism ... which . might lead one to speculate that the deepest part of the overturning may . be less sensitive to climate change,' he said. A Trawler travels in the waters off north Iceland, close to where the newly discovered flow of water runs . The existence of the North Icelandic Jet was suspected for decades but was only confirmed recently by Icelandic researchers using underwater velocity measurements taken from a ship. The current cannot be seen by satellites or detected by its temperature or salinity, but it does move a bit faster than the surrounding water, Pickart said. Pickart and researchers from Norway and Iceland don't know whether the North Icelandic Jet flows year round or how it varies with time. They are beginning a research voyage this week to deploy oceanographic instruments to directly measure the North Icelandic Jet over the course of a full year to try to figure out where and how this current forms. The research is published in the . journal Nature Geoscience.","The North Icelandic Jet feeds a giant pattern known as the 'great ocean conveyor belt', which regulates North American .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:54 PM on 21st June 2011 . John McCain today said that he was baffled by controversy surrounding his claim that illegal immigrants caused some of the wildfires raging across Arizona. In a hastily arranged tour of the breakfast news shows, the Arizona senator tried to explain his comments, saying all he was doing was repeating information he had been given by officials. 'We all know that people who come across our border illegally… that these fire are sometimes, some of them, caused by this,' he told the Today Show. 'I'm puzzled… that there should be any controversy.' Scroll down for video . Baffled: John McCain today said that he's 'not sure what all this controversy is about' surrounding his unsubstantiated claim that illegal immigrants caused some of the wildfires raging across eastern Arizona . Mr McCain said that his assessment that there is 'substantial evidence' illegal immigrants are responsible for 'some of these fires' was based on a briefing on Saturday from a U.S. Forest Service official. 'This is the toughest year in Arizona's history as far as fires are concerned,' Mr McCain told Good Morning America. 'The fact is that as far back as 2006 the Forest Service testified before Congress, and I quote, “Large numbers of warming and cooking fires built and abandoned by cross border violators have caused wildfires that have destroyed valuable natural and cultural resources”.' A spokesman for the agency said on Monday that although the latest wildfires appeared to be 'human caused' there is no evidence that the suspects were illegal immigrants. Meanwhile Mr McCain brushed aside questions about whether he might run for president again in 2012. Asked on the Today Show whether he would consider running if there were no clear front-runner, he smiled and said: 'There's a long history of masochism in my family, but not so severe as to make me want to jump in again.' Not running again: Mr McCain insisted that he would not be running for the Republican nomination again after he ran for president with Sarah Palin in 2008 . Republican senator John McCain accusation that illegal immigrants started wildfires raging across Arizona, prompting a furious response from Latino civil rights groups. He spoke as thousands more Arizona residents were evacuated from the paths of the biggest wildfires ever in the state's history. Mr McCain had said: 'There is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally. 'The answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border.' Latino civil rights campaigners slammed the remarks, presented without any supporting evidence, as 'careless and reckless'. Speaking to CNN, Randy Parraz, a . Latino Democrat who ran against Mr McCain in 2010, said: 'It's easier to . fan the flames of intolerance, especially in Arizona'. Tragic: Pete Tunstall leans on his rake while at his home that burned along the south side of Ramsey Road near State Route 92 . Fire crews from Rio Rico and Helmet Peak mop up hot spots in a storage trailer in Sierra Vista, Arizona, after the Monument Fire burned through the area overnight . Firefighters are currently battling wildfires that have burned a combined 732,427 acres across the state. Mr . McCain had suggested that illegal immigrants had started the fires to . send signals, to keep warm or to distract border security. But . he did not pin down which fires were allegedly started by illegal . immigrants, nor provide details of the 'substantial' evidence he cited. Meanwhile thousands more people were driven from their homes as powerful winds pushed the flames from one wildfire towards populated areas. The Monument fire just south of the city of Sierra Vista was one of several blazing through dry brush and timber in Arizona and New Mexico where fire crews have been dogged for days by hot, windy weather. About 3,000 people from 1,700 homes were evacuated on Sunday as the blaze - which has been burning for a week - picked up speed with winds gusted up to 60mph. Fire trucks escape the flames near South Andalusian Way after the fire jumped State Route 92 near Sierra Vista, Arizona . The Monument Fire burns a hillside just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona. Authorities have ordered more evacuations . 'Winds pushed fire across Highway 92, making run so fast and so hot that the danger to citizens in the path was significant,' said Cochise County sheriff's spokesman Carol Capas. The flames raced down a mountain and into a heavily populated area, forcing crews to abandon their lines and set up in new spots. Sunday's evacuations brought the total number to about 10,000 people from 4,300 homes forced to flee the flames of the Monument fire, she said. Evacuees have been staying with friends and relatives, at three evacuation shelters, and at local inns. 'This is horrible. This is a nightmare,' Debbie Schmidlin told the Arizona Daily Star. She said she was evacuated twice in the past week from homes east and west of Highway 92. Flames are seen over homes in Sierra Vista, Arizona. The biggest wildfire in state history is closing in on a half million acres burned. 'If this fire gets there, I'm leaving Arizona,' she added, as she watched from behind police lines two miles north of her home. Before the winds spread the flames earlier in the day, the blaze was reported 27 percent contained at about 21,000 acres or nearly 33 square miles. In eastern Arizona, the massive Wallow fire that has been burning for three weeks kept about 200 residents of Luna, New Mexico, under an evacuation order for a second day. A containment line that had held through days of high winds was breached on Saturday and the fire raced toward town before shifting winds steered it clear. It was moving to the north into an area of scattered ranches late on Sunday afternoon, fire information officer Michael Puentes said. Despite the evacuation order for Luna, about half the town's residents remained in town. 'If the fire comes back around or things change where they have to get out, we still have an egress point, so we will still escort them out of town,' Catron County Undersheriff Ian Fletcher said. The Wallow blaze has consumed nearly 800 square miles, a little more than 511,000 acres, and more than 3,500 firefighters were trying to stop its advance. It is larger than a 2002 fire that burned 732 square miles and destroyed 491 buildings that had been the largest in state history. Despite its size, the latest fire has destroyed just 32 homes and four rental cabins. Containment rose to 51 percent Sunday. The Wallow fire, which is burning up much of Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, is the largest of several wildfires burning in spots across the southwestern United States. Watch the video .

"By . Rachel Quigley and Thomas Durante . Last updated at 10:48 PM on 30th August 2011 . As ravaged areas try to pick up the pieces from the wrath of Hurricane Irene, a new threat may be churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Tropical Storm Katia was born at about 5am eastern time on Tuesday, upgraded from a tropical depression that formed yesterday. Like Irene, Katia formed from the tropical waves off Africa’s Cape Verde Islands, and could gain enough steam in the warm water to collect hurricane strength. Scroll down for videos . Here comes Katia: Tropical Storm Katia, bottom right, can be seen forming off the Cape Verde Islands in Africa . But will Katia pack the same punch as her sister? 'It's far too early to tell,' said Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 'We’re in the peak of the hurricane season. This is when you're going to see most of the storms and they’re not all going to take the same track.' Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Centre, told Reuters: 'It's still well out to sea. A lot of things can happen. Despite the fact that Katia’s path is unknown even to the experts, Mr Pasch recommended that the East Coast and the Caribbean 'keep an eye' on the storm. Keeping up with Katia: The experts say it's 'far too early to tell' whether Katia will take the same path as Hurricane Irene . As Hurricane Irene battered the East Coast this weekend, it appeared Tropical Storm Jose was next in line for the Atlantic hurricane season, but that storm sputtered almost as fast as it formed. '[Jose] died a quick death,' Mr Feltgen said. Meanwhile, storm-ravaged areas from North Carolina to Vermont are fighting to survive after Hurricane Irene levelled structures, knocked out power and spawned rivers of epic flooding. The small town of Prattsville, New York in the Catskill Mountains has nearly been wiped off the map after Irene tore through the area, taking out bridges and destroying homes. On Monday night, police helicopters rescued 21 people left stranded by the floods, including a pregnant woman and four young children, CNN reported.The group took shelter in a home after intense rain and treacherous flooding crippled all bridges leading into and out of the town. The dramatic rescue came after some 87 people were plucked from the area on Sunday. Another 40 people remain holed up at the Huntersfield Christian Training Centre. Catastrophe, before and after: The Gilboa Dam in upstate New York was heavily damaged after Irene tore through the area. Path of destruction: A once-quiet country road is now littered with homes and pieces of homes in the New York town of Prattsville . Bridge to nowhere: Dozens of residents in the town of Prattsville have been stranded after its bridges were destroyed . George Williams, youth leader at the centre, told CNN: 'There are some here that have nothing to go back to, so they don't know how long it's going to be.' And Prattsville's not alone, as thousands of residents as far north as Vermont were left homeless by Irene's unprecedented flooding. Marion Bender's home in Greenfield, Massachusetts, was completely flooded by the huge torrents that have swept across the region - and she and her husband have no flood insurance. 'We have got to start all over,' she said. 'We'll be all right.' The flooding has brought the death toll from hurricane Irene to 46 with whole towns swept away and the state of Vermont particularly badly affected. National Guard and firefighters rescued hundreds from record flooding in New Jersey on Tuesday as Vermont planned to airlift food and water to inland towns cut off by Hurricane Irene. Time to go: Carol Bittman kisses her husband, Richard, as she is evacuated from her flooded home by members of the Totowa volunteer fire department and the National Guard in Totowa, New Jersey . Dire situation: New Jersey and Vermont continue to struggle with their worst flooding in decades . The storm may have spared New York City, but it caused the worst flooding in decades in inland areas of New York State, New Jersey and Vermont. Search and rescue teams have plucked nearly 600 people from homes in recent days with the most intense efforts on Tuesday when the Passaic River measured 13 feet above flood stage, the highest level since 1903, Paterson police Sgt. Alex Popov said. Firefighters rescued some by boat and the National Guard saved others by truck, taking them to a Red Cross shelter. ‘Some are standing there in the doorway. Some are coming out of their windows,’ Popov said. ‘It's raging,’ he said of the Passaic, which runs through the centre of town. Authorities expected the river to begin receding later on Tuesday. Swollen rivers were still cresting on Tuesday and flood plains remained under water in northeastern states that were already soaked by an unusually wet summer. Devastation: Intense wind and flooding brought on by Hurricane Irene has left little to come home to in Vermont . Utilities restored electricity to roughly half the 6.7 million customers who had power knocked out, and New York City mass transit and air travel crept back to normal. Clear skies in the northeast aided rescue efforts, but hundreds of thousands of homes were damaged, some swept away in the torrent. In New York City's New Jersey suburbs, flood victims anxiously waited for waters to recede while just a few miles away the city buzzed anew, slowed only temporarily by an unprecedented preemptive shutdown of its mass transit system and an evacuation order on Saturday. The governor of . Vermont has spoken of the devastation the small rural state suffered at . the hands of Hurricane Irene and warned that further flooding and loss . of life are likely. Governor Peter . Shumlin said: 'It's just devastating. Whole communities under water, . businesses, homes, obviously roads and bridges, rail transportation . infrastructure. We've lost farmers' crops. We're tough folks up here but . Irene ... really hit us hard. Washed away: Residents walk along Highway 12, the main road that connects Cape Hatteras National Seashore to the main land, near where Hurricane Irene first made landfall on Saturday . Devastation: Lock 8 in Rotterdam, New York, overflows with water, and a metal barge is crashed into the gates, on Monday during extensive flooding in the region as a result of Irene . 'It's hard for us to know, frankly, . how many are stranded because it's hard for us to get into the . communities we need to get to. It really packed a punch. It is probably the toughest flooding that we've seen in the state of Vermont in our history. 'We really need more resources but the President has been extraordinarily helpful'. Highlighting . the transportation problems, the Vermont National Guard had to travel . through neighbouring Massachusetts to get rescue crews to the small, . cut-off town of Wilmington, the governor said. The . death toll for the hurricane has now risen to 46 as towns and cities . start the recovery process, with some still grappling with more . flooding. Images of the . flooding showed normally tranquil streams pouring through city streets . and thrashing against buildings and bridges, including some of the . state's iconic covered bridges. Four to six of the covered bridges were . destroyed in the flooding, officials said. From . North Carolina to Maine, communities cleaned up and took stock of the . uneven and hard-to-predict costs of a storm that spared the nation's . biggest city a nightmare scenario, only to deliver a historic wallop to . towns well inland. Collapse: Another home destroyed by Tropical Storm Irene rests on the beach in East Haven, Connecticut, yesterday . Many people lost all their worldly possessions in the hurricane and some even their whole homes. All . that is left of a beach front cottage in Nags Head, North Carolina, . owned by the Stinson family are the steps that once led up to it. The . Stinson family's devastation has been shown in several photographs of . the disaster, a father comforting his wife and daughter on the steps leading to where their house once stood, staring at the ocean beyond. Loss: The Stinson family looks out at the ocean from the remains of their beachfront home, which was swept away in the wrath of Hurricane Irene . Beauty: The Stinson cottage, seen in this 2010 photo, was built in 1903, and bought by Billy Stinson's family in 1963 . His . daughter, Erin Stinson said: 'We were pretending, just for a moment, . that the cottage was still behind us and we were just sitting there . watching the sunset.' The cottage, which was built in 1903, was bought by Billy Stinson's family in 1963. Since . then, it was where the retired art teacher spent his vacations, wooed . his wife Sandra, and gathered with family, according to OurState.com in . an article written a year ago that recounts the cottage and its rich . history. Rivers . and creeks turned into raging torrents tumbling with tree limbs and . parts of buildings in northern New England and upstate New York as the . storm's winds diminished, but the torrential rains refused to let up. Late last night, the storm continued to batter Vermont with heavy rains forcing hundreds  of evacuations. 'This is not over,' President Barack Obama said from the White House yesterday. 'Many Americans are still at serious risk . of power outages and flooding, which could get worse in the coming days . as rivers swell past their banks.' While . the full extent of the damage was not known, early estimates put it up . to $45billion, including lost business and physical damage. Power . companies said they were trying to get critical services running first. But . many are just starting to understand the full extent of damage to the . grid.

"By . Paul Bentley . Last updated at 1:11 PM on 21st June 2011 . A KBR contract worker who claims she was brutally drugged and raped while working in Iraq broke down as she spoke of her alleged ordeal in court. Almost six years after the event, Jamie Leigh Jones told jurors she . was 'scared to death' and held against her will by her employer after . being sexually assaulted in Iraq at the hands of co-workers. The 26-year-old, from Texas, is one of several female contract . workers for KBR and its former parent Halliburton Co. who claim they . were sexually assaulted or harassed while working for the companies in . Iraq. Ordeal: Jamie Leigh Jones exits the federal courthouse in Houston last week . Miss Jones said that . while she was a clerical worker at Camp Hope in Baghdad in 2005, she was raped . so violently her breast implants were ruptured, her pectoral muscles . were torn and she was severely bruised. When she reported the rape to KBR officials, she said they placed her under armed guard, held her . in a shipping container for hours and wouldn't allow her to make a phone . call. She claims she eventually managed to escape the ordeal by convincing one of the guards to let her use his . phone, which she used to call her father in the United States. After the ordeal she had to have two breast operations and hundreds of sessions with a psychiatrist, according to her testimony. In court, Jones said her chest was so disfigured after the incident she needed two reconstructive breast operations - with the first unsuccessful. She became depressed after the attack and developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, she said. Brutal: Jamie Leigh Jones, who was allegedly drugged and raped by her co-workers in Iraq, at court last week . Court: Jamie Leigh Jones pauses during a hearing before the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee . 'I was excited to get the memory of . Baghdad off of me,' Jones said of the plastic surgery. 'Yes, I could . cover it up [with clothing]… but why do I have to be constantly reminded . of it?' Miss Jones is suing KBR, Halliburton . and a former KBR firefighter she says was one of her rapists, all of . whom deny her allegations. During . her often tearful testimony, Jones said she had been drinking with a . group of KBR firefighters outside her barracks before she was raped. 'One of the firefighters, he handed me the drink. He said: ""Don't worry I saved all the ruffies for Dubai,"" Jones testified. She said she was drugged with what she believes was the sedative Rohypnol, widely known as a date-rape drug and also known by the nickname 'ruffies'. Miss Jones said she woke up the next . morning in her room and discovered she was naked, sore and had bruises . and scratches on her thighs and wrists. She . said he had no memory of what happened to her. She said she found Bortz . in the room with her and he told her that they had had sex the night . before. Accused: Charles Bortz allegedly carried out the sex attack on Jamie Leigh Jones in Iraq in 2005 . 'I was putting the pieces together. I was figuring it out. I knew I had been raped,' Jones said. At one point during her testimony, she took a short break to regain her composure. According to the lawsuit: 'When she . awoke the next morning still affected by the drug, she found her body . naked and severely bruised, with lacerations, blood running down her . leg, her breast implants ruptured, and her pectoral muscles torn – which . would later require reconstructive surgery.' Her account was confirmed by U.S. Army . physician Jodi Schultz.who gave the rape kit she used to gather evidence . from Ms Jones to KBR security forces. The rape kit later disappeared and was . recovered two years later, but missing crucial photographs and notes, . according to the Guardian. Miss Jones told jurors that after getting dressed and reporting for work, she realised what had happened to her and had a friend take her to get medical treatment. After being examined by a military doctor, several KBR officials were crass towards her and tried to bully her into giving a statement about what happened, she claimed. They then allegedly locked her in a trailer with no food or water or any means of communication. 'I'm . scared to death. I want my dad. He's my protector,' Jones said. 'As I'm . banging on the door, I say I need to get out of here. I need a phone. I . need to contact my dad.' Jones said she eventually contacted her father, who called U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, who helped to secure her release. Jamie Leigh Jones was a clerical worker in Camp Hope, Baghdad, when she was raped during U.S. military operations. Here, U.S. forces are on the ground at a forward operating base prior to elections in 2004 . Jones' attorneys have accused KBR and Halliburton of having a history of failing to protect workers who were sexually assaulted or harassed. The companies say they enforce rules against sexual harassment. She testified she's been treated for . post-traumatic stress disorder, takes medications for anxiety and had to . have reconstructive surgery for her breasts, which were disfigured in . her alleged attack. KBR said the case 'presents very . disturbing allegations that we take very seriously. We welcome the . opportunity to present what really happened in Iraq in July 2005.' Bortz's attorney tried to discredit Jones' claims this afternoon by suggesting to jurors that she has a history of making false accusations of sexual harassment. Bortz, who has not been charged, filed a countersuit against Jones that the jury also will decide at the trial. Jones has said she asked to be transferred to Iraq after being sexually harassed by a KBR supervisor in Houston. Campaign: The Jamie Leigh Foundation website is dedicated to helping U.S. citizens and legal residents who are victims of crime while working abroad . She said she entered into a sexual relationship with the supervisor for fear of losing her job. But Andrew McKinney, Bortz's . attorney, suggested when he questioned Jones that her relationship with . the ex-supervisor was consensual, showing jurors emails in which Jones . asked her mother about relationship advice related to the supervisor. Jones said she never told her mother the true nature of the relationship. 'The things I had to do to keep my job I hate myself for,' Jones said. KBR and Halliburton had contended . Jones' case should be settled through arbitration as stipulated in her . contract. But an appeals court let her lawsuit go to trial. Due in part to Jones' case, federal lawmakers in 2009 approved a measure prohibiting contractors and subcontractors that receive $1 million in funds from the Department of Defense from requiring employees to resolve sexual assault allegations and other claims through arbitration. Jones is asking for unspecified damages from KBR and Halliburton, which split in 2007. The trial is expected to last up to three weeks.","Jones speaks in full about her 'rape ordeal' in Iraq .

A mass murderer faces the death penalty after being found guilty of killing an extended family of five. William Craig Miller, 34, was convicted of fatally shooting Steven Duffy, 30, and Duffy’s girlfriend Tammy Lovell, 32, at their home in Mesa, Arizona, five years ago. He was also found guilty of killing Mr Duffy's brother - Shane Duffy, 18 - and Ms Lovell's children - Cassandra Lovell, 15, and Jacob Lovell, 10. Both Steven Duffy and Tammy Lovell were former employees of Miller's who were police informants against him in a 2005 arson case. He was convicted of the murders and burglary at their home in February 2006 by a Maricopa County Superior Court jury on Monday. Miller already is serving 16 years in jail after being convicted in March of burning down his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, to collect insurance money. ‘Today's verdict finally brings a measure of justice to a shockingly brutal crime that stunned the entire community,’ Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said. ‘Now we move forward in pursuit of a just punishment.’ Prosecutors will begin making arguments for the death penalty in court on Tuesday. Five dead: From left to right, Tammy Lovell, 32; Steven Duffy, 30; Cassandra Lovell, 15; Shane Duffy, 18; and Jacob Lovell, 10, were all killed by Miller . Miller's attorneys called no witnesses to the stand to testify on his behalf during the trial, which he did not attend himself.

He was an ‘arrogant braggart’ who tried to hire four hit-men but ended up acting alone when they wouldn't help, Kristen Hoffmeyer, prosecuting, said. ‘He eliminated them as witnesses, and he eliminated their family because there was to be no witnesses left,’ she added. Ms Hoffmeyer showed graphic photos of the crime scene, prompting the victims' family members to cry in court. Eric Kessler, defending, had urged jurors to keep an open mind, reported the Arizona Republic. ‘Things are not always as they seem,’ he had said.","William Craig Miller, 34, committed murders in Arizona .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 1:15 PM on 30th August 2011 . It was his first return visit to the organisation he once ran since sexual assault charges were dropped. Dominique Strauss-Kahn took the chance to apologise to staff of the International Monetary Fund for any troubled caused after sexual assault charges against him were dismissed last week. Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, drove himself and his wife Anne Sinclair to the IMF headquarters in Washington D.C. and met briefly with his successor and fellow French national Christine Lagarde. Happy: Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Anne Sinclair are seen outside their home on Monday in Washington D.C. He later addressed a packed auditorium out of reach of the cameras of televisions crews and photographers who had camped outside the IMF all day waiting for the former director. ‘He received a very warm welcome,’ said Paulo Nogueira Batista, who represents Brazil and eight Latin American countries. ‘It reflects the fact that he is very much appreciated in the institution.’ Mr Strauss-Kahn told staff he wanted to ‘apologise to those who have been hurt’ by the scandal and was sorry that the case had a negative impact on the IMF, one employee told AFP. Staff broke into spontaneous applause before Mr Strauss-Kahn began speaking - but he did not talk about his court case. However he did note the U.S. justice system had been fair, one witness said. An IMF spokesman said the visit by Mr Strauss-Kahn was personal and arranged at his request. His visit had been greeted ahead of time with dismay by some IMF staff, while others said they felt sorry for Mr Strauss-Kahn and wanted to pay tribute to his time at the helm of the global lender. Au revoir: Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair depart the IMF headquarters in Washington D.C., where he said goodbye to staff on Monday . All smiles: Frenchman Mr Strauss-Kahn drove himself and his wife Anne Sinclair to the IMF headquarters in Washington D.C. and met briefly with his successor and fellow French national Christine Lagarde . Mr Strauss-Kahn led the IMF, the world's economic firefighter, as managing director for four years. But he resigned in May after his shock . arrest in New York on criminal charges of sexual assault and attempted . rape involving a hotel maid. In a dramatic development last week, prosecutors asked that the charges against him be dismissed after they lost faith in the credibility of his accuser, an immigrant from Guinea. Mr Strauss-Kahn had been expected to be voted France's next president in the 2012 election before his arrest - but he could still relaunch his political career now the charges have been dropped. Movers have packed up belongings from Mr Strauss-Kahn's residence in Washington D.C. and speculation is rife over whether he plans to leave his adopted American home after losing his job. Meanwhile, his lawyers have hinted they could take legal action against the woman who accused him of rape in the sensational case, if her lawyers use 'despicable' methods to defend their client. Packing up: Items were moved from the Georgetown home of Mr Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair . On watch: Mr Strauss-Kahn's Georgetown home has been under near-constant media surveillance since he was freed from house arrest in New York . Following the news his rape charge was dropped, Mr Strauss-Kahn is now free to travel the world again after getting his passport back from prosecutors. It remains unclear when he might put the document to use, as he said he ‘can't wait to go back’ to his native France but has other things to do first. As a team of family friends appeared to pack his belongings into a U-Haul van at his Georgetown home, questions hand over his future plans. Just last week, Mr Strauss-Kahn was pictured in New York looking much happier with life. Strolling through the sunny streets of New York foot-loose and fancy-free with Ms Sinclair, he sported a more laid-back look. It was a far cry from the blue suicide smock he was photographed wearing days after being sent to Rikers Island prison when he was accused of raping a Sofitel hotel chamber maid in May. Relaxed: Former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair try to catch a cab in New York last week, appearing much happier with life . Perp walk: Life for Strauss-Kahn changed on May 15 as he was led, unkempt and unshaven from a New York police station after being arrested on rape charges . Mr Strauss-Kahn earlier paid a moving . tribute to Ms Sinclair, who stood beside him throughout the entire . ordeal, even paying for his expensive townhouse when he was placed under . house arrest. 'I am most deeply grateful to my wife . and family who have gone through this ordeal with me. We look . forward to returning to our home and resuming something of a more . normal life' Dominique Strauss-Kahn . 'I am most deeply grateful to my wife . and family who have gone through this ordeal with me,’ he said. ‘We look . forward to returning to our home and resuming something of a more . normal life.' But he did not appear to be in any . hurry to return to his native France when he was photographed wandering . around the streets of Manhattan in the sunshine with Ms Sinclair. It seems the French are not ready to welcome him back with open arms either. A poll revealed that most French . people do not want disgraced former IMF chief to return to politics, . despite the fact he was being touted as the next president before the . rape scandal. The survey found 53 per cent of the . French want Mr Strauss-Kahn to play no part in build-up to the . presidential elections next year. Only 23 per cent were in favour of him . contesting the election.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn makes first visit to IMF since sex charges dropped .

Suspect Luis Moore, 23, allegedly opened fire on target Ricky Rodriguez, 20, who was shot just hours after they had an argument, police said. The incident on Monday evening in the Bronx, New York, left two-year-old Patience Boyd fighting for her life and Jayla Rodriguez, six, also injured. Suspect: Luis Moore, 23, allegedly opened fire on intended target Ricky Rodriguez, 20, who was shot in the back hours after they had an argument, police said . A group of children and adults were outside in the street when a gunman suddenly appeared and fired shots from 50ft away, witnesses said.

A room-mate called cops because he was worried for the Belgian scientist’s health - and then police found the alleged drug factory there. Charged: Randy Lambreghts, 28, who is at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, was making meth in a student residence, police said . Lambreghts lives in a building with around a dozen graduate students - in an area densely populated by students, reported the New York Daily News.

Some children kick up a big tantrum when they’re refused toys or receive the wrong type of birthday card - but it doesn’t usually end up like this. Kimberly Garrity, who raised Steven II, now 23, and Kathryn, now 20, in a $1.5million home in Illinois, was sued by her own children. But the siblings, represented by three lawyers including their father, Steven A. Miner, have failed in their $50,000 lawsuit for ‘bad mothering’. Screaming: Kimberly Garrity, who raised Steven II, now 23, and Kathryn, now 20, has been sued by her own children for 'bad mothering' (file picture) They alleged Garrity failed to take Kathryn to a car show and threatened Steven II with phoning police if he did not buckle his seatbelt. The children claim she ‘haggled’ over dress prices and called at midnight to tell Kathryn to come home from a party, reported the Chicago Tribune. But after two years of battle an appeals court has dismissed the ‘emotional distress’ case, ruling Garrity's conduct was not ‘extreme or outrageous’. A positive ruling ‘could potentially open the floodgates to subject family childrearing (to) excessive judicial scrutiny and interference,’ it said. Mr Miner and Garrity were married for around ten years before she filed for divorce 16 years ago, reported the Chicago Tribune. The birthday card in question was labelled ‘inappropriate’ by Steven II as it allegedly failed to include any money.

Ms Smith wrote Garrity does still love her children but they wanted ‘the benefits afforded by a family relationship, but none of the restraints’. ‘(The children) do not view their (lawsuit) as an attack on mothering, but rather on accountability,’ the children’s father Mr Miner wrote. ‘Everyone makes mistakes, but... there must be accountability for actions.

Matouk Mohammed Matouk, the only one of three main suspects known to be still alive, reportedly tried to defect to the National Transitional Council as Tripoli fell ten days ago. The new government has confirmed that it knows the whereabouts of Matouk, a former minister under Gaddafi, according to the Daily Telegraph. Murder: There are three prime suspects in the murder of Yvonne Fletcher (left) - Matouk Mohammed Matouk (right) is said to still be alive . In response to Libyan media claims that Matouk had been placed under arrest because of his long service to Gaddafi, Ali Tarhouni, the de facto deputy prime minister, denied it but said: ‘We know where he is.’ Matouk was named in Crown Prosecution Service papers as one of two suspects who could be charged in connection with the killing outside the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984. Last night Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski, chairman of the all-party Libya group, called for him to be extradited as soon as possible, adding: ‘You can’t have British justice in a Libyan court.’ The discovery of Matouk comes as another suspect in WPC Fletcher’s murder, Abdulgader Baghdadi, was found shot dead in the chaos of Tripoli. He was said to have helped plan the response of Libya’s London embassy to the demonstration outside which led to shots being fired and killing the 25-year-old police officer. The body of WPC Fletcher is carried into Salisbury Cathedral for her funeral. The gunman who shot her outside the Libyan embassy is believed to be dead . A member of Tripoli’s revolutionary council, Osama al-Abed, said yesterday that Baghdadi’s bullet-ridden body had been found in a suburb of the city last week. Mr al-Abed said the body of the former embassy official was found among half a dozen other corpses. He said it was believed they had been slaughtered by fellow Gaddafi loyalists. There has been no confirmation of the whereabouts of the third prime suspect, Abdulmagid Salah Ameri, a junior diplomat identified as being the gunman. There have been claims, however, that Ameri is also dead. Earlier this year the Daily Mail tracked down Omar Sodani, another who was implicated in the murder of WPC Fletcher, after he was captured by rebels. It is unclear what has happened to him.

Marlins third baseman Greg Dobbs has been to the hospital to visit the 12-year-old boy who was hit in the face by a line drive during a game between Florida and the New York Mets. Dobbs says he went to Elmhurst Hospital on Tuesday and spent a little more than an hour with the boy and his family. He says the boy is doing OK after he was struck square in the face by Dobbs' foul liner Monday in the opening game of a doubleheader at Citi Field. Scroll down for video . Apology: Dobbs, whose line-drive smashed the boy in the face, visited him in hospital . Ouch! A young boy who took a line drive to the face at yesterday afternoon's Mets-Marlins game was taken to a local hospital for treatment . Dobbs says the boy has a broken nose, a fractured sinus and a . concussion. But he says the boy was expected to be released from the . hospital Tuesday night and doctors do not anticipate any permanent . damage. The boy was struck when Florida's . Greg Dobbs hit a ninth-inning liner into the right-field seats, just . beyond the New York dugout. Stadium . medical workers immediately tended to the boy, who was bleeding . heavily. Accompanied by his mother, he was carted away in a wheelchair . after the game and taken under the stands to an ambulance. Following the final out of New . York's 2-1 victory, Mets second baseman Justin Turner went over to wait . for the boy by the railing. Turner took off his jersey and handed it . over as a souvenir. New York manager Terry Collins also came over, and . Dobbs gave the boy a bat. Nathan Wise, 18, and his brother . Daniel, 14, from New Rochelle were sitting near the boy, who was in the . front row of section 119 for the first game of a single-admission . doubleheader. 'His mom stood up and was . screaming for a medic. A guy came running over and took off his shirt . and put it on the kid's head,' Daniel Wise said. It was unclear how old the boy . was. Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said the team could not provide any . information because of medical privacy laws. 'We saw him hit a line drive and, . at first, we thought we might catch it. But it went past us and we saw . it hit the kid,' Nathan Wise said. Unlucky shot: The boy was struck when Florida's Greg Dobbs (pictured) hit a ninth-inning liner into the right-field seats, just beyond the New York dugout . 'We saw him put his hands out and try . to block it, but he's a little kid, so his reactions were slow. We saw . his hands up and then saw blood trickling down his face. 'A security . guard called over to the Mets' dugout for some towels. It looked really . serious, but after a couple of minutes, we saw the medics standing . around and we realized it was bad, but it wasn't life-threatening.' Between games, the seat bottom was . removed with drills, and a crew of at least four other maintenance . workers were washing the area to clean up the blood. The boy's condition was not immediately available. Dobbs told the New York Daily News . after the game: 'They say he doesn't have a broken nose. They say he . has a laceration, a really deep laceration on his nose. Guilty: Dobbs said the boy did not have a broken nose, nor did he lose his eyesight, but he did suffer a deep laceration . 'His orbitals are fine - the bones . around the eye. His sight's fine... thank God. I just want to call the . mom and tell her that I'm praying for her son, and hope he's ... okay . and on the mend and out of the hospital.'

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 12:57 PM on 30th August 2011 . Highly sensitive government documents have been published by Wikileaks putting hundreds of lives at risk. The anti-secrecy organisation posted 134,000 memos online over the past few days which included the names of journalists, human rights activists and academics who spoke to American diplomats and whose identities were marked with the warning 'strictly protect'. The details of informants were never supposed to be revealed but were made public accidentally after a feud between founder Julian Assange and former Wikileaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg. Secret's out: Wikilieaks, founded by Julian Assange, has published highly sensitive U.S. state documents . When Domscheit-Berg left Wikileaks at the end of last year, he took a collection of material, including the . sensitive memos, with him. He eventually returned the information including the classified material. However in an apparent mix-up, Assange released all the documents online including the uncensored cables. Assange is currently under house arrest in Norfolk as he awaits a verdict from the High Court next month. He is facing extradition to Sweden to face accusations of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. More than 250,000 U.S. State department documents have been obtained by Wikileaks since last year. Many have appeared in the news but with the names blacked out of those thought to be vulnerable to retaliation in foreign countries. Among those named were a United Nations official in West Africa and a foreign human rights activist working in Cambodia. They had spoken candidly to American Embassy officials on the understanding that they would not be publicly identified. Wanted: A page from the Interpol website showing the appeal for the arrest of the editor-in-chief of the Wikileaks whistleblowing website, Julian Assange . According to German newspaper Der . Freitag, the uncensored cables are  in a password-protected . file circulating on the internet. The paper reported that the file was easy to find along with the password to unlock it. The cables contain the names of informants to the U.S. government in Israel, Jordan, Iran and Afghanistan. There is deep concern from U.S. officials that hostile countries could have already discovered and decrypted the file to uncover the names. Sources revealed: Informants of the U.S. government in Iran, Israel, Jordan and Afghanistan have had their names put online . Former Wikileaks employee Herbert Snorrason, who left the organisation as part of a staff revolt last year, and is now part of the competing site OpenLeaks, told Wired: 'The . story is that a series of lapses, as far as I can see on behalf of . WikiLeaks and its affiliates, has led to the possibility a file becoming . generally available which it never should have been available.' The . cables were contained in an encrypted file that Assange had stored on a . sub-directory of the organisation’s server last year, which wasn’t . searchable on the internet by anyone who didn’t already know its . location. December 2007 - Guantanamo Bay operating procedures including 'rewards' like toilet paper for prisoners' good behaviour . September 2008 - Sarah Palin's email account . November 2008 - BNP membership list which included several senior police officers, doctors and military personnel . October 2009 - The Minton Report into the health effects of dumping toxic waste in Africa . November 2009 - Emails from the Climate Research Unit which appeared to show scientists 'tricks' to convince people about global warming . November 2009 - Pager messages sent during the terrorist attacks on September 11 in New York . April 2010 - Video footage of  Apache helicopter attack in Iraq in which two Reuters journalists were shot dead . July 2010 - Iraq war files which raised questions about crimes by coalition troops . Assange had reportedly given the . password for the file to an 'external contact'. Both the file and the password are now available online. Mr Snorrason said the password leak was done 'completely inadvertently' but refused to name the source that it had come from. After nine months of slowly releasing information, WikiLeaks abruptly published around 130,000 documents this week - more than half its database. WikiLeaks responded to the leak on Twitter by stating: 'There has been no ''leak at WikiLeaks''. The issue relates to a mainstream media partner and a malicious individual.' The American soldier Private Bradley Manning faces spending the rest of his life in prison after he was accused of passing on highly-sensitive material to Assange in 2009.

"Family were returning form a trip to see grandmother when they crashed . By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 8:50 AM on 1st September 2011 . A mother and her three sons were killed in a horrific head-on collision with a tractor after their SUV careered into the other lane. The deaths of Stephanie Brown, 31, eight-month-old Grayson Brown, Jackson Brown, seven, and Gage Brown, nine, have shocked and overwhelmed members of the close-knit extended family and their community, after they were killed on State Highway 61 in Roane County, Tennessee on Tuesday. Stephanie Brown was said to be . returning from a visit with her grandmother when her 2004 Ford . Expedition crossed the centre line of the highway and struck the . oncoming tractor-trailer. Both vehicles burst into flames but driver of the tractor, Joe Sexton, 57, did not require medical treatment. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Grayson Brown, left, Gage Brown, centre and Jackson Brown all perished in the car accident after their SUv careered into the other lane . Scene: Four members of the Brown family died on Tuesday in Harriman, Tennessee. The driver had minor injuries . Mr Sexton reportedly tried to help . the occupants of the SUV, but they were pinned by the vehicle's engine, . which had been driven into the back seat by the impact. The Rev John Edwards, pastor of New Fairview Baptist Church, is the uncle of Stephanie Brown and described the families as 'crushed and devastated' by the tragedy. Her husband Josh Brown is obviously still in shock.' He said the couple grew up in Oliver Springs, were high school sweethearts while attending Oliver Springs High School and married 'right out of high school'. Jackson Brown was a first-grader at Bowers Elementary School in Harriman, while his older brother, Gage, was in fourth grade. Dr Toni McGriff, director of Roane County Schools, said on Wednesday additional counselling was and will be made available to staff and students for as long as is needed. Clarence Nelson, chief of the Blair Volunteer Fire Department, said: 'It looked like they were killed instantly. It was a terrible accident. 'Everything was burned. There was no paperwork, no VIN (vehicle identification number) available.' Tennessee Highway Patrol Sgt Bobby Clevenger says it's unknown why the SUV veered into the other lane but no charges will be filed. Neighbours along Coalfield Road say the boys and their mother radiated love. 'You have to give that much love for a child to take in, and actually show it to other people,' said Chris Turpin. 'My prayers go out to the family.' 'I don't know. I couldn't even begin to imagine how that feels,' said neighbour Jordan Williams. Just weeks ago, the Browns attended New Fairview for Vacation Bible School. rev Edwards says now he must lead his congregation and his family through a trying time. 'All of Fairview church and of course, all of Fairview community, have been so very supportive of family, in their grief, comforting and doing what they can for them,' he said.",Family were returning form a trip to see grandmother when they crashed .

This incredible image that looks straight out of Star Wars shows how smoke from a raging marsh fire in New Orleans has surrounded the iconic Superdome, as an emergency is declared in the city. Helicopters are dropping water from 500-gallon baskets, hundreds of acres of land have been burned and now a second marsh fire has started in what is turning into a city-wide disaster. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu spotted a second marsh fire during a flight over one that has hazed the metro area with smoke for three days and he has now declared an emergency. Eerie: Thick smoke from a burning marsh fire surrounds the Louisiana Superdome in downtown New Orleans . Spreading: Smoke rises from a marsh fire in New Orleans, Louisiana, near Interstate 510 on Monday . Four helicopters based in Hammond were . dropping water from the huge baskets onto the fire and five based in . Pineville would join them on Wednesday, a Louisiana National Guard . spokesman said. Haze from the fire was reported as far west as the Baton Rouge metro area. The National Weather Service expanded its smoke alert from New Orleans and six suburban parishes to 23 parishes. As of Tuesday morning, the original fire had burned all but about 537 acres - about eight-tenths of a square mile - of the trees, shrubs and grass on a 1,553-acre area surrounded by canals. It started in the centre of the area and has been spreading outward, with the smoke alert now covering towns 100 miles from New Orleans. Breathing difficulties: Jasmine Groves covers her face and eyes as she crosses Poydras Street, amidst thick smoke from a burning marsh fire nearby in downtown New Orleans on Tuesday . Suffering: Andrea Whittaker covers her face as she boards a streetcar amidst thick smoke from a burning marsh fire in New Orleans on Tuesday. She said the smoke triggered an asthma attack . ‘It would take an armada of helicopters’ to drop water on it and douse it,' said state Democrat Representative . Austin Badon Jr, who flew over the fires separately from Mayor Landrieu. 'Once it's underground, it's next to . impossible to fight. You can't bring enough water to wet . down that soil' Bret Lane, top firefighter for state's agriculture department . Each basket of water, when it hits earth, only covers an area about the size of a pickup truck. Along the East Coast, 40 hot spots in the Great Dismal Swamp were still smouldering even after Hurricane Irene dumped 10 to 15 inches of rain on the area, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. That fire that lightning started on August 4 has burned more than 6,000 acres in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Some New Orleans schools had cancelled outdoor activities because of smoke which has spread across the metropolitan area for three days. Smoky bridge: For the fourth day, the New Orleans area is blanketed with smoke from a stubborn marsh fire . Distant view: Smoke rises from a marsh fire in New Orleans East off Chef Highway as seen from the New Orleans central business district on Monday . Meteorologists expected the smoke to move north over Lake Pontchartrain by evening, but to settle over the metro area again overnight. ‘This is making breathing so hard. I'm still tasting (the smoke) in my mouth' Jasmine Groves . A Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry spokesman said the larger fire was likely to burn itself out by Wednesday afternoon, but Mayor Landrieu said it could take two days. However it could keep burning underground - and that’s what is really concerning emergency services. ‘Once it's underground, it's next to impossible to fight,’ said Bret Lane, the top firefighter for the state's agriculture department. ‘You can't bring enough water to wet down that soil.’ Up and away: Smoke rises from a marsh fire in New Orleans and hangs over a subdivision off Interstate 510 . The emergency department at the Interim . LSU Public Hospital, which usually treats four or five patients a day . for asthma, treated 24 patients with breathing problems in 24 hours. But it's not clear if all were because of the smoke, a spokesman said. Those with breathing problems have been urged to stay inside in the air conditioning. Jasmine Groves, who lives less than four miles from the New Orleans fire, said there was little smoke around her house on Tuesday. So she did not bring her asthma inhaler into the central business district for a class on Tuesday, only to have to deal with heavy smoke 10 miles from the fire. ‘This is making breathing so hard,’ she said. Even after her class was over, she said, ‘I'm still tasting it in my mouth.’","Louisiana city struggles to stop hundreds of acres of land being burned .

"By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 12:43 AM on 30th August 2011 . 'Furious argument': Tilly Lamb was allegedly rowing with her husband before she fell to her death . Witnesses heard a ‘furious argument’ before a British mother of four plunged from a third-floor holiday apartment in a Moroccan resort, it emerged yesterday. Tilly Lamb, 43, was seen lying fatally injured and semi-clothed on the ground before her husband Roger, 47, appeared briefly to check her pulse. He then went back into the two-bedroom flat in Essaouira, on the west coast of the North African country, where their four sons aged nine to 16 were sleeping. They were to be orphaned four days later when Mr Lamb fell to his own death from the second-floor balcony of a nearby luxury hotel. The startling revelations emerged as police in Morocco were accused of trying to cover up the circumstances surrounding the deaths. Despite a criminal inquiry being launched, the £30-a-night flat where the family were staying is still being rented to holidaymakers. A Daily Mail reporter and photographer were yesterday shown around the spacious apartment in the town’s ancient Medina area, popular with bohemian tourists looking to taste North African culture. An examination of the 3ft by 4ft window from which Mrs Lamb fell seemed to contradict police claims that she ‘stumbled and lost her footing’ in the early hours of August 17. Not only would the bottom of the window have been at waist level when Mrs Lamb was standing on the floor, but a high wooden balustrade would have prevented her from falling. There was no damage to any part of the window. The flat’s owner, Majid Naimi, said: ‘The only way out of the window is if someone climbs out or is pushed. There is no way it was just an accident.’ Mr Naimi, 24, rented the flat to Mrs Lamb for 900 dirhams, or around £70, for three days. Recalling his first meeting with the family, he said: ‘Mrs Lamb appeared very relaxed and happy. 'She said she wanted to stay for three nights with her husband and sons. On the second night of their stay I got a phone call in the middle of the night saying there had been a terrible incident, with Mrs Lamb falling head first on to the street below. An examination of the flat by a Daily Mail . reporter makes a mockery of police claims that Mrs Lamb stumbled from . the third floor window (left) as there is a waist high balustrade to . prevent people from falling . Death fall: Roger Lamb died four days after his wife when he fell from a second-floor balcony at a luxury hotel . ‘There had been a furious argument . heard by neighbours a few minutes beforehand. I spoke to Mr Lamb the . next day and he was very calm and relaxed. The boys were in agony, . however – they were crying and were very distressed. Fatally injured: Tilly Lamb reportedly had a furious row at the flat she was holidaying in before she fell to her death . ‘Mr Lamb went to the beach to swim. He and the boys completed their three-night stay, and then checked in at . the nearby Sofitel Hotel.’ Mrs Lamb died in hospital three days after her fall, and her husband plunged to his death the following day. Jamal Dabi, 23, was near the flat at 12.30am on the night of the first tragedy when he heard ‘terrible screams’. He told the Mail: ‘The English woman . had been involved in an argument and dropped on to a ledge above a shop . and rolled on to the ground. She had no clothes on except underwear. ‘A few minutes later the husband appeared to check her pulse. He quickly made his way back up to the flat.’ But last night Mrs Lamb’s . brother-in-law said the couple’s sons denied there was any argument and . insisted the holiday was ‘entirely amicable’. Mark Rogerson said: ‘It was Ramadan . so there was a great deal of noise around the building. Someone was . banging on the door downstairs. ‘Tilly leaned over and told them to . go away. There was an awning halfway down, so she had to lean quite a . long way out to see over it. ‘As the police said, some wooden bar on the window broke and she fell.’ About the suggestion there had been . an argument prior to her death, Mr Rogerson added: ‘These reports are . utterly and totally untrue. They are also extremely hurtful to the . family, particularly to the boys. ‘My source for information is one of the boys and they were there.’ Yesterday the couple’s four sons – . Angus, 16, Monty, 15, Henry, 11, and Felix, nine – were staying at the . Wiltshire home of their mother’s sister, Charlotte, and her husband . Rupert Sebag Montefiore.

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 12:42 PM on 30th August 2011 . The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, is believed to have scuppered talks held between U.S. and Taliban officials . Secret talks between representatives of the United States and the Taliban were closing in on a deal to free a kidnapped army sergeant, but were scuppered when Hamid Karzai's aides leaked information about them. Both U.S. and Afghan officials confirmed that the 54-year-old Afghan president kiboshed potential horse-trading with the Taliban, as he feared being out of the loop. Though the discussions, held in Germany and Qatar, were only at a preliminary stage, a trade which would see Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, of Hailey, Idaho, captured two years ago, was mooted. In return, the talks centred on the release of a number of Afghan prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, as well as the Bagram airbase. But before any deals could be firmed up, Mr Karzai's aided leaked knowledge of the talks to the press, and all hope of striking a clandestine agreement were gone. The Afghan president felt as though he was being undercut, according to U.S. officials close to the deals. According to an unnamed senior Western diplomat in the region a childhood friend of his, Tayyab Aga, was the Taliban negotiator. Since the secret talks were discovered, Mr Aga has fled and gone in to hiding, for fear of his life, but to the chagrin of the negotiators who have been left to rue Mr Karzai's reported intervention. The U.S. negotiators asked Mr Aga what could be done to gain Bergdahl's release. The discussion did not get into specifics but it is understood Mr Aga suggested - by way of a trade - the release of Afghan prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and at Bagram airbase. Collapse of the direct talks between Mr Aga and U.S. officials probably spoiled the best chance yet at reaching Mullah Mohammed Omar, considered the linchpin to ending the Taliban fight against the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan. The U.S. officials were trying to negotiate the release of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was captured two years ago (left) and Tayyab Aga, shown here in 2001 (right), was thought to be representing the Taliban in the negotiations but has now fled to Europe . Perhaps most importantly they offered the tantalising prospect of a brokered agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban - one that would allow the larger reconciliation of the Taliban into Afghanistan political life to move forward. The United States has not committed to any such deal, but the Taliban wants security assurances from Washington. In a series of interviews with . diplomats, current and former Taliban, Afghan government officials and a . close childhood friend of Mr Aga, the information suggests that the man . who was brokering the deals for the Taliban is now hiding in Europe, . and is afraid to return to Pakistan fearing reprisals. The United States, for example, has had no direct contact with him for months. A senior U.S. official acknowledged that the talks imploded because of the leak and that Mr Aga, while alive, had disappeared. Officials had been hoping that the negotiations would lead them to the Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar . While the U.S. will continue to pursue talks, the trust of such meetings have been affected. The . U.S. acknowledged the meetings after Mr Karzai, who apparently fears . being sidelined by U.S.-Taliban talks, confirmed published accounts . about them in June, but has never publicly detailed the content, format . or participants. The . first was held in late 2010 followed by at least two other meetings in . early spring of this year, and the sessions were held in Germany and . Qatar, the unnamed official said. The childhood friend of Mr Aga's . said the negotiator had fled to Germany and a diplomat in the region . said he exited to a European country after his contacts with the United . States were revealed. The . talks were deliberately revealed by someone in the presidential palace, . where Mr Karzai's office is located, said a Western and an Afghan . official. The reason . was Mr Karzai's animosity toward the U.S. and fear that any agreement . Washington brokered would undermine his authority, they said. Pakistan . had also been kept in the dark about the talks and an Afghan official . with contacts with the Taliban said the insurgents decided not to tell . Pakistan about the meetings with the United States. At . the time of the leak, Washington had already offered small concessions . as 'confidence-building measures', a former senior U.S. official said. They were aimed at developing a rapport and moving talks forward, said a current U.S. official on condition he not be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic. The concessions included treating the Taliban and al-Qaeda differently under international sanctions. The Taliban had argued that while al-Qaeda is focused on worldwide jihad against the West, Taliban militants have focused on Afghanistan and have shown little interest in attacking targets abroad. Other goodwill gestures that were not made public included Mr Aga's safe passage to Germany, U.S. officials said. The U.S. also offered assurances that it would not block the Taliban from opening an office in a third country, the official said. Mr Aga had been hoping for the release of some Afghan prisoners from Guantanamo Bay in Cuba . A number of other Afghans are being held at the Bargram airbase, near Kabul in Afghanistan . Mr Aga slowly established his trust and reputation with the U.S. officials, who had initial doubts both about his identity and his level of contact and influence with Omar. He sought the freedom of Taliban fighters in U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay and Bagram airbase, north of the Afghan capital where an estimated 600 Afghans are being held. Still at Guantanamo Bay is former Taliban Defense Ministry Chief of Staff Mullah Mohammed Fazil, Taliban intelligence official Abdul Haq Wasiq and former Herat governor Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa. Afghanistan's High Peace Council tasked by Mr Karzai with finding a negotiated settlement with insurgents has requested Khairkhwa's release. A former U.S. official familiar with the talks said the loss of the Mr Aga contact dismayed and angered the U.S. side, and further eroded thin trust in Mr Karzai. There is a difference of opinion among U.S. diplomats, military officials and others about how directly Mr Karzai should be blamed, but several officials agreed that the leak was an attempt to torpedo a diplomatic channel that he, and his inner circle, worried would sideline and undercut the Afghan leader. As the Afghan war rolls into its tenth year and Washington plans to withdraw its combat forces by the end of 2014, a negotiated settlement between Mr Karzai's government and the Taliban has become a target for the United States. An unnamed member of the High Peace Council said that the leaking of the talks reveals the level of mistrust and the lack of coordination among the key players in any eventual peace deal. Senator John Kerry has held talks recently, which have been behind closed doors . He said all the key players - the . United States, Afghan government, Afghan National Security Council and . the High Peace Council - are holding separate and secret talks with . their own contacts within the insurgency. The . flurry of meetings the United States is holding with the various . factions in the Afghan conflict has also extended to Pakistan, where the . most powerful insurgents have found safe havens. A month ago, U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, Senator John Kerry, and Pakistan's Army chief of staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani met for a marathon eight hours in a Gulf country. Peace negotiations with Afghanistan's insurgents featured prominently, and one U.S. official said Mr Kayani made a pitch during his meeting with Mr Kerry that Pakistan take on a far larger role in Afghanistan peacemaking. The United States considers Pakistan an essential part of an eventual deal, but neither the U.S. nor Pakistan trusts the other's motives in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, an unexpected consequence of attempts to find peace with the Taliban has been the rearming of the so-called Northern Alliance, that represents Afghanistan's ethnic minorities and who were partnered with the coalition at the outset of Operation Enduring Freedom to topple the Taliban regime. For the warlords that make up the Northern Alliance, Martine van Bijlert, co-director and co-founder of the Afghan Analyst Network in the capital, Kabul, talk of peace threatens their survival. Warlords-cum-government ministers and vice presidents are watching attempts at finding a peaceful end to the war with trepidation, each wondering, according to van Bijlert: 'What if it unravels, who is going to come after me, Will I be the weakest in the room?' 'They are feeling very vulnerable,' he added.","The release of Afghan prisoners from Guantanamo Bay was also discussed .

A politician was invited and uninvited twice from a Tea Party rally after pressure from Sarah Palin's unhappy aides who did not want her there. Organisers of the Tea Party for America event in Indianola, Iowa, decided to cancel former U.S. Senate candidate Christine O’Donnell's appearance. Now former Alaska governor Mrs Palin’s appearance at the event - costing $100,000 to put on - has finally been confirmed, after it was also in doubt. Combative: Aides of ex-Alaska governor Sarah Palin were unhappy about former U.S. Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell also appearing at an event . Ms O’Donnell received backing from Mrs Palin that helped her win the 2010 Delaware Senate primary and was first invited to the Iowa event. But then flip-flopping organisers decided to withdraw the invite before she was invited again and then uninvited again, reported Gawker. Ms O’Donnell is an outcast among many Tea Party . supporters, who have claimed she is erratic and unfit for political office, reported The . Atlantic. Mrs Palin’s aides told the event organisers that the Alaska politician would not attend if Ms O’Donnell was allowed to speak there, reported Politico. A source close to Mrs Palin said her team was also worried about fundraising and logistical changes that they had not approved. Mrs Palin is known for making late changes to her schedule, although this was seen as an important appearance, reported the Wall Street Journal. Not attending: Christine O'Donnell received backing from Mrs Palin that helped her win the 2010 Delaware Senate primary and was invited to the event . Many commentators think she could launch a Republican presidential campaign and 10,000 people are travelling from across the U.S. to attend. She will be in Des Moines on Friday, and then at a Tea Party Express tour stop on Monday in New Hampshire, reported the Wall Street Journal. It is even possible that Mrs Palin could hold an event on Saturday if she eventually decides not to attend the rally in Indianola on the same day. Mrs Palin has previously snubbed Ms O’Donnell, who beat Representative Mike Castle in a GOP primary before losing to Democrat Chris Coons. She chose to attend a New York Jets game instead of campaigning with Ms O’Donnell last year, reported the New York Times Magazine.","Tea Party for America event to take place on Saturday .

The school is a private learning centre for the children of diplomats and wealthy Haitians. U.S. Embassy officials said yesterday they are working on obtaining the release of Mr Jean-Baptiste. Francois Dossous, the head of Haiti's anti-kidnapping unit, identified Mr Baptiste as the man who had been seized from his home, but would not provide any more details for security reasons. Police and U.N. peacekeepers have increased checkpoints throughout Port-au-Prince in recent days. Renown: The Union School is extremely prestigious . Warning: The U.S embassy issued an alert about kidnapping on Twitter . On Friday, the day Mr Jean-Baptiste was kidnapped, the National Police of Haiti launched a vast research operation to strengthen checkpoints in Port-au-Prince and Petion-ville. Last week two other people were seized, including a girl aged six. On Saturday, the body of Haitian official Gilbert Giordanni was found on a street in Port-au-Prince after he had been kidnapped on Friday.

For four years, every time a  soldier’s body was returned home, the town’s residents lined the streets in a grateful and dignified tribute to our war dead. But for Wootton Bassett, the  market town that became a symbol of the nation’s admiration for its Armed Forces, sunset yesterday was the end of an era. A simple ceremony was held to mark the fact that no more military repatriations will pass through the town. Ceremony: Hundreds of people took to the streets of Wootton Bassett this evening to mark the end of repatriation ceremonies in the town . Crowded: Residents from the town bowed their heads in prayer during the ceremony which also included speeches from the vicar and mayor . Solemn: Two members of the Royal British Legion wait with their comrades in Wootton Bassett High Street before this evening's ceremony . We will remember them: Members of the Royal British Legion lower their flags during tonight's event . As the bell of St Bartholomew’s Church . chimed, the Union Flag on the high street was lowered and blessed. The . town’s brass band performed Sunset and Evening and the moving words of . The Exhortation were read out. From today, the bodies of British . troops killed on foreign battlefields will be brought home through RAF . Brize Norton in Oxfordshire rather than RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire. It . means corteges carrying the flag-draped coffins will no longer travel . along Wootton Bassett high street – nicknamed the ‘Highway of Heroes’. Last night’s solemn ceremony was still . tinged by sad news from Afghanistan. The latest serviceman to be killed . there was named as Sergeant Barry Weston, 40, of 42 Commando Royal . Marines, who was struck by a roadside bomb while on patrol in Helmand . Province on Tuesday. Lowered: The standard bearers begin to fold the Union Flag which had flown above the town for the four years since repatriations began . Duty: A group of ex-servicemen lower the Union Flag during the ceremony before it was blessed and folded as the national anthem played . The official folding of the flag is completed before it is passed to another bearer to carry to St Bartholomew's church . Salute to heroes: A former serviceman salutes as the flag is carried away from Wootton Bassett High Street . Born in Reading and married to Joanne, . he had three daughters, Jasmine, Poppy and newborn Rose. He was . described by senior officers as ‘selfless and courageous... an ardent . custodian of the highest standards and finest traditions of the Royal . Marines’. In the hours before yesterday’s dusk . ceremony, David Cameron offered a ‘heartfelt thank you’ to the people of . Wootton Bassett. He said the residents had ‘done our country proud with . the respect and admiration and passion they have shown for our Armed . Forces and those who have tragically fallen in battle’. In recognition of its role, the . Wiltshire town will be renamed Royal Wootton Bassett later this year. The bodies of 345 service personnel have passed through the town since . April 2007. It fell silent for the 167th and final time as the body of . Lieutenant Daniel Clack, 24, of 1st Battalion The Rifles, was brought . home last month. Initially, just a few members of the . Royal British Legion stopped and bowed their heads as the funeral . corteges passed through. But spontaneously the ritual grew, until . hundreds lined the high street to pay their respects. Dr Peter . Caddick-Adams, a military expert at Cranfield University, said: ‘They’ve . taught us the meaning of sacrifice, and I think we’d forgotten that.’ The town’s Union Flag will be taken to a memorial garden at  RAF Brize Norton for future repatriations. Tragic: Lieutenant Daniel Clack was the last soldier to be repatriated through Wootton Bassett, while Sergeant Barry Weston, who had three young daughters, Jasmine, Poppy and Rose, will be the first whose coffin travels through Clacerton after his death in Afghanistan on Tuesday .

A soldier who guards the Queen at Windsor Castle and his primary school teacher wife have appeared in court charged with raping a pre-teenage girl. Simon Davies, 37, and wife Fiona, 44, . were held by police after a video of the alleged incident was found . during a raid on a London home. Police swooped on the house as part of . an investigation into a child porn ring. It is believed the footage was . being circulated online by paedophiles. Charged: A soldier who guards the Queen at Windsor Castle has been arrested and charged, alongside his primary school teacher wife, with raping a pre-teenage girl . Housed: Davies is based at Combermere Barracks, where Princes William and Harry served before starting their careers of flying military helicopters . The husband and wife appeared in custody at Reading Magistrates' Court earlier this week over offences alleged to have occurred in January. Davies is charged with three counts of rape of a child under 13 years, while Parsons-Davies is accused of rape, aiding and abetting rape and child neglect. Two of the rapes were said to have taken place on January 26 and 28. They were both remanded in custody to appear at Reading Crown Court on December 15. A team of officers had raided Davies' terraced house on Windsor's Broom Farm estate - just two miles from the Castle where he guards the Queen when she is in residence. A neighbour told the Sun: 'Police have been here for five days and won't say what is going on. Investigation: Simon Davies guards the Queen (pictured) when she is in residence at Windsor Castle . 'They have warned us that if any of us know and tell anyone else, we could find ourselves under arrest. 'The man who was arrested was a member of the Household Cavalry, as are most of the families here.' He was allegedly identified from the video clip by specialist officers who traced the file through various internet service providers. Davies, who has fought in Afghanistan, and his wife were questioned by detectives separately over the weekend. The Household Cavalry - made up of the Blues & Royals and Life Guards - is responsible for guard duty at Windsor Castle along with mounted and gate duty at Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace. Davies is based at Windsor's Combermere Barracks, where Prince William and Prince Harry served before starting their careers of flying military helicopters. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'The matter is subject to a civil police investigation and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further whilst this is ongoing.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:17 AM on 24th June 2011 . Residents of Minot, North Dakota, fled their homes in panic today as devastating floods from the overflowing Souris River left entire neighbourhoods under water. More than 11,000 residents, almost a quarter of the population, have already been forced to flee as waters continue to rise towards historic levels - the biggest floods in the region in four decades. And there were fresh fears today as Minot is also home to Minuteman III nuclear missile silos - which are situated directly in the flood's . path. Soldiers and emergency workers piled sandbags and pumps at the sites today in a bid to protect the silos from flooding. Last night Curt Zimbelman, mayor of the town of 41,000, said: 'We could have a really catastrophic type of event here. We will - there is no doubt about it anymore. I think people have to understand if you were on the edge before you may not be on the edge now.' Scroll down for video . Devastating: North Dakota is experiencing the worst flooding in four decades as thousands flee in terror . Flooding: Water flows from Lake Darling into the Souris River about fifteen miles north of Minot, North Dakota, today . Resistance: Crews reinforce an earthen levee along the Souris River today in Minot. The river is expected to rise significantly, creating more havoc for the town . The warning was followed by an . announcement saying: 'All residents must evacuate, Zones 1 through 9,' prompting the last of nearly 11,000 Minot residents to leave their homes . for a second time in a month. Robyn Whitlow, 27, who was helping . some residents move the last of their belongings, burst into tears when . the sirens sounded just before 1pm. 'I feel so bad for everybody,' said Mrs Whitlow, a Minot resident who lives outside the evacuation zone. The Souris River, which loops down from Canada through north central North Dakota, has been bloated by heavy spring snowmelt and rain on both sides of the border. The resulting deluge is expected to dwarf a historic flood of 1969, when the Souris reached 1,555.4ft above sea level, the Associated Press reports. The river is expected to hit nearly 1,563ft this weekend - eventually topping the historical record of 1,558 feet set in 1881. Mr Zimbelman warned on Wednesday morning that the river would top the levees earlier than expected and said residents still moving their belongings from the evacuation zone should 'do their last-minute thing and be prepared to move quickly.' Safety: Residents use a boat to check on their homes in Big Lake, Missouri as thousands flee the area . Sandbags: Soldiers with the National Guard work on a temporary levee in Minot, North Dakota, on Wednesday . The National Weather Service in Bismarck also issued a flash-flood warning along the Souris River from Burlington through Minot and Logan to Sawyer. Before the sirens sounded, Laura Nessler, a 50-year-old nurse, watched the water lap against a bridge on Broadway, the main north-south thoroughfare through Minot. The road was bumper-to-bumper with furniture-loaded pickup trucks and cars pulling U-Hauls trying to get out of town. Nessler pointed to a side street that had become inundated in the hour since she arrived. 'That didn't have any water when I got here, and now it's filling up,' Nessler said. Ashley Getchell, 25, was snapping some photos at Broadway Bridge to document the flood for her children aged three and one-and-a-half because she 'has no place else to go.' Sinking: A home breaks apart as it is engulfed by Missouri River flood waters on Wednesday in North Dakota . Moving fast: The surging Souris River passes near a home in Minot, North Dakota, as 11,000 residents are evacuated . The stay-at-home mom had moved most . of her belongings from her home at Holiday Village Trailer Park to a . friend's house, but she didn't have enough time rescue anything else. 'I'm going to be losing my house,' she said calmly. 'I guess if anybody needed a reason to start over, this is it.' The mayor said the city has just been buying time, and he urged people to be safe as they leave. 'Be cautious and be courteous, I guess,' he told KXMC. 'Everybody's trying to do the same thing. If we work together, the result's probably going to be the best.' Get outta here: MacKenzie Mack moves some of her belongings out of her apartment near Minot State University because of rising water levels of the Souris River . Further north near the U.S.-Canada border, a rapid rise of nearly four feet was observed on the Souris River in the Sherwood area, the National Weather Service said late Wednesday morning. The area is the first point in North Dakota where water released from Canadian dams is observed. The weather service said flash flooding was expected in mainly rural areas of northwest Renville County, along with the hamlet of Greene. Renville County Emergency Manager Kristy Titus ordered a mandatory evacuation of Mouse River Park. About 10,000 Minot residents were evacuated earlier this month before the river hit 1,554.1 feet. Resigned to leave: Tina Collom, 82, stands outside her Minot home. 'We won't have nothing to come back to this time,' she said . They were later allowed to return to their homes, but told to be ready to leave again quickly. Nearly 500 North Dakota National Guard soldiers were in Minot to provide traffic control, and to help in the evacuation. Guard commander Dave Sprynczynatyk said he expected the impact of the impending flood among the worst he has seen in his 40-year career. 'What I see right now is probably the most devastating in terms of the number of people directly impacted and what will likely be the damage to homes as the water begins to overtop the levees and fill in behind,' he said.

"By . Daniel Bates . Last updated at 12:10 PM on 1st September 2011 . The discovery of a human foot in a rubber-soled shoe washed up on the Canadian coast near Vancouver has deepened a four-year mystery. DNA testing is under way but police are at a loss to explain how it got there. The macabre find brings to a dozen the number of human feet – all in rubber soled shoes – which have been discovered since August 2007. The first foot was later linked to a man whose name police withheld at the request of his family. Grim discovery: Police in Vancouver investigate after a human foot inside a running shoe washed ashore . It has been suggested that the feet, . which are both male and female, could be from victims of the Asian . tsunami in 2004, or even be the work of a serial killer. What seemed initially like a bizarre coincidence has over the years become the subject of a major investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and British Columbia's coroner's office. Nobody, however, has been able to offer a definite explanation as to what is happening - or identify who all of the feet belong to. The latest limb to be found was discovered floating in the water along the shore of Vancouver's False Creek, which wraps around the downtown area. Part of leg bone was still attached, police said. Detectives cordoned off the area and the British Columbia coroner was called in. Vancouver police spokeswoman constable Jana McGuiness said there was no indication how the remains got there and further forensic examination will be required. 'It was quite disturbing - quite a discovery to make,’ she added. Mystery: No one has been able to offer a definitive explanation as to where the feet are coming from - or who they belong to . According to reports in the Canadian press, the discoveries date back to August 2007 when a man's foot was found on Jedediah Island, northeast of Nanaimo in British Colombia. The foot was later linked to a deceased male whose name police withheld at the request of his family. Over the next four years they have turned up with occasional regularity, always clad in a rubber soled shoe. During one 11 month period six feet washed up, although it has been six months since the latest discovery. Initially it was thought that all the feet had come from four men who died in a light aircraft crash off the West coast of Canada in February 2005. However in August 2006 the theory fell apart with the discovery of a fifth right foot, meaning that something else was to blame. Since then a number of explanations have been put forward - some suggested the limbs might be from stowaways who smuggled themselves onto a container ship as it left Vancouver. False Creek: The waterway where the twelfth severed foot was found . Others claimed the feet could be from victims of the Asian Tsunami in 2004, or part of a human trafficking ring. But when it emerged that one had apparently been deliberately severed, rumours began spreading that a serial killer with a twisted calling card might be at work. Detectives frantically combed the missing person’s database for clues but later said they believed the the feet appeared to have come off the bodies naturally, and that foul play was not suspected. Men and women are among those whose feet have come ashore, but as yet only the one male has been positively identified - with no explanation as to how they got there. Complicating matters were claims by oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer who has said that the feet could have drifted as far as 1,000 miles. Pranksters have also made the investigation more difficult. In 2008 they planted a hoax ‘foot’ on Vancouver Island which renewed interest in the case.","DNA testing is underway but police are unsure how the foot got there .

Maths teaching in schools should be overhauled, with the introduction of Asian-style daily teaching and a focus on fundamentals, the Education Secretary has suggested. Michael Gove has signalled a return to academic rigour in the maths curriculum amid concerns that the UK is lagging behind other countries. He suggested daily maths lessons and regular tests are to be adopted, inspired by the system in Singapore, with the possible return of ‘numeracy hour’ – a Labour initiative scrapped two years ago. Summing it up: Michael Gove (left) wants a return to academic rigour in the maths curriculum, with fractions and algebra teaching given a boost . Under his proposals, lessons for primary school children are to focus on fractions and the building blocks of algebra. And those in secondary school will study advanced calculus and statistics – currently the preserve of A-level students. Mr Gove also suggested that within a decade all children should study maths in some form up to the age of 18 – which will be the school leaving age from 2015. The proposals come amid concerns that half the adult population lacks ‘basic maths skills’. English schools are slipping down international league tables in the subject while countries such as Singapore, Japan, China and Korea steam ahead. At the age of 15, pupils in China are around two academic years ahead of British counterparts in the subject. Primary pupils need to be taught maths every day to prepare them for secondary school, Mr Gove says . In a speech to the Royal Society . yesterday, Mr Gove said: ‘If we are to keep pace with our competitors, . we need fundamental, radical reform in the curriculum, in teaching, and . in the way we use technology in the classroom. ‘Unless we dramatically improve our performance, the grim arithmetic of globalisation will leave us all poorer.’ Mr Gove will publish details of reforms following the national curriculum review. Dame Athene Donald, chairman of the . Royal Society Education Committee, welcomed  his proposals. She said: . ‘The UK has a proud track record of achievement in science and . engineering, with the most productive research base among leading . economies. ‘However, we need to place science . and innovation at the heart of the UK’s long-term strategy for economic . growth if we are to remain competitive, and at the apex of this must be . inspiring the next generation of scientists, mathematicians and . engineers. ‘The Education Secretary’s recognition that more students should be studying maths and for longer is particularly welcome.’ Currently, maths is compulsory up to the age of 16. Only around 13 per cent of pupils, some 85,000, take it at A or AS-level each year.","'Improving the foundations would allow a more ambitious secondary curriculum,' says Michael Gove ."

Stagni's personal auditor Annamaria Pizzolato is understood to have forwarded the image to the work e-mail account of I.T. manager Danna Morris. The picture became known after city attorney Keith Conley released it as part of a public records request. Mr Conley said that once the image had been forwarded it would be 'stuck in the city servers'. No other 'sexted' images were found. Stagni apologised for his actions in a statement and asked for 'God's mercy and forgiveness' along with that of his wife, Denise, and family. 'I take full responsibility for my irresponsible behaviour. This matter has been a painful experience for my family and I pray that everyone will allow our family to continue to heal.

White House officials say the House Ethics Committee staff has initiated a preliminary inquiry into Weiner's sexually charged on-line relationships. President Obama slammed Weiner's actions as 'highly inappropriate'. He said the Democrat has 'embarrassed himself' and his wife and family.

Swift justice: Humberside Chief Constable Tim Hollis has questioned why criminals cannot normally be dealt with as quickly as rioters . A senior officer has blasted the courts system, asking why it could not always process criminals at the same pace used to deal with rioters. Head of Humberside Police Tim Hollis praised the 'rapid and robust' response but also demanded to know why it normally takes courts so long. He wrote in the Yorkshire Post: 'We really did see rapid and robust justice with offenders being arrested, charged, put before the courts and sentenced in days. 'This undoubtedly contributed to taking the momentum out of the disorder – but for the police and public it did raise the question as to why cases take so long to get to court in the normal course of events.' Chief Constable Hollis also questioned 'why imprisonment is . not used more effectively at an early stage for those who make the lives . of the law-abiding a misery on a more routine basis'. In the aftermath of the riots, courts were organised to run overnight and David Cameron joined politicians praising judges and magistrates for taking a tough line. In all 1,474 suspects had been before . the courts, nearly two-thirds of them in London, according to the most recent Ministry of Justice figures last week. The prison population . has risen by 1,300 since the start of August, reaching 86,821 last week. There remain 1,517 spare places in the prison system. Much tougher sentences were being handed out in the wake of the riots which spread across English cities earlier this month. Amed Pelle, 18, who incited 2,000 Facebook friends to commit violence and looting in Nottingham was jailed for 33 months last week, having encouraged them to  'kill a million police officers'. Another looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months. Anderson Fernandes, 21, wandered into an upmarket store in central Manchester after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops. But despite giving it to a passer-by because he didn't like the coffee flavour, he was still given a lengthy prison term. Destruction: Fire fighters and riot police survey the area as fire rages through a building in Tottenham, north London . Out in force: The cost of policing the London riots is set to exceed the cost of policing all the major public order events in the capital last year . Braced for impact: The Metropolitan Police say the figure will rise once they have paid the bills from the other forces who sent officers to help quell the trouble . The cost of policing the London riots . has spiraled to £34million with Scotland Yard expecting the figure to . rise even further, exceeding the total cost of policing all major public . order events in the capital last year. An 11-year-old boy was sentenced for arson and criminal damage five days before getting caught up in the recent riots, a court heard today. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stole a bin from Debenhams in Romford, Essex, on August 8 after the windows of the store were smashed by looters. He was given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order at Havering Magistrates' Court in Essex today after admitting burglary. The court heard that just five days before the offence, he was given a referral order for arson, criminal damage and carrying a pointed instrument in an unrelated incident. The 11-year-old, from Romford, is the youngest rioter in the capital to face prosecution, according to Scotland Yard. He took the waste bin, which was worth £50, after a group of males smashed windows at the store, causing £6,000-worth of damage. Passing sentence, District Judge John Woollard said: 'You seem to think that nobody can stop the way you behave.' The boy was placed under an 18-month youth rehabilitation order, and told that his local authority will dictate where he lives for the next six months. He was already under a referral order, put in place on August 3, for an incident on July 18 when he cut the seats of a bus with a craft knife and tried to set fire to the exposed foam. When the driver would not let him off, the 11-year-old threw a stone at the exit door of the route 174 bus, and then kicked a hole in the shattered glass so that he could jump out while the bus was still moving. The district judge said the boy, who sat in court next to his mother, had been involved in a 'major disorder' just days after appearing before magistrates. He said: 'My view is that the offence is a very serious one. If you were a little older, you would be ending up in prison, you would be looked after there rather than elsewhere. You need to understand very clearly that you can't get away with committing offences of this nature.' According . to the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) the current estimate is set . to rise significantly once the final bills from the other forces which . were called in to help quell the disturbances are settled. In . comparison, £34.8 million was spent on policing 42 major public order . events between April 2010 and March 2011, figures showed. As well as paying the salaries and overtime of officers brought in from other constabularies, the Met can also expect a hefty bill for accommodation as many had to be put up in hotels. A spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Authority expects at this stage a figure in excess of £34million for policing the recent disturbances in London.' Last year £7.5million was spent policing the student fees protests, £2.1 million providing security at the TUC anti-cuts demonstration, £1.9million on the Pope's visit to Britain and £2.2million on the general election campaign. Chief Constable Hollis's comments . came as magistrates rejected accusations from the leader of Britain's . prison governors that there has been a 'feeding frenzy' in sentencing . after the recent riots. But . Eoin McLennan-Murray, president of the Prison Governors Association . (PGA), claimed over the weekend that magistrates had lost all sense of . proportion. 'It's like when you've got sharks and there's blood in the water and it's a feeding frenzy,' he told The Independent on Sunday. 'There's a sentencing frenzy and we seem to have lost all sight of proportionality. 'It's . appealing to the populist mentality, and that's not the best basis on . which to sentence people. The norms of sentencing are being ignored.' But . Magistrates' Association chairman John Thornhill said the claims were . 'unreasonable and unfounded', adding that it was 'just not the case' that normal sentencing was being ignored.

Outspoken military chiefs were ‘putting lives at risk’ by warning that Britain would struggle to fight the Libyan war for more than six months, Liam Fox said yesterday. The Defence Secretary issued the warning as he admitted for the first time that the UK could be forced to cut firepower elsewhere in the world if the conflict dragged on. Dr Fox slapped down commanders as he announced the biggest shake-up in the Ministry of Defence in more than half a century. He unveiled a radical raft of reforms to purge military top brass, reduce rivalry between the Army, Royal Navy and RAF and cut waste and red tape at the cash-strapped department. The remarks about Libya came on the day the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, accusing him of crimes against humanity. The Government has been under pressure after Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the First Sea Lord, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant, second-in-command at the RAF, publicly questioned whether the UK could sustain operations in Libya after severe defence cuts. Last week an exasperated David  Cameron told service chiefs: ‘You do the fighting, I’ll do the talking.’ Yesterday Dr Fox waded into the row. ‘We must be very careful, those of us who have authority in defence, in discussing the sustainability of our mission,’ he said. ‘People’s lives are at stake. We may have to reprioritise some of our assets – but let us make it clear that there can be only one message that goes out to Libya. ‘That is: we have the military capability, political resolve and legal authority to see through what we started. We will continue our mission until our mission succeeds and Col Gaddafi must get no other signal than that.’ Ministers fear that offering any crumb of comfort to the Libyan tyrant ¿ whose regime has been bombarded by airstrikes for more than 100 days ¿ could spark a bloody fightback against Nato troops, rebel forces and civilians . Ministers fear that offering any . crumb of comfort to the Libyan tyrant – whose regime has been bombarded . by airstrikes for more than 100 days – could spark a bloody fightback . against Nato troops, rebel forces and civilians. Dr Fox unveiled an 82-page report by Lord Levene’s defence reform unit calling for a root-and-branch shake-up of the MoD. The report criticised the ‘bloated and dysfunctional’ department for leaving ministers ‘in the dark’ about key decisions. Scrapped: A Harrier jet comes in to land on the HMS Ark Royal which was axed with 'immediate effect' after the Strategic Defence and Security Review last October . Dr Fox told the Commons that the MoD . was ‘top heavy’ and over-bureaucratic, which had led to poor . decision-making and financial management. The MoD is attempting to plug a . £36billion black hole in its budget caused by ordering equipment that it . cannot pay for. As revealed by the Daily Mail last week, the heads of . the Army, Royal Navy and RAF will be booted off the MoD’s most senior . decision-making body, the Defence Board. They will be replaced by three . non-executive members on a new streamlined board in an attempt to get a . grip on the MoD’s ‘appalling’ procurement spending record. The move has been seen as revenge for tensions that have built up between the Government and the military. But the three service chiefs will get . more control over their individual budgets including how to split funds . between training, personnel and equipment. Dr Fox said this would end a . situation in which military chiefs spent most of their time ‘trying to . influence policy and haggle over funding in London’. He signalled that the number of . senior officers – including generals, admirals and air marshals – would . be culled and fresh blood brought in to make the forces more . ‘meritocratic’. Sources said a third of top brass could go. Dr Fox said: ‘There is a very strong . case for reducing the star count in the Armed Forces to create space for . those coming up the ranks.’ The MoD is shedding 25,000 civilian . staff over the next four years as part of spending cuts announced last . year. The forces will also shrink in size with 5,000 posts due to go in . both the Army and Navy and 7,000 in the RAF. Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy said the report contained some ‘sensible’ measures. But he said: ‘While the deficit is . temporary, the cuts they are making are permanent. Once you have sacked . RAF pilots, you cannot reorder new ones. They have gone and they have . gone for good. I think we will rue the day they made some of these . cuts.’","Warning from Defence Secretary to top brass .

"Simmering tension between taxi drivers and tourists . By . Nick Mcdermott . Last updated at 10:02 AM on 16th July 2011 . Armed and dangerous: Greek taxi driver Stelios Morfis, 21, poses in army fatigues and brandishing two rifles in a photo he posted on a social networking site on the internet . The cowardly killer who stabbed a British teenager on an idyllic Greek island yesterday hid in shame as he faced a court. Flanked by police officers, Stelios Morfis, 21, covered his face with a T-shirt as he was led up the steps of Zakynthos Court. In the hours before being charged with manslaughter for stabbing 18-year-old Robert Sebbage in the heart, he told his father: ‘I never meant to kill the boy, I’m so sorry.’ Robert’s friend Jordan Manson, 18, was left with a punctured lung, and three other British teenager suffered minor stab wounds following the vicious assault on the island. Yesterday, it was revealed that the taxi driver held a pocket-knife in his fist as he launched a flurry of blows at the group during the altercation in the early hours of Wednesday. Several of the teenagers were unaware they had been stabbed until they began bleeding. At least one of the youths was knifed as he tried to run away. The killer’s father, Danny  Morfis, 53, also a taxi driver, yesterday broke his silence to say his son was devastated by his actions and had tearfully apologised to the family over their son's death. ‘I spoke to Stelios and he is more than sorry for what has happened,’ he said. ‘He cried to me in his jail cell and said: “I never meant to kill the boy, I’m so sorry”. He also apologised to Robert’s family for the pain he had caused.’ He added: ‘The knife that he used was my little penknife which I’ve had for years. I use it to peel fruit. It’s a tiny little thing. He never thought it could do that much damage. He lashed out with it and hit Robert. He didn’t know how much he’d hurt him.’ hauled in: Stelios Morfis, (right), 21, his face covered with a black cloth, is taken into court in Zakynthos, Greece. He has admitted stabbing to death Robert Sebbage, 18 from Basingstoke whilst in the resort Laganas . 'Accident waiting to happen': Stelios Morfis has been arrested in Zakynthos in connection with the murder of British teenager Robert Sebbage . Stelios Morfis and his accomplice, Dimosthenes Mylonas, 25, spent more than seven hours with Greek prosecutors yesterday. Morfis, who faces charges of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, is likely to be sent to Korydallos prison in Athens. Mylonas, who has been charged with aiding the killer, has been released on bail. It has been revealed that Morfis had been freed just days earlier by police after being arrested over a vicious assault. Morfis was held by detectives after he apparently savagely attacked a business rival but the investigation was dropped when Morfis apologised to his victim. He was described by locals as ‘an accident waiting to happen’. After his arrest over Robert's death, . Morfis is said to have told Greek police: 'I could not stand the . insults and the mockery they were throwing at us. They were targeting us . with lasers and swearing at us.' The 'gentle' teenager from Tadley, near Basingstoke, Hants, had been enjoying his first foreign holiday on the party island of Zakynthos with a group of friends when he was knifed in the heart and died in the street on the final night of his week-long trip. Stabbed: Robert Sebbage's dream came true when he was given the chance to be an England mascot . The Reading FC fan's devastated parents Andrew . and Rhian were flown to the the Laganas resort in Greece by tour operators Thomas Cook. Their arrival came as more details emerged of violent history of the suspect and the simmering tension between the island’s taxi drivers and British tourists. Morfis, who liked to be . seen with his Rottweiler dogs, had worked as a bodyguard for Zakynthos . mayor Dionysis Bozikis, the Express reported. His father Dionysus is a high-ranking member of the local cabbies’ union and a close friend of the mayor, the newspaper said. Injured: Jordan Manson . Recovering: Steven Granston . In hospital: Callum Lane . Close: Stabbing victim Robert Sebbage, left, with his brother Steven . Morfis was a taxi driver for the . Zante Radio Taxi whose president Marinos Nikos said last night he was . 'very, very sorry for the Sebbage family's loss.' He said that there were ongoing . clashes between holidaymakers and local drivers: 'We are all very sad at . what has happened, Stelios Morfis was a driver for us. There has been a . some trouble between taxi drivers and tourists in the past.' Morfis's latest violent incident involves threatening a businessman who runs a tourist train in the party resort. Taxi drivers on the island are believed to be resentful that the train service is stealing away their customers and livelihood. Morfis then allegedly attacked one of the train . drivers two weeks later, the Express reported, but police did not . proceed with the case after Morfis apologised to the victim. Morfis . also apparently assaulted a fellow taxi driver at the airport earlier this year . after he made a private arrangement with tour companies to transfer . holidaymakers to their hotels. The source claimed to the newspaper: 'He has been allowed to get away with increasingly violent attacks.' Witnesses told how Morfis allegedly snapped after one reveller jumped on his cab in the resort’s busy strip of bars. Residents said the British youths had simply run into the ‘wrong guy’. Shop . owner Nikos Liveras, 52, said: ‘He is known for having a short fuse. He . would explode at anyone for no reason at all and has been involved in . many arguments with tourists. He’s not the type to back down.’ Murder scene: The spot on the central Laganas street where the brawl and killing took place . The family home where Robert lived with his parents Andrew and Rhian . In . the hours after the fatal attack, Morfis attempted to evade police . capture on a speedboat he had moored at a marina, according to reports. But officers tracked the  21-year-old thug, described by one local as . ‘an accident waiting to  happen’, to a relative’s house. But Morfis was detained and the . alleged murder weapon was recovered from the sea. He and driver . Dimosthenes Mylonas, 25, are due to appear in court today. Close friend Jordan Manson, also 18, suffered life-threatening injuries after his lung was punctured in the attack. But he was said to be out of danger after an operation and was recovering in the intensive care unit at Zakynthos Hospital. He was expected to remain there for a week. Three other friends in the nine-strong group were also stabbed but were released after treatment.","Stelios Morfis had previously attacked tourist and had a 'short fuse'

Authorities believe a 14-year-old northern California girl may have died after drinking vodka mixed with soda during a weekend sleepover. Police said paramedics found Takeimi Rao dead on her bedroom floor at around 9am on Sunday. She had hosted a sleepover on Saturday night at the family's exclusive gated Santa Rosa home for three of her friends. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Takeimi Rao, 14, was found dead on her bedroom floor after a sleepover . Popular: Takeimi, right, pictured here with friend Danielle Codding, who was not at the sleepover, was a popular girl and had been an 'outstanding student' Unusual: Danielle Codding said it was completely out of character for Takeimi to be drinking alcoho . All four of them had become ill and vomited several times during the night, but had blamed the sickness on the hamburgers they ate for dinner. Sonoma County Sheriff's Lieutenant Steve Brown said Takeimi's mother Aleae Pennette woke up . during the night and saw the girls throwing up. She had cleaned them up and put them back to bed. Tragic: 14-year-old Takeimi was found unresponsive on the floor of her bedroom at her Santa Rosa home on Sunday morning . Sleepover: Authorities said Takeimi died and three of her friends became ill after drinking what was believed to be vodka and soda . But the next morning when Ms Pennette . and her partner Scott Moyer went to wake her daughter she was . unresponsive and had vomited, according to assistant Sonoma County . Sheriff Lorenzo Dueñas. Paramedics were called and Takeimi was pronounced dead at the scene. The parents of the three other girls were told to take them to the hospital for a check-up. The three girls told authorities that Takeimi had mixed soda and vodka into a water bottle and they had passed it . around, but had not liked the taste, Mr Dueñas said. At least one of the girls told police Takeimi had only taken a few sips of the drink. 'At this point we are looking at it as an accident,' Mr Dueñas told Press Democrat. Ms Pennette is said to be distraught . and feels 'responsible' for what happened, according to the mother of one . of her daughter's friends. Angie Williams of Santa Rosa, said: 'It makes us all think, what parent doesn’t have old alcohol sitting in . our cupboards? 'Takeimi is a good girl and Aleae is such a good mom.' Takeimi had just graduated from Rincon Valley Middle School. The principle, Matt Marshall, called her an 'outstanding student'. One of Takeimi's closest friends, Danielle Codding, 14, had been in church when she heard the news about her death. Danielle, who had been invited to the sleepover but was not able to go, said drinking alcohol was completely out of character for her friend. 'She's never done that before,' Danielle said. 'And . she was one of those people that told me to listen. 'She was always watching over me and making sure I was . making the right choices.' Danielle had been at Mt Gilead Bible Camp in Sebastopol with Takeimi, according to her mother Michaela. One of Takeimi's classmates, Spencer Metela, said she had been a gifted singer and dancer. 'She had to dance and she was very good at it,' he told the Press Democrat. 'She was talkative, always very nice to everyone. She had a lot of friends.' A Facebook memorial group had today attracted 1,197 people. Alyssa Moore, who had known Takeimi from drama classes, wrote: 'You were so bubbly and such a talented dancer. You were very sweet and you will be missed. RIP.' Jessie Apodaca wrote: 'Nobody this young and beautiful should have passed away. Hopefully this will all teach us a lesson. Somebody should have been there to prevent it.' The results of an autopsy, carried out yesterday, were inconclusive and toxicology results could take several weeks.","Takeimi Rao was found dead and had vomited, police said .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:13 PM on 23rd June 2011 . Kathy Libraty is barely visible hidden amongst her astonishing collection of antique dolls - worth an astonishing £1.23million. Almost every inch of the 52-year-old's home in Brooklyn, New York, is filled by the hoard of more than 1,000 figurines which she has been collecting for over 25 years. She is so obsessed with dolls she has resorted to smuggling any new additions to the rapidly extending collection past her long-suffering husband Frank  who has forbidden her to buy any more. Blending in: Kathy Libraty and daughter Elisa with just some of the massive collection of antique dolls . But despite his objections, Frank, 52, along with daughter Elisa, get roped in to helping her repair and organise the vast assortment. Kathy's dolls - ranging from 2in to over 3ft high - come from all over the world including countries like Germany, France and the Far East. Some individual models are over 170 years old and range in cost from 60p to £30,000. Some of her favourites include figures of Henry VIII and his six wives, Victorian dolls from the 1900s, voodoo dolls, and even some from the 1880s which were used to smuggle opium. They're everywhere: A sideboard packed with yet more figurines . Two of Kathy's favourites: A Chinese opera doll from the late 19th century (left) and a German antique black and white from around 1900 (right) Kathy said: 'It all started over 25 years ago when I found an antique doll discarded in a dumpster. 'My husband and I were driving through our neighbourhood and came upon an old house that was having it's antique contents cleared out. 'It looked like there were some really valuable and interesting old treasures just being scrapped, so we asked if we could keep anything we liked. A few boxes contained old dolls and doll clothes and I decided to keep and restore them.' Once she had 'the bug' Kathy's collection grew and grew. And it eventually became work for her as she started her company kathylibratysdolls.com. A family affair: A range of all-bisque dolls made by the German manufacturer Kestner between 1895-1910. Each figure is worth between £600 and £750 . In her pursuit for yet more dolls, devoted Kathy has travelled more than 100,000 miles on trips between America and Europe - where most of the dolls were made. She added: 'I began restoring many of the dolls I acquired through auctions I'd travel around the world for.' 'Some I would restore and then sell to other collectors. Others I just fell in love with and had to add to my personal collection at home. 'My daughter loves the dolls too and she will inherit everything. 'It got to a point where I was sneaking them in past Frank because we were running out of room. We even bought a bigger house so that we could store them all. 'But I just couldn't part with some.' That's some dolls' house: Kathy and husband Frank needed to buy a new home in order to store the ever-expanding collection . Kathy sorts her new arrivals at home and seeks out clothing and accessories to try and make the antiques as close to their original forms as possible. She uses an extensive library of books and catalogues to help her find the correct fashions and accessories for the different periods in which the dolls were made. Some items, like shoes and wigs - made from real hair - can cost as much as £1,000. Her personal collection is stored in different rooms around her large home. New arrivals go first to her triage room where she sorts them according to style and determines what work they need. If they need repairing she moves them to the attic workshop where Frank helps to repair broken limbs and other damages. Over the years she has built up a huge array of spare parts including wigs, body parts and hand-blown glass eyes made in France and Germany. Later Kathy either auctions them through her website - helped by daughter Elisa - or adds them to her colossal private reserve.","Massive range includes dolls of Henry VIII and his six wives to opium smuggling figurine from the 1880s .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:56 PM on 23rd June 2011 . A cosmic 'pile-up' between four galaxy clusters that has taken place over 350million years has been pieced together by scientists. The investigation into how Abell 2744 - nicknamed Pandora's Cluster - came to be formed is likely to provide researchers with significant insights into the nature of dark matter. They pieced together the cluster's complex and violent history using telescopes in space and on the ground, including ESO’s Very Large Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. Scroll down for video . Abell 2744: A cosmic collision between four galaxy clusters that has taken place over 350million years has been pieced together by scientists . Lead researcher Julian Merten said: . 'Like a crash investigator piecing together the cause of an accident, we . can use observations of these cosmic pile-ups to reconstruct events . that happened over a period of hundreds of millions of years. 'This can reveal how structures form . in the Universe, and how different types of matter interact with each . other when they are smashed together.' Abell 2744 is the result of a . simultaneous collision of at least four separate galaxy clusters and . this complex collision has produced strange effects that have never been . seen together before. When huge clusters of galaxies crash together, the resulting mess is a treasure trove of information for astronomers. Researcher Renato Dupke said: 'We . nicknamed it Pandora's Cluster because so many different and strange . phenomena were unleashed by the collision. Some of these phenomena had . never been seen before.' Among these is a 'bullet' near the core of the cluster, where the gas of one cluster collided with that of another to . create a shock wave. The dark matter passed through the collision . unaffected. In another part of the cluster there . seem to be galaxies and dark matter, but no hot gas. The gas may have . been stripped away during the collision, leaving behind no more than a . faint trail. Even odder features lie in the outer . parts of the cluster. One region contains lots of dark matter, but no . luminous galaxies or hot gas. A separate ghostly clump of gas has been . ejected, which precedes rather than follows the associated dark matter. Treasure trove of information: The central part of Abell 2744 as its individual culsters merge together . This puzzling arrangement may be . telling astronomers something about how dark matter behaves and how the . various ingredients of the Universe interact with each other. The scientists have made an animation . that reconstructs how the remarkable merger event that created Abell . 2944 might have happened. In the video, the red regions are . clouds of very hot gas, detected by their X-ray emission; the blue . clouds are regions rich in dark matter that can only be discovered . indirectly by their gravitational influence. It shows how these different . components behaved over a period of several million years, leading up to . their currently observed positions. Abell 2744 was studied in more detail . than ever before by combining data from the European Southern . Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Japanese Subaru telescope, . the Nasa/Eureopean Space Agency Hubble Space Telescope, and Nasa's . Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The galaxies in the cluster are clearly visible in the VLT and Hubble images. Although the galaxies are bright they . make up less than 5 per cent of the mass there. The rest, around 20 per . cent, is gas, which is so hot that it shines only in X-rays, and dark . matter, around 75 per cent, which is completely invisible. To understand what was going on in the collision the team mapped the positions of all three types of matter in Abell 2744. Incoming: Scientists made an animation that reconstructs how the remarkable merger event that created Abell 2944 might have happened . Dark matter is particularly elusive . as it does not emit, absorb or reflect light, but only makes itself . apparent through its gravitational attraction. To pinpoint the location of this . mysterious substance the team exploited a phenomenon known as . gravitational lensing. This is the bending of light rays from distant . galaxies as they pass through the gravitational fields present in the . cluster. The result is a series of tell-tale distortions in the images of galaxies in the background of the VLT and Hubble observations. By carefully plotting the way that . these images are distorted, it is possible to map quite accurately where . the hidden mass - and hence the dark matter - actually lies. By comparison, finding the hot gas in . the cluster is simpler as Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory can observe . it directly. These observations are not just crucial to find out where . the gas is, but also to show the angles and speeds at which different . components of the cluster came together. It seems that the complex collision . has separated out some of the hot gas and dark matter so that they now . lie apart from each other, and from the visible galaxies. Galaxy clusters are the biggest . structures in the cosmos, containing literally trillions of stars. The . way they form and develop through repeated collisions has profound . implications for our understanding of the Universe.",The investigation into how Abell 2744 came to be formed is likely to provide researchers with significant insights into the nature of dark matter .

A council caretaker trafficked girls as young as 14 into Britain to work as prostitutes after they had been put under a voodoo spell, a court heard yesterday. Anthony Harrison, 32, is alleged to have raped two girls in Britain after they had been subjected to an extraordinary African black magic ritual by a people-smuggling gang. The terrifying ceremony was performed in Nigeria by a Juju priest to trap the girls into a life of sex slavery, it was said. Anthony Harrison, 32, is alleged to have raped two girls in Britain after they had been subjected to an extraordinary African black magic ritual by a people-smuggling gang. Woolwich Crown Court heard one 16-year-old girl was taken to a shrine and stripped naked before being cut so the priest could collect her blood to be put in a coffin . During the ritual, a 16-year-old girl was taken to a shrine where she was stripped naked by two men and slashed dozens of times with a razor so the priest could collect her blood which was placed in a coffin, Woolwich Crown Court heard. In a terrifying ordeal 'little short of torture', the girl's body hair was shaved off, her arms were bound behind her back and she was forced to lie naked and covered in blood in another coffin, jurors were told. The victim also allegedly had to eat the raw heart of a freshly slaughtered chicken as part of the spell by the priest, who told her that he had access to her soul and if she did not obey his commands he could visit her in her dreams and 'kill her from within'. In another ritual, a 14-year-old girl was made to swear an oath of loyalty to a Juju medicine man who took her to a river and told her to eat some white clay, having passed a rock from his mouth to hers. The youngster was instructed to wash with black soap and also given a raw chicken's heart to eat, it was said. On trial: Harrison, 32, is alleged to be a 'key player' in a Nigerian people smuggling gang who used African black magic to terrify two young girls . The court heard that in Nigeria where Juju is a greatly feared magic or medicine, the ceremonies 'bind' the victims to the priest and ensure they would be too frightened to go to police. The girls were later flown to Britain . in 2009 on false documents where Harrison is alleged to have raped them . before trying to pass them on to traffickers in Spain and Greece to . work in the sex industry. Juju is a form of witchcraft thought to have originated  in West Africa which centres  on the belief that objects can  be endowed with magical powers. It is widespread in Nigeria, where such objects are made into charms believed to have the power to protect people or influence events. Many of the practices of Juju are unknown as they are  conducted in secret, but are generally characterised by elaborate rituals, often involving animals. It is thought the word Juju means ‘fetish’ in Hausa, a language of northern Nigeria. Juju travelled to the Americas from west Africa with the influx of slaves, and still survives in some communities that retain strong ties with their traditions. In more recent times, migrant workers from the region brought Juju to Britain and other parts of Europe. Riel Karmy-Jones, prosecuting, said: . 'Anthony Harrison is, we suggest, a key player in what is undoubtedly a . sophisticated and organised criminal network of West African people . traffickers who have been operating in the UK.' Harrison, who led a double life as a . caretaker for Newham Council in East London, allegedly had at least . seven aliases. Police still do not know his real identity. He arrived in . Britain from Nigeria in April 2003, falsely claiming to be a Liberian . national. Although he was refused asylum and his appeals failed, he was . later granted indefinite leave to remain. The court heard that the girls hailed . from very poor backgrounds in Edo, Nigeria. The 14-year-old victim had . been abandoned as a baby and was raised as a 'domestic drudge' in a . single-roomed hut, before being sold into prostitution. The elder girl was brought up by her uncle who sexually abused her. Miss Karmy-Jones said: 'The two young . women concerned were little more than children when they were . trafficked into this country.' They were allegedly 'groomed' by their . handlers and given 'scripts' to tell UK immigration staff that they were . claiming asylum, having been forced to flee their country because they . were accused of being lesbians. Under her handler's instructions, the . 16-year-old later absconded from a children's home to meet up with . Harrison, it was claimed. Harrison is said to have threatened . to kill her if she went to the police. He allegedly forced her to sleep . outside, starved her and plied her with alcohol before raping her. He is . also accused of raping and beating the 14-year-old. Harrison, of Stratford, East London, . denies counts of conspiracy to traffic people for sexual exploitation; . two counts of false imprisonment; two counts of rape; and four counts of . conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration law. The trial continues.","Anthony Harrison, 32, accused of subjecting girls to terrifying black magic to trap them into sex slavery .

"By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 8:50 PM on 24th June 2011 . Boris Becker has had his £15million Majorca villa seized by the Spanish authorities over an unpaid wage bill of £246,000 to his gardener. A Spanish court ordered the sequestration of the German tennis ace's 700,000 sq ft ranch-style house and grounds called Son Coll until the bill is paid to the groundsman. It is the latest in a long string of financial headaches that the luxurious villa has caused the triple Wimbledon winner over the last 14 years. He has been unsuccessfully trying to . sell the villa since 2007, which is why he has had to pay such an . enormous upkeep on the massive grounds that comes to exactly £246,225.46 . to keep it in pristine condition for potential buyers. House of horrors: Boris Becker's Sol Coll villa in Majorca has caused him a lot of strife . Groundsmen grief: The dispute has spiralled from an unpaid wage . Becker's lawyer argued before a court on the island that the sum can only be paid by his client when the property is sold by celebrity German realtor Matthias Kuehn. Kuehn said he is not responsible for settling Becker's gardening debts before it is sold. Meant for a family: Boris and his wife Lilly now live in Switzerland and want to sell the house he bought with former wife Barbara . Becker tried to play down the severity of the punishment, telling German newspaper Bild: 'It's not so dramatic. But if someone believes they have suffered an injustice it is up to him to seek redress. 'The procedure is ongoing so I can say no more.' The father-of-four bought the villa with his former wife Barbara in 1997. He was fined . close to £190,000 by a court in 2004 for unauthorised changes to it . during construction. Despite . the fine he took pleasure in his achievements at the site, which boasts . a massive garden with orange trees, a guest house, pool, tennis and . basketball courts and spreads out over 75 acres. 'I come from a . family of architects and interior designers. I was on a building site . before I was playing tennis. So I was very much involved,' he said. When . the tennis star, who won Wimbledon for the first time aged 17, . initially put it on the market he explained that the home was meant to . be used by a big family. 'The . whole idea was a family house, but now, my two boys are in Miami and my . daughter is in London, so that’s two or three weeks a year here, and . that’s it,' he said. Still up for sale: The Wimbledon ace has been trying to sell his luxurious pad for years . Selling up: The luxurious kitchen and the rest of the huge property is on the market . His ex-wife Barbara took a massive £10million, plus a £1.8million pound house in Florida,  from him in a divorce settlement following his 1999 fling in a cleaning cupboard at the posh London restaurant Nobu with Russian emigre Angela Ermakova. That led to the birth of daughter Anna, the purchase of a £1million flat for her and her mother in London plus maintenance payments. But there is more bad news in store for Boris with the villa German newspapers dub the 'house of horrors.' A builder is claiming £500,000 from him for unpaid work and a court case is underway. Becker, who just narrowly escaped a jail sentence a few years ago on tax evasion charges, now lives in Switzerland after marrying his partner Lilly Kerssenberg. But the red-headed prodigy will have to forget his villa woes, as is currently in Wimbledon commentating on the championship.

A tax consultant posed as a modelling agent for Harrods in a bid to trick women into bizarre sex acts. Jeffrey Edwards scoured small ads and customers' details on his work database to identify victims. He told them he was a fashion industry insider called Brett Raphael. The 47-year-old, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, offered modelling work to 18 women over three years, using home-made documents and cash to convince them he was a talent scout for top stores, including the famous Harrods store in London. In fact, he had no connection with Harrods or any other shops. But, once women had given him their phone number, Edwards, of Romiley, would 'relentlessly' text them asking for intimate details or making obscene suggestions. He turned up on the doorstep of a young mum he met in the street even though she hadn't given him her address. Once inside Edwards demanded to see 'cleavage' and tried to coax her into posing topless for a photo-shoot. The woman left the room when her baby cried. She returned with the tot to find him naked and performing a sex act in the kitchen. He fled when she screamed. Another victim was hounded until she agreed to take part in what the pervert claimed was market research for Marks and Spencer. She stripped and allowed him to measure and fondle her believing it was for a T-shirt design project. Alex Leach, prosecuting, told Manchester Crown Court that Edwards then asked her to measure him nude. Edwards prowled the streets of Stockport looking for victims. He would scour the small ads looking for women selling items like Ugg Boots - believing they were young and desperate for cash. Lies: Edwards convinced women he was a talent scout for Harrods (above) Others were approached after he got their contact details from his work database. Edwards carried on even after being chased and pinned down by the boyfriend of one of his victims. He ignored warnings from police and bosses who found an inappropriate letter to a client. His obsession continued after he was arrested and bailed when he pursued two women. . Edwards admitted sexual assault, exposure, and sending obscene text messages. Mr Leach said: ‘He developed a back-story, supported it with props he had created himself, and executed his scheme with some professionalism.’ He was sacked from his job at Personal Taxation Services in Stockport when he was charged last year. David Toal, defending, said Edwards's behaviour 'doesn't add up with the rest of his life. ‘When his sexual fantasies are aroused they override all his rational thoughts.' Judge Martin Rudland sentenced Edwards to a three-year community order with supervision and ordered him to attend a sex offenders' treatment programme. He said: ‘It's clear that for the greater part of your life you have behaved in a normal way but lately, a bizarre sexual fantasy has entered your life. My main objective is to protect women from your unwanted attention.’","Jeffrey Edwards, 47, called himself ‘Brett Raphael’

But whether it will be enough to satisfy one of the world's most notorious dictators is another matter. North Korean coach Kwang Min Kim last night blamed the defeat of his women's World Cup soccer team by the United States on fact that five of his players were struck by lightning. He claimed some of them were hospitalised with electrocution after a training match almost three weeks earlier. And Kim has all the more reason to come up with a convincing excuse - his men's team counterpart was sentenced to hard labour after he came home from the 2010 World Cup having lost all three games.

'The fact that they played could be called abnormal, the result of very strong will.'

It was the fourth straight time the teams had met in group play at the World Cup, and the Americans have won all but one of the games.Still, the victory isn't likely to end the questions about the Americans, who have been uncharacteristically inconsistent lately. After going more than two years without a loss, they dropped three games in five months, and looked decidedly unsettled against the North Koreans for much of the first half.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:27 AM on 28th June 2011 . The mantra meditation involves repeating a sound repeatedly twice daily for up to 20 minutes . Transcendental Meditation, made popular by the Beatles during the flower power era of the 1960s, could cut heart attack rates by half, researchers claim. The mantra meditation, which involves repeating a sound repeatedly twice daily for up to 20 minutes, lowers death rates from heart attack and strokes. The relaxation technique was used by patients with heart disease during a nine year £2.25million trial at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Professor of Medicine Theodore . Kotchen said: 'These findings are the strongest documented effects yet . produced by a mind-body intervention on cardiovascular disease. 'The effect is as large or larger than major categories of drug treatment for cardiovascular disease. 'However, subjects were already taking standard medications and this effect was on top of that.' It . followed 201 African-American men and women with an average age of 59 . who suffered from the narrowing of arteries in their hearts. They were selected to do the Transcendental Meditation technique or to participate in a control group which received health education classes in traditional risk factors, including dietary modification and exercise. Professor Kotchen said: 'In African American men and women with heart disease, Transcendental Meditation, a technique for stress reduction, decreased the likelihood of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke by 47 per cent. Transcendental Meditation was made popular by the Beatles during the flower power era of the 1960s . 'At the same time, study participants remained on their usual medications for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including anti-hypertensive agents and lipid-lowering medications. 'Consequently, meditation should be considered an adjunct, not a substitute, for usual medical care. Although provocative, these observations should be confirmed in other patient populations.' The researchers did further analysis of two subgroups, those participants who had high compliance with the meditation program, and a high stress group, and found even greater reductions in death, infarction and stroke in those groups. The high compliance subgroup showed a 66 per cent reduction, while the high stress subgroup showed a 64 per cent reduction. Co-author Dr Robert Schneider claimed the results are the strongest documented effects yet produced by a mind-body intervention on cardiovascular disease. The findings were published in the American Medical Association's Archives of Internal Medicine. At a press conference two years ago before a concert to promote Transcendental Meditation, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney recalled their 1968 trip to India to learn meditation from the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. 'Over 40 years ago, we ended up in Rishikesh,' Starr said. 'That is where we hung out with Maharishi. We had met him a few months before in Wales. Since then, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little, I have meditated. It’s a gift he gave me.' McCartney added: 'It’s one of the few things anyone has ever given to me that means so much to me. For us, it came at a time when we were looking for something to stabilise us at the end of the crazy Sixties.'",Transcendental Meditation works by repeating a sound twice daily for 20 minutes .
"By . Jacqui Goddard . Last updated at 12:48 AM on 25th June 2011 . A Florida prosecutor today tore into Casey Anthony’s brother in court, appearing to suggest that he was putting on a display of emotion and giving inconsistent testimony to help his sister's defence. Lee Anthony - who since his niece’s death in 2008 had refused to meet with lawyers on either side of the case to discuss evidence - admitted that he 'reached out' to the defence earlier this week to offer 'information..,that I thought was important', angering state attorneys as they challenged him on conflicts in his testimony. The prosecution’s expressions of cynicism over Mr Anthony’s reliability came a day after his mother Cindy also dropped a bombshell when she testified that it was her, not her daughter, who researched chloroform on the family computer in March 2008. Break down: Lee Anthony testifies in the murder case of his sister Casey Anthony, saying he wasn't told about his sister's pregnancy until just before his niece Caylee was born . Her revelation, which was at partial . odds with a deposition she gave in 2009, damaged the state’s assertion . that Casey Anthony, 25, plotted in advance to overpower her two-year-old . daughter Caylee with chloroform before suffocating her. Giving evidence at the trial in . Orlando, Florida, Mr Anthony broke down as he testified about how his . sister’s pregnancy had been kept secret from him in 2005. His evidence was introduced by the . defence to bolster their claim that the Anthonys were a dysfunctional . family with 'dark secrets' who hid their daughter’s pregnancy out of . shame and raised her to lie. Despite it being 'brutally obvious' that his sister was pregnant in summer 2005, he claimed that his sister . 'waved off' his enquiries and that his mother also avoided discussing it . when he asked. As a result, he did not visit his sister in hospital after she gave birth, he said. 'I was a little hurt, just didn’t . want to be there,' he testified, crying as he spoke. His sister also . looked distressed, weeping in court. During the emotional day in court Casey Anthony wiped away tears from her eyes while her brother Lee Anthony testified . Reaction: Casey also teared up while mother Cindy Anthony testify today . Also during Mr Anthony's testimony, Cindy began to cry and had to leave the court room with her husband. Mr Anthony continued: 'I was very . angry at my mom and I was also angry at my sister. I was just angry at . everyone in general that they didn’t want to include me and didn’t find . it important enough to tell me, especially after I had asked.' But under cross-examination, he ceded . that his court testimony was at odds with a deposition given in 2009. In his deposition, he stated that he had never directly challenged his . sister about her pregnancy and that far from trying to sweep the pending . birth under the carpet, his mother and father had gone 'over the top' to prepare for their grand-daughter’s arrival, buying a crib, taking . their daughter shopping for baby items,  turning their spare room into a . nursery with a Winnie the Pooh theme, and organizing a baby shower. Prosecutor Jeff Ashton pointed out that Mr Anthony had not wept when asked the same questions in 2009 about his niece’s birth. 'What was different two hours ago in . this courtroom that question that caused such raw emotion which wasn’t . present two years ago when you were asked the same thing?' Mr Ashton . demanded roughly. Mr Anthony replied: 'Two years ago, I . did not 100 percent hold the belief that Caylee was dead…during that . two-year span I have come to the place that I believe she is.' He added later: 'I don’t want to be . here. I don’t want my sister to be here and my parents to be here…This . is obviously just very very emotionally draining.' Swim: An image projected on a courtroom monitor showing Cindy Anthony, left, and her granddaughter Caylee at the family pool . The video of Caylee showed how she was capable of climbing the ladder and getting into the pool with almost no help from her grandmother, who cried as she watched the video play in court . Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty . to first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, aggravated . child abuse and four counts of lying to law enforcement. She potentially . faces the death penalty if convicted. When Caylee first went missing in . June 2008, Anthony told her mother that the child was with a nanny. A . month later, when her mother called in sheriff’s deputies, Anthony . claimed that the nanny had kidnapped the child. During opening statements in her . trial, her story changed again as her lawyer claimed that Caylee drowned . accidentally in the family pool, that her grandfather George Anthony . disposed of the body, and that Casey went along with the cover-up . because she had been molested by her father as a child and 'raised to . lie.' George Anthony has denied the allegations. Photographs presented in court by the . defence today showed Caylee climbing up a ladder into her grandparents’ above-ground swimming pool, supported by her grandmother, illustrating . that she was capable of getting in on her own. Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee was able to open a sliding . glass door that led to the backyard pool. Cindy Anthony cried again as she testified for the second day in a row for the defense in the murder trial of her daughter . Stress: George Anthony listens as his wife Cindy Anthony testifies . 'Even at that point, she could even climb into the pool' Cindy said when shown a photo. Casey Anthony wiped away tears while a video of her playing with the girl was viewed by the jury during her mother's testimony. Mrs Anthony testified that the ladder . would always be removed after they had swum together. But on June 16, . 2008, the day the defence now claims that Caylee was found dead in the . pool, the ladder was mysteriously back in position, she stated, . confirming evidence introduced by detectives earlier in the trial. The . new revelations follow a dramatic day in court yesterday, where Cindy . Anthony admitted making internet searches about chloroform on a family . computer - directly contradicting prosecutors' theory that it was Casey . who made the queries. Tight: Attorneys with the defence, Cheney Mason, second from right, and Jose Baez, right, meet with Judge Belvin Perry, centre, in a sidebar with prosecuting attorneys, left . George and Cindy Anthony stand together in the courtroom during a break in Cindy's testimony. At one they left in tears . During a terse courtroom exchange, . Judge Belvin Perry poured scorn on Anthony’s lawyer, Jose Baez, for . attempting to quiz Cindy Anthony about 'marital difficulties', Judge . Perry cut him short, telling him that her relationship with her husband . was irrelevant to the case. 'If your theory of defence is . ever-changing, maybe you just need to tell me what your theory of . defence is. At least, somebody try to explain it to me,' the judge told . Mr Baez cynically. Among the spectators in court today . was Judge Stan Strickland, who was originally assigned to the Anthony . case in 2008 but withdrew nearly two years later amid hostilities with . Mr Baez. Judge Strickland – who during a bond . hearing in July 2008 remarked that 'The truth and Ms Anthony are . strangers,'- recused himself in April 2010 after Mr Baez filed a motion . accusing him of being a 'self-aggrandising media hound' who was biased . against his client. In a fiery parting statement to the . court in 2010, Judge Strickland accused Mr Baez of being the one trying . to court public attention, noting sarcastically: 'The recusal motion . accuses the undersigned of being a ‘self-aggrandising media hound.’ Indeed. The irony is rich.' The trial continues. If convicted of daughter Caylee's murder, Casey could face the death penalty .","Court shown emotional video of grandmother Cindy helping Caylee into pool .

Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons acted within 24 hours of oil prices falling on the international markets. The . move is likely to force oil companies such as BP and Shell to follow . suit, especially in areas where they have a cut-price competitor. Taking a lead: Tesco slashed 3p off a litre of petrol with Asda and Sainsbury's quickly following suit . It . will offer some respite to motorists who have seen average prices of . around 136p a litre for petrol and 140p a litre for diesel. The . cuts follow the decision by the International Energy Agency to open . emergency reserves to reduce the risk of shortages or price increases. The . move was seen as ‘a shot across the bows’ of the Arab-dominated oil . cartel Opec which has an interest in keeping prices high. Oil dropped by up to $8 a barrel, which should equate to a 4p a litre fall at the pumps. Oil prices dropped sharply following the opening of emergency reserves yesterday by the International Energy Agency . AA . president Edmund King said: ‘We welcome this rapid 3p reduction in fuel . prices and hope that other retailers will follow this lead. ‘This will help the general economy to recover, as lower prices at the pumps means more spending elsewhere.’ RAC . motoring strategist, Adrian Tink, added: ‘This looks like it’s the . start of price war at the pumps which can only be good news for . motorists.’ Earlier . this week reports by the AA and RAC revealed that the price of fuel was . forcing motorists to dramatically cut back on journeys. Tesco UK chief . executive Richard Brasher said of the company’s 3p a litre cut: ‘We know . our customers are feeling the pinch at the moment so we want to pass on . the benefit of a fall in oil prices straight away.’ Asda . is cutting prices by up to 3p a litre from today at its 180 forecourts. It said drivers will not pay more than 130.7p a litre for petrol and . not more than 134.7p a litre for diesel. Sainsbury’s . said it was cutting prices by up to 3p a litre from midnight last . night. A spokesman said: ‘We know that consumer budgets are stretched.’ Morrisons said it had dropped prices by up to 3p at its 296 filling stations. BP said it set its prices from site to site, depending on the level of local competition. AA . fuel market expert Luke Bosdet noted: ‘Tesco’s participation in a price . war is significant because of their large number of fuel stations.’ He . added: ‘A 3p drop in the price of petrol switches £1.8million a day . from petrol sales to other consumer spending, helping high street . businesses.’","Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda all lop 3p off a litre of petrol and diesel .

"By . Jenny Hope . Last updated at 9:31 PM on 29th June 2011 . Arbitrary: Some NHS Trusts are not performing cataract operations on sufferers if they don't consider their vision has deteriorated enough . Drastic restrictions on  eye operations imposed by  half of NHS trusts have put  thousands of patients at  risk of losing their sight, a report warns. Elderly victims of the cutbacks are being left unable to read, write or drive as they wait longer for cataract surgery, it says. Patients in their early-60s have been denied operations even though their job relies on them being able to drive or operate machinery, eye specialists add. The damning report reveals the scandal of PCTs picking surgery for a  cataract – a clouding of the eye lens – as an ‘easy target’ to save money by increasing the threshold for vision loss before patients can have an operation, and also by increasing waiting times. In some areas, ‘arbitrary’ restrictions mean they can have only one eye operated on. Some PCTs  have suspended surgery for weeks  at a time to claw back overspending at the end of a financial year, it  is claimed. Official guidance from the Department of Health states patients should have surgery if the cataract affects sight, has an impact on quality of life, and if he or she understands the risks and agrees to it. But the report for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the Royal National Institute  of Blind People insists this is not happening routinely and many PCTs are implementing ‘visual acuity’ thresholds. The research is based on Freedom of Information request results from 133 PCTs in England. Of these, 70 PCTs (53 per cent) are restricting access and have implemented the threshold for surgery on either the first or second eye. Meanwhile, 56 PCTs (42 per cent) allow surgery according to the guidelines or if clinicians deem it appropriate. In a further seven PCTs (5 per cent), the policy is under review or an updated one is being worked on. Experts believe trusts restricting access are doing so without ‘robust evidence’ that this will not harm patients or increase inequalities. Dennis Sleigh, 69, had a cataract removed in March but was told he cannot have his second eye done due to ‘PCT policy’. The singer, songwriter and poet from Derby said: ‘This is impairing my independence. I feel frustrated and abandoned.’ Barbara McLaughlan, of the RNIB and author of the report, said the data suggested PCTs had picked on cataract operations as an ‘easy target’ where patients could be made to wait longer without harm. ‘Cataract surgery should be  performed when consultants  believe it is in the patients’ best interest,’ she said. ‘But some PCTs are forcing patients to live with unnecessary sight loss and a reduced quality of life.’ Larry Benjamin, chairman of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists’ cataract guideline committee, described the cutbacks as ‘a false economy’, adding: ‘This short-term saving could lead to older  people having other accidents,  potentially increasing NHS costs in the longer term.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘PCTs should ensure that in each case the clinical needs of each patient are taken into account and should not be introducing blanket bans on access to treatment.’ A cataract operation costs the NHS £932 for the first eye and £808 for the second. It is the most common surgical procedure in the UK, with 400,000 carried out each year.","Cataract surgery seen as 'easy target' for NHS cost-cutters .

Rupert Murdoch has had discussions with News Corp executives about selling off all his UK newspapers, it was revealed today. In the wake of the hacking scandal, senior bosses met to discuss the pros and cons of disposing of The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times. The Wall Street Journal - one of Murdoch's own papers - reported that the media mogul had discounted a wholesale sell-off, but will revisit the issue in six months. Today as the scandal deepened, News International legal manager Tom Crone resigned from the company. Sources told Sky News he had been placed on 90 days gardening leave. Questions had been raised about how much he knew about phone hacking after he led the first internal investigation in 2007. The trained barrister had worked for the company for 26 years and signed off some of the News of the World's most controversial frontpages. News International declined to confirm whether he resigned or was asked to leave. A source in the legal world close to Mr Crone described him as 'an incredibly professional and very clever Fleet Street lawyer'. The source said: 'Tom was very much a hands-on man when it came to the News of the World. He was always there on a Saturday. 'He would usually be the only lawyer on a Saturday handling pre-publication reading. Rebekah Brooks is pictured behind her car's tinted windows as she leaves Rupert Murdoch's central London home.

"Britain will contribute £1bn to Greek bailout . By . Tim Shipman and Simon Duke . Last updated at 2:03 AM on 25th June 2011 . The European debt crisis is the greatest threat to the faltering economic recovery, the Governor of the Bank of England warned yesterday. As the turmoil spread to Italy, Sir Mervyn King said Britain would be at risk if a crisis of confidence over the euro spread ‘contagion’ to other countries. He also warned that handing the bankrupt Greek government another bailout would do nothing to solve the ‘mess’. Experts: The impact of the crisis nations such as Germany and France will have a knock-on effect on the UK and lead to a tightening of bank funding conditions . David Cameron has claimed he has won a . landmark victory in Brussels by preventing the UK being dragged into a . new handout for Athens. But Sir Mervyn warned: ‘The most . serious and immediate risk to the UK financial system stems from the . worsening sovereign debt crisis in several euro area countries. Experience has shown that contagion can spread through banking markets.’ Last night those fears appeared to be . partially justified when credit rating agency Moody’s threatened to . downgrade the credit worthiness of 16 Italian banks and two . government-backed financial institutions. Warning: The Bank of England's financial watchdog warned the eurozone's debt crisis poses the biggest single threat to UK financial stability . The analysts also said the outlook . for 13 more Italian banks has slipped from stable to negative because of . low growth and Italian government debts which are 120 per cent of . national income. Moody’s has already threatened to . downgrade the Italian government’s credit rating and yesterday’s move . sent bank share prices lower. Sir Mervyn King said uncertainty over exposure to countries such as Greece could lead to a ""crisis of confidence"" The threat to Italy sparked fears . that Spain will also go under, since bigger countries are more likely to . drag Europe into a new depression than the debt problems in Greece, . Ireland and Portugal. In a rebuke to EU leaders, Sir Mervyn . warned that heaping yet more debt on to Greece won’t alleviate the . deep-seated problems caused by the country living beyond its means. The Governor said: ‘Simply the belief . that we just lend a bit more will never be an answer. An awful lot of . people wanted to believe that this was a crisis of liquidity. 'It wasn’t, . it isn’t. Until we accept that, we will never find an answer to it.’ He called on British banks to keep . more assets to help them ride out the crisis, pointing out that while . they have relatively modest exposures to Greek debt, they are ‘quite . heavily exposed’ to French and German banks, which are themselves party . to the Greek problems. Sir Mervyn’s comments came as Mr . Cameron forced German Chancellor Angela Merkel to abandon an attempt to . make British taxpayers help to prop up Greece. The new Greek bailout will be funded by the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund rather than all EU nations. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair . The European single currency will survive its present crisis despite 'fundamental' problems - and the UK could still join in the future, ex-prime minister Tony Blair said. Mr Blair rejected claims by former Labour cabinet colleague Jack Straw that the euro was doomed to collapse though he conceded the case for British entry was not 'compelling'. But he told the BBC that he remained 'absolutely in favour of doing it, politically' if the economic circumstances meant the idea could be sold to voters. In an interview for the Politics Show . he said he had fully supported then Chancellor Gordon Brown’s . assessment - using five tests - that the UK should not enter. But asked if that decision was a . relief given the present eurozone chaos, he said: 'I do not take the . view some people take that Britain joining the euro in the past or now . would be a disaster. 'But I always said that unless you could make a compelling case for it economically, you were never going to win a referendum. 'The case for Britain joining is not compelling. It may become that at a certain point.' He went on: 'I was always absolutely in favour of doing it politically and still am, by the way.' Mr Straw suggested last week that the euro could not survive and called for a speedy demise rather than a 'slow death'. 'I don’t think it will (collapse) actually,' Mr Blair said in the interview, which will be broadcast on Sunday. 'I don’t think they are going to give up the single currency. That’s not to say there aren’t huge issues as to how you get through the next months. 'I think and hope the single currency will resolve its problems.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'It would be a dreadful idea for Britain to join the euro. 'As long as I am doing this job, there is no prospect of Britain even contemplating joining.' Britain’s contribution will amount to . around £1billion through the IMF. It would have been more than double . that if Mr Cameron had not got his way. The Prime Minister said: ‘Britain did . not contribute to the first Greek bailout. We were not involved in the . discussions about it. We are not in the eurozone. ‘As a result, it would be wrong to be . drawn into the European element of a future payment. I sought . assurances on that. I got assurances on that. That’s important for . Britain. ‘We want the eurozone to sort out its problems and its difficulties and we’ve been constructive in trying to make that happen.’ Flashpoint: The Greek government's austerity measures have been met with violent protests . The Prime Minister said he agreed with the Governor on the need for European banks to carry more capital. But critics called on the Government . to take a leadership role in the EU to ensure that Britain’s European . partners get their economic houses in order. Raoul Ruparel, of think-tank Open . Europe, said: ‘The Government gives the impression that it’s happy . standing on the side-lines of negotiations to deal with the crisis ... but the UK must now push for a long-term solution.’ Meanwhile, Tony Blair says he still wants Britain to join the euro – when the time is right. In an interview with the BBC to be . broadcast tomorrow, the former prime minister says: ‘I was always . absolutely in favour of doing it politically and still am, by the way.’ Riot act: David Cameron insisted Britain would bail out Greece. He said Greek Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou, right, was 'taking great steps forward' David Cameron accused EU leaders of wanting to live in a ‘gilded cage’ yesterday after Brussels bosses raised two fingers to austerity by laying out plans for a lavish new headquarters costing £280million. The Prime Minister and other EU leaders were presented with an expensive brochure about the building as they were discussing the need for austerity at a summit dinner on Thursday night. Computer generated images show a womb-like glass structure, dubbed the ‘EUterus’, and an enormous circular summit chamber resembling the war room in the film Dr Strangelove. Mr Cameron told Eurocrats they ‘just don’t get’ the need for austerity after it emerged that the European Commission was spending £100,000 of taxpayers’ money on the 16-page pamphlet alone. It features Euro-gobbledygook saying the building – expected to be in use by 2014 – will be ‘a patchwork of European diversity . . . housing the heart of Europe’, with achingly right-on areas such as ‘humane gathering places’. Mr Cameron said there was no need for a new summit building and expressed disgust that EU officials were wasting money promoting their own ‘grandiose schemes’ rather than tackling Europe’s economic woes. ‘It’s important, whether it’s at the national level or the European level, that politicians aren’t sitting in some gilded cage,’ he added.","Banks will be told to hold on to more of their profits to prepare for shocks ahead .

Masked intruder John Bennell, 27, died from the wounds to the chest he received after he and three others entered the house in Salford, Greater Manchester. Homeowner Peter Flanagan, 59, was arrested on suspicion of murder but has been freed pending further inquiries. Wrong house? Peter Flanagan's home in Salford where raider John Bennell was stabbed. Police believe he may have meant to burgle a bingo winner's house . The incident occurred just days after David Cameron promised stronger support for people protecting their property from burglars. Detectives are puzzled over why a gang would target the engineer’s modest £120,000 home, which he shared with son Neil, 27, who was also questioned after Wednesday night’s raid. One line of inquiry is that the gang had set their sights on a jackpot winner they believed lived in the area - but burst into the wrong address. Mr Bennell, who was left to die nearby after being dragged from the house and then abandoned by accomplices, was on bail for burglary following a theft in Tamworth, Staffordshire. It is understood that in that raid the home of a professional gambler was targeted. Questioned: Neil Flanagan, Mr Flanagan's son, was quizzed by police . Death scene: The police tent marks the spot where Bennell died last Wednesday . The Salford bingo winner, who asked not to be named, said: ""The police have spoken to me. They have said not to worry but I'm still a bit scared. “People have suggested it might have been my address but I can hardly believe it."" Police sources confirmed they were now investigating if the competition winner's house was the intended target of the raid. The dead man's estranged father, Garry Bennell, from Denton, has spoken out to apologise for his son's actions. The dead man's estranged father, Garry Bennell has spoken out to apologise for his son's actions. He said: 'I know that things can get out of hand but you're entitled to protect your property' The golf club captain said: ‘I know that things can get out of hand but you’re entitled to protect your property.’ Asked what he would have done if an intruder had broken into his home, Mr Bennell said: ‘I would hope to have the guts to protect my property. ‘Obviously he’s dead, we wouldn’t want to kill anybody. He’s my son.’ Asked how his wife, Diane, 56, felt about the situation, Mr Bennell said: ‘She’s gutted. At the end of the day, it’s her son. Whatever happened in the past between us, he was still our child.’ Mr Flanagan, a grandfather and father-of-three, remains a murder suspect after being released on police bail until July 25. Neil Flanagan’s 21-year-old girlfriend, who was staying the night, is believed to have dialled 999 to report the break-in just before midnight on Wednesday. Family members have refused to speak about the case. A 23-year-old man, from Hyde, was being held today on suspicion of aggravated burglary  after last night handing himself at Ashton-under-Lyne police station, where he was arrested. The man remains in police custody where he is being interviewed by detectives, police said. A 30-year-old man suspected of being one of the gang was released without charge on Saturday.","John Bennell had burgled home of professional gambler a month earlier .

The ten-tonne ATV Johannes Kepler ferry - otherwise known as ATV-2 - burned up on re-entry in a controlled dive over the South Pacific. It had taken 1.3tonnes of rubbish from the International Space Station after spending almost four months docked in orbit. Self-destruction: An artist's impression of the ATV Johannes Kepler ferry burning up on re-entry in a controlled dive over the South Pacific last night . Only a few hardy pieces of the craft survived and splashed into the uninhabited ocean at around 21.00 GMT. The area's air and sea traffic were warned in advance and a no-fly zone was erected to prevent any accidents. ATV-2 ad delivered about seven tonnes of much-needed supplies to the ISS, including 1170kg of dry cargo, 100kg of oxygen, 851kg of propellants to replenish the station tanks, and 4535kg of fuel for the ferry itself to boost the outpost’s altitude and make other adjustments. During the hectic mission, two Nasa space shuttles and Japan’s HTV cargo carrier visited the station, along with two Progress and Soyuz spacecraft. These required several changes of station altitude, mostly controlled by the ATV’s thrusters. ATV-2’s last important task was to give the station’s orbit a big boost. One important sequence was performed on 12 June, another on 15 June and the last one on Friday. The combined effect of these manoeuvres was to raise the station’s orbit to around 235 miles. Mid-mission: ATV-2 docked at the International Space Station, where it stayed for four months . ATV-2 had taken 1.3tonnes of rubbish from the ISS. It had delivered seven tonnes of much-needed supplies to the orbiting outpost . The craft had undocked from the ISS on Monday afternoon, when its thrusters gently increased the distance from the outpost. On Tuesday afternoon, the ATV fired its engines twice to descend from orbit. The first burn dropped it towards Earth while the second directed it precisely towards its Pacific target. Hitting the upper atmosphere, the vehicle tumbled, disintegrated and burned. The remains  struck the ocean at around 21.00 GMT. Confident: Mission directors Kris Capelle (left) and Mike Steinkopf photographed just before ATV-2 burned up on re-entry . Some aspects of a controlled destructive entry are still not well known, so ATV-2’s last moments will be recorded by a prototype ‘black box’. The Re-entry Break-up Recorder gathered measurements on the location, temperature, pressure and altitude of the vehicle’s break-up before ejecting. Once it reached an altitude of about 11miles, it transmitted the information via the Iridium sat-phone system. With this last phone call home, Johannes Kepler - dubbed 'Johannes Kepler' in honour of the visionary 17th . century German astronomer and mathematician - would have been productive right to the very end of a fruitful mission.","The ATV Johannes Kepler ferry burned up on re-entry in a controlled dive .

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 10:43 AM on 23rd June 2011 . Families will be nearly £900 worse off this year after the biggest squeeze on living standards since the 1870s. Soaring energy, food and petrol prices have massively outpaced increases in household incomes over the past year. Roger Bootle, a leading economist and former Government adviser, says inflation is likely to go above 5 per cent – well ahead of the 2.8 per cent growth in incomes. Roger Bootle, a leading economist and former Government adviser, said the last time earnings had risen less than prices for four years in a row was the 1870s . The resulting gap would see the disposable income of the average household fall by £858 this year. ‘Increases in areas like energy, food and petrol are having a really dramatic impact on household budgets,’ said Mr Bootle.  ‘The increase in the cost of energy means inflation is likely to reach a higher peak than previously forecast. I don’t think we will see a return to growth in disposable incomes until the end of 2012.’ The adviser to Deloittes believes the official CPI measure of inflation could climb to 5.5 per cent this year. In May it was 4.5 per cent.He said the decision by Scottish Power to increase its gas tariff by 19 per cent and electricity tariff by 10 per cent will make the situation worse because it will probably be copied by rivals. A report shows that households have been suffering since at least 2006. A loaf of bread costs 50 per cent more than it did five years ago . He said the last time earnings had risen less than prices for four years in a row was the 1870s. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has already suggested the squeeze is the worst since the 1920s. A report yesterday shows that households have been suffering since at least 2006. While salaries are up by 13 per cent on that year, a basket of staple foods costs 40 per cent more and gas and electricity tariffs have leapt by 76 per cent. Diesel is 45.8 per cent more expensive, car insurance 74.7 per cent and council tax 18.5 per cent. The basic state pension has risen by 20 per cent in the same period, according to the Office of National Statistics figures. Incomes have been decimated by rises in VAT and national insurance and cuts in benefits and tax credits. The ONS data shows a loaf of bread costs 50 per cent more than it did five years ago, while butter is up 57.7 per cent and milk 33 per cent. Crop-ravaging droughts across Britain and Europe are likely to make food even more expensive. And the fall in the value of the pound means imported food and other products are more expensive in the shops. Analysts at Ernst & Young say the fall in disposable incomes – the money left after tax and paying essential bills – over the past three years is ‘unprecedented’. Holidays, home improvements, eating out and going to the cinema are now considered luxuries or avoided altogether. Households are spending less on food and clothing and the elderly in particular are turning down thermostats and limiting which rooms are kept warm. Low mortgage rates are protecting some families against a financial meltdown. Families with a £150,000 loan on a two-year fixed rate deal are paying around £330 a month less than they would have five years ago. However, some City analysts are calling for rate rises despite the fact this would push many households into the red. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic advisor to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club, said: ‘The squeeze on household budgets is only going to intensify this year, as the gap between high inflation and subdued wage growth continues to widen.’ Richard Lloyd of consumer group Which? said: ‘Yet more price hikes are on the horizon, and there’s a limit to how much people can cut their spending on essentials.’","A basket of staple foods costs 40 per cent more .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 3:26 AM on 2nd September 2011 . A judge has sensationally declared a mistrial in the long-running case of a teenager accused of murdering his gay classmate at their high school. Jurors could not reach a unanimous decision on the degree on the guilt of Brandon McInerney, now 17, for killing Larry King, 15, three years ago. The nine-woman, three-man panel unsuccessfully deliberated for a week over Larry’s death at a school in Ventura County, California. Mistrial: Jurors could not reach a unanimous decision on the degree on the guilt of Brandon McInerney, now 17, left, for killing Larry King, 15, right, three years ago . Jurors took votes with the last one being seven for voluntary manslaughter, while five for either first-degree or second-degree murder. Prosecutors must decide whether to re-file murder and hate crime charges against McInerney - aged 14 at the time but tried as an adult. Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles Campbell declared the mistral. Larry's family would not comment as they left the court. Both sides agreed McInerney took a .22-caliber handgun to school in February 2008 and shot Larry twice in the back of the head. It happened during a computer lab class in front of stunned classmates. McInerney embraced a white supremacist philosophy that sees homosexuality as an abomination, Maeve Fox, prosecuting, said. Anger: The shooting roiled gay-rights advocates and parents in Oxnard, a city about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, California . Police found Nazi-inspired drawings and artefacts at his house - and a white supremacist expert testified his ideology was behind the killing. The attack was premeditated and at least . six people heard him make threats against Larry in the days leading to . the shooting, Ms Fox said. ‘He's basically confessed to first-degree murder in this case' Maeve Fox, prosecuting . She said McInerney told a psychologist he wanted to kill Larry after he passed McInerney in a school hallway and said: ‘What's up, baby?’ ‘He's basically confessed to first-degree murder in this case,’ Ms Fox said. Defense lawyers admitted he was the shooter but reached an emotional breaking point after Larry made repeated unwanted sexual advances. McInerney snapped when he heard moments before the shooting that Larry wanted to change his name to Latisha, the lawyers said. Liberal: The shooting took place in 2008 at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, California, in front of shocked students in a computer lab class . The defense psychologist said McInerney was acting without thinking when he pulled the trigger at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard. McInerney's lawyers also said he suffered physical abuse at home from his father, who has since died. 'He is guilty and he should be held . responsible, but he is not a murderer. He is not a white supremacist. He is a 14-year-old child who didn't know what to do and had no one to guide him' Scott Wippert, defending . They contended he didn't receive the proper supervision that would have kept him out of trouble. ‘He is guilty and he should be held . responsible, but he is not a murderer,’ Scott Wippert, defending, said. ‘He is not a white supremacist.’ ‘He is a 14-year-old child who didn't know what to do and had no one to guide him.’ McInerney did not take the stand during the nine-week trial. The school administration was accused of being more concerned about defending Larry’s civil rights than recognising his behaviour and clothes. The shooting roiled gay-rights advocates and parents in Oxnard, a city about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. They wondered why school officials hadn't done more to stop the harassment against Larry by students, including McInerney. His high heels, makeup and feminine clothing made other students uncomfortable. The case laboured in the court system for more than three years as McInerney's lawyers sought numerous delays. Judge Campbell was eventually persuaded to move the trial from Ventura County to neighbouring Los Angeles County. Extensive news coverage had threatened to bias jurors. Larry'S family sued the school district for failing to protect their son - and that lawsuit is pending.","Brandon McInerney shot Larry King, 15, in California .

Republican primary voters have sent a big message to their presidential candidates - they want Rick Perry, but Sarah Palin can forget running. Former Texas governor Mr Perry has moved into the lead with the backing of 26 per cent of GOP primary voters, according to a Fox News poll. But 74 per cent of voters think former Alaska governor Mrs Palin should stay out of the race to take on President Barack Obama in 2012. Candidates: Rick Perry, left, has the backing of 26 per cent of GOP primary voters - but 74 per cent of voters think Sarah Palin, right, should stay out of the race . Mr Perry has gained 13 points in three weeks to grab first place ahead of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is on 18 per cent. Mrs Palin and Texas Rep. Ron Paul are on eight and seven per cent, while Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann is down at only four per cent. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, ex-Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and businessman Herman Cain are also all at four per cent. But between announced runners, Mr Perry gets 29 per cent, Mr Romney receives 22 per cent and Mr Paul and Mrs Bachmann have eight per cent. Struggling: Minnesota's Michele Bachmann is down at only four per cent, below four other candidates running for the Republican presidential nomination . Mr Romney and Mrs Bachmann have lost much support since the last Fox News poll, taken before Mr Perry had announced he would run. Rick Perry - 26 per cent . Mitt Romney - 18 per cent . Sarah Palin - 8 per cent . Ron Paul - 7 per cent . Mrs Bachmann tops the ‘too extreme to be seriously considered’ among all voters with 18 per cent, followed by Mr Perry at 14 per cent. Meanwhile just 20 per cent of voters say Mrs Palin should run for President, in a clear signal that she should stay out of the race.

"By . David Williams . Last updated at 2:10 AM on 21st June 2011 . Thousands of chanting demonstrators took to Syria’s streets yesterday denouncing beleaguered President Bashar al-Assad’s latest bit to stop the protests tearing his country apart. In a televised address, he promised his regime would consider political reforms by the end of the year but gave no sign that he would step down – the key demand of a nationwide protest that has seen 1,300 killed in a brutal crackdown by security forces. Instead of reaching out to the protestors, he blamed the anti-government demonstrations on a small group of 'saboteurs' that was exploiting popular grievances. Address: Syrian President Bashar Assad makes a rare televised speech as he seeks to calms tensions . 'Vandalism, not reform': Syria's President Assad hit out at 'saboteurs' are trying to exploit legitimate demands for reform . 'What is happening has nothing to do . with reform. It has to do with vandalism,' Assad told supporters at . Damascus University, where he stood before red, white and black Syrian . flags. 'There can be no development without stability, and no reform . through vandalism.' Within hours, protestors were back on the streets braving security forces to give their defiant and clear answer. In Irbin, a suburb of the Syrian . capital Damascus, 300 demonstrators chanted : 'No to dialogue with . murderers,' while in the Sunni Sleibeh and Raml al-Filistini districts . of the coastal city of Latakia, where several Sunni neighbourhoods have . been surrounded by troops and armour for weeks, protesters chanted . 'liar, liar'. Assad’s speech came hours after Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that the leader must implement reforms or 'step aside.' 'The United Kingdom looks to him,' Mr . Hague said, 'to respond to legitimate grievances, to release prisoners . of conscience, to open up access to the internet and freedom of the . media.' He called on Turkey, which has . provided shelter to some 10,000 refugees fleeing the crackdown, to put . pressure on the Assad regime that they are losing legitimacy. Assad’s 70-minute, TV address was . only his third public speech since the pro-democracy uprising began in . March, inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. Much of his . message was not new, including his claim that the unrest is being driven . by armed thugs and foreign conspirators. Despite saying that he would consider . ending his Baath Party’s monopoly on power, the opposition immediately . dismissed the speech, saying it lacked any clear move toward democracy. Protest: Syrians wave national flags as they take to the streets to demonstrate after the President's address . Walid Al-Bunni, of the Syrian . Opposition, said : 'It was a very disappointing speech. The regime has . no realisation that this is a mass street movement demanding freedom and . dignity. Assad has not said anything to satisfy the families of the . 1,400 martyrs or the national aspiration of the Syrian people for the . country to become a democracy.' Mulhem Drubi, leader of the Muslim . Brotherhood, dismissed it.  'A theoretical speech as always,' he said, . 'He repeated old promises that do not offer a solution and are not . implemented on the ground. He kept on saying Syria was subject to a . conspiracies that he likened to germs. He has been giving promises since . day one. The street will continue its march toward freedom. 'He promised to hold the killers . accountable. But the killers are his relatives and clique. First among . them is his brother Maher, then the rest of the security apparatus.' One activist in Latakia said: 'People . were still hoping he would say something meaningful that would result . in tanks and troops leaving the streets. They were disappointed and . started going out as soon as Assad finished talking,' Fleeing: Refugee camps have sprung up in Turkey following prolonged civil unrest in Syria . Innocent victims: Syrian children climb the fence that surrounds their refugee camp during a spontaneous protest against President Assad . Supporters of President Bashar Assad march in Damascus after after he delivered a speech . Protests spread to other Syrian . cities and in Hama, scene of a 1982 attack to crush an uprising led by . the Muslim Brotherhood that killed thousands of civilians during the . rule of Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad, protesters chanted 'damn your . soul, Hafez'. Demonstrations also took place in the . eastern city of Albu Kamal on the border with Iraq, the southern city . of Deraa and other towns in the Hauran Plain, cradle of the uprising, . now in its fourth month, and at the campus of Aleppo University, . activists said. Clearly intent on riding out the . storm of protests, Assad, 45, who inherited power in 2000 after his . father’s death, has made a series of overtures to try to ease the . growing outrage, lifting the decades-old emergency laws that give the . regime a free hand to arrest people without charge and granting Syrian . nationality to thousands of Kurds, a long-ostracized minority. He warned that the country’s economy . will take a beating unless the unrest ends - a message aimed at his . supporters in the business community and prosperous merchant classes. 'The most dangerous thing we face in the coming period is the weakness or the collapse of the Syrian economy,' he said. 'We want the people to back to reforms but we must isolate true reformers from saboteurs,' he said.

"By . Amy Oliver . Last updated at 9:53 AM on 1st July 2011 . Glen Beck drew his last breath tonight...on his television show at least. The Fox News host filed his last ever show with a series of bizarre rants that repeatedly returned to the reason why he had decided to call time on the programme after two-and-a-half years. He promised a so-called cynical media . that he would be back adding 'you will pray for the time when I was only . on the air for one hour a day.' Beck bows out: Fox News host Glenn Beck filled his last ever TV show with bizarre ramblings about what he was planning to do next . Beck went on to reveal his plans in a live Q and A after the show online. From September Beck will broadcast a two-hour daily show on his GBTV internet network. He is also launching a charity programme called Mercury One, the name of which he revealed during his live TV show. Mercury One will be a 'humanitarian' project that will gather people to help others in disasters and tragedies, Beck explained. 'It will be part of a rapid response team everywhere in America, in every town...everywhere,' he added. Legacy: Beck said he and his audience must have 'faith, hope and charity' going forward . He is even planning a clothing line called 1791, the same date the U.S. Bill of Rights was ratified. 'It's not about GBTV, it's about . saving the world,' Beck said before setting out a challenge for people . to sign up as 'peace ambassadors.' 'It's 828, . it's' Restoring Courage.' During his hour-long last show, Beck said he was heading to Israel in search of 'courage.' 'What makes . people live in Israel? he asked. 'It 's a ticking time bomb. How do I get some of . that courage? I begin my search after this programme.' The infamous chalk boards: CNN may have graphics, but Fox has chalkboards, Beck told his audience . The show, broadcast live, kicked off with Beck reliving the last two-and-a-half years with a montage of best bits. Before that he had taken the cameras back stage to see where the props for the show were kept or 'magnet alley' as he called it. Floor to ceiling shelves groaned . under the weight of aids the Fox host had used over the years to express . certain metaphors. Quiet what a chainsaw was doing there was anyone's . guess. Looking back: Beck admitted he'd done many things in order to 'hack the left off' as he went over his best bits . There was also cases and cases of chalk for writing on the infamous chalkboards of the show. Beck later joked that 'CNN use graphics, we use chalkboards,' adding that he always felt as though he had chalk on his trousers. There was some speculation Beck may cry. He didn't but there were many emotional moments - genuine and hammed. 'I've met amazing friends' on this show, he said. 'Namely you.' Beck then went on to talk about all the 'amazing' things the Glen Beck Show has taught the people of America. End of an era: The blinds go up and the set is dismantled as Beck says a final farewell to his audience . Should the topics have slipped anyone's memory, they were all handily written up on a chalkboard titled: 'Things we've learned.' 'How many people knew about the great depression of 1920' before the show? Asked Beck. 'We showed you.' 'We are the same, me and you,' he continued before adding: 'I may be able to figure out some things little faster than you.' He's . well known for going on a bit but in tonight's show Beck actually . celebrated his 'staggeringly long monologues' saying that a 21 minute . stint was normal for the show now. He even took on Jon Stewart, berating him for having 'so many writers' for 'just six minutes' worth of material. He then brought in his show's writers, all two of them. They shuffled about and looked at the floor for a bit before the show went to a commercial break. Beck, teasing the audience, kept suggesting he would reveal the real reason why he was leaving 'next,' but never quite made it. 'There were people who said I was fired,' Beck said in a booming voice before going on to suggest if he had been sacked he wouldn't be in the midst of a live broadcast. Many asked if he was negotiating his contract Beck added, even his agent. But in the end Beck said he was standing in his New York City apartment looking at the skyline after 'hanging out with Bono' backstage after watching Spiderman: Turn off the Dark musical, currently on Broadway, and thought: 'If you don't leave now, you will not leave with your soul. 'Never want anything too much,' he said. 'It will destroy you.' Beck ended the show saying he was 'determined to fix this country one family, one entrepreneur at a time,' with his new project 'Mercury one.' He failed to say what that was exactly, but left the audience in no doubt that he'd be back soon.","Beck also launches charity programme Mercury One .

The Washington Post in the U.S. and the Economist newspaper in Britain both argued that explorations into space peaked a long time ago and were unlikely to ever increase. However, this debate was not on the mind of Commander Christopher Ferguson and his . crew. At the weekend they were given the small American flags as launch director Mike Leinbach . greeted them on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape . Canaveral, Florida, on their arrival from their training base in Houston. Commander Ferguson, a retired Navy captain, told the photographers and journalists swarming on the runway: 'This is a day that's decidedly American, a day where we kind of reflect on our independence and all the wonderful things that we really have as a part of being United States of America. ‘It's wonderful that you've all came out to join us.' Altogether, about 2,500 members of the news media have requested credentials to cover the launch. Estimates of the crowd at the launch on Friday have also risen. Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel said between 750,000 and one million people are expected to witness the end of shuttle history. Preparing for launch: Commander Chris Ferguson climbs out of his T-38 aircraft after arriving at Kennedy Space Center from the astronauts' training base in Houston, Texas . Lift-off of the shuttle, manned by a minimal crew of four astronauts, is set for 11.26am (4.26pm GMT) on Friday . That is considerably more than the number who turned up for Discovery's last lift-off in February and Endeavour's in May. Commander Ferguson said the four-man crew - there are usually six on a shuttle - have a very busy  12-day flight ahead. Atlantis will make a supply run to the International Space Station, before joining Discovery and Endeavour in retirement. ‘When it's all over... we'll be very proud to put the right-hand bookend on the space shuttle programme,’ he said. Co-pilot Douglas Hurley said: 'We're so very proud to be here sharing our nation's birthday with you all and the folks here at Kennedy, and we just want to honour the entire Kennedy team that has worked on these magnificent machines over the last 30-plus years.’ Nasa hasn't launched a shuttle with so few astronauts since 1983. The reduction is because there are no more . shuttles to retrieve them from the space station in the event of . serious launch damage to Atlantis; the shuttle crew would have to be . rescued by Russia's much smaller Soyuz capsules.

That's at least three to five years away. The . Obama administration wants Nasa to focus on expeditions to an asteroid . and Mars, instead of repeated trips to low-Earth orbit. There's not enough money to do both, shuttle programme manager John Shannon told reporters last week. ‘We're sacrificing the shuttle to enable us to be able to take that next step,’ Mr Shannon said. ‘If we were going to retire the shuttle, this is the time to do it,’ he said, noting that the space station is now completed and in good shape. One more mission: Nasa has approved shuttle Atlantis for a final run to the ISS on July 8 . Despite the overriding significance of this last shuttle flight, astronaut Rex Walheim was delighting in the little things. He said: 'It's . such a pleasure to come down here when you have a rocket on the pad and . it's got your stuff loaded on it.' The . three men - all with military backgrounds - are joined on the crew by . Sandra Magnus, a civilian scientist. Each has flown in space before. The Atlantis flight was added to the shuttle's schedule last year to buy time in case Nasa's newly hired cargo delivery companies have problems getting their spacecraft into orbit. Atlantis will be delivering a year's worth of food, clothing, science equipment and supplies to the International Space Station, a $100billion project shared by 16 nations which circles 220 miles above Earth. Distinguished career: Atlantis sits atop the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft while returning to the Kennedy Space Center after a ten-month refurbishment in 1998 . Debut: Atlantis lifts off from Kennedy Space Center on its first mission in October 1985 . Last Tuesday, the threat of an orbital debris impact interrupted the station's preparations for the visit. Nasa learned that an unidentified piece of space debris was likely to pass close to the station and told the crew to seek shelter in the station's two Russian Soyuz escape capsules. Typically, the station manoeuvres to avoid potential debris impacts, but the notice came just 14 hours before the closest approach, too late to plan and conduct an avoidance manoeuvre. Bill Gerstenmaier, Nasa's space operations chief, said: 'We think it came within about 1,100ft of the space station. It was probably the closest object that's actually come by the space station.' The six crew members divided . into two groups of three and sealed themselves into the Soyuz capsules . about 20 minutes before the object came closest to the station. It . was only the second time in the station's history that crews had to . seek shelter in their 'lifeboats' for an orbital debris threat. The . station's two U.S. crew members are preparing for a spacewalk during . shuttle's Atlantis' eight-day stay, a job normally undertaken by the . visiting astronauts. Long history: Atlantis in orbit, as seen from the Russian Mir space station in June 1995 . Nasa, . however, has been trying to keep the Atlantis crew's training as simple . as possible, as the four shuttle astronauts already are having to do the . work of the six or seven people normally assigned to shuttle flights. Space Exploration . Technologies and Orbital Sciences Corp. are scheduled to begin cargo . deliveries to the station next year. Nasa is hoping commercial companies . will be able to fly astronauts as well, though those spaceships are not . expected to be ready for at least four to five years. Meanwhile, Nasa will pay Russia to fly its astronauts to the station at a cost of more than $50million per person. The space shuttle was sold to America as cheap, safe and reliable. It was none of those. It cost $196billion over 40 years, ended the lives of 14 astronauts and managed to make less than half the flights promised. Nasa's first space shuttle flight was in April 1981. The 135th and final launch is set for Friday. Once Atlantis lands at the end of a 12-day mission, it and the other two remaining shuttles are officially museum pieces - more expensive than any paintings. The total price tag for the programme was more than twice the $90billion Nasa originally calculated. Soon-to-be-retired: Atlantis undocks from the International Space Station in September 2006 . Six years ago, then-Nasa chief Michael Griffin even called the shuttle programme a mistake. But as a mistake it is one that paid off in wildly unexpected ways that weren't about money and reliability. 'The discoveries it enabled, the international co-operation it fostered and the knowledge it gained - often at great human cost - has also contributed in countless, important ways to humanity and our common progress,' former president George Bush Sr said. Mr Bush oversaw the programme's early days as vice-president, a job that has traditionally included supervising Nasa. University of Colorado science policy professor Roger Pielke Jr., who studies shuttle costs and policies, said there are probably other ways the U.S. could have spent several billion dollars a year on a human space programme and gained more. When the shuttle succeeded, it did so in a spectacular way. But its failures were also large and tragic. Seven astronauts died when Challenger exploded about a minute after launch in 1986 and seven more died when Columbia burned up as it returned to Earth in 2003. One out of every 67 flights ended in death - a fatality rate that would make the most ardent daredevil cringe. Based on deaths per million miles travelled, the space shuttle is 138 times riskier than a passenger jet. Former astronaut and past Nasa associate administrator Scott Horowitz said: ‘While the shuttle is the most magnificent engineering feat, its complexity and the naive belief that it would be as safe as an airliner was its Achilles heel.' The concept behind it was based on a three-step space plan, ultimately ending on Mars, said George Mueller, the former top official who is credited as the father of the space shuttle programme. To get to Mars, Nasa needed a space station circling Earth as a jumping-off point. In 1971, President Nixon gave Nasa only the shuttle. It had no place to go. The space station wasn't built until 1998. Budget cuts ordered by the Nixon White House meant that the fuel tank would be jettisoned with each flight and the boosters would fall into the ocean after launch and have to be retrieved and refurbished extensively. The shuttle will likely go down in history as an anomaly of America's space programme.","Shuttle to lift-off from Kennedy Space Center on Friday .

Barack Obama launched a scathing attack on super-rich jet owners yesterday as he desperately looked for a way to deal with the country's spiraling debt. The President focused attention on class differences as he sought to increase taxes for people earning over $250,000 and tackle the Republicans over their plans for the economy. But outraged critics retaliated by pointing out that just running a private jet costs $500,000 a year - far more than a family earning $250,000 could afford. Meanwhile, the average jet costs $5m just to buy. Chided: President Barack Obama attacked Republican lawmakers today . They suggested that Obama's . announcements at a conference on Monday were simply a smokescreen in . order to raise taxes among middle-class families. Republicans and the tea party want to tackle debt by cutting public services while also lowering taxes for the average citizen. Obama said that Democrats had agreed to billions of dollars in budget cuts that would inevitably lose them votes. But he accused Republicans of . refusing to compromise by not agreeing to eliminate tax breaks to owners . of corporate jets and profit-rich oil companies. 'I'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners,' Obama said. The president said Democrats had already shown they were ready to 'take on their sacred cows' by agreeing to big cuts in programs important to the party and its supporters. Republicans must be too, he said. 'I've said to Republican leaders, . ''You go talk to your constituents and ask them, Are you willing to . compromise your kids' safety so some corporate-jet owner can get a tax . break?'' ' Mocking: In a personal touch Obama used his daughter's Malia and Sasha as examples of good time keeping . Tough: Obama on Wednesday vowed to keep pressure on the Al-Qaeda terror group following the death of Osama bin Laden . Luxury: Private jets coast around $5m and $500,000 a year to run - far more than somebody earning $250,000 could afford . Obama mentioned corporate jets three more times before moving on. But he provoked anger after it was . pointed out that hundreds of wealthy Democrat donors - who Obama has . rewarded with cushy jobs in government - fly on corporate jets. Commentators also highlighted the amount of private trips Obama takes on private jets when going for family holidays. For the third consecutive year Obama is planning to return to Martha's Vineyard for vacation this summer, according to a White House official. The Obamas are scheduled to spend seven to 10 days on the island in the Cape Cod in New England in mid- to late August, according to the official. Arrangements for White House staff members and Secret Service personnel who travel with the Obamas have been made. Obama has began focusing on the economy after repeated warnings from financial organisations and appalling poll ratings. The Treasury Department says it must be able to borrow more money by August 2 or the U.S. faces an unprecedented default on its mounting $14.3 trillion debt, predicted to grow by $1.4 trillion by the end of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. One rule for them...The Obamas will fly in their private jet to the holiday island of Martha's Vineyard this summer for the third consecutive time . Obama, facing a re-election bid in November 2012, has watched his poll numbers languish below 50 percent approval, primarily because of the sluggish economic recovery after the Great Recession. Critics point out that Obama simply lacks the strength to take on the federal reserve and big businesses that are pulling government strings on the economy. With the coming election fight . clearly in mind, he openly attacked Republicans for holding to what he . called an 'unsustainable' position. Regardless, the opposition party . says it will not vote to raise the debt limit unless Democrats agree - . without any taxes increases - to $2 trillion in cuts to government . spending over 10 years. Obama's aggressive response came with . the country souring on the recovery, the Republican presidential . contenders taking aim at his economic record and opposition leaders in . Congress challenging him to show more leadership in the debt stalks. His re-election hinges on the economy, and Obama is trying to restore a sense of public confidence.Obama has faced such countdowns before. A generic Republican candidate would beat Obama if the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 were hole now, polls have revealed. The Republicans have been ahead for the last five weeks but they currently have the biggest lead between the candidates.A republican candidate currently has support from 46 per cent of voters, according to the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. The president picks up just 42 per cent of the vote while three per cent of people prefer some other candidate.Nine per cent are currently undecided. Both parties will be looking to target this group of voters.The unnamed Republican candidate was winning by 45 per cent to 43 per cent last week. A more accurate indication of the outcome of the elections will come from the polls when the Republicans nominate their presidential candidate. Republicans also hold a seven-point lead over Democrats on the Generic Congressional Ballot for the week ending Sunday, June 26. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney leads the race for the Republican nomination but Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann is in second place following the GOP debate on June 13. She accused Obama of failing black and Hispanic communities. He . and Congress avoided a government shutdown earlier this year at the . last possible moment. And they cut a deal on taxes in December, days . before a tax increase would have automatically kicked in. Facing . what most economists predict would be a catastrophic outcome if the . U.S. cannot pay its bills, Obama took his message to the American . people. Polls show a majority of voters broadly support higher taxes for . wealthy Americans and Big Oil. The comments came as Obama scolded . congressional lawmakers while urging them to forego their July 4 . vacations and focus on solving the nation’s debt crisis. Using . his own daughters' study habits as examples, the impatient president . said no more time should be wasted in trying to get a deal in place. ‘If . by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial progress, then I . think members of Congress need to understand, we are going to, you know, . start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done,’ the . President warned. ‘They're in one week, they're out one week and then they're saying, “Obama's got to step in,’ he added. ‘You need to be here. I've been here. I've been doing Afghanistan and Bin Laden ... Greek crisis. You stay . here. Let's get it done.’ In . a personal touch to his lecture to the lawmakers who were preparing for . a long recess at the end of the week, Mr Obama insisted the . procrastinating should stop. ‘Malia and Sasha generally finish their homework a day ahead of time,’ he said, adding, ‘Malia's 13, Sasha's 10. They don't wait until the night before. They're not pulling all-nighters. ‘Congress can do the same thing. If you know you've got to do something, just do it,’ he added. Mr . Obama’s vacation postponement demand was supported by Tea Party . favourite Senator Rand Paul, who agreed that lawmakers should remain at . their desks until they have hammered out an agreement. The testy president repeated his demand to reduce America’s federal debt by eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy, and called on Congress not to sabotage middle-class priorities such as education and Medicare. ‘The tax cuts I'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners,’ he said. With members of Congress still bickering in a debate to try and reach agreement to raise the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit by the August 2 deadline, Mr Obama said failure was not an option. ‘The consequences for the US economy will be significant and unpredictable. We don't know how capital markets will react,’ he said at a White House press conference this morning. The president said he is 'not engaging in scare tactics,’ But he added: ‘These are bills that Congress ran up. The money's been spent. The obligations have been made. If his bid to get a higher debt limit fails, Mr Obama said tough decisions would have to be made to decide ‘which bills are we going to decide to pay.’ He claimed that if Chinese investors must be paid to avoid default, it could mean not paying Social Security or disabled veterans.","President looking to tax middle-class families .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 6:45 PM on 1st September 2011 . Venus Williams has pulled out of the U.S. Open after revealing she is suffering from Sjogren's syndrome - an auto-immune disease which affects production of tears and saliva and causes joint pain. The seven-time Grand Slam winner had cruised through her first round match in New York on Monday but dramatically withdrew from the tournament yesterday after revealing she had been diagnosed with the condition. Williams, 31 - who had previously cited a virus in withdrawing from hard court tournaments before the U.S. Open - had been due to face 22nd seed Sabine Lisicki in the second round. The seven-time Grand Slam winner had cruised through her first round match in New York on Monday (pictured) but dramatically withdrew from the tournament after revealing she had been diagnosed with the condition . But the two-time U.S. Open champion is now set for an indefinite break from the game after telling how she is suffering from the rheumatic illness. Sjogren's syndrome affects the body's moisture-producing glands, and in severe cases can lead to arthritis and joint pain. The condition is thought to affect as many as 4 million people in the U.S., the vast majority of whom are women. There is currently no known cure for the condition. Sjögren's syndrome was first described in 1933 by Swedish eye specialist Henrik Sjögren (above). The condition causes antibodies to . attack the body's moisture-producing glands, leading to dryness on the . body due to lack of secretion. The illness most commonly affects the . eyes, mouth, salivary glands, lungs, kidneys, skin and nervous system . but all organs of the body can be affected. In rare cases, complications from . Sjogren's syndrome can cause salivary gland infections, kidney problems, . ulcers or pancreatitis. Williams had said after her first round victory over Vesna Dolonts on Monday: 'No one is more in one-match-at-a-time mode than me now at this tournament. It will just be one match at a time, for sure.' The American said yesterday in a statement: 'I'm really disappointed to have to withdraw from this year's US Open. 'I have been recently diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an auto-immune disease which is an ongoing medical condition that affects my energy level and causes fatigue and joint pain. 'I enjoyed playing my first match here and wish I could continue but right now I am unable to. 'I am thankful I finally have a diagnosis and am now focused on getting better and returning to the court soon.' Dr Simon Bowman, spokesperson for Arthritis Research UK, said constantly fighting fatigue caused by Sjogren's Syndrome would affect Venus Williams' training and ability to compete at the top. He said: 'At 31 Venus is relatively young to be diagnosed with this condition, typically affecting women over the age of 40. 'She would need to get the condition under control before she can re-evaluate her career, but there are effective treatments available. 'It is too early to say whether this will be the end of her career and whether she is likely to compete at such a high level of tennis again, as constantly fighting fatigue will have an impact on any training regimes.' The former champion's agent, Carlos Fleming, said: 'All of us came with the full expectation she'd be playing today. She was geared up to play her match. 'I just hope she's OK, and I hope she's healthy and going to be fine.'Despite her previous record at the tournament and Grand Slam titles, . Williams had gone into the U.S Open unseeded after falling to 36th in the world rankings. She reached the semi-finals at the . last year's tournament, but has only played 11 matches since and was . knocked out in the fourth round of Wimbledon this summer. Venus's sister Serena, herself a 13-time Grand Slam winner, is scheduled to play her second round match on Thursday. On . Monday, Venus Williams was asked about the illness that caused her to . skip tournaments this summer. She said that night that her ailment had . been diagnosed, but wouldn't say what it was. Williams . had said: 'It was just energy-sucking, and I just couldn't play pro . tennis. It was disappointing, because I had huge plans for this summer, . of course, to improve my ranking. 'To . miss out on all those points was definitely devastating. Just to miss . so much time off tour was just disheartening. But I'm just really . excited to be back.'","Sjogren's syndrome affects tear and saliva production .

An eBay user has been banned from selling an inch-high war games model . of Hitler on the grounds that it could be seen as Nazi propaganda. Philip Fursman, 38, paints models from war games and sells them around the world on the popular website. In the past he has sold other 'hate' figures including those of Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban without a problem - but when the father-of-three came to sell a tiny model of Hitler worth just £10 eBay removed it. Stunned: Philip Fursman was amazed to receive a warning from eBay after listing a tiny Hitler figurine . And he was 'stunned' to be told that site regulations do not 'permit members to list items . that contain propaganda or memorabilia with Nazi or SS markings.' He also received a warning that if he tried to list similar items in the future they 'may be removed and affect your account negatively"". Mr Fursman, an aerospace programmer from Chard, Somerset, said of the decision, 'I quite agree that Hitler was a horrible individual but if you look at the model there are no SS markings on him. 'If I painted him blue he could be mistaken for Blakey from 'On The Buses. 'There are still lots of Nazi branded products on eBay, and if this is their policy they should apply it more thoroughly. 'And if you are have the good guys you have to have the bad guys too. I . don't think I have been treated fairly."" Mr Fursman bought the Hitler model four years ago from an online shop when his son . Owen, now aged 14, was studying World War II at school. It was made by Bolt Action Miniatures which produced a World War II range of figures including Stalin and Mussolini. He put the model up for sale on eBay on June 13 with a £2 reserve price, and had already received nine bids before eBay removed it six days later with bidding at . £9. eBay told him in an email, 'We know it is frustrating to see items . removed from the website but people are not allowed to list items that . promote or glorify hatred, violence or racial intolerance.' Tiny dictator: The figurine measured just 28mm in height - and was thought to be worth around £10 . Despite . removing Mr Fursman's model from its listings, eBay continues to stock other . memorabilia including three-inch high figures of Hitler and Goering . which are currently available and have attracted bids of up to £115. Mr Fursman's experience is similar to that of David Davidson who was banned from . selling a rare Dad's Army board game on eBay in January 2010 after it breached . their 'offensive material policy'. Mr Davidson, of Droitwich, Worcs.,bought the game - suitable for . children as young as eight - second hand from a car boot sale for just . £1 more than 20 years ago. He decided to sell the game on eBay with a starting price of 99p but . received an email from the online giant telling him they were taking it . off the site because it could 'promote violence, hatred, racial or . religious intolerance'. Removed from sale: But eBay continues to list other similar items of memorabilia . The company even suggested a swastika symbol on the board and on the . front of the box constituted 'memorabilia associated with the Nazi . Party' which breached their offensive material policy. Mr Davidson, who came across the game while clearing out his loft, said at the time, 'Instead of making a few quid and clearing some space, I've been made to look like I'm a racist or Nazi sympathiser. I'm very annoyed.' He accused eBay of vetting content on the site 'without looking into anything properly. They allow coins and stamps with swastikas and there are hundreds of novels which are war stories that have them.

"First Lady is greeted by children dancing in animal hide . Obama family given personal welcome as dancers chant 'Obama Ye-Le-Le' Mrs Obama helped paint a mural . She paid a courtesy call on President Ian Khama . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:20 PM on 24th June 2011 . Michelle Obama was given an especially personal welcome by 25 children when she landed in Botswana today. The excited group, clad in traditional clothing, greeted the First Lady as she arrived on the second leg of a week-long goodwill visit to Africa after flying in from Cape Town, South Africa. The youngsters, aged between six and 18, wore costumes of animal hide with shells around their ankles, as they clapped and danced, singing 'Obama Ye-Le-Le'. Warm welcome: Michelle Obama with daughters Sasha, far right, and Malia, right, were greeted by traditional dancers as they arrive in Gaborone, Botswana . That's a new way to say hello: The First Lady looks delighted at the performance, which began when she arrived in Botswana . Side-splitting: The dancers put on a special performance and chanted 'Obama Ye-Le-Le' Another 50 children waved U.S. and Botswana flags to welcome Mrs Obama, who looked delighted while she clapped along to the performers. Her first stop upon arrival was at the clinic in the capital of Gaborone that is sponsored by Baylor University. The clinic serves 4,000 children and their families. The First Lady helped paint a mural at the Botswana-Baylor Adolescent Center of Excellence, a new facility under construction. Mrs Obama's daughters Malia and Sasha, her mother Marian Robinson, and her niece and nephew joined in the painting. She . painted a sun on a scene of children playing against a backdrop of . homes and blue sky with members of the 'Teen Club.' The center is . affiliated with Baylor University's Pediatric AIDS initiative. Smiles all round: Everyone looked thrilled to meet the First Lady, who has been promoting good health in southern Africa . Giving out hugs: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama was greeted by excited children when she arrived and made their day by chatting to them . The mother-of-two was hesitant to leave as she had not had time to blend the paint on her portion of the mural. The Teen Clubs are a support program for HIV infected children and teens affected by the virus. Some of them have lost their parents to the disease. The first lady then spoke at a . women's leadership luncheon, where she called Botswana 'a thriving . democracy' with a fast-growing economy that embodies 'a vision of Africa . on the move.' She also paid a courtesy call on . President Ian Khama and tonight the Obama family will have dinner at a . nature park that is home to giraffes, elephants, zebras, baboons and . other animals. The . first lady's mission began last Monday in South Africa and is her first . overseas visit without President Obama. She is due to return Monday to . the White House. At a . forum at the University of Cape Town yesterday, a young student asked Mrs. Obama: 'Do you still feel pressure being the . first African American first lady?' Time out: An attentive Mrs Obama made sure she spoke to school children who had come to see her . At first Obama didn't catch the question. 'Do I feel --' she prompted back. 'The pressure,' the student responded. 'Pressure, oh, the pressure. I thought you said the 'pleasure',' Obama said, to laughter. 'I don't know if I feel pressure. But I feel deep, deep responsibility. So I guess in a sense there is pressure, because I don't want to let . people down.' The attentive, youthful audience did not appear the least bit let down. 'I didn't necessarily run for office. I was actually trying to talk my . husband out of running for office,' she continued, again to laughter. 'But now that we're here, I want to be good because this is a big job, . and it's a big, bright light. And you don't want to waste it.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:17 PM on 29th June 2011 . Blood glucose test: Type 1 diabetics using insulin check their blood sugar levels before every meal. Type 2 diabetics tend to test themselves several times a week . Hundreds of thousands of younger people with diabetes are facing severe complications and could require 'substantial' hospital care in the future, according to an NHS report. The world's biggest audit of diabetes found that youngsters and those in their 20s, 30s and 40s are at dangerously high risk of serious problems, including kidney failure and stroke. Diabetics under 54 are less likely . than those aged 55 to 69 to receive all the basic health checks needed . to keep their condition under control, it found. Another . report from campaigning charity Diabetes UK estimates that 10 per cent . of the NHS budget is spent treating the disease and its complications, . which is equivalent to £1m an hour. The latest audit found there are big variations in the types of treatments offered by hospitals . and the prevalence of complications according to social group. Some . 2.5 million people in the UK are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, which . is linked to obesity and unhealthy lifestyles, and up to a million more . are thought to have the condition without knowing it. A further 300,000 people have Type 1 diabetes, which usually develops in childhood, but both forms of diabetes are on the rise. Today's audit said a ""large cohort"" of a whole generation of people with diabetes are expected to require substantial hospital care in the future. The form of diabetes that blights the lives of millions of middle-aged Britons could be wiped out by cutting calories severely for just two months, research suggests. After a small-scale trial, diabetics who consumed just 600 calories a day – the amount many people would eat at lunch alone – were able to throw away their tablets. Eighteen months on, some are still free of type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and usually occurs in middle age. The Newcastle University researchers . described the result as remarkable and said it proves that the condition . that affects 2.5million Britons need not be a life sentence. Dr Iain Frame, of Diabetes UK, which . funded the study, warned that no one should go on such a drastic diet . without speaking to his or her doctor. Almost 300,000 children and under-54s with diabetes have blood sugar levels that are so high they are at high risk of complications. Another 144,000 have dangerously high risk blood sugar levels while, across all age groups, 800,000 are at high or dangerously high risk. Serious complications can occur when blood sugar is not kept under control, including limb amputation and blindness. The National Diabetes Audit 2010 for England and Wales found 42 per cent of those aged 25 to 54 receive the nine basic health checks that should be given by NHS staff, including blood pressure, blood sugar, weight and foot care, compared with 54 per cent of those aged 55 and over. Across all age groups, two-thirds of Type 1 patients and almost half of Type 2 patients do not receive all nine checks. Today's report noted that children and younger adults with diabetes are also far more likely to be obese than those who are older. Nine out of 10 adolescents with Type 2 are overweight or obese - more than any other age group with the condition. Obesity and diabetes can be a deadly combination, putting people at high risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke. Commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), which is funded by the Department of Health, the audit includes data for more than 80% of the people diagnosed with diabetes in England. Bob Young, lead clinician on the audit and clinical lead for the National Diabetes Information Service, said: 'These results ring alarm bells. 'They show that younger people make up a quarter of all those with diabetes yet have the highest risks of potentially preventable complications. 'If these risks could be reduced, much future disability and shortened life expectancy could be prevented.' Rowan Hillson, national clinical director for diabetes, said there was 'no excuse for not doing the basics well'. 'I am very concerned that the National Diabetes Audit shows that we still have a long way to go in delivering basic standards of diabetes care for everyone. 'In particular, young and middle-aged people with diabetes are not getting the regular checks they need to manage their condition and improve outcomes. 'These checks are vital to reduce serious but avoidable complications.' Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'This highlights the need for urgent action to ensure that people with diabetes start to receive all the basic care processes, otherwise there will be more amputations, more people going blind and more cases of kidney failure, heart disease and stroke.' Care Services Minister Paul Burstow said: 'Diabetes is one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS today and this report shows that this challenge looks set to increase as more and more people develop diabetes. 'It also highlights unacceptable variations in standards of care for people with diabetes. 'The NHS needs to rise to this challenge. The NHS Health Check programme will help by detecting diabetes sooner, allowing the NHS to provide earlier and better management of the condition through education, care and support. 'Programmes such as Change4Life will help the NHS to work with people to understand the causes of Type 2 diabetes, signposting them to the information they need to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. 'All patients should receive the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) recommended checks without exception. 'Clinical audits such as this are vital in highlighting where this isn't happening so NHS services can be held to account for whether patients are healthy and able to live fulfilling lives.'",NHS spends estimated 10 per cent of budget on treating diabetes and its complications .

The Duchess of Cambridge proved her power as queen of Centre Court today as she convinced Prince William to join in the wave. The Prince was clearly uncomfortable as he raised his arms halfway in unison with the rest of the Wimbledon crowd while a grinning Kate looked proudly on. The couple were on hand to watch their countryman Andy Murray roar to victory against Frenchman Richard Gasquet in straight sets. Murray celebrated victor with an extravagant bow towards Kate and William in the Royal Box. Never mind the royal wave... Kate, Duchess of Cambridge looks expectantly over at her husband as she raises her arms for the Mexican wave on Centre Court . Here's the Mexican one: The second in line to the throne gets in to the spirit of the occasion . Your Majesty: British number one Andy Murray bows to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge following his victory over Richard Gasquet in their fourth round match at Wimbledon . In turn, they gave him their seal of . approval with a pat on the back after the match, won in 100F heat on . court, and told him: 'Well done.' Murray said: 'If I'd known they were . coming, I would have shaved. I was thinking to myself as I came off I . was sweaty and very hairy. I said to them, ""I'm sorry, I'm a bit . sweaty"". But it was very nice to get to meet them.' The bow, he said, was 'just, yeah, . sort of off the cuff. Didn't think too much about it'. He added: 'I was . obviously very happy after the match. I think it was the right thing to . do.' The win earns Murray a quarter-final clash tomorrow with the Spaniard Feliciano Lopez. Happy couple: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sitting in the royal box on Centre Court at Wimbledon . Pretty layering: Kate followed Wimbledon's specification that players must wear white . William and Kate became the surprise . stars of the Royal Box after weeks of speculation that they might attend . before embarking on their tour of Canada tomorrow. Centre Court was crammed to capacity, . which equates to 15,000 bums on seats. But to widespread . disappointment, none, alas, was Pippa Middleton's. For although there were frantic . rumours during the morning that Kate's little sister and former maid of . honour would arrive with the royal party, Pippa-watch was stood down at . 12.31pm when the celebrated rear failed to emerge from the . police-escorted cavalcade. Kate, a huge fan of the game, wore . what looked to be a triple-decker tennis skirt – in fact a £795 Alice . Temperley dress – teamed with LK Bennett nude court shoes. Within half . an hour of her appearance, the frock, reduced to £395 in the summer . sale, had sold out on the designer's website. Unusual detailing: The white disks on Kate's shoulders will remind Wimbledon fans of a less successful recent fashion statement... Bethanie Mattek-Sands' Lady Gaga-esque jacket which was covered in white tennis balls . The royal spectators clapped and . cheered as Murray got to grips with the heat. Later, during Rafael . Nadal's match, they would even join in a Mexican wave. Murray's triumph was followed by despair . from the Williams sisters who made a shock exit from the tournament in . the fourth round. Venus . Williams' attempt to win a sixth Wimbledon title ended in the fourth . round with a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria. The . 23-year-old Pironkova beat Williams at Wimbledon last year by the same . score to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal. She also won their . first-round match at the Australian Open in 2006. Williams' defeat came shortly after younger sister Serena also went out in the . fourth round, losing to Marion Bartoli. It is the first time since 2006 . that neither sister has reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Expert in action: Andy Murray drew in an A-list crowd for his match on Centre Court today . Fan club: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears and his mum, Judy, were watching his progress . Support from afar: Andy Murray's tennis racket bag is covered with tweets from his fans . Kate and William appeared happy and . relaxed as they watched the day's tennis. The Duchess has been a . Wimbledon fan for years - as have all the Middletons. Pippa has attended the French Open . and the Aegon Championships since her big sister's wedding earlier this . year and Kate has visited the championships twice before. In 2007 she attended with a friend to watch Rafael Nadal play Swede Robin Soderling on Court one and in 2008 she visited again. A polite thank you letter Kate wrote . to Wimbledon bosses after her most recent visit is currently on display . at the All England Club. Keen spectator: This is Kate's third time at Wimbledon and her passion for tennis was clear to see from her facial expressions . Fun day out: William and Kate's visit to SW19 is a private affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties . More than 2,000 people queued along the grassy banks outside the club in a bid to secure places  for Murray's match. As the fans waited outside, though, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took up their prime positions on Centre Court. There . they watched a very convincing display by Britain's number one who won . the first set in a tie-break, soon claimed the second too and broke . early in the third set. As well as the young royals, Murray had his slightly more personal fan club in attendance. His pretty girlfriend Kim Sears, and his mother, Judy Murray were sitting side-by-side at his fourth round match. Murray's . support also came from further afar, his tennis racket bag was covered . with tweets from his legion of fans including 'stay positive we are all . behind you' and 'believe in yourself and never give up.' The perfect guest: Kate chatted and joked with Gill Brooke, the wife of the Chairman of the All England Tennis Club, who was sitting by her side . Top tips: Kate leant back to give Jane Henman, Tim's mum, who was sitting behind her, a kiss on the cheek before exchanging a few words with her too . Kate and William's visit to SW19 is a private . affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties. But they both . appeared very contented to chat to the others sitting around them.

As the Royal Box guests arrived today, thousands of sun drenched fans applauded. But the heartiest welcome was reserved for the young couple who were given a standing ovation. The retractable roof was also partially covered to shade the royals' end of the arena.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:36 PM on 23rd June 2011 . Criticised: Tory MP Graham Stuart . Tory MP Graham Stuart has been criticised after contractors working for his local council tarmacked the private road to his luxury home for free. Workers employed by East Riding Council resurfaced 164 feet of a lane not run by the council in Beverley, East Yorkshire, at his wife Anne's request, despite nearby public roads and potholes in need of repair. Taxpayers are angry that the stretch of road on Seven Corners Lane, Beverley, which leads to the MP's home has had preferential treatment over other road works. The stretch of asphalt would have cost £2,500 if Mr Stuart had paid for the job. Contractors . employed by the Conservative East Riding Council had been working on . rectifying continuing road surface problems in Hengate half-a-mile away . when Mrs Stuart approached them and asked if they could surface her lane . with any tarmac that was left over. The new surface leads directly to the Stuarts' recently-built detached four-bedroom house in one of the most exclusive residential areas of the town. However, it does not extend to the other 18 properties further along the lane, which dates back to the Victorian era. Yesterday, Mr Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, issued a statement defending the work. Controversy: MP Graham Stuarts home at Seven Corners Lane, Beverley which has been tarmaced when other roads have pot holes . He said: 'My wife was cycling past Hengatewhile it was being resurfaced. She asked one of the workmen if it would be possible to lay any leftover Tarmac in Seven Corners Lane. 'No payment was asked for, none was offered and none was given. My wife was not given any assurance that spare Tarmac would be used on Seven Corners Lane. 'When my wife returned home later that day she found part of the lane had been resurfaced.' Mr Stuart stressed the work had not only benefited him and his wife, but other residents in his street. He said: 'I understand one resident in Seven Corners Lane has since complained and that is why the contractors are writing to all the residents to see how many would like the new surface left and how many would like it to be pulled up. 'They will, I am sure, abide by the feelings of the majority of residents.' Residents in Beverley said they would have liked to have seen the surfacing used on potholes and pavements. Sean Pashley, a worker at Whittakers shoe repair in Mill Lane, said: 'That is disgusting. Why didn't they fill in a few potholes on public roads? This shouldn't be happening. It is our money.' Resident Pete Wilson, 50, of Beverley, also agreed the work could have been done on a public road. 'This looks pretty bad to me,' he said. 'You need to get all the main roads sorted first. It could certainly have been put to better use.' Freebie: The new surface leads directly to the Stuarts' recently-built detached four-bedroom house but does not extend to the other 18 properties further along the lane . Andrew Allison, East Yorkshire co-ordinator of the TaxPayers Alliance, said he was 'surprised' the work had been sanctioned. He said: 'Even if no money exchanged hands in this case, MPs need to be seen to be above this sort of thing after all the controversy over their expenses. 'Mr Stuart is paid well enough as an MP and he has his own successful business. Surely he should pay for something like this out of his own pocket like the rest of us? 'I would hope he officially declares this as a benefit in kind in the register of members' interests because that is what it is.' The resurfacing work on the gravel-covered lane was carried out by staff from construction firm Galliford Try. In a statement, the company said: 'At the end of a session of resurfacing works in Hengate we were left with the remnants of blacktop material. 'We had made a prior arrangement with a farmer to deposit the material with him. 'On the day, however, we were approached by a resident who asked if we could lay the blacktop down nearby Seven Corners Lane, a rough, un-adopted road on which she lives. 'We agreed to do so since it seemed to be an expedient and environmentally friendly way of dealing with the excess material. The Galliford Try team that carried out this job acted in the right and proper manner. 'The laying of blacktop down Seven Corners Lane was carried out purely out of goodwill and without any money changing hands.' An East Riding Council spokeswoman said: 'This is a private matter between a contractor and a resident and does not concern East Riding Council.' The spokesman for Mr Stuart said he would not be declaring the work as a gift, as he does not own the road.","Graham Stuart’s luxury home in East Yorkshire has 164 ft-long .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:01 PM on 23rd June 2011 . The mother and sister of Milly Dowler broke down in tears today as Levi Bellfield was finally found guilty of murdering the schoolgirl. An Old Bailey jury found him guilty of abducting and murdering the 13-year-old after she walked past the killer's home in March 2002. Bellfield is also facing a charge of attempting to abduct 11-year-old Rachel Cowles the day before he took Milly. No verdict has yet been reached on that charge. Guilty: Levi Bellfield has been found guilty today of murdering schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002 . It took Milly's parents Bob and Sally . nine years to get justice, even though her killer had been living 50 . yards from where she was last seen in Station Avenue, Walton-on-Thames, . Surrey. Police knocked on the door of . Bellfield's flat in Collingwood Place, off Station Avenue, 11 times, but . did not try to contact the letting agent to trace him. Rachel Cowles' mother Diana rang police when a man . in a red car offered her daughter a lift but it was three years until . officers interviewed her. In 2008, he was convicted of murdering two students and the attempted murder of a third. Milly, 13, vanished on March 21, 2002 in Station Avenue, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, while she walked home from school. Court: Gemma Dowler, sister of Milly Dowler, arrives at the at the Old Bailey today followed by Rachel Cowles . Trial: Bellfield sits in the dock staring straight ahead as Milly's father, Robert, wells up during proceedings . Sally Dowler, Milly's mother, breaks down in floods of tears after hearing the verdict . Her remains were found six months . later in a wood at Yateley Heath, Hampshire, 25 miles away, but the . cause of death could not be determined. Bellfield went on to kill again twice before he was arrested by London police two years later. He . moved his family out of Collingwood Place the day after killing Milly . and dumping her body 25 miles away in Yateley Heath wood, Hampshire. Milly's bones were found six months . later by mushroom pickers. She may have been strangled or suffocated, . but it was impossible to say. Bellfield, . a former wheelclamper and bouncer, went on to kill Marsha McDonnell, . 19, Amelie Delagrange, 22, and to attempt to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, . in 2004. All the attacks . took place near bus stops on the borders of London and Surrey. There was . no apparent motive except a hatred of women. Bellfield, 43, was jailed for life for those crimes in February 2008 and was told he would never be released. He is now due to receive another life . term to run alongside the existing jail sentence in Wakefield prison, . where he spends most of the day locked in his cell. Milly's mother and sister Gemma, 25, collapsed in tears after hearing the verdict. The Dowlers join a tragic list of people whose lives have been devastated by the 6ft 1in bully. After years of anguish and heartache, they went to court to seek justice, only to have Bellfield imply that Milly's death was their fault. Grieving: Milly's father Robert, her sister Gemma and mother Sally at Milly's funeral in 2003 . Milly, 13, vanished on March 21, 2002 in Station Avenue, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, while she walked home from school . Happy family: Milly, aged 13, left, with her parents Robert and Sally and sister Gemma, 16 on holiday . They each broke down in the witness . box in the face of suggestions that Milly might have run away or . committed suicide because she was unhappy. For . Mr Dowler, a 59-year-old IT management consultant, there was the added . humiliation of having to admit that he had an interest in bondage sex, . and that police found a ball gag at the family home in Walton Park. Milly had found a porn magazine with contact numbers for women providing kinky sex nine months before her death, and felt let down by Mr Dowler, the court heard. This led to detectives considering him as a suspect - the first of 54 checked out by Surrey Police over the years. Walton on Thames Station where Milly Dowler was last seen alive in 2002 on her way home from school . Evidence: Milly's Nokia 3210 mobile phone was recovered by police after the teenager had been abducted . The school uniform that was worn by Milly Dowler in the months before he was murdered . Bellfield went undetected until his arrest in November 2004 for the murder of Frenchwoman Ms Delagrange. His partner Emma Mills told detectives they had been living near Station Road and moved out suddenly. Bellfield's red Daewoo Nexia car, which was seen turning into Station Road 22 minutes after Milly was last seen, has never been found. As Mrs Dowler was helped from the courtroom, she collapsed. After being carried out by police officers, Gemma, 25, became uncontrollably emotional outside the courtroom and both her and her mother began wailing and shouting 'guilty'.

Google yesterday launched its own social network in an attempt to challenge Facebook with a service that ties together all its existing sites including Gmail.

Taking on Facebook: Some critics believe Google is at risk of losing out to social networking sites as the internet evolves. Google+ aims to address that balance . Circles of friends: The site is seeking to differentiate itself by letting users divide their friends into 'circles' Google+ started rolling out to a limited number of users on Tuesday in what the company is calling a field trial. Only those invited to join will initially be able to use the service. Google did not say when it would be more widely available. The service does not currently feature advertising. To create Google+, the company went . back to the drawing board in the wake of several notable failures, . including Google Wave and Google Buzz, a micro-blogging service whose . launch was marred by privacy snafus. 'We learned a lot in Buzz, and one of . the things we learned is that there's a real market opportunity for a . product that addresses people's concerns around privacy and how their . information is shared,' said Google spokesman Bradley Horowitz.

'They're . going to have an uphill battle due to Facebook's network effects,' said . Maher, citing the 700million users that some research firms say are . currently on Facebook's service. 'The more users they (Facebook) get, the harder it gets for Google to steal those,' he said. But he added that Google's popularity in web search and email could help it gain a following. To set its service apart from . Facebook, Google is betting on what it says is a better approach to . privacy -- a hot-button issue that has burned Facebook, as well as . Google, in the past.

Africa was officially declared Princess Charlene of Monaco today . following her marriage to Prince Albert. Dressed in a sky-blue jacket and . skirt, 33-year-old Charlene Wittstock smiled radiantly as she said ‘I . do’ in a civil ceremony in the Royal Palace throne room of the ancient . Mediterranean principality. Her new husband, 53-year-old Albert, . looked on proudly in a dark suit and grey tie as he put sensational . rumours about his personal life behind him. Centre stage: Princess Charlene of Monaco points skywards as she talks on the microphone in Monte Carlo Harbour alongside new husband Prince Albert and Jean Michel Jarre . Royal knees-up: The Prince tied the know with South African Charlene Wittstock in a civil ceremony yesterday, followed by a concert and fireworks . The French press even compared the . nuptials to Britain’s Royal Wedding – while lamenting the fact that the . Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had sadly had to decline their invitation . to Monte Carlo because they were on an official trip to Canada. Less respectful Gallic commentators . were, meanwhile, suggesting that history’s first Princess Charlene might . not have the same ring to it as Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Miss Wittstock had, in the words of . Le Monde, ‘tried to escape’ last week  – back home to South Africa after . learning that Albert may have fathered a third love child. As the mystery deepened, Albert’s two . love children and their mothers stayed away from today’s 40-minute . ceremony at the Royal Palace. No expense spared: Jean Michel Jarre performs in Monte Carlo Harbour as part of the royal wedding celebrations . Glitter: Hundreds of people watch a huge firework display over the harbour after the civil ceremony . Entertainment: Thousands of people crowd the harbour to watch French musician Jean Michel Jarre, right, perform for the royal couple . Spectacular: There were concerns over the wedding after rumours Prince Albert had fathered another love child . They are also expected to be absent from the Catholic Church ceremony tomorrow. Instead French President Nicolas . Sarkozy is set to join celebrity guests including James Bond star Roger . Moore, former supermodel Naomi Campbell, and veteran fashion designers . Karl Lagerfeld and Giorgio Armani. Princess Charlene today hit out at the rumours her wedding nearly fell apart over rumours of her husband's infidelity. She told vogue.com: 'It is a shame that those rumours came at such a bad time, but I think they were timed to sabotage such a happy occasion. 'They are categorical lies. I won't dignify them with any response other than to say that the photographs of me and Albert in love and getting married will speak louder than any vicious gossip and empty rumours.' Sealed with an awkward kiss: Prince Albert and his bride Princess Charlene kiss on the palace balcony after their civil wedding service in Monaco this evening . Happy couple: The newly-married couple wave to crowds that gathered below the balcony of the royal palace . Sister act: Princess Alexandra of Hanover, Princess Caroline of Hanover, Pauline Ducruet and Princess Stephanie of Monaco enjoy the cheers of the crowds . The former swimmer compared her big day . with competing in the pool and said it was no less challenging than . diving into a freezing cold pool every morning as she trained for the . Olympics. And she talked about her wedding day . outfit, a powder-blue corset, chiffon pleated palazzo pants and a powder . blue jacket decorated with tiny silver and pearl buttons, which she . designed with Karl Lagerfeld. 'It is my creation and I'm proud of it. It's feminine and keeps with tradition yet has a little twist that . reflects my personal style. 'I thought it was a nice change to go . for trousers instead of a skirt, especially since I'm an athlete and . have always kept my clothes clean and simple.' Marriage: Prince Albert of Monaco and Charlene Wittstock are seen on a giant screen outside the palace during the civil ceremony . Scandal: The preparations have been dogged by claims that Prince Albert had fathered a third love child . Prince Albert has two love children - including Alexandre - pictured with his mother Nicole Coste . Organisers of the £55million . celebrations surrounding the wedding – which included a concert by The . Eagles last night – hope that it will rival the 1956 wedding of Albert’s . mother, Hollywood star Grace Kelly, and his father, Prince Rainier. Philippe Narmino, president of . Monaco’s Council of State, officiated today, and confirmed that the . former Miss Wittstock was now officially a Princess. Before the 5pm ceremony, Mr Narmino . said: ‘It’s the event of my life. Me, who as a magistrate, has dealt . with hundreds of divorce dossiers during 27 years, will be marrying a . couple for the first time. Referring to the Paris news magazine . which broke the story about Charlene’s attempted flight, and which still . stands by it, Albert’s lawyer Thierry Lacoste said: ‘I heard everything . about the child – white, black, who has been born, not yet born - it . has to stop, it’s I don’t know what.’ He said: ‘There is no child, it’s a . totally false rumour and absolutely without foundation. It’s easy to do . your job as a journalist – to check that Charlene did not go to the . airport. It’s clearly false, she and the prince were around all last . week.’ In fact a senior detective from . Monaco, who was involved in the later stages of the ‘incident’ at Nice . airport, has confirmed that ‘Charlene had her passport confiscated so . that the Prince’s entourage could persuade her to stay’. Albert already has two children - . six-year-old Alexandre, the son of Nicole Coste, a former Air France air . hostess from Togo, and Jazmin, 19, whose mother is Tamara Rotola, an . American estate agent. Miss Coste was spotted in Monaco . earlier this week, but was said to have been advised to stay away from . the wedding to avoid ‘media exposure’. Mr Lacoste infamously issued fierce denials before DNA tests proved Albert was the father of Alexandre and Tamara. Despite his strong denial this time around, Mr Lacoste confirmed that he was taking no action against L’Express. And Christophe Barbier, editor of . L’Express and a close friend of French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, . said the magazine had no intention of removing the story from its . website, saying: ‘We stand by our information which was supplied by . three different sources.’ Mr Barbier said it was important to . give Charlene’s attempted return home publicity because of the ‘number . of crowned heads and representatives of various states that are expected . at the marriage’. Despite such enthusiastic . predictions, the guest list for the wedding – which had been shrouded in . secrecy until today - revealed that many senior royals who had been . expected to attend were not in fact coming. Miss Wittstock, who was born in . Zimbabwe and moved to South Africa as a child, met Albert during a 2000 . swimming competition in Monaco. He has been an International Olympic . Committee member since 1985 and competed in five Winter Olympics as part . of Monaco's bobsled team. Until . now the name Charlene has been most commonly associated with Charlene . Robinson, Kylie Minogue’s character in the Australian soap opera, . Neighbours.","Catholic Church service  will take place today .

The Governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King has suggested that interest rates would not rise until it was certain the economy was growing and there had been a drop in unemployment. He was giving evidence to MPs at the Treasury Select Committee along with other members of the bank. Sir Mervyn also indicated yesterday that a large cash injection directly into the economy to boost asset prices and spending was possible. Reprieved: Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, told MPs yesterday he was against a rise in interest rates . He said: 'We expect to see relatively weak consumer spending. The fall in house prices has come back a bit, activity is very weak. 'But the number of repossessions is way down from what we saw in the early 1990s. 'The reason we would raise interest rates would be in the context of a much stronger economy, with unemployment falling rather than rising. 'It should also be the case that the interest rates that borrowers face should not rise as fast as the rise in Bank rate.' Divided: Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, raised concerns over freezing interest rates again . Minutes from a meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) earlier this month revealed conflict between members over what plan of action would be best for the struggling economy. Paul Tucker, the Bank's deputy governor, revealed he is close to voting for a rate rise. Mr Tucker, who has been tipped to . succeed Mr King in the top job in 2013, said: 'I'm one of those that is worried . about an upward drift in inflation expectations. 'The longer that inflation remains so . high, and we say it's due to another one-off factor, the more the . people of this country think we use this ''one-off factor'' in a . completely different way.' Mr Tucker, who has voted for unchanged . rates so far, said he was concerned slow growth was eroding supply . capacity, and with it Britain's ability to grow strongly in the future. Interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009, and earlier this year economists had expected a rise. Any prospect of that now looks likely to be left until next year. The development comes as official data showed the biggest fall in households' disposable income in more than 30 years. Gloomy predictions: Senior staff at the Bank of England think the economy will now take longer to recover . They showed savings shrank in the first three months of the year as families struggled to keep up with rising prices. Stagnant wages meant the savings ratio - the money they have left to tuck away after paying bills - fell from 5.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent over the three months to March. At the same time, households - while paying more - are actually buying fewer goods and services. Economy watch: GDP or gross domestic product fell 4.6 per cent in the 1980s recession, by 2.5 per cent in the 1990s . recession and by 6.4 per cent in the so-called Great Recession of 2009 . The amount bought . in those months fell by 0.6 per cent - the largest decline since the . depths of the recession in the spring of 2009, according to the Office . of National Statistics. The ONS revealed the volume of products and services bought has taken its biggest fall since the depths of the Great Recession but the amount spent has risen. House prices saw a further fall during May after all but the top end of the market experienced weaker activity, the Land Registry said. The average cost of a home in England and Wales dropped by 0.4 per cent in May, to bring the average cost down to £161,823 - 2.2 per cent lower than a year ago - according to the latest industry data. Housing activity also slowed sharply, with the number of transactions dropping by 13 per cent to 44,803 in March, the latest figures available, from 51,399 at the same time last year. The May decline was the seventh month out of the past nine that prices have fallen, with the average price now down by 3 per cent from its peak in August. London is the one place bucking the trend, with prices rising by 2.9 per cent over the past 12 months, though over the month the East Midlands also saw prices pick up slightly. The number of properties being sold worth over £1million also surged by 58 per cent from 511 to 805, highlighting the strength of the high end market, a lot of which is based in London. The weakest areas were in the North East, which saw an annual fall of 6.9 per cent, and Wales, where prices fell 3.5 per cent in May alone. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the main support for house prices will come from the fact that interest rates are likely to ‘remain very low for some considerable time to come’. He added: ‘In fact, it is looking ever more likely that the Bank of England will hold off from raising interest rates until 2012.’ The ONS said the rise was 'driven by price increases, rather than the purchase of more goods and services . by households' with prices up 1.9 per cent in the first three months of the year. The amount of goods and services bought . in those months fell by 0.6 per cent - the largest decline since the . depths of the recession in the spring of 2009. The comparison on a year ago was more . pronounced with volumes bought falling by 0.5 per cent but household . spending up 5.2 per cent due to rising prices. It was also confirmed that economic growth is sluggish - meaning there is little hope of wages being increased. As a whole the economy grew by 0.5 per cent in those months. But this follows a 0.5 per cent fall in the final quarter of 2010. In response to the gloomy news, Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro in response. Analysts also . pushed back their forecasts for rises in the UK bank rate. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, lowered his . prediction for the end of 2012 from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent for the base rate. 'The . drop in domestic demand was still appreciable and there was still . marked, worrying declines in consumer spending and business investment,' he added. Among the bad news revealed today was: . However, there was some encouraging news. Trade made the biggest contribution to first quarter GDP growth since 1977 and the economy saw the biggest rise in services output since early 2007. Exports continued to aid Britain's economic recovery, up to an all-time high of £74.6billion, but they are . still heavily outweighed by imports. The most recent figures for the current account deficit  - the . difference between imports and exports - were also published today and show a narrowing to £9.354 billion from . £12.956 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010. This was the smallest . deficit since late 2009 but was still double what economists had . forecast. The all-powerful ratings agencies were focused on today's data release. Fitch responded by reducing its estimate for growth in the UK economy in . 2011 to 1.4 per cent from 1.6 per cent. It maintained its estimate for . 2012 at 1.7 per cent. It said the decline in consumption and investment served as a . reminder of how anaemic the recovery is with growth still held back by . households and banks trying to pay down debts or improve their financial . safety nets.","Rate rise would need a 'stronger' economy, says Bank of England chief .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:10 PM on 23rd June 2011 . On her feet: Lizzie suffers from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which affects the body's ability to adjust to the pull of gravity . A student with a rare condition that caused her to faint every time she stood up over 14 years is finally back on her feet. Lizzie Rees, 22, suffers from postural orthostatic . tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which affects the body's ability to adjust . to the pull of gravity. The condition causes her heart rate to speed up whenever she stands, causing her to pass out up to five times a day. Even getting up from a chair would cause her to collapse and she often had to crawl around on her hands and knees or use a wheelchair. But after countless medical experts failed to cure the problem she is finally enjoying a normal life after a heart specialist prescribed a drug to control her blood flow. Miss Rees, from Bristol, said: 'I would pass out up to five times a day and was constantly getting injured banging my head and have to go off to A&E. 'I have seen cardiologists and doctors of pretty much every speciality going, but it is great to know that this is treatable. 'I remember feeling so much better after I started treatment. I still pass out occasionally but going to college now shows how far I have come.' POTS is a form of dysautonomia - an abnormal functioning of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), which controls many subconscious bodily functions including breathing and balance. When the average person stands their blood pressure drops slightly but the ANS recognises this and causes their heart rate to momentarily increase. But in POTS patients, their blood pressure plummets when they stand, causing the heart to race. Blood supply is not able to reach the brain quickly enough, resulting in dizziness, vision loss and fainting. Lizzie inherited a genetic condition which left her more susceptible to POTS and it was triggered by an infection she picked up at the age of eight. But the age of 12 she was unable to even sit up in bed and was admitted to hospital for 14 months as doctors sought a cure. Lizzie missed school completely between the age of 11 and 16 because she was unable to stand.By her late teens the condition briefly improved and she was able to take a job as a part-time care assistant at 18. In and out of hospital: Lizzie pictured in hospital with her mother when she was younger. An infection triggered her condition when she was just eight . But she had to quit within a year after the symptoms returned. Lizzie, who has spent most of her life getting around in a wheelchair, said: 'I have seen cardiologists and doctors of pretty much every speciality going but no one could figure it out. 'I spent three years in hospital in total, including 14 months at the children's hospital, bed-bound in a darkened room, fed by a tube. 'Fortunately I have had the support of my family and some very good friends.' But last September Lizzie was referred to Glyn Thomas, a consultant cardiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist at the Bristol Heart Institute. After extensive tests he prescribed daily injections of the drug octreotide, which increases her blood pressure and prevents her passing out. Her condition improved so much she has started an arts therapy college course at City of Bristol College. Getting around: Lizzie Rees was often confined to a wheelchair to stop her from fainting . She said: 'I almost didn't turn up for my appointment with Dr Thomas because I have seen so many people before and had not got anywhere, but it was so refreshing to see him. 'I remember feeling so much better after I started treatment. I still pass out occasionally but going to college now shows how far I have come.' Lizzie is now fulfilling a long-term dream of attending the Glastonbury Festival. She has bought tickets every year since 2005 with the hope of being able to join her friends at the event but has had to rip up her ticket at the last minute. The medication she is using is not routinely funded by the NHS but doctors can apply for exceptional funding on their patients' behalf. It is thought that just a few hundred people worldwide suffer from the severe form of POTS such as Lizzie's. Her parents Corinne, 58, and Gareth, 61, both doctors, hope that hundreds of other POTS sufferers could now benefit. Christmas away from home: Lizzie spent 14 months bed bound in a children's hospital . Corinne, a community paediatrician, said: 'It is huge, the heart institute have done a fantastic job, it is such a profound relief. She just wants to get on with her life. 'It has made a considerable difference to her life, one the hospital trust can be proud of. 'I think a core part of what they are doing is to recognise that POTS is a treatable condition and working to treat it. 'A lot of factors contribute towards the condition, such as the right water and salt levels and increasing exercise to help with blood flow. 'I would suspect they will find a lot of people out there who suffer to some extent who previously may not have fitted into a certain box and not been treated correctly. Hopefully this will change that.'",Lizzie would crawl on her hands and knees or use a wheel chair to stop herself collapsing .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:11 PM on 7th July 2011 . European airports are bracing for another volcanic eruption that could cripple summer travel plans. Scientists are closely monitoring unusual underground activity that could signal a massive explosion at a volcano dubbed the 'Gateway to Hell.' The Heckla volcano in southern Iceland is capable of producing four times the debris of the country's last ash-producing blast that caused flights to be cancelled across northern Britain in May. Danger: Scientists have recorded 'unusual' magma movement beneath the Hekla volcano in Iceland, prompting fears it could soon erupt . In April last year, ash from an eruption at Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano grounded flights across Europe for days, disrupting travel for 10 million people in the biggest airspace shut down since World War Two. University of Iceland geophysicist Pall Einarson said yesterday that magma appeared to be moving deep beneath the giant volcano. 'The movements around Heckla have been unusual in the last two to three days. The mountain has been slowly expanding in the last few years because of magma buildup .The volcano is ready to erupt,' he added. In the past few decades, Hekla has . erupted about every 10 years, most recently in February 2000, and . experts believe another one is overdue. Hekla is so active that scientists . estimate about 10% of the tephra - the solid matter ejected when a . volcano erupts - produced in Iceland over the past millenium, about . five cubic kilometres, comes from this one volcano. It is feared that four times as much debris will be spewed into the air as when Eyjafjallajokull, pictured, erupted last year . 'No eruption has started in Hekla volcano. But it might start without any warning.' said Icelandic volcano expert Jon Frimann. Hekla, . which means hooded cloak in Iceland, has erupted more than 20 times – . and once a decade in recent times in 1970, 1980, 1991 and 2000. Its . first eruption, in 874, produced 2.5 cubic km of tephra, the scientific . term for various kinds of debris emitted by volcanoes. The . Eyjafjallajokul eruption in April 2010 produced roughly 1.8 cubic km . over three days. The main reason it grounded so many flights for over a . week was that the ash cloud hung so low. If Heckla blows, the amount of disruption it causes will depend on it size and the speed and direction of the wind. Both of Iceland's latest eruptions provided warning signs several hours before, but Hekla is known for having a very short fuse. 'Hekla never gives you much of a . warning,' said Mr Einarsson, In 2000, it began rumbling an hour and a . half before the outbreak of magma, which was actually an unusually long . warning. In 1970 we only got 25 minutes notice,' he added. Powerful: Smoke plumes from the Grimsvotn volcano in May. Hekla could produce up to four times as much debris if it erupts . Rongvaldur Olafsson, a project manager at the Icelandic Civil Protection Authority, said no immediate safety precautions were being taken but: 'We will watch the mountain and developments very closely.' After Iceland's last two eruptions, geologists have warned that the country's volcanoes appeared to have entered a more active phase and that more eruptions could be expected, with Hekla believed to be first in line. The volacano, situated about 70 miles east of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, is a neighbour of Eyjafjallajokull.","Hekla could erupt soon after 'unusual' activity recorded .

"Details emerge in newly-disclosed files . Britain feared chemical invasion in 1941 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:21 PM on 23rd June 2011 . Poison gas: Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ordered the use of chemical weapons . British authorities feared the Nazis would use poison gas as part of an attempt to invade the UK, accordingly to newly disclosed intelligence files on WWII. Intelligence suggested Germany had stockpiled large amounts of chemical weapons and carried out tests using anthrax-infected mortar shells and a foot-and-mouth disease spray. An unconfirmed report even suggested that the Nazis had developed a . gas which could stop car engines from working, previously secret . documents released by the National Archives reveal. In January 1941, when a German invasion was feared to be imminent, . British military intelligence concluded that Hitler's forces were likely . to use poison gas against the UK. 'If Germany attempts to invade this country she will be undertaking a . most hazardous operation for which the prize will be world domination,' officers wrote in a report. 'Into that operation she is certain to put all her strength, and if . she considers that the use of gas will increase her chance of success, . she will not hesitate to use it.' Devastation: As well as air strikes on London, poison gas attacks were likely, reveals a new report from War Office Intelligence branch MI14 . The briefing noted that Germany's highly developed chemical industry had already created large stocks of mustard and phosgene gas, which were reportedly being moved from factories in readiness for a possible invasion. 'There is likely to be no bar to the use of gas by Germany on account of the lack of stocks or of trained personnel or weapons for producing it,' stated the report drawn up by MI14, the specialist German intelligence branch of the War Office. Threat: Sir Winston Churchill had close links with MI14 . British officials concluded that the Nazis were not likely to use poison gas on civilians in general, but might do so to provoke a panicked evacuation of coastal areas ahead of an invasion. Another intelligence report, from February 1941, suggested that the Nazis were preparing to accuse the UK of launching gas attacks to justify their own use of chemical weapons. 'A foreign diplomat indicated that the German authorities are fostering a belief in the intention of the British to use gas in their raids against Germany, and concludes that this propaganda is intended to prepare German public opinion for the German use of gas against the United Kingdom,' it said.","Details emerge in newly-disclosed files .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:52 PM on 22nd June 2011 . Breach of trust: Jeffrey Horne planted the device in an attempt to gain attention . A hospital security guard who perpetrated a bomb hoax which shut down an accident and emergency unit and cost the NHS £218,000 has been jailed for 15 months. Birmingham Crown Court heard that Jeffrey Martin Horne, 43, planted the 'realistic' device just weeks after starting work at the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. Horne, formerly of Mile Oak, Tamworth, Staffordshire, showed no emotion as the court was told how the 'stupid and frightening' offence had caused massive disruption which even saw four babies born prematurely. Almost 80 surgical operations were cancelled due to the near six-hour security alert, which only ended after a controlled explosion carried out by an Army unit drafted in from Gloucestershire. Passing sentence on Horne, Judge Sybil Thomas said she believed the former soldier, who was seen apparently attempting to defuse the 'bomb' in a toilet cubicle, had staged the hoax to seek attention. The judge told the father-of-four: 'You were employed as a security officer trusted to keep the hospital safe. 'This was therefore a gross breach of that trust.' Criticising Horne for failing to alert the authorities that the bomb was not genuine after the alarm was raised, the judge added: 'You were present, you worked at the hospital, you had experience working in security and you knew what would happen. 'You saw the harm you had caused unfold, and did nothing.' Non-operational: Part of the Good Hope Hospital was forced to shut down after the bomb squad was called in . Horne, who is said to have 'paraded' in front of camera crews covering the security alert from behind a 100-metre cordon, covered his face as he arrived at today's hearing on crutches and with his left arm in a plaster cast. It is thought he had been working at Good Hope on a temporary basis for around six weeks when he planted the package, which incorporated black and white wiring and a bottle containing a liquid. Horne, said by his counsel to be anxious and depressed due to the nature of his work, pleaded guilty in May to placing an article with intent at the hospital at about 8am on November 23 last year. The agency worker was charged with the offence in February after wires matching those used in the hoax were found in his garden shed and CCTV footage exposed him as the only person who could have planted the device. The wrong kind of attention: Horne pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing into the case . Alistair Redford, prosecuting, told Judge Thomas that Horne had used the 'bomb' to facilitate a crisis where he could be seen to apparently disarm it. On the morning of the hospital's partial evacuation, Horne was observed by a mortuary technician to be carrying something under his coat. The guard, who served in an infantry regiment in his late teens, then called a colleague to the male toilets in the accident and emergency department and told him the device, which he was seen handling, had 'gone click' and was ticking. A police officer then confirmed that the item, contained in a carrier bag, was an incendiary device and the bomb squad were called. Mr Redford told the court: 'At this stage it was treated as a major incident and the whole department was evacuated.' The hospital was then closed, and although certain wards were not evacuated, a total of 678 outpatient appointments had to be cancelled. Speaking after the sentencing, Superintendent Rich Youds revealed that the device had appeared to be genuine but was not actually capable of causing an explosion. But the officer added: 'This was not just a phone call from a hoaxer - this was a deliberate and elaborate attempt to make people believe that there was a threat. 'Whatever his motive - whether he was an attention seeker or wanted to portray himself as a hero - this was a stupid and potentially dangerous act. 'West Midlands Police take hoax calls very seriously and this case shows that we vigorously investigate reports and bring any offenders to justice.'","'Attention seeker' costs NHS £218,000 after planting device in toilet cubicle ."
"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 7:28 AM on 2nd September 2011 . 'Gross abuse of power': PC Edward Prince was convicted of assault . A police officer who kicked an illegal immigrant in the head as though he was 'kicking a football' was jailed for 18 months today. Pc Edward Prince, 31, attacked Trinidadian victim Nyrone Games, 27, in an act of 'thoughtless naked aggression' as colleagues pinned him face down on the pavement. The plainclothes officer told Mr Games he would have suffered much worse treatment if the event had not been captured on CCTV, saying 'You would have got a good kicking. You well deserved what you got.' Today, Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC jailed him for his 'gross abuse of power and breach of trust.' Eye witnesses described seeing blood splattered across the victim's face and on the ground beneath his head after the assault. Prince denied deliberately kicking Mr Games in the head during an arrest and said he was only following orders to restrain the man. But a jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted Prince of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after rejecting his claims. Prince had been part of a group of officers who had chased the suspect through the streets of Croydon, south London, on November 6, 2009. Mr Games, originally from Trinidad, was wanted for deportation after being jailed in 2007 for a string of drug related offences. Jurors heard that Prince had been traced to an address in Croydon by officers with a warrant for his arrest, but fled the property. He was chased through the streets to Brighton Road where he was surrounded and hauled to the ground outside an Esso petrol station. During the melee Prince kicked him in the head with his right foot, said prosecutor Sam Brown. 'At this point Pc Tina Bassett saw one of the officers run up to where Nyrone Games was lying on the ground, run straight up to the top of his body, move his right leg back and kicked Nyrone Games in his head area,' he said. Denial: Prince told the court he did not deliberately kick Mr Games . '[A second officer] also saw an officer performing a kicking action but was obstructed from seeing what he was kicking. 'Both officers saw blood on Nyrone Games' face and the pavement underneath his head. 'It was observed from what they saw of his demeanour that he was angry and in pain. 'The actions of this defendant were thoughtless, naked aggression in the course of a melee the circumstances of which he thought would conceal his actions.' Giving evidence against her colleague, Pc Tina Bassett had told jurors how she saw four officers restraining Mr Games when a plainclothes officer ran over and kicked him in the head. She said: 'I would describe it as kicking a football with some force.'I could not believe what I saw. 'What I saw was completely against all ethics of being a police officer.' Guilty: A jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted Prince of assault occasioning actual bodily harm after rejecting his claims . Giving evidence Prince said he had joined in the pursuit of Mr Games and had watched as an officer from Lewisham intercepted Mr Games and hit him round the legs with a baton. He said his colleague Pc Gavin McSweeney then grabbed hold of Mr Game's upper body and hauled him to the floor outside the Esso garage. When asked to describe what happened next by his barrister Elroy Claxton he said: 'As I ran around Mr Games Pc McSweeny shouted to me to get his head. 'My reaction was he is the first one there, he knows what he is talking about, I need to go down and secure the head. '[Mr Games] was struggling to get away. It was still a violent struggle. 'Mr Games was a strong, very well-built, young man, determined to get away from police officers. 'I put my left hand on his left shoulder and put my weight on him so that he could not try and get up.' 'Your actions amounted to an extremely grave breach of your public duty and a gross breach of the public's trust' Mr Claxton asked him: 'Did you at any stage kick Mr Games?' Prince, who joined the force nine and a half years ago, replied: 'No, at no point did I deliberately kick Mr Games. 'It is a possibility I may have come into contact with Mr Games, but as I say it was not a deliberate act.' Prince, of Crawley, west Sussex, denied causing actual bodily harm. Mr Games was deported back to Trinidad in March 2010. Judge Pegden said: 'In my judgement you also hit the prone man with your radio, which was in your hand. 'You also, in my judgement, provoked the restrained man. 'By your actions you caused this man's face to bleed profusely. 'You caused him cuts and grazes to his face and a swollen and blackened left eye. 'Your actions amounted to an extremely grave breach of you public duty and a gross breach of the public's trust. 'The public are entitled to expect that their police force to behave lawfully and not use gratuitous and serious violence on someone who is already restrained and prone. 'This was a gross abuse of power and breach of trust carried out in broad daylight in front of your colleagues and members of the public causing them outrage, shock, disgust and disbelief.'",Judge said Pc Edward Prince was guilty of 'gross abuse of power'

Off the streets: Max Melitzer, left, in an old mugshot and right, shortly after he was found living homeless in Salt Lake City. He is set to inherit around $100,000 . A private investigator tracked down Mr Melitzer, 65, last week to deliver the life-altering news of the inheritance left by a brother who died of cancer. Ms Behling said Mr Melitzer was deeply affected by the death of his wife, Janice, and his life on the streets seemed to begin after the accident. Windfall: Max Melitzer on the park bench in Salt Lake City where Mr Lundberg found him last week . Mr Melitzer has since left Utah to reunite with his family in New York, who he hadn't seen in more than ten years. ‘He was very much in love with his wife, I believe,' Ms Behling said. 'And it was really hard for him - one, to have her gone and, two, to have been driving.' ‘I’m sure that affected him a lot, and I'm sure he missed his wife a lot,’ she told the Deseret News. Mr Melitzer was driving through Wyoming in July 1990 when he lost control of his car, killing his wife and two passengers. Behling said she recalls Mr Melitzer . lost his apartment after the crash and bounced from place to place . between Ogden and Salt Lake City. Two months ago the Melitzer family hired private investigator David Lundberg to track down Max. Neither Mr Lundberg nor the family's law firm . have disclosed the amount Mr Melitzer will receive, but it is believed . to be around $100,000. ‘He'd have money where he could take care of himself or hire someone to take care of him,’ Mr Lundberg said. Success: Private investigator David Lundberg with Mr Melitzer. He is now set to inherit his late brother's entire estate, believed to be worth around $100,000 . ‘Apparently, he does have some emotional issues. The family just wants to make sure he's set up and he's taken care of.’ It took his cousin, Richard Goldfarb, more than a year to find Max, finally fulfilling his brother's deathbed request. The down-and-out was left 'in shock' when Mr Lundberg told him he stands to inherit just over $100,000 from . his brother, Morris, who he hadn't seen in 15 years. He was discovered wandering around a park in Salt Lake City last Friday, pushing his shopping cart in front of him. Refuge: Max Melitzer was a regular visitor to the Rescue Mission of Salt Lake City . Mr Goldfarb, the Melitzers' first cousin, said he was 'tickled pink' to have finally found Max. He told MailOnline: 'He ate his first seafood in over 25 years when Mr Lundberg took him out for dinner. ‘(The windfall) is not a fortune, but . to him it'll feel like a million dollars. I am tickled pink, now I . don't have to worry about finding him anymore. 'The family are all tickled pink, . we're all very happy that we have finally found him, and got him out of . the life he has been living.'","Friend said man declined into homelessness after his wife and two friends were killed in a car crash in 1990 .

"By . Rebecca Camber and Nick Fagge . Last updated at 2:13 AM on 24th June 2011 . 'Innocent': Jason Owen is claiming that he had nothing to do with Baby P's death . The paedophile jailed over the death of Baby P will be free in six weeks and is demanding an expensive new identity. Jason Owen, 39, who was convicted of causing or allowing the death of Peter Connelly, wants taxpayers to pay for plastic surgery so he can ‘start a new life’ under a different name. The arsonist and former crack addict will walk free on the fourth anniversary of the death. Yesterday his victim’s family reacted with fury on learning the sadistic lodger wants help to get a seaside council house for his girlfriend and his five children. At Wandsworth Prison he has told other offenders he is innocent and deserves a fresh start when he is released so that he can work as a personal trainer. Yesterday Baby P’s grandfather Richard Johnson said: ‘He should be locked up for life. It’s a crazy system that allows someone convicted over the death of a child to walk free after such a short time. ‘Why is it that my beautiful grandson is lying dead and buried in the ground, yet one of the monsters responsible for killing him will soon be walking around as happy as can be? ‘To this day my grandson is still being let down by the authorities. There’s no justice whatsoever and it makes my blood boil to think he’s got off so lightly.’ Owen, a member of the National Front, and his brother Steven Barker, 35, who was Baby P’s stepfather, were both convicted of causing or allowing the child’s death in 2008.  The toddler’s mother Tracey Connelly, 30, pleaded guilty to the same offence. Neglected: Baby P was found dead in his cot and had 50 separate injuries . Speaking from his home in Leicester, Mr Johnson said: ‘He robbed me of my only grandson and I’ll never forgive him, or my own daughter and her partner, for that. ‘A new identity would be a total waste of taxpayers’ money. He doesn’t deserve to hide behind a new face and name. He should walk the streets in shame.’ A relative of Peter Connelly’s biological father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ‘The idea that someone involved in one of the most notorious crimes in recent history will be released from jail after serving less than four years makes British justice look like a joke.’ The cost of providing Owen with a secret identity could run to £250,000. Officers would have to provide him with a new name, national insurance number and passport when he is released in August. There would also be housing and benefits payments. A source close to Owen’s family said: ‘He reckons he never had anything to do with what went on with Peter and was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, which is why he should be able to start a new life with no one knowing who he is. ‘He and his missus talk all the time about getting set up in a nice big council house near the beach. Convicted: Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly (left) and Owen's brother, Steven Barker (right) were both jailed over the youngster's death . ‘He thinks he is like those boys that . killed Jamie Bulger and his life will be at risk.’ Yesterday the . Ministry of Justice refused to discuss the case, but sources said it was . rare to give defendants a new identity. Owen has received death threats in . jail and his lawyers are expected to argue that his notoriety means he . would be at risk of harm if he were not protected. Among the . high-profile criminals who have received new identities are Maxine Carr, . 31, the former girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who . murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993, and Mary Bell, who was 11 . when she was convicted of killing two boys in 1968, were also given new . identities. Baby P was found dead in his blood-spattered cot in August . 2007 after suffering more than 50 injuries, including a snapped spine . and eight broken ribs. He had been placed on a  protection . register eight months before his death and social workers, doctors and . health visitors saw him 60 times, but failed to halt his abuse. An Old Bailey judge ordered that Owen . should be jailed indefinitely to protect the public, but the Appeal . Court cut his sentence to six years in October 2009 because he did not . pose a ‘significant’ risk. He is not on the sex offenders register and . his automatic release in August raises the prospect he will be able to . offend again. Although never charged, Owen had been investigated for alleged sex attacks on other children. He is likely to be under supervision . for three years and prevented from contacting Barker and Connelly or . from entering Haringey, the North London borough where the killing took . place. Also under consideration is a clause obliging him to report to his probation officer any relationship with a woman or a child.",Jason Owen to be out of prison in six weeks .
"By . Ian Sparks . Last updated at 4:35 PM on 1st September 2011 . It's the game show that doesn't like to see asylum seekers sent home empty-handed. Broadcast tonight for the first time, a Dutch TV programme will pit contestants set for deportation against each other in a quiz which will have the politically correct brigade tearing their hair out. On Weg van Nederland, the would-be immigrants are asked a series of questions about the country they are being kicked out of. Quite simply, whoever answers most correctly wins £3,500 to spend rebuilding their life - outside of the Netherlands. Far from the Netherlands: The new game show, presented by Waldemar Torenstra, centre, gives failed asylum seekers the chance to win cash to spend after their deportation back to their countries of origin . The losers win 'consolation prizes' which include a bag of tulip bulbs and a bullet proof vest. In the programme, called Weg van Nederland, or Far From the Netherlands, contestants are flanked by women dressed as air hostesses as they answer questions about Dutch culture, language and history. Among the contestants on tonight's pilot show on the VPRO channel is an aeronautical engineer set to be deported to Cameroon and a Slavic languages student who will be sent home to Chechnya. VPRO editor-in-chief Frank Wiering said he was 'pretty unenthusiatic' when production house Sky High first pitched the quiz. He added: 'My first reaction was that this was a terrible idea. 'But then I realised the show was not really mocking asylum seekers but highlighting their plight through humour. 'The candidates are not actors, they are genuine unsuccessful asylum seekers who have to leave this country within a month or two. 'The show focuses attention on the fact that these days many asylum seekers being expelled have children who know nothing about their country of origin. 'They have had a good education, speak perfect Dutch and have only seen their country of birth on television. We believe it's time to stop and think about this.' Tasteless? The programme is a commentary on Dutch immigration policies . Holland's Refugee Support Group spokesman Wouter van Zandwijk said he could understand why many people might find the show 'tasteless'. He added: 'The programme is sick but, let's face it, the reality is sick too. 'Often our government invests in the education and integration of immigrant children, then just as we are about to harvest that investment and they all become hardworking Dutch taxpayers, they are sent away.' TV viewers at home can also play the quiz online, with a top prize of a return ticket to the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao.","'Consolation prizes' for losers include bulletproof vest and bag of tulip bulbs .

"By . Rebecca English . Last updated at 8:15 AM on 29th June 2011 . His future subjects may be tightening their belts, but when it comes to austerity Prince Charles appears to be setting a less than perfect example. The Prince of Wales’s income rose to £19.7million last year, an above-inflation increase of 4.9 per cent in a year when the salaries of his staff were frozen. In addition, Charles was able to claim tax relief on more than half the total by designating it ‘official expenditure’. According to his annual review, published yesterday, almost £18million of his income came from the Duchy of Cornwall estate and the rest from Government grants. The prince’s personal spending shot up by 50 per cent to £2.5million and his travel bill  topped £1million, equal to £31.50 for each of the 34,287 miles covered by him and Camilla. He also took on ten extra members of staff, bringing the total he employs to 159. Prince Charles and Camilla in Morocco in April: His spending on official travel by air and rail came to £1,080,000, up £388,000 from the previous year . The prince did, however, pay £4.4million in taxes and help to raise £123million for charity, as well as making personal charitable donations of more than £800,000. In the past 12 months he and Camilla have visited India, Portugal, Spain and Morocco at the request of the Foreign Office, which explains why his travel bill – funded by a Government grant – rose by 56 per cent year on year. Included in his tax-exempt official costs are £6.4million on staff, £323,000 on entertaining and receptions, a 28 per cent rise, and £207,000 on office equipment. Costs also included £155,000 on the upkeep of his gardens which, he argued, were used for official entertaining. That was a rise of £30,000, or 24 per cent. Charles’s 159-strong household staff includes butlers, valets, dressers, gardeners and housekeepers. Of these, 133 support the prince, his wife and Princes William and Harry and the rest work on his gardens, farm and estates. Five new aides have been taken on – three to work for the newly created households of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, one to assist with the Charles’s website and one as an estate worker at Highgrove, his country residence. The other positions were temporary staff employed to help with the royal wedding, or temporary jobs which have been made permanent. He also personally funds 17 estate, farm, garden and stable staff. Charles gives a speech before a state dinner at Belem Presidential Palace in Lisbon, Portugal in March. The average cost of his official travel soared from £16.13 per mile in 2009/10 to £31.50 per mile in 2010/11 . The Prince's non-official expenditure rose £488,000 to £2,539,000, in small part to cover expenses related to the Royal wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in April . Do you think Prince Charles is good value for money? On a thriftier note, Charles yesterday . revealed his new official harpist, an unpaid position which will reward . 24-year-old Hannah Stone with around £3,000 in expenses a year. The . musician, from Swansea, is the fourth person to take on the historic . role since it was reinstated 11 years ago. Last night, the prince’s increased . spending was defended by his private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, who . insisted it was largely down to the ‘significant’ donations the prince . makes to charities. Sir Michael said the prince kept a . firm reign on his finances, an assessment endorsed by Mike Warburton, . senior tax partner at Grant Thornton. ‘I would say he keeps a fairly . tight grip on his expenditure,’ he said. ‘Admittedly there are a few things . that I would struggle to be able to write off for, say, the senior . finance director of a large company. Clearly the taxman is slightly more . lenient when it comes to the Prince of Wales.’ However anti-monarchist group Republic . said: ‘Charles’s spending is spiralling out of control. Why are . taxpayers funding his lavish lifestyle when public services are being . cut?’ On the prince’s travel bill, Charles’s . spokesman Paddy Harverson said: ‘This is not spending by the prince, it . is spending at the request of the Government and the Foreign Office.’ The Duchy of Cornwall has paid . almost £100,000 to Prince Charles’s sister-in-law to redecorate its . holiday cottages. Its accounts reveal interior designer Annabel Elliot . was paid £62,685 in fees and £35,920 for the purchase of furniture. Clarence House insisted she offered good value for money.

'I . found out about the news a few weeks ago and it has been very difficult keeping . it quiet. 'The . auditions process was quite surreal, because I was performing to a small panel.

Konrad Schmidt, 47, flew the rented light aircraft past the building three times before crashing into it at high speed. There was a huge explosion and fireball but, incredibly, his mother Rosemary, 68, survived because she was in the basement at the time of the suicide attack on Saturday afternoon. Devastated: Rosemary Schmidt's house was destroyed by her son's suicide attack . Neighbours helped rescue her from the burning shell of her house in the Swiss village of Oberhallau, 50 miles north of Zurich. Mrs Schmidt, who is being treated for shock, told police that shortly before the crash her son telephoned her from the cockpit to say: ‘Are you home? I am just going to drop by.’ Witnesses said there was ‘no possibility’ that it had been an accident. One said: ‘He had all these flypasts. He was lining himself up. And then he did it. It was like seeing a mini re-run of 9/11.’ Rubble: The pilot is thought to have been depressed, and to have fallen out with his mother . Schmidt, who had been a keen hobby pilot for many years, had hired the Diamond Aircraft DA42 earlier on Saturday. In the past two years the unemployed electrical engineer had suffered depression and financial problems. Neighbours said he had a long-running feud with his mother. ‘They had a lot of heavy issues over a lot of things,’ one said. ‘They did not have a good relationship.’ Disaster: Emergency services had to tackle fires at the house in northern Switzerland . Media reports said Schmidt's father Otto was a senior pilot with national carrier Swissair, and was rarely at home during his son's childhood. Konrad was brought up almost single-handed by his mother, and after his parents' marriage crumbled he was left bitter and disillusioned. He blamed Rosemary for the split, while his father moved out and died from cancer shortly afterwards.","'It was like seeing a mini-rerun of 9/11'

"Charlie Harper may meet his maker after driving off a cliff - perhaps inspired by Sheen's own 'car cliff' mishap last year . By . Mike Larkin and Andrea Magrath . Last updated at 4:44 PM on 28th June 2011 . They say there is always a way back in showbiz. But it looks like any lingering hopes hell-raising actor Charlie Sheen had of making a dramatic return to hit sitcom Two and a Half Men have finally been laid to rest. It has been revealed on TMZ that when Two . and a Half Men returns the screen will turn dark for just a minute or . two because Alan and Jake will learn Sheen character Charlie Harper bit . the dust. Show creator . Chuck Lorre's wants is to make sure his character Charlie Harper can never come back on . the show, with mooted scenarios for his death including him driving . a car over a cliff. Cliffhanger: It looks like the smile may be wiped from Charlie Sheen's face after it emerged today his character in Two and a Half Men is going to be killed off . Such a storyline would be a real kick-in-the-teeth for the actor, as he has twice had his car stolen and driven off a Los Angeles precipice in the last year. The show's creator is also toying with the idea that Ashton Kutcher's proposed new character could star in the show after buying Harper's old house. However it looks like Sheen could come back from the dead quicker than expected, as it has emerged he is being lined up to star in a new show . It has been claimed the star has signed a lucrative deal . with Lionsgate Television for a new sitcom that will cash in on his . notoriety. A bidding war is now said to be under way among broadcasters to land the rights to the show. But life continues to lurch from one extreme to the other for the troubled actor, as it also emerged the 45-year-old has lost his last remaining ‘goddess’ Natalie Kenly after she dumped the star and moved out of his home. But the news he has penned a money-spinning deal that could see him earning more than ever before is sure to sweeten the blow. An insider told RadarOnline: ‘Charlie has inked a deal with Lionsgate Television to create and star in a new sitcom.’ ‘Charlie's character will be very similar to the one he played on Two And a Half Men, however the show will be a lot racier. Half an idea: Actor Charlie Sheen's new show is rumoured to be a more extreme version of his ratings topper Two And a Half Men . ‘Networks and cable are bidding on the show right now, with TBS being the front runner. ‘TBS recently expanded their comedy division with the acquisition of The Conan O'Brien Show after his fall out with NBC. ‘Plus cable makes more sense because it offers more creative freedom. ‘In other words the show can be raunchier and more outrageous, which is perfect for Charlie.’ It will could see the controversial star, who was sacked from his ratings winning starring vehicle Two And a Half Men, raking in even more cash than before. He will not be getting paid the $2million (£1.25million) per episode he received the smash hit show. Split: Charlie sheen's last-remaining 'goddess' Natalie Kenly has split from the troubled actor . However it is understood he will get a . share of the profits, known as a back-end deal, which means in the long . run he could make much more than he did on the CBS show. The insider added: ‘Lionsgate Television will produce the  show. ‘They . have committed to ten episodes up front with the option to pick-up and . produce 90 more episodes if the ratings prove to be successful. ‘This means the sitcom could be on TV for 8 years, which is a long time. ‘It also means that Charlie will make more money than ever before.’ Whether Sheen will actually be able to make it through a whole season, never mind eight years, is another story. The Hot Shots! actor has had a troubled time since he was sacked from from hit sitcom Two And a Half Men in March. Happier times: The couple were last seen together celebrating Natalie's 25th birthday on June 2 . After . being permanently replaced by Ashton Kutcher in Two and a Half Men, it . has been revealed that the 45-year-old's last-remaining 'goddess' has . dumped him. Natalie Kenly, 25, moved out of the self-proclaimed 'warlock's' home a week ago. The duo were last seen together happily celebrating Natalie's birthday at the W hotel in Los Angeles on June 2. But TMZ reports that Miss Kenly, who was nanny to Sheen's twins Bob and Max, packed her bags just a fortnight later. According . to the celebrity website, the Wall Street star has demanded that . Natalie return the Mercedes he bought her while they were together. However, Miss Kenly's mother Hanny came forward to insist she had no problem returning the car. She told RadarOnline.com: 'Natalie is doing really well but I just want to protect my daughter. The car she was using has been returned - my daughter never kept Charlie Sheen's Mercedes. It was never taken in the first place those stories are not true.' Bizarre: Other 'goddess,' porn star Bree Olsen (left, pictured with Sheen, Natalie and his children Bob and Max) left sheen's unusual living arrangements in April . Miss Kenly's departure comes two months after fellow 'goddess' Rachel Orbelin, aka Bree Olsen, left. The porn star dumped Sheen by text message in April after leaving, and then returning to Sheen in early March. Natalie remained with Charlie and accompanied him on his Violent Torpedo of Truth tour. It appeared that all was well between the pair at Natalie's birthday parties earlier this month. They cuddled and laughed in front of photographers as they partied with friends at the Nine Thirty restaurant at the W hotel. Last  month it was confirmed that Ashton Kutcher was replacing Sheen as the star of Two and a Half Men. Following the announcement, Sheen told TMZ: 'Kutcher is a sweetheart and a brilliant comedic performer... Oh wait, so am I!!' 'Enjoy planet Chuck, Ashton,' he added, referring to the show's creator and his nemesis, Chuck Lorre. 'There is no air, laughter, loyalty, or love there.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:15 PM on 14th July 2011 . A stripper who went on the run with her lesbian lover after the children she left home alone were killed in a fire has handed herself in. Police were hunting Kiaira Pollard, 27, whose sons KiDonn, seven, and KrisDon, four, perished in a blaze that tore through her Pittsburgh apartment while she was at work. They believed Pollard was with her 33-year-old girlfriend Dayna Kenney, who works as her personal security guard. At large: Stripper Kiaira Pollard, left, is on the run with her lesbian lover Dayna Kenney, right, after the children she left home alone were killed in a fire . But she surrendered to police on Wednesday with her attorney who said she is ""anguished by the loss of her children"". Pollard was was charged with two counts of homicide, child endangerment and tampering with a fire apparatus, with police saying she often left the boys at home in an apartment without a smoke alarm. Fireman found straight-A student KiDonn dead under a pile of clothes while KrisDon was discovered under a crib. Pollard became a fugitive on Tuesday, a day after police filed charges against her in connection with the June 30 tragedy. She handed herself in at 3.45pm on Wednesday. Pollard's attorney, Fred Rabner, said: 'This is a tragedy for all involved.' He added that his client had been too distraught to provide many facts about the case. Both boys were killed when the fire took hold of the flat in North Versailles. Brothers in arms: The boys were never far apart . When Pollard eventually arrived from work on the fateful night she told officers a babysitter must have left the children home alone. Pollard then frantically tried to call the sitter to no avail. Witnesses said when she arrived she shouted: 'That's my apartment! My babies! Where's the babysitter?' Police later checked Pollard's record and found she never made a call. Talented: KiDonn was a straight-A student . They were first at the scene but could not get through the locked front steel door, which fire fighters had to break down. Neighbours, interviewed at the time, said Pollard was an attentive mother who would never leave her boys at home on their own. But police thought otherwise charging her with homicide, endangering the welfare of . children and tampering with a smoke detector. A maintenance man told officers the smoke detector was missing during an annual inspection two days before . the fire but he had replaced it. He added that Pollard told him . she had previously disconnected the device because the alarm would go . off when she cooked. Before she handed herself in Allegheny County Police Lieutenant Andrew Schurman said Kenney and Pollard 'travel as a pair'. He added: 'She's (Pollard's) girlfriend, and they share a residence.' Investigators believe the blaze started accidentally at 2.30am next to an air conditioner in the apartment. A friend of Pollard's told police she drove her to work at 10 or 11pm the night before the fire and didn't see a babysitter. Pollard refused to give detectives contact information for the babysitter when they requested it on several occasions after the fire. The boys' funeral took place amid emotional scenes earlier this month. Pollard sobbed and leaned on others as she walked toward the lone white casket holding her sons. Relatives cried out when the casket was closed. KiDonn was expected to join a programme for gifted pupils. KrisDon was said to be fond of Power Rangers and was known as 'Fatty'. His father, Christopher Williams, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette the boys were 'beautiful'. He added: 'They were best friends.' Grandmother Carmen Pollard said the boys were never apart. 'You take one,' she said, 'you've got to take the other.' Cousin Ashley Burchette told the same paper that Ms Pollard will forever suffer the loss of her sons and should not be charged. 'She's paid enough,' Ms Burchette said. 'She's paid the ultimate price.'","Kiaira Pollard left boys, aged four and seven, at house while she went to work .

"Despite being caught and jailed, the 'mystery' thief still refuses to reveal her own true identity . By . James Tozer . Last updated at 1:44 AM on 21st June 2011 . One is a white, British-born housewife from the West Midlands. The other is a younger black woman, thought to be from Nigeria. But despite their obvious differences, the African woman was able to spend 15 years travelling on a British passport in the unsuspecting British woman's name. The astonishing deception only came to light after the real Carol Anne Keast tried to renew her passport  – and was interrogated to find out whether she was who she claimed to be. The anonymous woman thought to be from Nigeria, left, had spent 15 years travelling on a British passport using the identity of Carol Anne Keast . After the 53-year-old provided proof of her identity, including . decades-old school records, an alert was raised for the mystery black . woman travelling the world using her name. The bogus Carol Anne Keast, thought to be an illegal immigrant, was . finally arrested following a break in Marbella with her unsuspecting . television producer boyfriend. Yesterday she was beginning a nine-month prison sentence for fraudulent . use of a  passport – but still refusing to divulge her  real identity. Even the partner she had been living with, 54-year-old former Gladiators . producer Tom Henderson, last night admitted he didn't have a clue who . she really was. The case highlights worrying loopholes in Britain's border security – . and raises the prospect that unless the impostor reveals her identity, . she cannot be deported when she is freed. Manchester Airport: Officials there discovered the imposter - but she had been living a lie since 1989 and had got several passports in the name of Carol Anne Keast before detection . Her victim, who has used her married name of Carol Anne Payton since . 1982, said: 'It is a bit silly really because mine is a very unusual . name and she is apparently about 20 years younger than me. 'She is of African appearance and I am not. Neither are any of my . family. How she thought she was going to travel and get away with it I . will never know.' The impostor obtained a copy of Carol Anne Keast's birth certificate in . 1989 and used to it obtain a passport in that name in 1995. She renewed . the passport in 2005. But when former bank worker Mrs Payton applied to renew her passport in . 2009, tighter anti-fraud checks highlighted the clash and she was called . in for interview.

'I had to take in school documents and the passport authorities asked me . questions about my family.

'I must admit I thought she was never going to be caught.' But last November, the bogus Carol Anne Keast flew into Manchester Airport and was challenged by immigration officers. The impostor was unable to give any information to support her claim to . be the real Carol Anne Keast, insisting she suffered from memory loss. She was jailed for nine months at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, for fraudulent use of a passport. Prosecutor Sol Broady said: 'She is wilfully refusing to identify herself properly, or give her country of origin.' Sarah Johnston, defending, said medical tests had shown her client to be . displaying symptoms of depression and mental health 'fragilities'. Judge Jonathan Geake told her: 'You have fooled a number of people, and have been living a lie for a number of years. 'Your real identity, it would appear  to everybody, remains something of  a mystery.' She could face further action, including contempt of court, if she fails to tell the truth. When Mr Henderson was asked if he knew the woman's real identity . yesterday at the flat they shared in Northenden, Manchester, he replied: . 'I haven't got a clue.' Immigration sources said she was believed to be originally from Ghana or . Nigeria and to have arrived in Britain before fingerprints were . routinely taken with visa applications. The Home Office said such a case could not happen today due to tougher . anti-fraud measures. For example, fingerprints are now taken from . overseas visa applicants seeking to travel to Britain and are kept on . file. The impostor also obtained a driving licence under the name Carol Anne . Keast. Investigators are expected to examine whether she fraudulently . claimed benefits during her two decades living a lie.","The impostor secured a copy of Carol Anne Keast's birth certificate before getting British passports in her name .

"By . Jack Doyle and Jaya Narain . Last updated at 11:09 AM on 30th June 2011 . Judge: Jonathan Finestein . Tens of thousands of killers, rapists and thugs could escape prosecution after an alarming legal judgment. The ruling tore up 25 years of bail . rules for criminal suspects, left a gaping hole in police powers to . protect the public and could undermine a string of major investigations. It means alleged offenders can no . longer be released on bail for weeks or months while officers conduct . painstaking investigations. Instead they must be charged within a . maximum of 96 hours of arrest. Senior officers have branded the . ruling ‘bizarre’, and indicated that  offenders are already being . released from custody as a result. Ministers could be asked to bring in emergency laws to reverse the decision within days. As a result of the ruling made by a . district judge in the case of a murder suspect, all the 85,000 suspects . now on police bail in England and Wales will see it revoked unless . officers can bring charges against them within hours. The protections offered to victims by bail conditions will also go. These include: . ■ Requiring criminals to hand over their passports as part of bail. Suspects could now flee the country. ■ Insisting paedophiles do not go near schools or children’s play areas as part of their bail conditions; . ■ Suspects being forced to tell the police where they are living. ■ Victims of domestic violence being offered the protection of the court, so their abusive husbands cannot return home. Fury: Sir Norman Bettison, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, left, said they were 'on the verge of disaster' following the Magistrates' Court decision upheld by Mr Justice McCombe, right, in the High Court . The ruling also means suspects  who are not charged cannot be brought to justice unless new evidence emerges – giving defence solicitors a new legal weapon to challenge prosecution. The decision does not apply to terror suspects, who cannot be bailed. Under separate counter-terror legislation, alleged terrorists can be held for a maximum of 14 days before they must be charged. Until this year the maximum detention period was 28 days. The ruling does not apply to defendants bailed by the courts after being charged. Sir Norman Bettison, chief constable of West Yorkshire Police, described the decision as ‘bizarre’. He said: ‘We are running round like headless chickens wondering what this means to the nature of justice. It’s on the verge of a disaster now because the question being asked by my custody sergeants is, “What do we do, boss?” 'The early indications are that until this matter is appealed or new legislation is passed the issue of putting people on bail for further questioning when they answer their bail is pretty much a dead duck.’ Previously, when officers released a suspect on bail, they ‘stopped the clock’ on his time spent in custody. Concerned: Home Secretary Theresa May said Government was looking to appeal the decision which could have huge ramifications for the criminal justice system . But on April 5 at Salford Magistrates Court, District Judge Jonathon Finestein rewrote the rule book. Refusing to extend custody time for a murder suspect, he ruled that the detention clock continues to run while the suspect is on bail from the police station. Paul Hookway, 47, had been arrested over a ferocious attack on Malcolm Short, 52, who lived alone. He was first held last November for 28 hours and then released on bail. On April 5, police applied to the court to extend the period of detention from 36 hours to the maximum allowed of 96 hours. The ruling was made despite Hookway’s solicitor not opposing the extension. Court papers suggest the judge initially decided the police’s case was ‘justified’ before changing his mind on the advice of his court clerk. Hookway has not been charged and will remain free unless new evidence emerges in the case. Greater Manchester Police applied to the High Court for a judicial review but last month Mr Justice McCombe upheld the decision and refused leave to appeal. Yesterday, the Association of Chief Police Officers issued guidance explaining the ramifications. The Greater Manchester force is now seeking an urgent hearing before the Supreme Court. Home Secretary Theresa May said the ruling was a ‘matter of great concern’ and that ministers ‘were looking at whether or not it’s necessary to introduce legislation to deal with this issue’.","Suspects could only be re-arrested 'if new evidence comes to light .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 6:22 PM on 26th June 2011 . Almost 30 people are still unaccounted for following the fatal Amtrak train crash that took six lives. The driver of the truck that ploughed through the Nevada rail crossing into the California Zephyr, and the train conductor - Laurette Lee, 68, of South Lake Tahoe, California - were among the dead. But there is still confusion as 28 people are unaccounted for, and a passenger manifest suggests a different number of people on the train to the figure given by an Amtrak spokesman. Tragedy: Train conductor Laurette Lee, 68, left, of South Lake Tahoe, California - was among the six dead in the Amtrak crash in Nevada last Friday, but 30 people are still unaccounted for . Ms Lee came from a railroad family, . with her great-grandfather and grandfather working for railroad . companies, her brother an Amtrak dispatcher and her nephew an Amtrak . conductor. Two truck drivers and a train . engineer watched helplessly as the semi-trailer skidded the length of a . football field before it smashed through crossing gates and into two . double-decker cars of the train. The drivers were part of a . three-truck convoy that saw the gates come down and the warning lights . go off as the train approached. They stopped, but the driver of the big . rig in the lead did not. Investigators plan to look over the . scene for any clues as to why the truck driver skidded through the . railroad crossing on Friday - but it's expected to take up to a year to . pinpoint the cause of the crash. The unaccounted figure is ‘spongy’ as . some passengers may have got off before the crash or walked away without . telling officials, National Transportation Safety Board member Earl . Weener said. Tangled mess: Firefighters put water on the wreckage of an Amtrak passenger car . Point of impact: The spot where the westbound Amtrak train and the truck on U.S. 95 collided . ‘This is not quite like you are used . to when you get on an airplane. They record exactly who gets on, and . what seat they sit in,’ he said. ‘On a train, you can get off without . necessarily being tracked.’ ‘This is not quite like you are used to when you get on an airplane. They record exactly who gets on, and what seat they sit in. On a train, you can get off without necessarily being tracked' Earl Weener, National Transportation Safety Board member . About 20 people were injured, and the train's assistant conductor was among those seriously hurt. Mr Weener said a passenger manifest . counted 210 on board, but an Amtrak spokeswoman said 204 passengers and . 14 crew members were on the train at the time. ‘We are going to be working in the . next several days to get more of that (unaccounted) number down the best . we can,’ Mr Weener said. At the time of the collision, Mr Weener said visibility was excellent and the crossing gates and warning lights were working. Charred shell: The passenger cars sit still smouldering hours after the tragic collision . After the chaos: An Amish group from Ohio were among the passengers aboard the Amtrak train collect their stuff to board a bus . The train's engineer saw the truck . approaching the crossing about 70 miles east of Reno and realised the . collision was inevitable, he said. ‘He recalled the event clearly. He . saw the truck approaching the train. At some point, he . knew the impact was imminent. He was hoping the train was not going to . derail' Earl Weener on Amtrak train engineer . The engineer slammed on the emergency . brakes, but the train, which was going about 78 mph in an 80mph zone, . travelled a half-mile more before it finally stopped. The engineer watched the truck smash into two of the train's 10 cars through the rear-view mirror. ‘He recalled the event clearly. He . saw the truck approaching the train,’ Mr Weener said. ‘At some point, he . knew the impact was imminent. He was hoping the train was not going to . derail.' National Transportation Safety Board . investigators were returning to the crash site on Sunday to search for . more possible victims and try to rectify discrepancies in the passenger . manifest. On the way: Representatives from Amtrak, which is partly owned by the U.S. government, were headed to the scene along with those of track owner Union Pacific and the National Transportation Safety Board . Statement: An Amtrak spokesman said they are saddened by any injuries that happen and appreciated the response by emergency services . The California Zephyr from Chicago, Illinois, . was about 300 miles east of its destination in Emeryville, California, . when the truck hit the two train cars, which burst into flames. ‘It was like a bomb exploded. Like a war zone, it was . crazy. Bloody people everywhere' Passenger Justin Rhine . Witnesses had said the truck driver . didn't attempt to stop before it drove through the crossing, but Mr . Weener said the driver did try to stop because the truck skidded about . 320ft before it crashed. The speed of the truck hasn't been . determined, but Mr Weener said it was going ‘at a considerable speed’ because the impact left the tractor embedded in one of the train cars. The truck driver who died was a . Nevada man in his mid-40s, Mr Weener said. Churchill County authorities . said they were working to confirm other victims' identities and notify . family members. Passenger Justin Rhine told Fox News . after the crash: ‘It was like a bomb exploded. Like a war zone, it was . crazy. Bloody people everywhere.’ Shell-shocked: Angelica Longoria, 15, holding her brother Logan Longoria, 11 months, and their mother Antonia Cerda, who were on the Amtrak train, try to call relatives . Walking away: A truck drove into the side of the train with 204 passengers and 14 staff at a rail crossing . Abel Ortiz, 42, of San Jose, California, said he was sleeping on the side of the car that was struck. 'As I looked up, I saw the train . being ripped up. It created an opening in our car. I saw the flames come . over the windows of the side, like a quick flash of flames. Then smoked . filled up everything.’ 'There was a big bang and an . explosion and an unbelievable amount of fire went by the window. It scared the living daylights out of . me' Eugene Rheault, New .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:44 AM on 29th June 2011 . Major film studios battling online piracy launched a test case action at the High Court yesterday against Britain's biggest internet service provider. They are urging a judge in London to grant an order which would force BT to cut off customers' access to a website accused of 'flagrant' copyright infringement. Hollywood studios - including Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount and Disney - have brought the proceedings over the Newzbin website, which has around 700,000 members. 'Social evil': Major film studios battling online piracy have launched a test case action at the High Court against BT, Britain's biggest internet service provider . Richard Spearman QC, arguing for an . injunction on behalf of the applicants, told Mr Justice Arnold at the . start of an estimated three-day hearing that the Newzbin copyright . infringement was being carried out on a 'grand scale'. The general economic impact of piracy on the film and TV industry was, he said, 'nothing short of staggering'. Describing . the illegal activity as a 'social evil', Mr Spearman said the loss to . the industry was estimated to be 'several hundred millions of pounds'. A . report published last year estimated overall loss to the film industry . to be £477million in 2009 and £58million to the TV industry. The High Court action, which is being . brought on behalf of all members of the Motion Picture Association of . America, is believed to be the first in Britain where an attempt is . being made to force an internet provider to block a site under the 1988 . Copyright, Design and Patents Act (CDPA). Filmmakers want BT to block Newzbin with the same system that stops access to sites hosting child sex abuse images. Mr Spearman said the order sought was a simple one for BT to implement and 'costs nothing'. The . QC told the judge: 'The applicants and others have been making huge . efforts, not only against the Newzbin website, but against piracy in . general and yet the industries are still suffering huge losses to . piracy. 'If the order is . not made, websites such as Newzbin will simply be able to move offshore, . anonymise the individuals behind the website and cock a snook at the . courts and at rights holders who put their trust in the courts.' Studios - including Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount and Disney - have brought the proceedings over the Newzbin website, which has 700,000 members . BT is contesting the claim for an injunction, arguing that there is no jurisdiction for the court to make the order sought against it under the CDPA. Mr Spearman said the background to the dispute was a successful High Court action last year against Newzbin. As a result of orders made by a judge in those proceedings the Newzbin website was taken offline and the company that operated it was put into liquidation 'avoiding the payment of the costs order and any damages'. But the website was only offline for a 'very short while' and was now back up and running and continued to focus on providing movies and TV. The QC told the judge that apart from the addition of the digit '2' to the name to make it Newzbin2 'the only difference appears to be that the operation has been moved offshore'. The upshot was that, despite 'considerable effort and expense' in bringing a successful action against the website operators, those behind it 'continue flagrantly to infringe the applicants' copyrights'. The 'very large' number of subscribers to the Newzbin website 'continue to infringe the applicants' copyrights by downloading copies of many commercially important motion pictures and television programmes'. Mr Spearman told the judge: 'The applicants have no realistic means of bringing this wide-scale infringement to an end by pursuing the operators of the website or its subscribers.' In written argument before the court, submitting that the injunction application should be dismissed, Antony White QC, for BT, argued that if the court ordered it to block access to the newzbin2 website 'there would be nothing to stop countless other claimants coming forward demanding that BT block other websites alleged to contain unlawful material'. Rights holders in the music and movie industries 'have already identified 100 copyright infringing websites which they would like to see blocked'. BT had heard 'verbal indications from rights holders' representatives to the effect that they would like to see 400 sites a year blocked by ISPs'. Mr White added: 'Nor would this flood of claims be restricted to copyright infringement. 'Claimants would seek orders blocking access to websites alleged to contain defamatory allegations or private and confidential information.' The case continues.","Proceedings have been brought over the Newzbin website .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:06 PM on 24th June 2011 . A burglar stabbed to death after an attempted break-in was on police bail for another burglary, it has emerged. Earlier this month, John Leonard Bennell, 27, from Hyde, Greater Manchester was arrested in Tamworth, by Staffordshire police on suspicion of burglary. The development comes after Peter Flanagan, 59, was arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday following the incident in Ethel Avenue, Salford. He remains in police custody this morning. Scene: A police officer stands outside the Flanagans' home in Salford . Evidence: Police surround a tent that covers the spot where the man who was stabbed was found . Two other people were also arrested, Neil Flanagan, 27, son of Peter Flanagan, and a woman, 21, but both have been released without charge today. Mr Bennell died from a stab wound to the chest following a 'disturbance' at the house. Four . men, wearing dark clothing and balaclavas, apparently tried to smash their way . through the back door of the terraced house just before midnight on Wednesday. Released: Neil Flanagan was taken into custody by police along with his girlfriend but the pair have been released without charge . The 21-year-old woman made a frantic 999 call for police to come to the property. The victim was then carried away by accomplices as they fled, it is believed. Neil Flanagan was held by police yesterday following the incident but has been released without charge . A . second call alerted officers to the victim a short distance from the . property and he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police have made an appeal to the public to try to trace his three accomplices. The incident comes after David Cameron promised stronger support for people protecting their property from burglars. We . will put beyond doubt that homeowners and small shopkeepers who use . reasonable force to defend themselves or their properties will not be . prosecuted,' the Prime Minister said. Sylvia . Sharp-Cadigan, Mr Flanagan's next-door neighbour, said: 'I went to bed . at 10 o'clock and about 12 heard all this commotion, all voices. 'There were four police cars outside. 'I came down and said to the police 'What's going on?'. 'He said 'There's been a break-in'. 'I said 'Is anybody hurt?' and he said 'I can't say any more'.' Mrs Sharp-Cadigan, 67, said Mr Flanagan senior lived at the house with his son. Investigation: The house, which has been sealed off, backs on to scrubland. It is believed that the dead man was among a balaclava-clad gang trying to break in . Neighbour Sylvia Sharp-Cadiga revealed she was woken up by the 'commotion' She . described Mr Flanagan as a 'worker' who left early in the mornings and . his son as a 'lad' who had a lot of visitors to the house. She . added: 'We are all upset because it is a quiet little street, we never . have any bother. You don't like it on your own doorstep.' Mr Flanagan’s wife Valerie, who moved out of the home in 2000, was not at the property at the time. She said: ‘It’s such a terrible . incident. How anything like this  can happen to anyone I don’t know. My . husband is a great man and a great father – it’s such a shock.’ Mr Flanagan helped Neil run a construction company in Manchester until it was dissolved in 2007. One . neighbour said: ‘They’re just a normal family and I would never have . expected in a million years that they would have been caught up in . anything like this. ‘I’ve known the young lad Neil since he was born and I’ve known the family for years.' Probe: Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan outside Swinton police station . Another neighbour said: ‘We’re such a close community around here. 'It’s just so upsetting. Everyone is really surprised and shocked. We all try to support each other. 'Neil is my mate and he’s a hard-working normal young guy. His dad is an honest bloke that has lived in the area all his life.' The . house, part of a cul-de-sac, is next to an open area of scrubland close . to a council recycling centre in the Pendlebury area of Salford. A large area around the house was cordoned off by police tape as detectives continued their investigation. Forensic officers in white boiler suits could be seen entering the property and taking scene-of-crime photographs. Chief . Superintendent Kevin Mulligan, Salford divisional commander for Greater . Manchester Police, said yesterday: 'Clearly this is a shocking incident . and a man has lost his life. 'However, . I can reassure the community that we will thoroughly investigate what . happened last night and do not believe that members of the public are at . risk. 'I would urge anyone . who knows something to speak to officers from the major incident team . and anyone else who has other concerns can speak to my officers, who . will be providing an increased presence to provide the community with . reassurance.' Asked whether . the case raised issues over how far residents can go to protect . themselves, he said: 'We are investigating this matter within the legal . framework as it stands and I don't want to speculate on political . matters at this stage. 'If . somebody was confronted by a burglar tonight, I would tell them to ring . the police and use reasonable force to protect themselves.' Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil . rights group Liberty, said: ‘This is a problem not of law but the public . understanding of it. ‘Of course people facing intruders can use reasonable force to defend themselves. ‘But . saying that “burglars leave their rights at the threshold” is a recipe . for vigilante execution and mistaken killings of family members . returning home after dark.’ Briefing: Mr Mulligan talks to the media outside Swinton Police station, said: 'We are investigating this matter within the legal framework as it stands and I don't want to speculate on political matters at this stage' Patrol: Police had been at the scene since midnight when the 999 call was made .

"Las Vegas police apologise for the error . DNA linked to crime belonged to cousin of man jailed . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:13 PM on 8th July 2011 . Las Vegas police officials apologised yesterday for a DNA error that sent the wrong man to prison for four years. Authorities said a financial settlement is being worked out with Dwayne Jackson after determining that a laboratory technician mishandled evidence following Jackson’s 2001 arrest on kidnapping and robbery charges. ‘We acknowledged that we made a mistake,’ Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie said. Mistake: Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie explains how the mix-up occurred at a press conference . The error was exposed in November by officials at a national database known as the Combined DNA Index System. They discovered that DNA found on clothing worn by a man who carried out a robbery in 2001 did not belong to Dwayne Jackson, but actually his cousin, Howard Grissom. Police said the 2001 case involved a mother and her children confronted by an intruder in their southeast Las Vegas home. Authorities said the suspect wielded a baseball bat, stole $23 and forced the woman to go to a bank and withdraw more money. Error: Las Vegas authorities used a power-point presentation to explain how the mix-up happened . The DNA mistake was uncovered when Grissom was matched to the sweat shirt, cap and cheek swabs already on file. Las Vegas police identified Grissom and Jackson as cousins. Once DNA links a person to a crime, it's virtually impossible for him or her to escape a guilty verdict. This is because that while 99.9 per cent of your DNA is identical to that of every other human being, the remaining 0.1 per cent is unique - and there's a 1 in 100billion chance of a coincidental match. This small part of your genome contains about three million base pairs of DNA and it's these that forensic scientists look at while processing samples. The DNA profiling technique was developed by Sir Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester in the 1980s. A resulting investigation turned up the mistake by Terry Cook, a veteran forensics scientist who handled the DNA samples. The officials said the mishandled evidence led Jackson to plead guilty in 2003 to kidnapping and robbery in a plea deal that his current lawyer said avoided the possibility of life in prison on a kidnapping conviction. Jackson served four years before his release in 2006. Gillespie said California inmate Howard Grissom was linked to the break-in pending the new information but there were no plans to prosecute him in Nevada for the decade-old case. The 25-year-old Grissom is serving 41 years for manslaughter and won’t be released from prison for decades. Lab chief Linda Krueger said authorities are reviewing as many as 250 cases that Cook handled during his time at the lab. Authorities said no other mistakes had been discovered. But Gillespie said Cook had been placed on paid leave pending an internal police investigation and a review by the lab accrediting agency. Attempts to contact Cook for comment were not immediately successful. Authorities, in announcing the details of the case at a news conference yesterday, also said they released an Internet video in an effort to explain further how such a mistake could have occurred. Jackson’s criminal case was sealed July 1, and Las Vegas police and Jackson’s lawyers, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, declined to detail the confidential financial settlement now pending before the Las Vegas police fiscal affairs panel. Chesnoff told The Associated Press that Jackson wouldn’t make any public comment about the case. The lawyer said his client was handling the developments gracefully and gratefully. ‘He’s thankful now that people can believe him when he kept telling people he was innocent,’ Chesnoff said. ‘Hopefully, the clearing of his name will help him find work.’ Settlement: Jackson is line for a payout from Las Vegas police for the mistake .","Las Vegas police apologise for the error .

Accused: Andre Muller (left), the father of slain HS football star Isayah, was the 'aggressor' according to police . Dead: Isayah Muller, 19, died after a fight in the Bronx, New York, over whether something was stolen from his family's car during his graduation ceremony . Speaking to Fox 5 News Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said: 'What a tragedy. [Andre] Muller was the aggressor.' 'He [Andre] struck one of the attendants whom I believe is still in the hospital. 'He assaulted the attendant. He picked up a shovel and struck the attendant. 'Another attendant had a shank, which is a homemade knife.

The family arrived at the car park on Tuesday morning and walked to a campus for the graduation of Harry S. Truman High School students. They headed back to the car after the ceremony and just after they left to go for dinner Mr Muller noticed something was missing, police said. An argument erupted between Isayah's father and parking attendants and he accused them of stealing something from the car, police said. A source told the New York Daily News the allegedly stolen items were ‘expensive fragrances’ worth up to $200. Great player: Star running back Isayah, known as 'Zayah' to friends, led Harry S. Truman High School team to the Public Schools Athletic League championship . Isayah and Mr Muller ran to the family car where his mother and girlfriend were waiting and they drove him to a clinic and later a hospital. He was pronounced dead at the hospital on Tuesday evening. His father has been charged and police are trying to determine what kind of a weapon he allegedly possessed. The parking attendants were being questioned. Car park officials have not yet commented and it is not clear how many attendants were involved or who delivered the fatal blow. The American footballer rushed for 285 yards during the high school championship game in November, winning 23-20 over Beach Channel. His performance was the talk of newspapers and television, and he was revered by his team-mates and coach.

Winding up: Model Glenda Gilson and her brother Damien are facing jail over the alleged failure to provide financial statements in relation to the Gilson Motor Company Limited . Model Glenda Gilson is facing jail over the alleged failure to provide financial statements in relation to the liquidation of their luxury car sales company. The 30-year-old and her brother Damien were at the High Court as directors of Gilson Motor Company Limited, which is being wound up at the request of the Revenue Commissioners. Ms Gilson had filed a statement of affairs, but the liquidator is said to be unhappy about it. Her brother also only handed his statement of affairs in court yesterday, citing a mix-up which led to a delay. The company, which specialised in selling high-end cars, had clocked up more than 140,000 euro in unpaid taxes. Last month, the siblings were threatened with prison if they did not comply with a court order requiring them to to submit a statement of financial affairs for the liquidator. Ms Gilson - a former girlfriend of . Irish rugby star and captain Brian O'Driscoll - was a non-executive . director of the company as 'an accommodation' to her brother, according . to the Irish Independent. Damien Gilson was managing director of the Dublin-based company. Gary . Lennon, of Lennon Corporate Recovery, told Ms Justice Mary Finlay .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:33 AM on 28th June 2011 . The body of a man who died on a Greek island 11 years ago was exhumed today, police said. Christopher Rochester, 24, of Chester-le-Street, County Durham, died after falling 40ft from a hotel balcony in Rhodes. The exhumation was carried out to settle a long-running row over a kidney that was missing from his body when it was flown home, according to reports. Agony: Christopher's mother Pam Cummings and stepfather George watch the grave being dug up in Ropery Lane, County Durham . A Durham Police spokesman confirmed the body was exhumed early this morning at Ropery Lane Cemetery in Chester-le-Street. 'Our CID was working in conjunction with the Greek authorities,' he added. Fall: Christopher Rochester who died after falling 40ft from a hotel balcony in Rhodes 11 years ago . Mr Rochester died from internal bleeding after being left unattended on a hospital trolley while on holiday in Faliraki in June 2000. His parents won their protracted battle for justice in 2008 when one of three hospital doctors was convicted of manslaughter through negligence. But a row has persisted over the missing organ. Mr Rochester's mother and stepfather, . Pam and George Cummings, have long called for the Greek authorities to . accept their son's kidney was removed illegally during the post-mortem and . that the organ, subsequently sent to Britain, belonged to someone else, . as revealed by a DNA test they commissioned. They have campaigned for a separate investigation into the kidney mix-up. The Greeks have insisted that DNA samples were inadequate and that new ones should be taken by digging up Mr Rochester's body. Mr Cummings told the BBC: 'This is . something we very much wanted to avoid. We believed that DNA from . Christopher's mother would be enough to prove that the kidney they sent . back wasn't Christopher's. 'But sadly the Greek authorities stood by their request for Christopher's body to be exhumed and to extract DNA from the source. 'The Greeks have made it as difficult as possible for us from day one. 'But when the test results come back positive, as we expect them to, the Greek authorities will have nowhere left to hide.' Mr Rochester's mother, Pam Cummings, and stepfather, George Cummings, stayed beside his grave while the exhumation took place. The Greeks have insisted that DNA samples were inadequate and that new ones should be taken by digging up Mr Rochester's body . Mrs Cummings, 53, told The Journal in Newcastle: 'Never did we imagine we would ever have to go through something as horrific as this. 'We were by Chris's grave during the exhumation because we wanted to be there for him. 'We laid him to rest and now the Greek authorities have forced us to disturb him.' Tests on the kidney returned to the family by Greek authorities were carried out by the head of Newcastle University's Institute of Genetics, Professor John Burn. Pictured: The Greek island of Rhodes: Mr Rochester died from internal bleeding after being left unattended on a hospital trolley in Faliraki in June 2000 . Prof Burn said he established with 99 per cent certainty that the organ did not belong to Mr Rochester. Mr Cummings, 51, told the newspaper: 'Until we get the results of the new samples taken, we can only go by the findings of Prof Burn and we remain confident that the kidney sent by the Greek authorities is not Christopher's. 'If that is the case, the Greek authorities have put this family through living hell. 'To bury your child once is a nightmare but to bury your child twice is beyond a living nightmare.' He said if the kidney was proved not to be Mr Rochester's, the family wanted those responsible to be jailed.","Christopher Rochester died after falling 40ft from a hotel balcony .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:00 PM on 7th July 2011 . The devastated parents of a popular schoolboy found hanged in his bedroom told an inquest they believed his death could have been an April Fool prank gone wrong. Talented Lance Bassett, 15, from Hastings, East Sussex, was a keen practical joker and seemed perfectly happy on the evening of his death on March 31 this year, they said. In a statement read at the inquest in Hastings, his mother, Ann Bassett, 47, said she thought at first he had set up an elaborate hoax when she discovered him hanging in his room. Suicide riddle: Recording an open verdict, Coroner Alan Craze said nobody would ever know if Lance Bassett, pictured, meant to kill himself . She said: 'I am more and more of the . opinion that it is at least a possibility that this terrible tragedy was . a practical run-through for an April Fool's prank that had gone . terribly, terribly wrong. 'He . just had to get out of bed to set up the prank. It would not have been a . particularly funny prank, but it just doesn't make sense to us, knowing . what we do of his character, that he would take his own life. 'Knowing him as we did we know that his character did not match someone who would commit suicide.' She said she even believed the apparent suicide note he left was tongue in cheek because of its teasing tone. She said: 'He used the word 'dang'. He knew his father hates the word 'dang'. With his meticulous eye to the planning of his jokes he would have known this would have wound him up. 'Of course, we're aware that this interpretation could be wrong. It is possible that we just cannot come to terms with the fact he killed himself. 'We're trying to come to terms with the fact that we shall never know which of these these scenarios is correct.' Mrs Bassett said her son had been doing his maths homework in his bedroom upstairs when she went to his room to ask him to come down for supper. Practical joker: Lance Bassett was found . hanging in his bedroom. His parents think it was a prank that went wrong . She said: 'My first reaction when I saw him was that he was teasing and to tell him to stop it. 'I said 'Stop it, come on.' Then I touched him and it was clear from the movement of his body this was not a prank.' She said she had spoken to all Lance's friends and teachers at his school, Claverham Community College in Battle, and they all agreed he had never showed any signs of distress or depression before his death. She said: 'We had several visits from his school friends and they all found it hard to believe that he had taken this action himself. 'He had been exactly the same when he left them that day as he normally was. He had been laughing, joking and happy. 'His teacher said there was nothing different about him that day.' On the way home from school, she said Lance asked her advice about how to ask a girl out on a date without losing face, and said he was looking forward to a school fancy dress party. Recording an open verdict, Coroner Alan Craze said nobody would ever know if Lance meant to kill himself. He said: 'I'm left in exactly the same position as his parents, which is to take note of the evidence and to try to decide whether his death came about as a result of a definite attempt to end his life. 'I believe this was a probable suicide but not a proven suicide. 'As a father of a young daughter of about the same age, I can't begin to imagine what you as a family have gone through. You have all my sympathy.' Speaking after the inquest, Lance's father Nigel, 49, an osteopath, said: 'We'll never know for sure why he did it. He was a cheerful guy with loads of friends. 'He was always very open with his emotions, and he didn't seem unhappy at all in the days before he died. 'We will miss him forever.' Almost 2,000 people joined a Facebook tribute page which shows poignant videos of the teenager snowboarding, sitting on a beach and one of him and two friends giggling as they performed a choreographed dance routine which they put on YouTube. One friend wrote: 'Out of the 6,000 million people on the earth, you deserved to die least. You will be missed by us forever. If only you knew how much we cared.' Another wrote: 'Everyone was shocked finding out, if only you could see. You should have been out partying with all your mates leaving school, having fun.' 'We really miss you Lance and we wish we could share school memories with you in 50 yrs time rest in peace and sleep tight Lance.' Lance's headmaster Paul Swatton said: 'Everyone at Claverham Community College has been extremely shocked and saddened. 'He was an intelligent young man who was working towards his GCSEs and had a very bright future ahead of him. 'He played a full and active part in school life and was well liked by staff and pupils.'

"Says Katie's claim she never loved him was like 'a knife to the heart' Believes his marriage cost him his 'credibility as a serious actor and athlete' By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:13 PM on 28th June 2011 . Alex Reid admits that his ex Katie Price's revelation last week that she never really loved him was like 'a knife to the heart.' But despite being hurt by his estranged wife's churlish words, the cage fighter and reality star insists he has moved on, and is enjoying his new romance with Chantelle Houghton. And in a thinly-veiled dig at Price, Alex, 35, says his favourite thing about the Celebrity Big Brother winner is that she is 'a real lady.' I'm free! Alex Reid says he is enjoying being with 'a real lady' (Chantelle Houghton) following his split from Katie Price . In an interview with this week's new! magazine, Alex says: 'The great thing about her is that she’s . so feminine, a real lady. He quips: 'It’s nice to be with someone who’s a real . lady - is that a little dig?' 'She really is just so sweet, so girly. I’m cheeky. I’m like a . little kid and I play around, [I make] little bum jokes. I tone that . down a bit. She’s not a prude, she’ll find it funny, but I want to be a . gentleman.' On the rebound: Alex and Chantelle hit it off in April shortly after her split from Rav Wilding . The new couple hit it off when they sat together on a flight to Northern Ireland for the Fate Awards in April. Reid admits he got to know Chantelle through her ex Rav Wilding, an acquaintance of his, but as he believed they were still dating, was a little 'stand-offish.' But following her split from the Crimewatch presenter, she began flirting with Alex at the Our Heroes Awards in Glasgow, they shared a kiss. Reid says they are taking things slow and joke that they are both on the rebound. He also tells the magazine that he discouraged by the knowledge that their relationship may be viewed as a 'showmance.' 'What put me off was that it was going to be considered that sort of stuff. And I thought, ""'Screw that. I'm going to live my life.""' And while he is moving on with Chantelle, 27, Alex says Katie still plays on his mind. 'She’ll always have a special place in my . heart. I would have given my life for her. I am a romantic for better . or for worse, so yeah, that hurts. 'I wish it had worked out. It’s sad . because I was fighting the whole way to save it. It wasn’t my choice [to . split].' Reid says that Katie's revelation in an OK magazine interview last week that she never truly loved her him was 'like a knife to the heart. She says we're still friends, but a friend wouldn't say something like that.'

Being with her was brilliant. It opened so . many doors. It got me put on the map, even though I’d been working for . 20-plus years in showbiz. 'But . she also closed many doors.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:31 PM on 29th June 2011 . Worries: Academics claim less women became pregnant in the recession as they feared for their financial future . The global economic downturn stopped the first rise in fertility rates in more than 40 years, research reveals today. Academics found that the recession of 2008-09 led to a decline in fertility rates as young, professional women feared for their financial future if they became pregnant. The downturn which started three years ago brought to an end the first concerted rise in fertility rates in the developing world since the 1960s, the study found. In some large countries like the USA and Spain, the recession actually reversed the upward fertility trend. In others like England, Ireland and Italy, the rising fertility rates were interrupted, following a decade of generally rising fertility after 1998. The study by the Vienna Institute of Demography of the Austrian Academy of Sciences found that there were differing reactions to the recession depending on sex, age, number of children, education level, and migrant status. Scientists discovered that fertility rates in 26 of the 27 EU nations were steadily rising until 2008 (with stagnation in Luxembourg), when they then began to either decline or stay the same in 17 countries. In 2009 13 EU countries saw their fertility rates decline and another four countries experienced stable fertility rates. Decline: The Period Total Fertility Rate (TFR) representing number of children per woman either stagnated or declined in many European countries after 2008, including England, Italy and the Czech Republic . Researchers said that a rise in unemployment and general job uncertainty was a 'key factor' behind this trend. The decline could last until 2013, according to researchers, but is unlikely to affect overall worldwide population growth. Tomáš . Sobotka, one of the authors of the VID study, said: 'Highly educated . women react to employment uncertainty by adopting a 'postponement . strategy,' especially if they are childless. 'We . have noted some specific patterns of behavior; the young and the . childless, for example, are less likely to have children during . recessions. 'In contrast, less-educated women often maintain or increase their fertility under economic uncertainty.' Study: Mr Sobotka said the current recession has been serious enough to have 'long-lasting effects' on fertility . Mr Sobotka also noted that countries who have recently suffered severe debt problems such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland are likely to see much longer-term fertility declines. He added: 'Countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal, or Spain are likely to see protracted fertility declines due to a combination of very high unemployment and radical cuts in social spending.' It was also noted that for men, those with low education and skills faced increasing difficulty in finding a partner or supporting their family, and often showed the largest decline in first child birth rates. Although previous downturns were too . short to have a permanent impact on fertility, it has been said that the . current recession has been sufficiently serious to have long-lasting . effects. The study . adds: 'Massive cuts in public spending in many developed countries, . including Spain and the UK, aimed at reducing the budget deficit, will . affect social and family-related expenditures and potentially also . fertility.' The study . by Tomáš Sobotka and Dimiter Philipov from the Vienna Institute of . Demography of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and Vegard Skirbekk from . the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis is published in . the latest issue of Population and Development Review.","Downturn 'stopped first fertility rise since 1960s'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:24 PM on 20th June 2011 . The case of a young woman who died from deep vein thrombosis after nurses used a computer guide to diagnose her with muscular pain, has been referred to the Health Secretary. Rebecca Cain, 26, died after suffering a huge blood clot . in her leg in 2009 - days after she had begged nurses at a Nottingham . NHS walk-in centre for help. Rebecca Cain on her wedding day: She diagnosed herself with DVT but was 'fobbed off' by nurses before her death . Rebecca, from Radford, Nottinghamshire, diagnosed her own condition after spending just 10 minutes on the internet but nurses insisted the pain and swelling in her leg was 'definitely muscular' - and sent her home. Her husband Gareth told an inquest into her death that his wife had been in tears, saying the nurse had 'fobbed her off.' After the inquest last November, Coroner Geoff Fell ordered an investigation into the 'serious failure' to be carried out. Rebecca's widower, Gareth Cain, 29, has now welcomed the findings of the investigation, which have not been made public, being passed to Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, to check the necessary action has been taken. Gareth said: 'From my point of view, any further investigation is a good thing. I'm hoping it will have a positive impact.' Coroner Geoff Fell made a narrative verdict at the inquest in Harrogate, ruling that Rebecca died because a nurse missed symptoms of deep vein thrombosis last June, and asked for a serious case review. Gareth Cain, pictured at the November inquest, has welcomed the further investigation into his late wife's death . The inquest had heard that Rebecca had diagnosed herself with Deep Vein Thromboses after noticing pain and swelling in her right calf. She had asked the walk-in clinic for help, but a nurse at the centre relied on a computerised guide to diagnose Rebecca, rather than rely on her experience as a nurse. Rebecca, a marketing executive, was told by the nurse her problems were 'definitely muscular'. Gareth told the inquest his wife was in tears, saying the nurse had 'fobbed her off'. A few days later, while visiting friends in Harrogate, Mrs Cain collapsed and died hours later in hospital, where doctors diagnosed DVT. Mr Fell ordered a full review into the 'serious failure'. The walk-in centre used to be managed by an organisation called CitiHealth NHS Nottingham. It is now run by the Nottingham City Care Partnership, which provides services for NHS Nottingham City. A previous investigation was carried out by independent consultants Verita, which found two previous incidents of deep vein thrombosis being overlooked at the centre, in 2002 and 2008. A spokesperson for NHS Nottingham City said: 'Following the death of Mrs Cain an independent investigation was undertaken into the care and treatment she received. 'The report from this investigation made recommendations which have now been fully implemented, including additional training for staff. 'In addition, we have also ensured that the computer system used to diagnose patients has been modified to minimise the risk of any future misdiagnoses. 'We have met with the family of Mrs Cain to ensure that they are satisfied with the actions taken and to address any remaining questions they had. Mrs Cain visited the Nottingham NHS Walk-In Centre in 2009 after developing leg pain . 'We will now be reviewing all correspondence from the coroner and proactively seeking to work with both him and the Department of Health to resolve any outstanding concerns. 'We again extend our sympathies to the family of Mrs Cain and wish to reassure patients that we are committed to ensuring that they are safe and protected whilst in our care.' As the case has been referred to the Secretary of State this means the Department of Health will now review the paperwork to check all the recommendations have been adhered to. The Secretary of State will then either write to the coroner and say he is satisfied, or say he is not satisfied and ask NHS Nottingham City to do more to implement the recommendations.",Rebecca told husband nurse had 'fobbed her off' days before she died .

"Haddad axed after claim Syrians are fleeing imposters in stolen army uniform . She also said flood of terrified refugees are visiting 'relatives' in Turkey . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:34 PM on 17th June 2011 . For weeks she has been ridiculed for putting forward outlandish explanations for Syrian atrocities - all in a perfect cut-glass English accent. But the Damascus regime has finally ditched its flame-haired spokesman Reem Haddad, otherwise known as 'Comical Sally'. Haddad was absent from the airwaves yesterday in the wake of a series of interviews in which she has bizarrely claimed residents were fleeing 'armed groups' dressed in stolen army uniform, and the flood of refugees to Syria were doing the equivalent 'visiting the next street'. She also accused journalists of being swept up in an 'eyewitness phenomenon' when she was faced with requests for independent verification of her 'facts'. Scroll down for video . Axed: Reem Haddad said Syrian refugees were fleeing 'armed groups' who had stolen army uniforms . Q: Why are Syrians fleeing the country? Haddad:It's . a little bit like having a problem in your street, and your mum lives . in the next street, so you go and visit the next street.' Q: Can journalists enter the country to see the protests? Haddad: 'I know you have this 'eyewitness phenomenon' thing. But we have our cameras everywhere and we have seen no gathering.' Q: Do you find video of children tortured in Syria troubling: . Haddad: I'll tell you what I find troubling. I find troubling the misrepresentation of Syria overboard. I find troubling that there all these biased and troubling accounts of what happened. Q Why are people fleeing the army in Jisr al-Shughur? Haddad: These people fleeeing are not fleeing the army because the army is not there. They are fleeing from these armed groups... wearing army uniforms, they might be mistaken for the army. But the army has not entered, by all accounts, and this is a fact. Haddad, the daughter of a Syrian diplomat, has reportedly been moved from her position as director of Syrian TV into a more junior position. Her TV role had been an attempt to put an acceptable face on a brutal confrontation - but her antics soon earned her the Comical Sally nickname, a reference to Saddam Hussein's spokesman Mohammad Al -Sahaff - known as 'Comical Ali' during the 2003 invasion. His most famous gaffe was denying American tanks were at Baghdad airport when TV Reports were being broadcast from the runway. Perhaps Haddad's most bizarre explanation of Syrian repression was her account of Syrian refugees heading for Turkey. She said: 'A lot of them find it easy to move across because their relatives are there. It's a little bit like having a problem in your street, and your mum lives in the next street, so you go and visit your mum for a bit.' It came as Syrian troops backed by tanks and helicopter gunships swept into another northwestern city today, just days after laying siege to it. The European Union is also preparing to target Syrian businesses with tough economic sanctions. The Turkish prime minister is also visiting the flood of 9,600 refugees who have crossed the border from Syria since the repression began. Big demonstrations were expected nationwide as the Syrian people pressed on with the uprising to oust President Bashar Assad. Syria-based rights activist Mustafa Osso said large numbers of soldiers entered Maaret al-Numan. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties in the operation. Many of the residents of Maaret al-Numan, a town of 100,000 on the highway linking Damascus with Syria's largest city, Aleppo, have fled after Syrian forces swept through the northwestern province of Idlib last week near the Turkish border. Omar Idilbi of the Local Coordination . Committees, a group that documents anti-government protests, said . troops are in full control of the town. Since . anti-government protests erupted in mid-March, inspired by democratic . revolutions in autocrat-ruled Tunisia and Egypt, Assad has unleashed the . military in region after region to crush street demonstrations. Human . rights activists say more than 1,400 Syrians have been killed and 10,000 . have been detained. The . operation in Maaret al-Numan coincided with opposition calls for . protests Friday throughout the country naming it ""The Day of Saleh . al-Ali."" Al-Ali was an Alawite leader who led an uprising against French . colonial rule in the 20th century. Safe but injured: A wounded Syrian man flashes a V-sign in a medical tent next to a refugee camp in the Turkish border town of Yayladagi . The opposition has been giving a name for every Friday since the uprising began 13 weeks ago but using the name of an Alawite leader was designed to show Assad's opponents were not rising up over secular concerns. The Assad regime is dominated by the . Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, but the country is . overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim. Alawite . dominance has bred resentment, which Assad has worked to tamp down by . pushing a strictly secular identity in Syria. But the president now . appears to be relying heavily on his Alawite power base, beginning with . highly placed Assad relatives, to crush the resistance. Osso, . the rights activists, said troops are now massing around the town of . Khan Sheikhon, south of Maaret al-Numan. Earlier this month, any army . forces were attacked by gunmen in the area. Two government tanks were . damaged in the melee, the activists said. Fleeing: Syrian refugees are seen in a camp in the Turkish border town of Boynuegin . A Syrian military official was quoted by SANA, the state-run news agency, as saying the army deployed near Maaret al-Numan and Khan Sheikhon to prevent ""armed terrorist organizations"" from cutting the highway. Syrian tanks and the government's most loyal troops have been trying to prevent the uprising from gaining a territorial base for a wider armed rebellion against Assad. Some 9,000 Syrians have already sought refuge in camps in neighboring Turkey during the latest military crackdown, which authorities said was necessary to rid the area of ""armed terrorists."" The government blames a foreign conspiracy for the unrest, saying religious extremists are behind it - not true reformers. It is estimated that 9,600 refugees have crossed the border from Syria since the repression began .","Haddad axed after claim Syrians are fleeing imposters in stolen army uniform .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:20 PM on 30th June 2011 . Fatal error: Lorry driver Brian Coleman who was jailed after two men died when he did a U-turn on a dual carriageway . The driver of a recycling lorry who left two men dead after he did a U-turn on a dual carriageway has been jailed. Brian Coleman, of Calne, Wiltshire, was convicted of causing the deaths by dangerous driving of Gareth Jones and Philip Wicks when he took the short cut across a major trunk road. The 59-year-old former AA man claimed he had seen their van coming but thought he had time to complete the manoeuvre, not realising they were speeding. Coleman pulled into a lay-by at Pretty Chimneys, between Chippenham and the M4, at about 7am on July 29 last year, so his work colleagues could collect some recycling material during his round for recycling firm Hills. Coleman made the decision to complete a U-turn though a gap in the central reservation to collect recycling from properties on the other side of the road - a manoeuvre that was permitted on the road and he had completed in the past without difficulty. But a Ford Transit van, driven by 25-year-old Mr Jones, smashed into the lorry at about 70mph, leaving the driver and Mr Wicks, his 30-year-old boss, with fatal head injuries. Sentencing Coleman at Swindon Crown Court, Judge Douglas Field said: 'The manoeuvre you wished to take required particular care because of the large size of your lorry and the speed at which traffic was approaching from behind. In your mind you thought it was safe. 'You seriously misjudged the speed of the oncoming vehicles. Just before your manoeuvre was completed, the Transit van struck your vehicle with such force that it turned over. Two people were killed. 'I do take into account the Transit van was driving in excess of the allowed speed. It appears the van did not brake at all as it was coming towards you. It took no action. 'The families of Mr Jones and Mr Wicks have lost their loved ones. They were both young men with the rest of their lives ahead of them. They are greatly missed.' The judge said Coleman had never been in any trouble in the past and was heading towards retirement with an unblemished driving record of over 30 years. Coleman, dressed in a shirt and tie, stared straight ahead as the judge handed him two three-year sentences to run concurrently and a driving ban of three years. Ian Lowrie QC, prosecuting, described Coleman's actions as an 'accumulation of errors', from pulling out across the carriageway to wrongly assessing the time he had to complete the manoeuvre. He said the raw emotion of the families' grief was clear. In mitigation Luke Blackburn told the court that Coleman, who is the sole carer for his wife, had an 'impeccable' character. 'He is summarised as a man who is well loved and respected and considered a reliable, steady figure and above all honest,' Mr Blackburn said. 'He nearly retired without so much as a speeding fine. He has driven hundreds of thousands of miles.' Mr Blackburn said Coleman had suffered nightmares since the collision: 'He is not a man of stone and knows the effect of his driving on those two families.'","Former AA man gets three years for causing accident .

One of the most influential names in today’s media was well aware more than 40 years ago that television could do the thinking for viewers. Roger Ailes was planning a forerunner to Fox News in 1970 to deliver ‘pro-administration’ news for President Richard Nixon, documents show. The Republican strategist and Fox News chief launched the channel in 1996 but had ideas for another partisan station decades before then. At the start: Roger Ailes, left, is pictured in January 1996 with Rupert Murdoch, right, announcing that the Republican adviser would head Fox News . A memo called ‘A Plan For Putting the GOP on TV News’ was discovered by a Gawker journalist inside the Richard Nixon Presidential Library. It shows Mr Nixon’s aide was looking at a channel to avoid the ‘prejudices of network news’ in what he felt was the liberal establishment media. There was even a now-unthinkable idea that it would be paid for and run out of the White House to avoid the ‘censorship’ of left-wing outlets. He knew that ‘people are lazy’ because they were reading fewer newspapers - and with television the ‘thinking is done for you’. Mr Ailes was a consultant to Mr Nixon . and George H.W. Bush through his firms REA Productions and Ailes . Communications, reported Gawker. Aide: Mr Ailes was a consultant to presidents Richard Nixon, left, and George H.W. Bush, right, through his firms REA Productions and Ailes Communications . Documents reveal he gave advice on what kind of tie to wear, how to deal with Saddam Hussein and ensuring the media present the right message. AGE: 71 . BIRTHPLACE: Warren, Ohio . SALARY: $14million in 2010 . JOB: Fox News Channel chief . FORMER WORK: Republican presidential adviser . BALANCE SHEET: Fox News had an estimated profit of $816million in 2010 . He was also involved in obscure events such as the lighting of the Christmas tree at the White House in Washington D.C. Mr Ailes organised staged events to ensure better media coverage and using his contacts to stop threatening narratives before they happened, reported Gawker. But some of his ideas back then are in contrast to now - with him advising Mr Nixon to talk to high school students 30 years ago. This was labelled as ‘indoctrination’ by Fox News - the channel he set up to be ‘fair and balanced’ - when Mr Obama tried it recently. Mr Ailes did not respond to a comment request by Gawker. The revelations come as controversial TV host Glenn Beck had his last ever show on Fox News last night and thanked Mr Ailes for his support.","Ailes was presidential advisor to Nixon and Bush senior .

"Revelation came the same day she said the media 'want to see her mud wrestle Sarah Palin' By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:27 PM on 30th June 2011 . Michele Bachmann has revealed she suffered a miscarriage after an unplanned pregnancy, and says the loss inspired her to become a foster parent to 23 children. The Minnesota Republican told a town hall crowd in South Carolina on Wednesday that the experience changed her and refocused her family's priorities. She says the miscarriage was 'devastating' and that it came after when she and her husband Marcus already had two children. Scroll down for video... Michele Bachmann revealed that she suffered a miscarriage between the births of her second and third child while speaking at a town hall in South Carolina . Bachmann, who describes herself as '100 percent pro-life,' now has five children of her own. She says the miscarriage led to the belief that 'no matter how many children were brought into our life, we would receive them because we are committed to life.' Fellow Republican candidate Mitt Romney has been criticized for taking too soft a stance on abortion. She said it was devastating, even though she and her husband, seen here, had not planned the pregnancy . Earlier Bachmann claimed that the media want to see her have a ‘mud wrestling fight’ with fellow Tea Party darling Sarah Palin, who is also staunchly pro-life. Palin also has five children, and has said the experience the of having a child with Down's Syndrome strengthened her anti-abortion stance. Bachmann, who is touring the U.S. for support for her White House bid, showed yet more signs that she is growing tired of comparisons with Mrs Palin. But Mrs Bachmann’s latest bizarre campaign trail outburst is unlikely to relieve of her being associated with the gaffe-prone former governor of Alaska. Outburst: Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, wearing her trademark pearls, on the campaign trail in South Carolina, where she told an audience that the media wished to see her 'mud wrestle' with rival Sarah Palin . Speaking at a meeting in Rock Hill, South Carolina, Mrs Bachmann, 55, said of the media: ‘They want to see two girls come together and have a mud wrestling fight. ‘And I’m not going to give it to ‘em. I have great respect and admiration for the Governor.’ The Minnesota representative is seen as arch-rival of Mrs Palin, who has yet to announce whether she will run in next year’s primary contest. This is because they appeal to the same stripe of deficit-hating, gun-loving social conservatives. Mrs Bachman has been keen to stress that she in an ally of the former vice presidential candidate – but there are increasing signs that she may be willing to go to war with her. A potential turning point in their relationship occurred earlier this month when the congresswoman strategist, Ed Rollins, launched into a harsh critique of Mrs Palin, describing her as ‘not serious’. Debate: Mrs Bachman at public meeting in Rock Hill, South Carolina, yesterday . There are even claims that Mrs Bachmann may have already taken many of Mrs Palin’s supporters and is her slightly softer stance may win over more people in the middle. Although both women’s tendency to make gaffes – Mrs Bachmann kicked off her campaign by inadvertently saying she would suggesting she would work in the 'spirit’ of an Iowa serial killer – are equally likely to put off many voters. Yesterday, while speaking of the U.S. currency’s loss of value in foreign exchange markets, she appeared to blame President Barack Obama for a century’s worth of inflation. ‘In the last two years of the Obama . administration ... you have lost 14 percent of the value of that . dollar,’ she told a crowd of 800 at an hour-long evening town hall . meeting in Rock Hill. Rival: Fellow Tea Party darling Sarah Palin, at a book signing in Minnesota, yesterday, has yet to announce whether or not she will run for the White House . ‘That means the federal government has stolen that money from you. You made it and they stole it from you because they've been printing essentially valueless money and flooding it into the money supply. ‘I don't stand for that. A dollar in 2011 should be the same as a dollar in 1911. A dollar should be worth a dollar.’ But despite her gaffes, Mrs Bachmann’s words seem to please an initially cautious South Carolina audience, whose state is one of the key early nominating contests. Afterwards many felt she had the right mix of being was exciting enough without being too extreme as to be unelectable. Of the other candidates, the former governors – Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, and Jon Huntsman of Utah – were seen as too boring. The Tea Party favourites – former senator Rick Santorum, pizza mogul Herman Cain, and Representative Ron Paul of Texas – are thought to be incapable of beating Mr Obama. But Democrats are not getting too worried by Mrs Bachmann. They claim her position in the middle of the Republican pool of candidates merely demonstrates how far to the Right the Tea Party movement has dragged the party. ‘She's talented. She definitely has an appeal and there's a sense on the Democratic side that it might be even more potent than Sarah Palin,’ Jennifer Palmieri, president of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, told the Huffington Post. ‘But, you know, she is gaffe prone and she's really conservative. ‘The idea that Barack Obama can't beat Michele Bachmann is laughable to me.’",Revelation came the same day she said the media 'want to see her mud wrestle Sarah Palin'
"By . David Gardner . Last updated at 4:29 PM on 8th July 2011 . New charges: Alleged 'Hollywood Ripper' Michael Gargiulo, 35, is now accused of killing a young woman in Chicago in 1993 . A man tagged the 'Hollywood Ripper' who is suspected of killing the former girlfriend of actor Ashton Kutcher has been charged with murdering another woman 18 years ago. Air conditioner repairman Michael Gargiulo, 35, is already facing trial over the violent stabbing deaths of two female victims. Now investigators in Chicago claim he also stabbed Tricia Pacaccio to death after she returned home after a night out with friends in 1993. Prosecutors say the killing shows a similar pattern to the February2001 slaying of 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin, who was then Mr Kutcher’s girlfriend. The actor, now married to Demi Moore, told Los Angeles police that Miss Ellerin never came to the door when he went to her Hollywood Hills home to pick her up to go to a post-Grammy Awards party. Her bloodstained body was found later inside the house. Killed: Tricia Pacaccio (left) was stabbed to death in Chicago in 1993, while Ashley Ellerin (right) was killed in her home in 2001 in Los Angeles . Gargiulo is also being held for the December 2005 stabbing of Maria Bruno in her El Monte, Los Angeles apartment. According to police in Chicago, Gargiulo was a family friend of 18- year-old Miss Pacaccio, who was found by her father in August 1993 on the step of her Chicago home after she had been stabbed 12 times. Testified: Ashton Kutcher, shown in January with wife Demi Moore, testified about the 2001 death of his then-girlfriend . He lived a block away from the Pacaccios and had long been a suspect because a small amount of his DNA was found under her fingernails. But it wasn’t enough to bring charges until the case was featured on the CBS show ’48 Hours.’ According to a statement released today by prosecutors in Cook County, two men came forward after the show to say that Gargiulo had confessed to them that he’d carried out the killing. They said he told them he’d stabbed a girl in Chicago and left her for dead on the steps of her home. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said in the statement: ‘Our detectives have been committed to this case and never once wavered in their belief that we would one day be able to bring justice to it. ‘It is our hope that those who knew and loved Tricia can find some measure of peace as a result of this'. Gargiulo was arrested in 2008 after allegedly stabbing a Santa Monica woman who fought with an intruder who broke into her home.","Michael Gargiulo, 35, accused of stabbing Tricia Pacaccio in Chicago in 1993 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:45 PM on 17th June 2011 . Sentenced: Benjamin James George, 30, got life in prison for the violent death of a toddler . A 230-pound former Marine has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter in a brutal wrestling match, in which he threw the child across a bed and into a wall. Benjamin James George, 30, of Medford, Oregon was sentenced Thursday after he was convicted of murder by abuse in the death of Kacy Sue Lunsford, the Mail Tribune reported. The girl died at a Portland hospital in June 2010, five days after the assault. Prosecutor David Hoppe said previous episodes of abuse culminated in one night of 'ultimate wrestling moves' that left the 30-pound child with collapsed lungs, a lacerated liver, internal bleeding and massive head wounds. Kacy's family cried quietly during the hearing, but they made no statement in court, and left the building immediately. Mr Hoppe said: 'Hopefully the verdicts will bring a small measure of solace to Kacy's family'. Jackson County Circuit Judge Lorenzo Mejia also sentenced George to 7 1/2 years for assault, to run concurrently with the life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. George showed no reaction and expressed no remorse during his sentencing. Murder by abuse applies when a person, . recklessly or with extreme indifference to the value of human life, . causes the death of a child younger than 14 through a pattern of abuse, . torture or neglect. Tragedy: Toddler Kacy Sue Lunsford died in June 2010, after Benjamin James George used 'ultimate wrestling moves' on her . Crime scene: The home in Medford, Oregon where police say George killed the 2-year-old daughter of his girlfriend . After an emotional three-day trial, Mr Hoppe broke down during closing arguments as he discussed the assault. Mr Hoppe said there were seven previous incidents of abuse, when George had pulled out patches of Kacy's hair, stepped on her and caused her to be terrified of him. In the final assault, George had thrown Kacy 'like a piece of garbage' across a bed and into the bedroom wall, the prosecutor said. The details came from six hours of taped interviews of George by police, Mr Hoppe said. 'It's a murderer describing how he killed a child', he said. George's defence attorney, Robert Abel, had argued that George was a victim of genetic mental illness made worse by a traumatic childhood and compounded by a problematic relationship with Kacy's mother, Michelle Lunsford. The last witness, George's ex-wife, Amanda George, said she tried to break off her relationship with him several times, but George would become suicidal. Police investigate the death of the toddler. Later, George gave lengthy descriptions of how he hurt the little girl . He constantly accused her of infidelity and eventually became abusive toward her and their two daughters, punching holes in the wall, pushing the children and pulling their hair, she said. She left him, but George continued to drive past her house and once tried to kick down the door, she said. 'I slept with knives and mace. Eventually I did purchase a gun', she said. Defence witness Dr. Norvin Cooley, a psychologist from Willamette Valley, told the court George suffered from serious mental deficits, including severe depression and post traumatic stress disorder, which the expert said should be factored in as mitigating circumstances. George had a history of suicide attempts, a 'borderline intelligence and major abandonment issues, Dr Cooley said, according to the Mail Tribune. The fact that George calmly explained to police how he brutally choked Kacy from behind, body slammed her over his head and pinned her by putting his full weight on her, while pulling her leg as hard as he could, indicated he had cognitive failings, Dr Cooley said. 'His behavior was bizarre. It was amazing, he said, according to the Mail Tribune. Evidence: A technician removes a cloth from the home that looks like it may be stained in blood . George had seemed to be doing better after being placed on anti-psychotic medication, Dr Cooley testified. However, prosecution expert Dr. Michael Sasser, a Medford psychiatrist, said George was a 'malingerer' who was faking hallucinations about 'little green men' to get off easy. Dr Sasser examined George once. He told the court, 'His hallucinations are bogus. He's trying to make himself look like he has an impairment'. 'There was almost a cavalier indifference', Dr Sasser said, adding he thought George had meant to hurt the child, or even kill her. Judge Mejia said he wasn't swayed by either expert's words. 'Both testified more as hired guns than as objective (medical experts),' he said.","Benjamin James George, 30, of Medford, Oregon sentenced .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:30 PM on 6th July 2011 . A pregnant mother-of-four has been thrown out of her home after her children, aged just six and seven, terrorised terrified neighbours. Single mother Tania Wall, 38, did nothing as her boys, who are six and seven, made residents' lives hell for 18 months. Now a court has ordered the family to leave their terraced council house in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire for three months. More than 90 complaints were made to council bosses while over 70 were filed to police as the children's mother struggled to cope. Picture posed by models . Initially granted for a period of . three months, the order means that no-one can enter the property, except . council and Trust officers. An application can be made to extend the order after three months if there is evidence that it is needed. Ms Wall has also been served with a . long-term Injunction, preventing her from continuing with the . anti-social behaviour, or allowing her family to do the same. The two tearaways - who are under the age of criminal responsibility - used golf clubs to hit stones, swore and screamed at people and were left playing outside on scaffolding into the early hours. The two boys attacked a gas meter with an axe in one incident while their father gave neighbours a cut-throat gesture in another. There were dozens of reports of the brothers using hand gestures to swear and mimic guns. More than 90 complaints were made to council bosses while over 70 were filed to police as their mother struggled to cope. One neighbour, Maciej Kolodziejczyk, said he and his wife were stressed out every day as a result of the non-stop nuisance and trouble. The Polish immigrant said Mrs Wall, who is expecting her fifth child, and her children had even stopped them starting a family. Welwyn Hatfield Council took Wall to court in a bid to get her out of her council house in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, and it boarded up for three months. PC Jennifer Edwards told JPs her two sons would have been arrested for racist abuse, criminal damage and harassment if they had been old enough. The police officer said: 'They were still playing out at 11.30pm, their behaviour at that time of night was quite shocking due to their age. 'They aren't at all supervised, they treat the area of Linkfield as an extension of their own home and as a playground.' She added: 'The whole family needs a police officer 24/7. 'I have been unable to carry out any other duties for the Hollybush area, I've neglected my responsibilities there.' PC Edwards said frightened neighbours could have reported even more incidents but they feared reprisals. Mr Kolodziejczyk said his wife and young child were verbally abused and had missiles hurled at them by the two youngest boys, aged just six and seven. He told magistrates he had sold his Polish house and bought a new home in Welwyn. Mr Kolodziejczyk said: 'It was a beautiful area and for a few months, this was the best months of our lives. But everything changed.' The married father said stones and food were thrown into his garden and screaming and shouting went on after midnight. He said their friends' cars had been scratched from one end to the other and shocked relatives were too scared to visit them. Mr Kolodziejczyk said the Walls even branded him a paedophile after he filmed one of the boys sticking his middle finger up at him while walking out of school. 'I could see him from about 20 metres away and he was already showing the finger.' he said. 'His mother said he never did it, so I recorded it to show he did it. 'We want to have another child, but I can't have my wife in this stress when she is pregnant. 'You can't enjoy your life in a situation like this - every day we are stressed.' Bethan Charney, representing Wall, said the mother, who is six months pregnant, disputed much of the evidence against her children. She said: 'This is a single woman, struggling to cope with boisterous children. 'She believes she has had racist abuse and discrimination - moving this problem on is not in the best interest of her young children.' But Central Hertfordshire magistrates in St Albans backed the council and ordered the Wall family out of their home for three months. A spokesman for Welwyn Hatfield Council said: 'A Welwyn Garden City woman whose family’s behaviour has caused local residents misery, has had her house closed down. 'Tania Wall of Linkfield has been the subject of ongoing complaints since moving to the area 18 months ago. 'In a move to protect other residents in the neighbourhood, Welwyn Hatfield Community Housing Trust – in partnership with Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council and the police – made a successful application to St Albans Magistrates Court for a Premises Closure Order on Thursday 30 June 2011.' Chief Executive of the Housing Trust, John Briggs said: 'Action like this is a last resort, but where an individual or a family is causing a persistent problem we must act to help those affected.'","More than 90 complaints were made to local council .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:38 AM on 28th June 2011 . Women's fashion firm Jane Norman fell into administration today in a move which could put up to 1,600 jobs at risk. Accountancy firm Zolfo Cooper hopes to find a buyer for the stricken retailer, which closed its 90 stores on Saturday. Media reports have suggested that Jane Norman could be sold imminently in a so-called pre-pack administration deal, with department store chain Debenhams and knitwear firm Edinburgh Woollen Mill reported to be among the potential bidders. Jane Norman closed it's doors on Saturday before it was put into administration today . Pre-pack administrations are controversial because creditors, such as suppliers, can lose out as some of the debts are scrapped. Jane Norman, which specialises in selling to women between the ages of 16 and 25, is the latest retail victim of the squeeze in consumer spending brought about the financial crisis. Habitat's UK shops outside London and Homeform, the owner of Dolphin bathrooms and Moben kitchens, were put into administration last week. Mothercare, Comet and HMV are among retailers closing stores. The retailer, which also has around . 100 concessions within department stores including Debenhams, is . understood to have asked its landlords last week to defer its rent . payments as its quarterly payments deadline loomed. Around 1,600 jobs are at risk as a result of the collapse of Jane Norman . The company, founded in London in 1952, has failed to find a buyer in recent weeks but putting the company into administration may speed up the sale process because some of its £140 million debts could be scrapped. Jane Norman has been squeezed in recent months as cash-strapped consumers put off non-essential purchases and consumer confidence plunged amid fears over the strength of the economic recovery. Clothes have also become more expensive as raw materials such as cotton have soared in price, and VAT rose to 20% from 17.5% in January. Debenhams, which operates most of the Jane Norman concessions, could be interested in buying the stock and brand. Knitwear firm Edinburgh Woollen Mill has a record of turning around troubled companies after it bought 77 stores from the administrators for textiles business Rosebys in November 2008. They were merged with the assets of furnishings business Ponden Mill to create the 150-strong Ponden Home chain. Habitat:Thirty stores outside London put into administration. Around 900 jobs threatened. Homebase and Argos owner, Home Retail Group, bought the rights to the Habitat brand in the UK, the webstie and three stores in central London for £24.5million. HomeForm: . About 3,000 jobs at risk across 160 showrooms, including 1,500 fitters and designers. The private equity owned business is behind Moben kitchens, bathroom chain Dolphin and Sharps bedrooms. Administrators were called in last week. All Saints:Fashion chain on the brink of administration until Lion Capital stepped in. Lion owns La Senza and American Apparel and the deal secures undreds of jobs in 63 stores and 47 concessions in the UK, Europe, US and Russia. Badly affected by Icelandic banking crisis as Glitnir and Kaupthing held significant stakes. Focus DIY:Ernst & Young launched a closing down sale in May as it moved to shut 123 stores out of the company's 178-strong store estate. The administrator earlier managed to find buyers for 55 stores, including to Wickes owner Travis Perkins, but the collapse of the chain left more than 3,000 workers facing redundancy. Oddbins:The wine merchant was the latest victim of a declining independent wine trade in the UK, which also saw Threshers' owner, First Quench Retailing, collapse in 2009. Oddbins had hoped to push through a rescue deal but HM Revenues & Customs, which was owed £8 million by the chain, refused to vote for the scheme. Whittals Wine Merchants bought 37 Oddbins stores, securing more than 200 store jobs, but this left a further 52 stores in the hands of administrators Deloitte. JJB Sports:The sportswear chain was saved from administration after landlords and creditors backed its second rescue deal in as many years. JJB's latest company voluntary arrangement involved closing 43 unprofitable stores, placing a further 46 under review and a move to monthly rental payments. The deal enabled it to raise £65 million from investors and secure a new banking facility. HMV:The sale of its Waterstone's book chain for £53 million has been key to HMV's survival as the deal with Russian investor Alexander Mamut enabled the high street retailer to negotiate a two-year extension to lending facilities with its banks. HMV, which has around 260 stores in the UK and Ireland, is now working on a plan to reduce its estate and focus more on gadgets such as iPads. Mothercare:Mothercare unveiled plans in May to close 110 outlets and focus on out-of-town superstores. Rents will be cut on a further 40 stores, squeezing incomes for high street landlords even further. The new focus will be on out-of-town Parenting Centres, which contain its Early Learning Centre brand.","The women's shop joins Habitat, Focus DIY and Oddbins in list of collapsed retailers .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 4:07 AM on 12th July 2011 . Testify: Former police detective turned Government witness Jeffrey Lehrmann . A former police detective testified Monday that he participated in a plot to fabricate witnesses, falsify reports and plant a gun to make it seem police were justified in shooting unarmed residents on a New Orleans bridge after Hurricane Katrina. Jeffrey Lehrmann, a government witness in the federal trial of five current or former officers, said he saw Sergeant Arthur 'Archie' Kaufman retrieve a gun from his home several weeks after the deadly shootings on the Danziger Bridge. Kaufman later turned the gun in as evidence, claiming he found it under the bridge a day after the 2005 shootings that left two people dead and four others wounded. Mr Lehrmann said Kaufman instructed . him to fill out paperwork that claimed the gun belonged to Lance . Madison, whose mentally disabled brother, Ronald, was shot and killed on . the bridge. Lance Madison was arrested on attempted murder charges and held for more than three weeks before a judge freed him. Mr . Lehrmann said Kaufman, his supervisor, had grown concerned because the . judge who freed Madison didn't believe Kaufman's testimony at the . hearing. Implicated: Retired New Orleans police sergeant Arthur Kaufman is charged with covering up the deadly shootings of civilians on the Danziger Bridge . Surrounded: Ronald Madison's brother Lance is arrested by police teams on September 4, 2005, after an alleged shootout on the Danziger Bridge in New Orleans . 'Therefore, we needed a gun,' Mr Lehrmann said. He said Sergeants Robert Gisevius and Kenneth Bowen joined him and Kaufman when they drove to Kaufman's house to retrieve a gun. Kaufman emerged from his garage carrying the gun in a brown paper bag, calling it a 'ham sandwich', Mr Lehrmann said. Kaufman's attorney, Stephen London, suggested during cross-examination that Mr Lehrmann was trying to shift blame to his client and has changed his story over time. Ghost town: A caution tape floats in the wind over a walkway running alongside the Danziger Bridge in eastern New Orleans in 2005 after the shooting . Relative: Lorna Madison, right, sister of Ronald Madison, who was killed by New Orleans police on the Danziger Bridge in Hurricane Katrina's chaotic aftermath . On 4 September, 2005, Mr Lehrmann drove himself to the Danziger Bridge after a truckload of officers responded to another officer's distress call and began shooting. He isn't accused of firing his gun that day. Mr Lehrmann said he handcuffed Ronald Madison on the west side of the bridge after he was shot, then felt badly about it when another officer told him he already was dead. Mr Lehrmann said the officers immediately afterward started to 'get their stories straight'. 'We had a lot of problems because it was a bad shoot,' he said. 'What was the goal of the cover-up?' prosecutor Cindy Chung asked. 'Protect the officers from legal ramifications,' he said. Mr Lehrmann said he helped Kaufman with an initial, 32-page report that was bounced back by Lt Michael Lohman, who also has pleaded guilty to participating in a cover-up. He recalled: 'Lt Lohman became irate with Archie because he thought Archie's report was garbage. 'The lies changed whenever we needed to change them.' Evidence: A spent shell casing lies alongside the road on Danziger Bridge after the incident in which New Orleans police killed two suspected snipers accused of firing at officers in the chaos following Hurricane Katrina . Mr Lehrmann said the false accounts of what officers did on the bridge continually changed as they honed their cover story. He admitted making up the name Lakeisha for a phony witness to the shootings when Kaufman called out, 'Hey, somebody give me a name!' He said they also fabricated a witness named James Youngman and reported he lived at a large, storm-damaged apartment complex where it would be hard to prove the witness didn't exist. Weeks after the shooting, Lehrmann said he and Bowen returned to the bridge a day before crime scene technicians were to collect evidence. Lehrmann said he saw Bowen kick shell casings off the bridge where police shot several people. Gisevius, Bowen, Officer Anthony Villavaso and former officer Robert Faulcon are on trial for charges stemming from the shootings. Kaufman is charged in the alleged cover-up. Mr Lehrmann, who already has been sentenced to three years in prison, is one of five former officers who pleaded guilty to participating in a cover-up. He is the fourth of those officers to testify at the trial, now entering its third week.",Jeffrey Lehrmann claims gun used as evidence to implicate Lance Madison was taken from Sgt Kaufman's house .
"By . Fiona Roberts . Last updated at 10:15 PM on 15th July 2011 . Civil suit: Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez is suing Casey Anthony for defamation after the cleared mother used her name for the fictitious nanny . Casey Anthony could face more questions over her daughter's death, after lawyers for the woman suing the 25-year-old for defamation demanded that she testify in the civil case. Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez has filed a lawsuit against the cleared mother, claiming her life was ruined after Anthony used her name when she told Orlando police little Caylee had been kidnapped by 'Zanny the nanny'. Her legal team have asked the court to force Anthony to give a deposition next week, as they fear once she is released from jail she will vanish under a new identity. Anthony's lawyers intend to block the move, claiming she is is 'emotionally and mentally exhausted' after the criminal trial. The demand came as Orange County Jail revealed twisted wellwishers are continuing to send Anthony money, swelling her jail commissary account to $470 - but it's still only $200 more before she was cleared of murder at the end of her sensational trial. Strangers from Iowa, Pennsylvania and . even Canada have been sending $10 and $20 money orders, which Anthony . has been spending on sweets including KitKats, Skittles and Reese's peanut butter cups in the run up to her release on Sunday. But two days after she walks free from jail, she could have to give a video deposition at the office of Fernandez-Gonzalez's lawyer. The 42-year-old  is suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she lost her flat and her job and found it impossible to find work in the three years since Anthony falsely said a fictitious nanny with the same name has her had abducted Caylee. Scroll down for video . 'Wasting time': Casey Anthony asked people to search for her daughter but they say she lied when she said she did not know she was dead . Anthony stuck to her story for three . years, until her lawyer dropped a bombshell at the  beginning of her . trial and revealed that the nanny had never existed. Instead, . she had made up the babysitter using Fernandez-Gonzalez's name. She had the idea after . she saw her details on an information card when they both visited an apartment . complex on the same day. Her . lawyer says after Anthony's claims were made public, Fernandez-Gonzalez . received death threats in the middle of the night against her and her . children. She was fired from her job as a housekeeper, and her landlord said he didn't want her on his property. Fernandez-Gonzalez's . lawyer, John Morgan, told ABC News he plans to interrogate Anthony . about her daughter's death - a move Anthony's legal team are likely to . strongly oppose, saying it isn't relevant to the civil case. Mr Morgan said: 'The first question I'm going to ask her is, ""Tell us the last time you . saw Caylee"". The second is, ""Tell us when you found out she was dead"".' Pocket money: Wellwishers, including a Pennsylvania woman also called Casey, have sent $10 and $20 money orders to the jail . Sweet treats: Funds in Casey Anthony's jailhouse account today reached $470 thanks to the donations . Dismissing . their possible objections, he said: 'Everything about the death of the . child is not only relevant, it's very relevant. It's the essence of the . case. America wants justice. They want to make [Casey Anthony] sit down . and tell them what happened.' He will hold a meeting with Anthony's lawyers tomorrow to discuss the deposition. Today . they officially filed an objection, asking the hearing to be cancelled . because Anthony had suffered 'trauma' during the murder trial. They . also claim that as the dates and location of her deposition have been . made public, her safety would be in jeopardy because of the 'numerous . threats that have already been made against her'. In . a verdict that shocked America, on July 6 the jury found her not guilty of . murdering her two-year-old old daughter, Caylee. She was sentenced to . four years in jail after being convicted on four counts of lying to . police, . Behind bars: Casey Anthony will walk free from Orange County jail on Sunday 17 July .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:09 AM on 30th June 2011 . IT must have taken all her willpower, all her strength. Andy Murray’s mum cheered him on yesterday as he thrashed her favourite tennis pin-up Feliciano ‘Deliciano’ Lopez. How Judy must have steeled herself for this moment. On one hand, a mother’s pride at her champion in the making; on the other, the end of a beautiful Twitter relationship with the hunkiest player on the circuit. Victory: Andy Murray is victorious after defeating Feliciano Lopez and now faces Rafa Nadal in the semi-final . Straight sets: Andy Murray cruised past Feliciano Lopez of Spain in their quarter-final . 'My mum fancies you': Murray offers some words of consolation to his vanquished opponent . What enormous reserves of restraint . she must have called upon not to blow Lopez a goodbye kiss or give him a . wolf-whistle. But after all their mock flirting over the internet, you . might at least have expected the defeated Spaniard to send her an . affectionate Tweet. For 50-year-old divorcee Mrs Murray, whose public . infatuation with Lopez threatened at one stage to take on Mills & . Boon proportions, the dream must end. But 24-year-old Andy’s dream of . winning Wimbledon might soon be on the way to fruition on the strength . of his performance yesterday. He and 29-year-old Lopez faced each . other like gladiators on Centre Court as Mrs M looked down from a seat . in the players’ box alongside her son’s girlfriend Kim Sears. Murray had failed once again to shave . off his straggly facial hair. Steady now  Judy, but it seemed his hunky . opponent had recently waxed his chest. Onwards: Murray punches the air after securing victory and now hopes to go one better than last year's title tilt . Cheered on: Murray delighted his fans by moving into he semi-finals - a point beyond which he is yet to progress at the All England Lawn Tennis Club . Both players had both spent the . morning practising in public. Andy had his family there; Lopez, who . somehow managed to make pouring a bottle of water over his head look . sexy – was watched by a cluster of 20-something females among the crowd. They cooed and purred at every movement of the bronzed body Mrs Murray had described 24 hours earlier as ‘like a Roman god’. We asked him if he would he blow a . kiss towards Mrs Murray. ‘Do you really think this is the right time to . ask these questions, man?’ he replied, clearly in no mood to join Judy’s . fun. On Centre Court, however, the crowd . quickly picked up on the tongue-in-cheek theme that Mrs M has kept alive . through schoolgirlish tweets about Lopez and racy remarks in . interviews. ‘Come on Feliciano,’ an English accent shouted. ‘Do it for . Judy!’ Mrs Murray smiled. Kim, not so much. Andy, not at all. Ladies day: Murray's mother Judy . applauds her son's victory from the stands accompanied by Kim Sears . In the sunshine: Thousands of fans gathered on Murray's mound to watch the match . This is the third time in a row the . Scot has qualified for the semi-finals. He plays Rafael Nadal tomorrow. Asked at his post-match press conference about the continuing . flirtation between his mother and his vanquished opponent, Murray . grimaced. ‘I haven’t spoken to her about it but I was embarrassed by . it,’ he groaned. For Lopez, it will have to be some other mañana. And – until next time at least – adios from Judy. Also bidding a dejected farewell to . Wimbledon was Roger Federer, who cruised to a two-set lead before . Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga launched an astonishing comeback to win in . five and earn a semi-final clash with Novak Djokovic. This was the Swiss master’s  worst . result here since he took over from Pete Sampras as the King  of Grass. The King is dead ... long live King Murray? The lady in red: Pippa Middleton and Alex Loudon were among the spectators to see a regal performance from Murray's . Best of luck: Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and his brother Nicholas, left, talk to Judy Murray prior to her son's match on centre court . A kiss or Kim: Murray's girlfriend gets a peck on the cheek from pop mogul Simon Fuller . The British fourth seed was never threatened by the unseeded Spaniard Lopez who wilted under a relentless barrage of pinpoint groundstrokes and consistent serving. Murray served three successive aces to seal victory on his first match point and he will next play top seed Rafa Nadal or American Mardy Fish as he continues his bid to become the first British men's singles champion at Wimbledon for 75 years. Murray took the match 6-3 6-4 6-4 with the comfort of three match points to seal victory in the final game. Murray said: 'I thought it was good. I think Feliciano was a little bit tired but I served well for most of the match. I'm playing well. I'm sure in the next round I'm going to get pushed even harder so I'll have to raise my game even more.' Seize the day: Andy Murray of Great Britain reacts to a play during his quarterfinal round match against Feliciano Lopez . The British No 1 had begun his previous match against Richard Gasquet rather slowly but he quickly showed he would not make the same mistake again, piling the pressure on Lopez. The Spaniard is unseeded but a talented player on grass and making his third appearance in the quarter-finals. He had been hugely impressive in a straight-sets win over Andy Roddick in round three but few were predicting another upset here. Murray looked totally focused and a superb passing shot brought up another break point in the third game of the second set but Lopez, who has served more aces in the tournament than anyone else, quickly shut the door. The Spaniard was bound to be feeling the effects of a lengthy five-setter against Lukasz Kubot in round four, where he had fought back from two sets down, and his right thigh was heavily taped up. Lopez's stated belief that he could beat Murray for the first time in five meetings had to be called into question by his decision not to pull out of his mixed doubles match on Monday, and he was simply not playing at anywhere near the Scot's pace. A forehand volley dumped into the net gave the world number four a break for 3-2, and from there he was utterly untroubled, clinching the set 6-4 courtesy of yet another unforced error from Lopez. Murray had lost only eight points on his serve in the first two sets, and never more than two in a single game, but there were just signs at the start of the third that things might be changing. Lopez took the Scot to deuce for the first time in game three, finally stringing a series of good shots together, but his revival was quickly curtailed by another Murray break. It needed the 24-year-old to be at his best, with a forehand winner down the line followed by a stunning pass on the run. Up next: Murray now faces Rafa Nadal, who beat American Mardy Fish . Murray was nearly there, and he held to make it 4-2 without too many problems, but he began to grimace and struggle a little with his movement. The Scot did not call the trainer but in the eighth game he found himself facing his first break points of the match. Lopez, though, could not take advantage, and three successive aces helped Murray wrap up a simple victory. Now, with Federer out of the running for the final, Murray fans can finally allow themselves a glimmer of hope that maybe this is the year Andy Murray could win Wimbledon. With confidence behind Murray growing, ticket sales sites have reported that the price of tickets is soaring. According to one seller, ardent Murray fans could be willing to pay up to £20,000 a ticket to watch him if he gets to the Wimbledon final. Tickets for the men's final are trading for up £10,000 on one website. Edward Parkinson, director of viagogo UK, said: 'Tickets to see Murray are really driving sales - every time he wins, ticket prices for the men's semi-finals and final jump by around 30 per cent as the nation's hopes are raised. 'Tickets for the men's final are currently trading at £10,000. If he keeps winning, I expect some seats will go for twice this level if not more.' This time last year tickets were trading at £6,000 when Murray was still in the championships. Among the crowd showing their support for Murray were a sea of familiar faces. Pippa Middleton, wearing a red dress from high street store Hobbs' line NW3, watched with parents Carole and Michael and boyfriend Alex Loudon, from whom it was recently rumoured she had separated. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton greeted Andy Murray's mother Judy, who was at the centre of attention after admitting to having a crush on Murray's rival Feliciano. U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour put in an appearance, after cheering on her friend Federer.","Murray glides past Feliciano Lopez in straight sets: 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:27 PM on 18th July 2011 . Rebel forces have routed most of Muammar Gaddafi's troops in the Libyan oil town of Brega in the biggest boost for the insurgents' military campaign in eastern Libya in weeks. The rebel fighters have encircled Brega, an oil export terminal with a refinery and chemical plant which for months marked the eastern limit of Gaddafi's control, rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said. Libyan rebel fighters give the victory sign as they drive towards the Brega frontline in a truck as Ajdabiya residents in cars cheer them on yesterday . Undaunted: A rebel injured in the fight for the control of Brega is helped by medics . But its streets are littered with landmines, making it hard to secure full control of the area. 'The main body (of Gaddafi's forces) retreated to Ras Lanuf' to the west, Abdulmolah said by telephone. 'I am told they have some four-wheel-drive trucks with machine guns spread out between Ras Lanuf and Bishr.' The rebels have encircled the oil expert terminal Brega, although the streets are littered with landmines, making it difficult to secure the whole area . A LIbyan man mourns a rebel fighter killed during recent fighting with forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi near Brega . David Cameron and South African President Jacob Zuma today disagreed over an exit strategy for Libya. President Zuma says he wanted to . see negotiations aimed at ending the five-month-old rebellion there and has pushed for NATO to give an African . Union (AU) 'roadmap' involving talks between Libyan rebels and leader . Muammar Gaddafi the chance to succeed. 'Once there was a fight, . the AU took a very clear position -- that military intervention would . not solve the problem. You needed political intervention,' Zuma said. 'How must Gaddafi go? Where must he go? Why must he go? These . issues must be put on the table, and the Libyan people must decide,' said Zuma, whose government has accused the West of trying to . assassinate Gaddafi. NATO has been bombing Libya for nearly five . months under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians from . bombardment by forces loyal to Gaddafi, who has shown no sign of being . prepared to end his 42-year rule in the face of the rebellion. Cameron, . whose Africa trip has been reduced to two days by an escalating phone . hacking scandal at home, said he and Zuma both wanted the same result -- . a peaceful and democratic Libya. 'We both want to see a future for Libya that doesn't include Colonel Gaddafi,' Cameron said. 'The . difference is that the president sees that as the outcome of a . political process, whereas I believe for a political process to work it . has to be the starting point. That is the difference between us. That's . the gap.' Rebel forces based in Benghazi control a swathe of . eastern Libya, the western city of Misrata, and parts of the Western . Mountains southwest of the capital Tripoli, which is Gaddafi's . stronghold. While rebel fighters have been making . gains in eastern and western Libya in recent days, Russia criticised the . United States and other countries for recognising the rebel leadership . as the legitimate government of Libya, saying they were taking sides in . the insurgents' five-month-old war to oust Gaddafi. 'Those who declare recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow on Monday. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced U.S. recognition of the rebels on Friday, while in Turkey for a meeting of an international contact group on Libya - a major diplomatic step that could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds. Russia and China have taken a softer line towards Gaddafi, and neither attended the contact group meeting. Brega, about 750 km (465 miles) east of Tripoli, is the site of a strategic oil terminal. The attack could signal a new rebel push westwards from their main stronghold in the east of the country after weeks of stalemate. Gaddafi is refusing to step down despite the five-month-old rebellion against his rule, a campaign of NATO air strikes, and the defections of members of his inner circle. The slow progress of the rebel military campaign has caused strains within NATO, some member states pressing for a negotiated solution to hasten the end of a conflict many thought would last only a few weeks. Reports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis, but in a speech on Saturday he described the rebels as worthless traitors and rejected suggestions that he was about to leave the country. Brega has changed hands several times in the back-and-forth fighting along Libya's Mediterranean coast since the rebellion began in February. Rebels say taking it back will be a tipping point in the conflict on the eastern front. NATO warplanes have been attacking pro-Gaddafi forces near Brega. The alliance said targets hit on Friday included one tank, five armoured fighting vehicles and two rocket launchers. Libyan officials in Tripoli have made no comment on any fighting in Brega, and it was not immediately possible to verify rebel accounts of what was happening there. On another front, in the Western Mountains region southwest of Tripoli, pro-Gaddafi forces exchanged artillery fire on Sunday with rebels in the village of Al-Qawalish, a rebel fighter manning a checkpoint there told Reuters. Despite resistance from Gaddafi troops, the rebels have made advances in the area.","Rebel fighters make gains with Gaddafi's troops retreating to Ras Lanuf .

Nasa's scheduled launch of Atlantis on July 8 will be watched around the world as the U.S. space agency embarks on the final chapter of its 30-year shuttle programme. Officials yesterday began a full dress rehearsal for the launch of mission STS-135 at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The four-strong Atlantis crew landed on the Cape Canaveral runway in T-38 jets as final mission testing gets underway. Two weeks to go: Nasa's scheduled launch of Atlantis on July 8 will be the final chapter of the U.S. space agency's 30-year shuttle programme . Led by Commander Chris Ferguson, the astronauts will partake in the programme's 135th and final mission. Commander Ferguson said they are trying to 'savour the moment'. This week, the crew will undergo a . number of training activities before suiting-up and climbing aboard . Atlantis on Thursday to start their pre-launch check lists. Workers at the Kennedy Space Center last Wednesday filled the shuttle's fuel tank in a key test ahead of its scheduled launch. The test was added after structural . problems were found last year on a tank later used for the February . launch of sister ship Discovery. Nasa reinforced metal supports inside . both tanks. Last week's test was to verify the Atlantis tank repairs ahead of its lift-off. Final preparations: Astronauts Sandra Magnus, Doug Hurley, Commander Chris Ferguson and Rex Walheim are raring to go . 'It's very straightforward,' said . launch director Mike Leinbach. 'We fill it up, send the final inspection . team out to the pad, they'll do their walk-down... and then we'll get . the 'go' for drain. That's it.' A . week's worth of X-ray photography followed to ensure that the metal . struts withstood the extreme temperatures generated by 500,000gallons . (1.89million litres) of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen inside the . tank. The test is one of . the final milestones before Nasa launches Atlantis and four astronauts . on a supply run to the International Space Station, a 12-day mission . that is set to close out the 30-year-old U.S. space shuttle program. An . Italian-built shipping container holding 9,500lbs (4,275kg) of food, . clothing, science gear and supplies for the station is due to arrive at . the launch pad on Thursday and be loaded into the shuttle's payload bay . on Friday. In addition to . the cargo, the shuttle is set to deliver an experiment to demonstrate . how satellites can be robotically refuelled in orbit, a potential . game-changer in an industry worth more than $160billion a year. Off to a flying start: The four-strong Atlantis crew landed on the Cape Canaveral runway in T-38 jets as final mission testing gets underway . Hundreds . of communications, weather and other satellites are currently circling . Earth but none are designed to be refuelled. Once their fuel is spent, . they can no longer reboot themselves or change position and manoeuvre, . and they become expensive space junk. The . Robotic Refueling Mission is a special assignment for Dextre, the . Canadian-built robot attached to the space station's 55ft external . crane. Over the next two years, ground controllers will use Dextre to . demonstrate how the robot can handle various tasks associated with . fueling a satellite and handling minor repairs. Nasa . is retiring its three-ship shuttle fleet due to high operating costs. It has hired two commercial companies, Space Exploration Technologies . and Orbital Sciences Corp (ORB.N), to take over cargo deliveries to the . station and hopes to do the same for crew transportation within five . years. Until then, the U.S. will pay Russia to taxi astronauts to the station, at a cost of more than $50million per person.",Lift-off from Kennedy Space Center is scheduled for July 8 .
"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 3:25 PM on 1st July 2011 . She is the face of millions of unemployed Americans trying everything they can to get back into the job market. Elizabeth Romanaux, 55, had to put on a brave face as she worked as an unpaid intern for a public relations firm in New Jersey earlier this year. The former media relations manager has been building contact lists and fetching lunches as she tries to boost chances of full employment again. Trying everything: Elizabeth Romanaux, 55, had to put on a brave face as she worked as an intern for a public relations firm in New Jersey . Ms Romanaux is one of many older Americans struggling to find jobs and keep their skills up to date in the worst labour market in decades. Internships were once the domain of high school and college students - but older workers are trying to build up their resume in between jobs. ‘You have to suck it up sometimes and do what a 17-year-old would happily do and be happy about it,’ Ms Romanaux said. Margo Rose, founder of online job search advice website HireFriday, said lots of adults laid off are looking for new ways to improve their CV. She said: ‘The last thing you want to do is look the interviewer in the eye with a blank stare when they ask you: “What have you been doing for the last year?”’ Careers advisor Liz Ryan said she had never been approached by mid-career clients seeking help securing an internship before 2008. ‘There has definitely been almost an explosion of this kind of thing,’ she explained. ‘In 2008, I had about 20 of them.’ That increased to 36 annually in 2009 and 2010, Ms Ryan said. Ms Ryan says Will Smith's 2006 movie ‘The Pursuit of Happyness’ may have contributed to the uptick in post-college-age interns. Film link: 2006 movie 'The Pursuit of Happyness' with Will and Jaden Smith may have contributed to the uptick in post-college-age interns . In the film, Mr Smith's character loses everything in a get-rich-quick scheme selling bone density scanners. But in a Hollywood twist, he lands a stock brokerage internship, which, after six gruelling months, turns into a job. Phil Gardner, who analyses initial employment at Michigan State University, said the number of graduates taking internships ‘ballooned last year’. But it did ease off as the labour market improved earlier this year. Chatting: Ms Romanaux, left, talks with a colleague at Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, where she was media relations director for more than 16 years . College internships did not take off until the 1970s, when baby boomers flooded universities. From 1970 to 1983, the number of colleges and universities offering internship programs increased from 200 to 1,000. ‘If I could get someone like me for free, I would be apologetic about it, but I would do it' Elizabeth Romanaux . The rising number of older interns now represents a broader crisis in the labour market in which job seekers cannot get the kind of work they want. While the unemployment rate ticked up to 9.1 per cent in May, almost 16 per cent of Americans were ‘underemployed’ in the same month. This means they were either out of work but looking, working part-time involuntarily or discouraged from searching for a job. Labour Department data this week showed initial claims for unemployment benefits have dipped by just 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 428,000. Presentation: Ms Romanaux, left, is now a part-time consultant at the museum and had to work as an unpaid intern earlier this year during her job search . That is far from the drop below 400,000 claims that would signal an improvement in the labour market. 'The last thing you want to do is look the interviewer in the eye with a blank stare when they ask you: “What have you been doing for the last year?”' Margo Rose, online job search advice website HireFriday . Ms Romanaux, now back doing freelance consulting for the same museum that laid her off, is grateful for her internship, which ended in May. She understands the business logic of using older workers as interns and learned about social media without having to pay the cost of education. ‘If I could get someone like me for free, I would be apologetic about it, but I would do it.’ But she says there is nothing easy about starting over at 55 and it was difficult when she made early errors during her internship. ‘It was very stressful,’ she said. ‘Even though they weren't paying me, I felt badly I couldn't do it well.’","Elizabeth Romanaux learned about social media at a public relations firm instead of paying for education .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:55 AM on 22nd June 2011 . One of the advantages of ageing is the right to do things your own way. And having reached 90, it seems the Duke of Edinburgh is keen to exercise this privilege as much as possible. Arriving for a rare private lunch at Downing Street yesterday, Prince Philip stood to one side as his wife efficiently stepped into position for an official photocall with the Prime Minister and his wife. Samantha Cameron gently attempted to guide the Duke to his place in between her and the Queen, as the media advisers and spinmasters had wanted. In the line of duty: Samantha Cameron politely encourages the Duke to take his spot in between her and the Queen . Age before beauty: But independent Philip has other ideas . Carry on regardless: The Prime Minister looks bemused . But independent Philip was having none of it and instead walked to the end of the line, on Mrs Cameron's right. Reluctant to be the one to dissuade . him, Mrs Cameron simply smiled for the cameras – as a slightly bemused . Mr Cameron looked on. The four then made their way to the . White Room to celebrate the Duke's recent birthday with Stilton and . watercress tart, followed by Inverurie beef from Aberdeenshire and . rounded off with peaches, nectarines and ice cream. The Queen was said to have found the Prime Minister and his wife ‘delightful'. How lovely to see you! As the royal car arrived two men on the roof of No 10 wearing hard hats and high visibility jackets raised the Royal Standard . Welcome, Your Majesty: Mr Cameron bows to the Queen. It is understood the last time the royal couple visited Downing Street was in April 2002 for an event hosted by Tony and Cherie Blair . Past premiers: The Queen and Mr Cameron in conversation as they walk down the staircase in Downing Street which is adorned with pictures of previous prime ministers . Private party: The Camerons and the royal couple had tucked into a starter of Stilton and watercress tart, followed by Inverurie beef from Aberdeenshire and a dessert of peaches and nectarines with ice cream . Taking her leave: The Queen looked radiant in a green jacket and white gloves as she left Number 10 and headed home . Thanks for coming: The Camerons wave as the Queen and Prince Philip leave Downing Street and head back to Buckingham Palace . The royal couple arrived in their . Daimler Super Eight just after 1pm and as the car drove up the street . two men on the roof of No 10 wearing hard hats and high visibility jackets raised . the Royal Standard. Mrs Cameron curtseyed as she shook hands, first with the Queen and then with the Duke. The Queen was wearing a green jacket over a floral dress and white gloves and Mrs Cameron was in a patterned white dress with green belt. The Dean of St Paul's, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, introduces the Queen to members of the congregation after the 300th anniversary service at the cathedral . The royal couple leave St Paul's before heading off to Downing Street for lunch with the Camerons . In good voice: The Queen led the nation in honouring St Paul's Cathedral, which came to symbolise Britain's Second World War defiance during the Blitz . A 15-year project completed this month is the first time the cathedral has been comprehensively restored inside and out. It is the fourth building on the site and was designed by architect Sir Christopher Wren and built . between 1675 and 1710 after its predecessor was destroyed in the Great . Fire of London. June 21 is a significant date for the cathedral as it marks the same day the first stone is believed to have been laid in 1675. Despite the work finishing in 1710, Wren was handed his final payment on Christmas Day 1711 and when he died he was buried in the cathedral in a plain grave. It is marked with a Latin inscription written by his son that said: 'If you seek . his monument, look around you'. Over the centuries the cathedral has adapted to meet changing styles and needs with decorations being added and removed. The impressive mosaics that cover the walls were the result of a . complaint by Queen Victoria who had described the interior as 'most . dreary, dingy and undevotional'. The cathedral's famous dome is actually three in one - an outer 'skin', . an ornately decorated inner structure seen by congregations and a brick . cone between the two that supports the lantern on top of the building. The restoration scheme has seen the once blackened and damaged west front returned to its former glory. Other work included cleaning and repair of the interior, redesign and . landscaping of the south churchyard gardens, restoration of the grand . organ and adding wheelchair access to the crypt. After pausing for a brief moment for . photos Mr Cameron led the group into Number 10 where they tucked into a . starter of Stilton and watercress tart, followed by Inverurie beef from . Aberdeenshire, and a dessert of peaches and nectarines with ice cream. It . is understood that the last time the royal couple visited Downing . Street was in April 2002 for an event hosted by Tony and Cherie Blair. Earlier this month, before the Duke became a nonagenarian on June 10, Mr Cameron spoke of the country's gratitude for his work. The Prime Minister described him as a 'remarkable man who has given years of his service to our country, someone who has defended his nation in time of war, a man who has stood alongside Her Majesty the Queen for over six decades, a man who has given his time and effort and passion to so many great causes up and down the country, across the Commonwealth and indeed the world'. The Queen and the Duke left Downing Street shortly before 2.30pm. Mr Cameron stood with his arm around his wife's waist as they waved goodbye. Earlier in the day the royal couple attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral to mark its 300th anniversary. Sir Christopher Wren's masterpiece came to symbolise Britain's defiance during the Blitz and has played an important role in the spiritual life of the nation over the centuries. It was the setting for the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales and for the funerals of Sir Winston Churchill, Lord Nelson and the Duke of Wellington. It staged Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria, peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars and another commemorating the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Its Dean, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, gave the sermon at the service, before a congregation including cathedral staff, volunteers and guides. He said: 'What better monument could a man leave behind him, other than a cathedral, which has come to represent the presence of God at the heart of this amazing city? 'The much overworked word ""iconic"" has been used to describe the dome, and no one can fail to recognise its silhouette. 'The wartime photograph of the dome rising unscathed above the smoke and fire of the Blitz can be found anywhere.' He added: 'But you will be surprised to hear, the one question visitors ask when they come through our door remains ""so, do you still hold services here?"" The question is usually asked incredulously.' Earlier this month a £40 million project to clean and repair St Paul's was completed after 15 years.","It is the first visit by the Queen and Prince Philip since April 2002 .

Casey Anthony's parents are holed up at their Orlando home after receiving death threats following their daughter's stunning acquittal, which has sparked outrage across the U.S. Cindy and George Anthony said they were shocked by the 'not guilty' verdict, which means the 25-year-old defendant is poised to walk free tomorrow morning. The family, which has been torn apart by accusations of incest, rape and adultery, said it was 'too early' to know if they will welcome back their daughter. Stonefaced: Cindy and George Anthony were the first to leave the courtroom, with their attorney Mark Lippman, after their daughter was found not guilty of murder . Speaking yesterday, their lawyer Mark Lippman said that there were threats against the couple and that police were investigating. 'Obviously there's some concern but the Orange County Sheriff's Office is doing their job and they're being protected,' he said. After the verdict was read in court, George and Cindy were the first people to leave the courthouse, walking out in silence. They appeared to have no reaction as the stunning verdict was announced. 'I think they were shocked that it [the verdict] came back not guilty, but you can never tell what a jury is going to do and they were not expecting anything,' Mr Lippman told Good Morning America. 'They were shocked that the jury didn't find any sort of evidence against her even though the state did a fantastic job. Delighted: Casey Anthony shows her excitement as she is found not guilty . Relief: Casey Anthony celebrates with her defence lawyer after their victory, which has stunned America . The couple said that their reputations have been 'destroyed' by the claims of Casey's lawyers that George Anthony molested her as a child and that he helped hide the dead body of their two-year-old granddaughter. 'Hopefully they can start rebuilding their lives,' said Mr Lipmann. 'Their lives will never be the same. This case has destroyed everybody's reputations. 'Even if it is baseless, there's people out there that are going to believe no what I say or they say for the rest of their lives, they're going to believe what the defence told them.' It is not clear where Anthony will go if she is freed after sentencing tomorrow morning. Her parents, who have always been torn by their roles as both family members of the victim and the parents of the accused, said they have not yet spoken to their daughter, but plan to do so 'at some point', according to their lawyer. Casey's parents, who have been married for 30 years, publicly supported their daughter from her initial arrest in 2008, as they continued to lead the search for their missing granddaughter, to the start of the murder trial.

Grieving grandparents: George and Cindy Anthony broke down while giving evidence in the case . Drowning: Casey Anthony's lawyer convinced the jury that Caylee had drowned in accident at her parents house in Orlando, Florida . But on the shocking first day of the . murder trial, Casey's lawyers accused George Anthony of sexually abusing . his daughter from the age of eight. Defence . lawyer Jose Baez also suggested Mr Anthony had a role in disposing the . body of little Caylee, a claim Mr Anthony also denies. The . family, which has denied the defence's account of events that Caylee . drowned in their pool, said it hoped to one day find out the 'truth' of . what happened. Torn apart: The family of George and Cindy Anthony has been torn by the accusations . Their . lawyer Mark Lipmann said: 'There was a slim chance that we were hoping . to get some slither of truth during this trial and that would have been . through testimony by Casey.' He . added: 'Hopefully one day she'll tell her story, but who knows that to . believe. Everybody wants the truth and who knows whether it will ever . come.' The defence . accused Anthony's father George Anthony of sexually abusing her as a . child, and suggested the dysfunctional relationship explained Casey's . behaviour after her own daughter's death. Mr Baez acknowledged Anthony's . actions as 'bizarre' and 'inappropriate'. Four days after the defence claim Caylee died, Anthony paraded in a 'hot body' contest at a nightclub and friends said she showed no signs of distress, anxiety or depression. Mr Baez had told the court that Mr Anthony had a role in disposing of the body and bullied his daughter into keeping it all secret. On the final day of the trial, Anthony reportedly mouthed either 'it's not his fault' or 'because it's his fault' while prosecutors said she was trying to pin the death on her father. After jurors heard Anthony's mother Cindy may have left a ladder in the pool where the child allegedly drowned, prosecutors said: 'Casey Anthony would have you believe that this is all her mother's fault anyway for leaving the ladder down, let's twist the knife in my mum a little bit more.'

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 2:32 PM on 28th June 2011 . It appears Bristol Palin is using every platform she can to take a swipe at rival conservative daughter Meghan McCain. Not content with criticising her in her upcoming memoir Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far, when she accused her of complaining and felt she had to 'watch her back' around her, the 20-year-old criticised Ms McCain again when she was interviewed for Sean Hannity's Fox news programme. When asked about her 'suspicions' and 'problems' with Meghan McCain, Palin replied: 'Yeah I just want to note that we come from two very different worlds, I mean her dad's a politician and my mom's a politician, but that never defined me. Scroll for video . Candid: Bristol Palin talks to Sean Hannity about her 'problems' with Meghan McCain saying that they were very different people and that they do not speak . Family: Bristol said that Meghan let her father's job define her and has never had a job . 'We don't talk, we are not friends, nothing like that but I just want to note that we are two very different people. 'I've had a job since I was really little and, um, I don't know if she does stuff like that.' Bristol Palin's memoir has just been released and has already attracted a lot of controversy for her candid remarks surrounding her teenage pregnancy and ex-boyfriend Levi Johnston as well as her rivals on Dancing with the Stars and Ms McCain. She recalled one incident when they were in hair and make-up getting ready for  a speech during the McCain campaign and the senator's daughter stormed in, demanding to be done. Palin wrote: 'As Meghan looked at us, you could tell she was supremely irritated. ""I need to be worked on,"" she barked. When she was told she had to wait because the others were getting 'more air time' than she was, Palin claims she then screamed: 'If anyone had told me I had to do my own hair and make-up, I would've done my own f***ing hair and make-up.' In a final dig at her rival, the former Dancing with the Stars contestant then wrote: 'Surely she wasn't so self obsessed that she believed everyone else should scoot over so she could take priority.' Frenemy: Bristol slammed Meghan McCain in her memoir and said she was always complaining and 'checking them out' Speaking about Cindy McCain - who is the senator's second wife and heir to a beer fortune - she referred to her as being 'like a Queen' and said: 'I'd never seen people with so much Louis Vuitton luggage, so many cell phones, and so many constant helpers to do hair and makeup.' She said that Meghan wore thousand dollar dresses and seemed to be 'constantly checking us out, comparing my family to hers and complaining. Oh the complaining.' She also said she felt like she had to 'watch her back around her.' Royalty: Bristol said Cindy McCain held herself 'like a queen' In the years since 2008, Ms McCain has fostered her own time in the limelight, appearing frequently as a young conservative pundit in media, blogging for The Daily Beast and constantly updating her 112,000 Twitter followers. On June 17, in response to Bristol's remarks, the firebrand tweeted: '""Hi, I'm Meghan McCain"" is in no way, shape or form a pickup line. Trust me honey, you'd know it if I was hitting on you.' Ms Palin wrote that she was mystified when Mrs McCain offered to be a godmother to her unborn baby Tripp: 'I had just met her and I wondered why she wanted any type of guardianship over my child'. Though the McCains can rest east that Ms Palin seems to have saved her deepest jabs for former fiancée Levi Johnston, who has his own tell-all book scheduled for release this fall. She refers to her baby's daddy as a 'gnat' who 'cheated on me about as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates'. She writes that while her parents allegedly 'accepted' her pregnancy, he wasn't so supportive, saying the child 'Better be a f**king boy'. Ms Palin claims that Mr Johnston plied her with wine coolers before taking her virginity, then promised it wouldn't happen again until they were married. That apparently didn't go as planned, as she would become pregnant with his child shortly after. Later, she claims he admitted to seeing another woman while he was staying at the Palin home with her, and eventually, that he had gotten another women pregnant.","Also claims she threw a tantrum because she had to wait to get her hair and make-up done .

A goose-stepping 80-year-old who made Nazi salutes and who terrorised her neighbours for seven years leaving some suicidal has been handed an ASBO. Edna Beck ranted and raved for up to six hours at a time, threw her soiled underwear out of the window, pushed over a . visitor's motorbike, threatened to punch people and stole, hid and . defaced neighbours' post. She regularly insulted Muslims, Jews, Germans, Poles and gay people and frequently shouted 'Heil Hitler!', as well as goose-stepping and making the Nazi salute outside her block of flats in Hove, East Sussex. Edna Beck frequently shouted 'Heil Hitler!', goose-stepped and made Nazi salutes outside her block of flats in Hove, East Sussex . At one point, council officers were dealing with an average of three anti-social problems with her a week. She was arrested on Tuesday after a loud, disturbing rant about US President Barack Obama. PC Kevin Michnowicz, Brighton anti-social behaviour coordinator, described her as 'racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic.' Brighton magistrates heard how Beck, who walks with a zimmer frame, showed no signs of dementia or mental illness, but delighted in making life hell for everyone around her, leaving some 'depressed and suicidal.' Brighton and Hove Council received 49 complaints and many more were made to police. Goose-stepping: Edna Beck, 80, has been handed an Asbo for her behaviour . Mike Tyler, prosecuting on behalf of the council, said: 'Children were terrified of her because she called them Hitler's children. 'When challenged she treats her behaviour as a joke and relishes in the misery she causes. 'She has left neighbours depressed and suicidal.' He said she had been arrested several times but was carried on regardless. He said: 'She will continue to perpetrate anti-social behaviour wherever she lives. 'There is an urgent need to protect the community. 'She has not been deterred by the arrests.' One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'She just seems to hate everyone. 'The first time I met her she was laying on the floor and the shouting started that night. 'It's awful.' She was given an interim Anti Social . Behaviour Order (Asbo) banning her from inciting hatred, being drunk and . disorderly and shouting to cause alarm. Beck, who disrupted the proceedings constantly, said: 'I've never been anti-anything in my life. I'm for everything.' Outside court she said: 'I'm not anti-social. I'm a normal woman and everyone can tell you that.' Brighton and Hove Councillor Ben Duncan, Cabinet Member for Communities, Equalities and Public Protection said: 'We have not taken this action lightly and have done everything we can to avoid imposing an interim ASBO on an 80-year-old woman, but Ms Beck has left us with no option. 'Despite numerous offers of support and warnings from council officers and police, Ms Beck has continued to cause considerable distress to her neighbours and other members of the community with her persistent intimidating and anti-social behaviour. 'This council has a duty to protect our residents from all forms of anti-social behaviour so they can live peacefully and without fear and it is a duty we take very seriously. 'We sincerely hope that Ms Beck will now consider the serious nature of her behaviour and of the implications should she continue to behave in this manner. 'We will continue to offer Ms Beck support to help her address her behaviour and become a good neighbour.'","Edna Beck insulted Muslims, Jews, Germans, Poles, and gay people .

A furious van driver trapped a dying heart attack patient inside an ambulance after it clipped his wing mirror because he'd refused to move to let it through. Dale Barker, 46, had pursued the emergency vehicle for more than a mile to Bradford Royal Infirmary and pulled up so close to the rear doors that paramedics could not open them to get the patient out. He was also recorded on CCTV arguing with the crew. Bradford Crown Court heard that the patient, a 42-year-old man, later died. Electrician Barker, of Bradford, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving last September. Prosecutor Alisha Kaye told the court that the patient, who was not named in court, had suffered a heart attack and the ambulance crew had been taking him to BRI through heavy traffic. The court heard that while Gemma Richardson was driving the vehicle her colleague was in the back performing CPR on the patient. In the Great Horton area of the city the driver was confronted with queuing traffic, which included Barker's van. 'The sirens and flashing lights were activated and Gemma Richardson was carefully manoeuvring around the queuing traffic,' said Miss Kaye. 'All of the traffic moved apart from the defendant in his van. As the ambulance passed the defendant's van it clipped the wing mirror.' Miss Kaye said minor damage was caused to the mirror, but as the ambulance continued the driver heard a horn blowing. The ambulance driver realised Barker was following and described him being very close to the back of her vehicle. Miss Kaye said the ambulance driver felt she had to keep a careful watch on Barker's van, which impeded her progress to the hospital. The driver said she could see Barker's face and described him as being angry and making gestures towards her. A West Yorkshire ambulance like the one that clipped van driver Dale Barker's wing mirror before he chased it and obstructed it at Bradford Royal Infirmary . During the pursuit, which went on for 1.6 miles, Barker was also said to have followed the ambulance through a red light. Miss Kaye said the patient was eventually taken out of the ambulance at the hospital but he subsequently died. Barker had told police that the ambulance had taken his wing mirror off and he panicked and chased it. He described the incident as a silly mistake. Miss Kaye said Barker told police he was very sorry and admitted having a problem with his temper. Barrister Yunus Valli, for Barker, said his client was a hard-working man who contributed positively to society and he acknowledged, with the benefit of hindsight, that he should not have done what he did. Mr Valli submitted that it was a spur-of-the-moment offence which did not involve excessive speed and there had been no damage to other vehicles. He said his client had apologised for what he did to the officers who arrested and interviewed him.

'You reacted angrily to the ambulance having struck your wing mirror.' Barker was made the subject of a 12-month community order, including a requirement to do 150 hours' unpaid work.

An overweight ginger man catapulted to top spot in Next's quest to find a top model has quit the contest after receiving abuse on his Facebook page and at home. In a statement on his online profile, Roland Bunce declared he was pulling out of the competition, citing the threats as the reason. 'Just to let you all know I am quitting the next model contest,' he wrote. 'It was a big honour to win and it's . been fun but the amount of abuse I've been getting since Thursday is out . of control and I've now just been threatened. Support: A Facebook group set up in Mr Bunce's honour won thousands of fans - but some cruel users posted threats and abuse . 'Can't go into all the reasons but just know that the decision wasn't taken lightly and I can handle some insults but when people ring your house and email your work then it's not fair.' 'Thanks to everyone who has supported me but I am now bowing out before this gets any worse.'

Under pressure: Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron delivers a speech in Lagos, Nigeria, today, before flying back to the UK . David Cameron was dragged deeper into the phone-hacking saga last night after it emerged that a key suspect gave media advice to his office in the run-up to the General Election. Ex-News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis – arrested last week – acted as an informal adviser to Mr Cameron’s former communications chief Andy Coulson. Wallis, nicknamed Wolfman during his Fleet Street days, has already precipitated the downfall of Met commander Sir Paul Stephenson and his deputy John Yates. Sir Paul resigned on Sunday after revelations that Wallis had been employed by the Metropolitan Police as a PR consultant. The following day Yates quit as assistant commissioner following a suspension over his relationship with Wallis and his handling of the phone-hacking crisis. Last night the Conservative Party issued a statement confirming that Mr Wallis – Mr Coulson’s deputy when he edited the paper – continued to advise him after he had started working for Mr Cameron. A spokesman said: ‘It has been drawn to our attention that he may have provided Andy Coulson with some informal advice on a voluntary basis before the election. ‘We can confirm that apart from Andy Coulson, neither David Cameron nor any senior member of the campaign team were aware of this until this week.’ The spokesman said that neither Mr . Wallis nor his PR firm ‘has ever been contracted by the Conservative . Party, nor has the Conservative Party made payments to either of them’. But the disclosure remains damaging . for Mr Cameron. He has repeatedly faced questions over his judgment in . handing Mr Coulson a ‘second chance’ when he appointed him in 2007, . following his resignation from the News of the World. In a separate . twist, it also emerged that one of David Cameron’s most senior officials . stopped Scotland Yard from briefing the Prime Minister on the . phone-hacking scandal. The Murdochs appear before the Select Committee yesterday as David Cameron was last night dragged into the phone hacking row . Help: Conservative party officials admitted that former spin doctor Andy Coulson, left, may have got help from Neil Wallis, right, before the last general election . MPs heard yesterday how Ed Llewellyn, . Mr Cameron’s chief of staff, rejected an offer by outgoing assistant . commissioner John Yates to talk to Mr Cameron after the New York Times . ran an article alleging that Mr Coulson ‘actively encouraged’ phone . hacking while he was editor of the News of the World. Mr Llewellyn, an old school friend of . Mr Cameron and one of his most trusted advisers, flatly rejected the . offer on the grounds that it was ‘inappropriate’ and adding that he . ‘would be grateful if it were not raised please’. Sir Paul Stephenson, pictured giving evidence to the Select Committee yesterday, resigned after it emerged he accepted a free stay at Champneys spa - where Neil Wallis was a PR . No 10 yesterday took the unusual step . of releasing the email exchange between Mr Yates and Mr Llewellyn. Downing Street officials stressed that Mr Llewellyn had cleared his . response with Downing Street Permanent Secretary Jeremy Haywood. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . said: ‘After the election [Mr Llewellyn] was given serious warnings . about Andy Coulson, and in November he was offered information about . police action on new allegations. ‘Surely the Prime Minister needed to . be told, especially as on both occasions it had serious implications for . the Prime Minister’s judgment in continuing to employ Andy Coulson.’",Former News of the World deputy editor gave informal advice to Andy Coulson .
"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 3:16 PM on 28th June 2011 . Armed: Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger made frequent trips to Boston while on the run for 16 years . Notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger boasted to agents that he returned to Boston in disguise and 'armed to the teeth' several times during his 16 years on the run. He also told them that he flew to Las Vegas 'to play on the slots' as well as travelling to San Diego and even crossing the border to Mexico to buy medication. The revelations about Bulger's description of life in hiding were included in a memo filed on Monday by federal prosecutors who are objecting to Bulger's request for a taxpayer-funded attorney. After he was arrested, agents found . $822,198 in cash in his apartment, much of it in packages containing . $100 bills that were hidden inside a wall, prosecutors said, money which . is now frozen. Bulger fled Massachusetts in 1995 with his moll Catherine Greig and was finally captured last week after 16 years on the run. The 81-year-old, former leader of the infamous Winter Hill Gang who is charged in connection with 19 murders, was arrested in Santa Monica, California, after spending years on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Bulger, who was also a top-echelon FBI informant, fled Boston after he was tipped by his former FBI handler that he was about to be indicted. Cloak and dagger: Bulger boasted that he returned to Boston many times in disguise and armed to the back teeth during his 16 years on the run . Life of crime: Map showing how many murders Bulger is accused of committing and their location in the Boston area . He made the shocking disclosures while being brought back to Boston by federal agents, when he 'admitted that he had been a frequent traveller as a fugitive', Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian Kelly and Fred Wyshak Jr. said in their memo. They said Bulger admitted travelling to Boston several times 'armed to the teeth' because he 'had to take care of some unfinished business'. Kelly and Wyshak wrote: 'Bulger refused to elaborate on whom he visited, when exactly he visited, and who was with him on these trips to Boston.' Sketch: Bulger stands during his initial appearance in a federal courtroom in Boston on Friday while his brother William Bulger, left, looks on . Bulger waived his Miranda rights on the flight and boasted to the agents about the many trips he took while on the run, saying he also visited Las Vegas - a city blanketed with security cameras - to play the slots on numerous occasions and 'claimed he won more than he lost'. He also claimed to have travelled to San Diego, then crossed the Mexican border into Tijuana to buy medications, according to the memo. Bulger’s reference to San Diego is of . particular interest since he was possibly sighted there by a DEA agent . in November of 2006 leaving a showing of the Scorcese movie The Departed, in which . the villain is loosely based on him. Evidence: FBI agents carry bags believed to be full of money as they walk out of the complex where Bulger and his longtime companion Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica . The prosecutors also said Bulger told the U.S. Pretrial Services office in Los Angeles that his brother, former Massachusetts Senate President William Bulger, may be willing to help post bail for Catherine Greig, Bulger's long-time girlfriend who was arrested with him after the couple was found in California. Greig, 60, is charged with harbouring a fugitive. Kelly and Wyshak said the court should require an affidavit from William Bulger and another Bulger brother, John, before deciding whether Whitey Bulger is entitled to a public defender. Brother: Former Massachusetts Speaker of the House William Bulger exits John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse following the arraignment of Whitey Bulger . Detained: Catherine Greig, who was arrested Wednesday with Bulger in Santa Monica, is charged with harbouring a fugitive . Peter Krupp, an attorney who represented Whitey Bulger at his initial appearance in court last week, said no one in Bulger's family has offered to help him pay for his defence. In their memo, prosecutors say that during his 16 years on the run, Bulger 'financed a relatively comfortable lifestyle' for himself and Greig. After he was arrested, agents found $822,198 in cash in his apartment, much of it in packages containing $100 bills that were hidden inside a wall, prosecutors said, money which is now frozen. Prosecutor Brian Kelly suggested Bulger has additional hidden assets. The mobster also had two cell phones and . 'other items' still being analysed to determine the 'whereabouts of . additional assets', court documents say. 'He has every incentive to lie and stick the taxpayers with the bill for his defence,' prosecutors said in the filing. Kelly said in court last week that prosecutors plan to seek forfeiture of the money. Money that is earned illegally is subject to forfeiture to the government. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Wolf will hold a hearing Tuesday on Bulger's request for a public defender. Greig is due back in U.S. District Court in Boston on Thursday for a detention hearing.","Mobster also revealed he went to Mexico for medication and Las Vegas to play on the slots .

Google is currently testing out a new user interface design in Finland - and the button is conspicuous by its absence . 'I'm Feeling Lucky' was designed to take users directly to the first search result, bypassing the search results page. There has been no official word yet confirming whether or not it will be permanently removed. But since the launch of the Google Instant search last year, the button only works if the user first disables the instant search fuction. 'I'm Feeling Lucky' was first created to reflect Google's confidence that its top search result would almost always be the one being looked for. As Google continues to break new ground at a tremendous rate, perhaps the button is part of an older online mindset. Earlier today it was confirmed that the company has struck a deal with the British Library to put 250,000 books online. Time-honoured: 'I'm Feeling Lucky' was designed to take users directly to the first search result, bypassing the search results page . The works, which are all out of copyright, date from between 1700 and 1870 and have been selected by the library to be digitised by search engine giant. The material - some 40million pages - will cover the period that saw the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the Battle of Trafalgar, the Crimean War, the invention of rail travel and the and of slavery. And last week Google unveiled a new feature allowing users to conduct Internet searches searches on their personal computers simply with the sound of their voice and without touching a keyboard. Google voice search has been available for some time on mobile devices, but now everyone will have the option of searching via voice command from a regular laptop or desktop.

Resigned: Rebekah Brooks, pictured here on Tuesday, sensationally strood down as News International chief executive this morning . Rebekah Brooks this morning sensationally resigned as chief executive of News International, it was revealed. In an internal email to staff she announced she was standing down to avoid distracting attention from News International's efforts to 'fix the problems of the past'. In a statement the 43-year-old said: 'I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt. 'I now need to concentrate on correcting the distortions and rebutting the allegations about my record as a journalist.' Pressure was mounting on her to quit . after the second biggest shareholder at News Corp said she 'must go'. Even Prime Minister David Cameron had said in recent days that he would . accept Mrs Brooks' resignation. Fractures had earlier begun to appear . between senior figures at News International over the handling of the . phone hacking scandal after Rupert Murdoch's daughter apparently . launched a four-letter attack and the second biggest shareholder . declared that 'she has to go.' Elisabeth Murdoch is reported to have . told friends that Brooks had 'f***** the company' and Saudi Prince . Al-waleed bin Talal has made his position clear that she should leave. Until . today's resignation the Murdochs have said they are standing behind the . former News of the World editor but it appears that her job is becoming . more and more untenable as senior figures turning in the company on . her. Elisabeth Murdoch, 42, is understood to . be furious that her father's media empire has been thrown into turmoil . and from her apparent outburst, revealed in the Daily Telegraph, it appears she holds Brooks responsible for the handling of the crisis. Turning tide: Prince bin Talal said Brooks 'must go' while Elisabeth Murdoch said she had 'f***** the company' Rupert Murdoch, 80, has been keen to show that he is fully behind the NI chief executive last night playing the crisis down declaring that 'we only made minor mistakes' over the scandal. The media tycoon and his son James last night agreed to appear at Parliament to go before MPs investigating phone hacking after facing the bizarre prospect of imprisonment in a cell half way up the Big Ben clock tower. They prompted fury at Westminster . after initially declining the invitation to give evidence at a powerful . Commons select committee meeting next week. As a near-hysterical mood gripped the . Commons, there were even suggestions that Parliament should somehow . 'impound' Mr Murdoch’s private jet to prevent him leaving the country. Britain's top civil servant yesterday hit back at claims by Gordon Brown that officials prevented him ordering an inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal. Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell published secret papers showing Mr Brown was offered advice on the pros and cons of an inquiry, but never told what to do. Sir Gus was said to be 'incandescent' with anger after Mr Brown suggested in the Commons that the civil service thwarted his plans to hold an inquiry into the scandal at the News of the World in the run-up to last year's general election. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also poured scorn on Mr Brown, accusing him of 'rewriting history'. On Wednesday Mr Brown insisted his plan for an inquiry was 'opposed' by the civil service, the police, the Home Office and a committee of MPs which had already investigated the affair. Sir Gus's advice reveals he said there was a risk any bid to hold an inquiry would be successfully challenged in court unless ministers could show there was 'public concern' and warned targeting the NoTW 'could be deemed to be politically motivated'. But a final decision on an inquiry was left to Mr Brown. Only last week he was pictured smiling . with his arm around Brooks after an hour-long meeting at his luxury . London flat and when asked what his top priority was, he gestured at Brooks . and said: 'This one'. Prince bin Talal, who holds seven per . cent shares in News Corp, told BBC's Newsnight that Brooks should quit. 'For sure she has to go,' he said 'you bet she has to go.' Speaking on his luxury yacht, the billionaire  - known as the 'Arab Warren Buffet'- added: 'We hope that as this things unfolds the truth will come out. 'It's very important to me and my company who have been investors in . News Corp for 20 years to get this in order because ethics to me are . very important.' He added: 'I will not accept to deal with a company that has a lady or a man that has any sliver of doubts on her or his integrity.' Turning to the hacking of Milly . Dowler's phone, he said he wanted to differentiate between the News of . the World and the corporation as a whole. Remarking on allegations that James . Murdoch had known about illegal activity he said: 'I think we have to . wait for the commission that's been appointed by the Prime Minister and . look at the results.' He also urged the Murdochs to co-operate with the . investigation. However Asaud, who could lose . hundreds of millions if News Corp's stock market value crashed further, . put forward a measured defence of the company saying it should not be . 'over-criticised.' Elisabeth . Murdoch is due to be given a seat on the board of News Corp next to her . brother, James, chairman of NI, a move that had made Brook's future look more uncertain. His two . offspring will one day inherit their ageing father's empire and the . different approaches to Brooks raise the question of whether she will be . 'frozen out' amid a growing tide of public anger. United front: Rupert Murdoch has publicly backed the News International chief executive but other senior figures want are now turning on Ms Brooks . Commissioner of the Met Police Sir Paul Stephenson, left, did not inform the Prime Minister that Neil Wallis had been employed by Scotland Yard between October 2009 and September 2010 . Ms . Murdoch was a managing director at BSkyB but left in 2000 to pursue her . own ventures until recently rejoining News Corp when it bought her . production company, Shine, for £290m. The controversial deal caused uproar among U.S. shareholders who accused her of using the business as a 'family candy store'. Yesterday Neil Wallis, a former executive editor at News of the World, was arrested and later bailed over phone hacking allegations. His alleged involvement in the crisis is a further embarrassment for Scotland Yard as it turned out the 60-year-old was paid £1,000-a-day as a consultant between October 2009 and September 2010. As a result head of the Yard, Sir Paul Stephenson, also faces being dragged before MPs to explain himself and his relationship with Wallis. A former New York police officer has also claimed that News of the World journalists tried to pay him for phone details of British 9/11 victims . Devastated: Prime Minister David Cameron meets with the family of murdered school girl Milly Dowler to reassure them about the phone hacking investigation . Both Home Secretary Theresa May and an angry Mr Johnson have both demanded answer from the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Mr Stephenson briefed David Cameron at Downing Street earlier this week but sources at Number 10 said he had made no mention of the Wallis appointment whatsoever. As a mark that Brooks's prediction last week that 'worse revelations are yet to come' forms some truth, the FBI has now waded in on the scandal saying it has launched its own investigation. A source at the bureau said that they were looking into allegations that the phones of September 11 victims were also hacked by News Corporation employees. News Corporation's bid to buy the remaining 60 per cent of BSkyB was shelved this week but the company's second biggest shareholder revealed the plan will 'come back'.","Brooks says she doesn't want to distract attention from News International's efforts to 'fix the problems of the past'

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 9:14 AM on 22nd June 2011 . A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after six-year-old Owen Wightman was knocked down and killed on Saturday. The man, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, has been detained by police over the incident in Wakefield and will be interviewed tonight. It follows heartbreaking scenes as Owen's 12-year-old brother Jake confronted the terrible loss, weeping at the scene of his death. Among the tributes placed by grief-stricken family and friends, Jack left flowers, a cuddly monkey toy and a note that read: ‘You were the best bro ever. Even when we used to fight and argue I still loved you.’ Tears: Jack Wightman at the scene of his little brother's death, sitting alone among the flowers and teddy bears left in tribute to tragic Owen . Heartbroken: A family friend tries to comfort Jack as the realisation of his brother's death sinks in . Detectives have recovered CCTV images . of the car that hit Owen as he crossed a road near his home in . Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Saturday and are urging the driver to hand . himself in. After hitting . Owen, the driver is said to have got out of his car a short distance . away to inspect the damage before speeding off. Owen’s . parents, Neil, 33, and Julie, 31, who also have a one-year-old son, . Thomas, added their voices to the police appeal yesterday. ‘We have lost our baby and ask for someone to please come forward so we can lay him to rest,’ they said. ‘He . was a perfect little man who was taken from us. He walked into a room . and lit it up. He was our bundle of joy and our ray of sunshine.’ Too much to bear: Jack left flowers, a cuddly monkey toy and a note that read: 'You were the best bro ever. Even when we used to fight and argue I still loved you' Owen’s death was witnessed by his best friend, Mason Boardman, seven. The pair had been playing in the wooded area next to the busy road when Owen said he was hungry and wanted to go home for something to eat. It was as he was making his way across the road the vehicle - a hatchback type car - hit the youngster before the driver made off, only stopping a couple of hundred metres up the road to check the damage. Detective Taylor said at the scene of . the accident on Monday: ’Officers who have been working over the weekend . have recovered CCTV images of the offending vehicle. We have also . recovered items of debris from the offending vehicle. 'Bundle of joy': Owen Wightman's parents said he 'was a perfect little man who was taken from us. He was just perfect in every way, a bundle of joy' ‘Those . items and the CCTV images are with the forensic science service as we . speak and I am very hopeful that the scientists will be able to identify . exactly the make and model of the offending vehicle. ‘I am also hoping that with enhancement of the CCTV we may get a registration number. ‘That . being the case, I would appeal for the driver to come forward and give . their version of events prior to us receiving information about what the . vehicle was and prior to us knocking on their door.’ The officer confirmed that the CCTV footage had been obtained from a passing bus and the images were ‘fairly good’. Tribute: The scene of the hit and run in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, has been filled with flowers and soft toys in a tribute to Owen . Crime scene: This is the spot where a driver hit the six-year-old boy with his car and drove off . Detective . Taylor also confirmed he had spoken to Mason Boardman, saying: ‘He's . only a little boy, he's only seven, so it is very difficult for him.’ The devastated father of a Owen told yesterday how he held his dying son and begged: ‘Please don’t leave us, my little soldier.’ Six-year-old Owen was flung into the air as he crossed a road close to his home. The driver is said to have got out of . his car a short distance away to inspect the damage before speeding . off. Owen’s horrified best friend watched the tragedy unfold and then . alerted the boy’s parents. Grieving: Neil and Joanne Wightman described their son as a 'proper little lad' as they paid tribute to him following his death . Heartfelt: Members of Owen's family left their own personal tributes at the spot where he was killed . Owen’s father, Neil, dashed to his . son’s side but by then it was too late. The boy’s mother, Joanne, was . held back by onlookers because of the nature of her son’s injuries. Mr Wightman, a landscape gardener, said: ‘I went over to Owen and I was holding him and talking to him. ‘I . was holding his hand and saying, “Owen, if you can hear me, please . don’t leave us. I love you so much, you’re my little soldier.” ‘But when I looked at his face I knew really that he was gone. I knew from that blank look that we had lost him. Lovely smile: Owen Wightman, 6, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in Wakefield on Saturday . ‘There were lots of people around Owen and I assumed that one of them was the one who had hit him. ‘When I was told that the driver had driven off I couldn’t believe it. I thought, “How can someone do that to my baby?” ‘Owen was a proper little lad, cheeky and a handful. He always wanted to be out playing with his mates. He didn’t want to be stuck indoors.’ The crash happened in Fishpond Lane, . Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Saturday shortly after midday. Owen was . taken by ambulance to hospital but was pronounced dead. Mr . Wightman, who has two other sons Jack, 12, and Thomas, one, said . yesterday that witnesses had seen the man stop his car 200 yards down . the road. He got out, inspected the damage to the front of his vehicle . before getting back into the driver’s seat and fleeing. Owen’s . grieving parents appealed for the driver to hand himself in to police. He is described as young, white and was driving a grey or white small . hatchback-type vehicle. Fighting . back tears, Owen’s mother, a housewife, pleaded: ‘Whoever has done . this, please come forward because he has left two brothers behind.’ She added: ‘Owen had such a lovely smile. He would walk into a room and light it up.’ ‘A woman who was passing saw Owen’s best friend and brought him him to us to let us know what had happened. ‘His . friend said that a car had come zooming down the hill and it had hit . Owen in to the air and knocked his shoes off. He said the car drove off . straight away.’ A large number of floral tributes, soft toys and heartfelt notes have been left at the scene. One note, from his parents, reads: ‘ To mummy and daddy’s little soldier, forever in our hearts, love u always.’ Detective Chief Inspector Simon Bottomley, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ‘The vehicle is likely to have front end damage from the collision. I would urge anyone with information to contact the police.’","The arrested man from Huddersfield is being questioned tonight .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:58 AM on 21st June 2011 . Hacker groups believed to be behind a breach of the systems of Sony and CIA have vowed to unite against world governments. LulzSec enlisted the help of the group known as Anonymous in their cybercampaign dubbed 'Operation Anti-Security'. The groups announced their intentions on their official Twitter feeds at the weekend saying they would target anyone who got in their way - and that could include the British Government. One of the messages put up by the group LulzSec as it sets about on its cyber-attack against world governments . World governments, including the UK's, are at risk of being targeted by LulzSec and Anonymous . They said: 'Welcome to Operation Anti-Security. We encourage any vessel, large or small, to open fire on any government or agency that crosses their path. We fully endorse the flaunting of the word 'AntiSec' on any government website defacement or physical graffiti art.' LulzSec is believed to be behind the idea and also hinted at joining forces with other 'hacking groups' saying 'To increase efforts, we are now teaming up with the Anonymous collective and all affiliated battleships.' Among their goals, the groups declared 'immediate and unremitting war on the freedom-snatching moderators of 2011' in defiance at internet regulations. And it's not just governments that are potential victims 'Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments', the groups said. One of the main aims is to steal and then leak any  classified information including emails and documents. Sega's 'Free Pass' system recently came under attack from cyber-anarchists . It is believed their attacks are a retaliation to proposed increase in sentence for cyberterrorists in the U.S that would see people who break into the U.S. government's systems facing 20 years in prison. LulzSec says it doesn't hack for profit but 'to have fun by causing mayhem.' It was recently revealed that Sega became the latest computer game giant to fall prey to hackers. The company sent an email to users of the Sega Pass system yesterday, warning that email addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords had been obtained. However it said that no financial information was at risk. The Sega Pass system was taken offline on Thursday and all users' passwords have been reset. This comes after attacks on Sony and another games company, Codemasters. In April Sony had data stolen from the 77 million users of the PlayStation network, one of the worst security breaches of its kind. There was then a second attack when another 24.6 million computer game users might have had their personal details stolen. Personal information and passwords were taken in the hack on Codemasters earlier this month, but not financial details. The hackers who claimed responsibility for the Sony attack, LulzSec, have apparently denied the Sega intrusion.","British Government could be in the sights of 'cyber-campaigners' LulzSec and Anonymous .

"TSA: 'Our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure' By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 9:03 AM on 29th June 2011 . We've already had complaints against TSA agents of toddlers getting patted down, a woman's breasts being exposed and groping. Now a 95-year-old woman in the final stages of a battle with leukaemia has been allegedly detained and humiliatingly searched at a Florida airport while in a wheelchair - and the TSA is defending their actions. Jean Weber, of Destin, Florida, claims her mother Lena Reppert was asked to remove an adult diaper in order to complete a pat-down search. Jean Weber claims her leukaemia-stricken mother, 95, was made to take off her adult diaper by airport security in Florida, who are standing by their actions . Ms Weber has filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security after the incident last weekend at Northwest Florida Regional Airport. ‘It’s something I couldn’t imagine happening on American soil,’ she told the Northwest Florida Daily News. ‘Here is my mother, 95-years-old, 105lbs, barely able to stand, and then this.’ Ms Reppert was trying to board a plane to fly to Michigan in an attempt to be with relatives as she battles the disease, Ms Weber said. Her mother entered security in a wheelchair because she could not walk through by herself and was detained for 45 minutes. The humiliating search took place at Northwest Florida Regional Airport, pictured . But Ms Reppert was pulled aside into a separate area and patted down before being moved to another room to protect her privacy. Security staff then said they needed her diaper removed because it was soiled and was preventing them from completing their search. Ms Weber, who removed her mother's diaper in a bathroom for her, said she did not understand why her mother had such an extensive search. The TSA released a statement defending its agents' actions in the search. 'While every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner,' the TSA said. 'We have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure.' A TSA spokesman told the Northwest Florida Daily News it would be dangerous for them to exempt any group from screening. ‘We know from intelligence that there are terrorists out there that would then exploit that vulnerability,’ a TSA spokesman said. Wheelchairs are swabbed for explosives and patted-down, the spokesman said.",TSA: 'Our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:28 PM on 22nd June 2011 . A mother was left stunned when she logged on to Facebook to find a message from the son she had given up for adoption over 30 years ago. Pat Corlett, from Liverpool, was contacted by 36-year-old Chris Haworth - who she had not seen since he was six days old - on the social networking site last year. The message began 'Hi my name is Chris and I was born on . 22nd June 1975.' He then went on to ask her to contact him but added, 'You . may not want to reply to this.' Pat, 54, who works as a courier for the Probation Service, said: 'It was like a bomb going off, but a nice bomb.' Reunited: Chris Haworth, who works as a coach driver, traced his birth mother Pat Corlett through Social Services, and then contacted her via Facebook . When she responded she asked him what name she had given him at birth - and knew she had found her son when he replied, 'David'. She discovered that Chris - who kept his birth name as a middle name - worked as a coach driver and had enjoyed a happy childhood in the Lakes after being adopted. And the arrival back in her life of her first-born has special resonance . for Pat, who went on to have two more sons. Eight years ago her youngest boy, Michael, died at the age of just seven after losing a battle . with cancer. 'Chris coming back in our lives is like the rounding off of a story,' Pat said. 'He . can never replace Michael, of course, but to have him with us is a real . happy ending.' Pat revealed that she had always wanted to trace Chris - but he beat her to it, enlisting the help of Social Services before he finally managed to pinpoint her on Facebook. 'I always said I'd never trace him, that it might be too disruptive for . him or upsetting, but I often wondered whether he would try to find me,' Pat said. 'The answer came via that message on Facebook and it was overwhelming.' Pat first became pregnant when she was 18 and working away from home in a Lake District guest house. 'I was in a relationship that I thought would work out,' she explained. But the couple parted and it was only after the split that Pat found . herself pregnant. Aware that the relationship would not last she did not tell her boyfriend about the baby. 'I was facing being on my own with a child and it was daunting,' she said. 'Back . then, in 1975, single mothers were viewed very differently to how they . are now; there was a stigma. 'Plus, I just didn't know how I would be able to work and look after a baby,' Pat admitted. 'I was brought up in Liverpool as an only child in an all-female . household with my mum and my great aunt who held a lot of Victorian . views and values. ""They were also very active in the church and the community. There was no way I could go home pregnant. 'It was daunting to think about keeping the baby but equally daunting thinking about giving him away."" She gave birth to her son in a hospital in . Barrow and stayed with him for six days before handing him over to . adoption authorities - admitting she did not want him to have the same kind of upbringing as she had experienced. 'My mother went to work in the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and met my . father who was from the Belgian Congo. They later divorced and we lost . contact so I never knew him. 'I didn't want that for my son. I wanted him to have a mum and dad. I was very upset but I'd made the decision.' Pat went on to marry her husband of 33 years . Bob, who she told about her adopted son - but they faced an uphill struggle to conceive a child of their own. Together again: Chris - who was called David at birth - has met up with Pat and her 18-year-old son Andrew (left) whom she had with husband Bob . 'It was especially painful, of course, because of the baby I had given . up,' Pat said. 'I thought about him every day, especially as we were trying so hard . to have children.In the end we started to look into adoption."" Eventually, 14 years after they had married, Pat fell pregnant with their oldest son Andrew, who is now 18, and had Michael three years later. But in 2003 their younger son was diagnosed with Burkett's . lymphoma. After battling a series of illnesses, including a stroke and . septicaemia, he finally succumbed to his illness and he died aged just . seven. 'Andrew was only a child at the time and I remember him asking: 'can't I have another brother?' 'By the time he was 15 or so he asked again about whether we might adopt . and it was then that I told him he did have another, much older, . brother somewhere else but I would never trace him. 'I didn't even know if he'd been told he was adopted; I just felt it might open a can of worms.' Pat admitted that finding the Facebook message from Chris had left her 'stunned' - and that she was even more nervous when they finally arranged to meet. 'It was a strange feeling,' she said. 'I was excited but not overly so. I wondered . whether he would like me, whether he'd like my husband and son and I . worried about the complications it might bring.' ""I was very nervous but we all just got on like a house on fire. It was fantastic. And the boys get along wonderfully.' 'Of course there are times when I wish I could turn the clock back,' she added. 'I wish Chris could have met my mum and Michael. 'But I have a son back. I feel very blessed.""","Pat Corlett had not seen son since he was six days old .

"By . Jacqui Goddard . Last updated at 11:11 PM on 27th June 2011 . Casey Anthony’s own defence team had her trial halted temporarily so that psychologists could determine whether or not she was mentally fit for trial, it emerged today. Trial goes on: Casey Anthony appeared in court today after a break in session on Saturday . In a bizarre turn of events, Judge Belvin Perry revealed at the start of proceedings in Orlando, Florida, today that Anthony, 25, had been examined by three state-appointed mental health experts over the weekend, after a motion filed by her lawyers brought proceedings to a sudden halt on Saturday. The episode came amid bafflement by legal commentators over where the accused murderer’s defence case is going. Five weeks into the trial her lead . lawyer, Jose Baez, has still not backed claims made during his opening . statement that Anthony’s behaviour following the death of her . two-year-old daughter Caylee in June 2008 stemmed from deep-rooted . psychological issues caused by her father sexually molesting her as a . child. In a separate . development, another of Anthony’s lawyers was today reported to have . filed a motion for a mistrial, attempting to have the death penalty . taken off the table as their client fights to save herself from a . first-degree murder conviction and possible execution. Today jurors were handed pieces of rubbish to smell. The debris, collected from Casey Anthony's car, was given to jurors to 'prove' that the foul smell prosecutors argued was a 'stench of death' was just rotting rubbish. Prosecutor Jeff Ashton asked the judge for permission to let the jurors smell for themselves, handing them a box and other rubbish that had been found in Anthony's car. Conference: Chief Judge Belvin Perry (L) confers with defense attorneys Cheney Mason (C) and Jose Baez (R) at the Orange County Courthouse today . Tense: Casey Anthony waits in court with her attorneys Cheney Mason (L) and Anne Finnell (R) today . Attorney . Ann Finnell, a death penalty expert, was said to have filed the motion . based on a ruling made by a judge in Miami last week relating to a 1991 . murder case. In that case, . the way in which the death penalty was applied was deemed . unconstitutional, though it does not automatically apply to every other . capital case. Despite the . manoeuvre, which was not immediately addressed in court, Anthony’s trial . continued this morning with evidence from the lead detective in the . case, following an address by Judge Perry explaining Saturday’s delay. 'On Saturday the defence team filed a motion to determine competency to proceed,' the judge revealed. 'Based . on that motion, the court ordered the defendant to be examined by three . psychologists to determine her competency to proceed.' Anthony - who on Saturday had appeared agitated with her lawyers, at one point gritting her teeth and snarling aggressively at defence team member Cheney Mason – sat calmly, reading legal documents and sometimes smiling, as she awaited the start of today’s court session. Judge Perry said that based on the independent psychologists’ reports, 'the court will find that the defendant is competent to continue.' The experts’ exact findings will remain secret. 'Those reports will be filed but pursuant to law those reports will remain under seal,' said the judge. Beginning: Defence attorney Jose Baez, centre, comes to the defence table where Casey Anthony sits before today's session . Huddle: Defense attorneys Ann Finnell, left, and Dorothy Clay Sims talk before today's trial . Anthony is accused of murdering her daughter by overpowering her with chloroform and then sealing her nose and mouth with duct tape, to free her up to 'live the good life', prosecutors allege. She has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, aggravated child abuse and providing false information to law enforcement. She was arrested in July 2008 after her mother, Cindy Anthony, became suspicious of her stories as to Caylee’s whereabouts. Anthony told her mother that the little girl was with a nanny but, when challenged further by her mother and law enforcement, claimed that Caylee had been kidnapped by the nanny. The nanny later turned out to be non-existent - one of several 'imaginary friends' that Anthony dreamed up, Mr Baez has admitted to the court. At the start of the trial last month, Anthony’s defence again changed as Mr Baez claimed that Caylee had actually drowned accidentally in the family’s pool on June 16, 2008, but that the child’s mother had covered it up out of fear. WFTV legal analyst Bill Sheaffer explained that the attempt to have her declared incompetent for trial did not amount to an attempt at an insanity defence. Tragic: An image projected on a courtroom monitor last week showed Cindy Anthony (L) with her granddaughter Caylee . 'Like so many things we have seen in this trial, that’s unusual what we have just seen happen….but there’s a difference between employing the insanity defence and issues of competency to proceed. 'An insanity defence must be put by the defence before you ever go to trial in a case – it means you were insane at the time of the commission of the defence and basically boils down to that you didn’t know the difference between right and wrong. 'Competency to proceed' says that at any time during proceedings either the court, the defence or the prosecution feels that this client is not able to participate in their defence in a meaningful way, that the court should conduct an inquiry into whether or not the client is competent to proceed. 'Obviously Mr Mason or others thought that Casey’s emotional state was such that she could not proceed to help the defence.'","Defence called for Anthony to be seen by psychologists .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:44 PM on 2nd July 2011 . Criticism: Judith Hackitt said the HSE would target officials who wrongly used health and safety to stop everyday activities . Misguided 'jobsworths' are robbing children of educational experiences and fun in school playgrounds by applying over-zealous safety laws for fear of being sued, experts have warned. The chairman of the Health and Safety Executive accused employers of cynically using health and safety rules as a 'convenient excuse' for avoiding activities that might cost money or expose them to being sued for personal injury. Judith Hackitt said school playgrounds have been turned into 'joyless no-go zones' which risk harming children's education due to bureaucrats' fear of being sued. Warning that 'the gloves are off', Ms Hackitt warned that her organisation is ready to take on the officials who use health and safety rules as a scapegoat when they make 'daft decisions' to ban innocuous activities. Health and safety rules were wrongly blamed for decisions to make children wear goggles when playing conkers, to ban running at a pancake race and to stop tennis fans watching the Wimbledon action on big screens from Murray Mount, she said. Ms Hackitt told the Daily Telegraph that health and safety had become 'shorthand for someone, somewhere, stopping someone from doing something they want to'. She sent out a message to anyone using it as an excuse: 'Don't use health and safety law as a convenient scapegoat or we will challenge you.' Excessive and unnecessary application of restrictions on unfounded health and safety grounds threatens to spoil children's experience of growing up, said Ms Hackitt. 'The creeping culture of risk-aversion and fear of litigation... puts at risk our children's education and preparation for adult life,' she said. 'Children today are denied - often on spurious health and safety grounds - many of the formative experiences that shaped my generation. 'Playgrounds have become joyless, for fear of a few cuts and bruises. 'No-go zones': Ms Hackitt said over-zealous safety laws have turned children's playgrounds into 'joyless' areas . Science in the classroom is becoming sterile and uninspiring.' Ms Hackitt is no stranger to hazardous school activities, having previously set her hands alight in a Year 11 science class to spark teenagers' interest in the subject. Her comments today were aimed at stopping the 'creeping culture of risk aversion and fear of litigation'. In many cases, the people behind unreasonable rulings were 'well-meaning but misguided jobsworths' who have the public interest at heart but go too far, she said. But she added: 'A trend of far more concern to me is the use of health and safety as a convenient excuse by employers and other organisations cynically looking for a way to disguise their real motives.' 'The creeping culture of risk-aversion and fear of litigation... puts at risk our children's education and preparation for adult life,' she said. 'Danger': Ms Hackitt criticised the decision by Wimbledon bosses to close Murray Mount during wet weather incase someone slipped . Ms Hackitt said that to a large degree, organisations imposed health and safety restrictions less from a concern for people's safety, but from fear of no-win no-fee lawsuits for personal injury. Ms Hackitt's comments came as Education Secretary Michael Gove joined the HSE in announcing they were tearing up much of the red tape required for children to go on school trips. Schools and local authorities have been told by the HSE to ditch 'unnecessary paperwork', in a move which the organisation hopes will dispel 'myths about legal action'. The Department for Education, which has also updated its advice, says complex guidance that teachers previously needed to grapple with has been slashed from 150 pages to just eight. Mr Gove said: 'Children should be able to go on exciting school trips that broaden their horizons. 'That is why we are cutting unnecessary red tape in schools and putting teachers back in charge. 'This new, slimmer advice means a more common sense approach to health and safety. It will make it easier for schools to make lessons more inspiring and fun.'","School playgrounds becoming 'joyless', HSE warns .

"Toyota relented after a Facebook campaign . By . Mara Gay . Last updated at 10:28 PM on 17th June 2011 . As if losing his mother wasn't enough. Just two weeks after his mother was slain in an apparent murder-suicide, Aaron Knudsen lost her car as well. Toyota seized the 2003 Camry from an impound lot where police had sent it on the day of the slaying May 17, though Knudsen's mother, 44-year-old Denise Fransua, of Denver, Colorado, had no late payments on the car. Aaron Knudsen had his late mother's car repossessed by Toyota . Still grieving, Knudsen, 24, and his 17-year-old sister, began what he said proved to be the long and frustrating process of reclaiming their mother's Camry. 'I'm just a 24-year-old guy, my sister is 17. She just graduated high school. My mom is a single mom and all this is too much,' Knudsen told NBC/9News. Knudsen says he spent days on the phone with unhelpful Toyota representatives and made a first payment to show he was serious about getting the car back. Knudsen's slain mother wasn't late on payments for the 2003 Camry, but he was told he'd have to pay the remainder of the loan -- plus nearly $1,600 in fees -- to get the car back . Toyota, however, told him he'd have to pay the entire $3,400 left on the loan in full by July 5 -- as well as the almost $1,600 impound fee -- if he ever wanted to see his mother's car again. When he protested, Knudsen told CBS4 that representatives from the car company simply said, 'This is what the state allows us to do.' Finally, Knudsen had had enough. The tech-savvy young adult took his grievances directly to Toyota's corporate Facebook page. Knudsen, 24, turned to Facebook for help . Virtually overnight, his tragic story caught the attention -- and the ire -- of thousands of users and went viral. 'Shame on you Toyota,' one of the posts read, as noted by NBC/9News. 'To do this to a murdered single mother and her son is beyond words,' read another. 'Prepare to lose business.' Toyota later apologized on its corporate Facebook page . Toyota, perhaps embarrassed, relented Thursday. They agreed to waive the fees and work with Knudsen to help him get his mother's car back. According to CBS4, he'll still have to pay the $3,300 left on the loan, however. 'We want to convey our sincere apology that yesterday we were not sensitive to the extraordinary circumstances leading to this car being impounded,' Toyota said in a written statement Thursday. Knudsen's mother, 44-year-old Denise Fransua, was the victim of an apparent murder-suicide May 17 . The car company took to Facebook to apologize as well. 'To those of you who posted on our wall regarding a recent customer’s family repossession: We are incredibly sorry for the loss this family has suffered and are working directly with the family to rectify the issue. Thank You.' Knudsen says he's relieved, but is still in mourning over the one thing he will never be able to get back: his mother. 'She was the best mom you could think of,' he told NBC/9News. 'I'll miss her smile the most.'",Toyota relented after a Facebook campaign .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:45 PM on 30th June 2011 . Guilty: Danilo Restivo has been given life in prison for killing Heather Barnett - and could also be extradited back to Italy . The hair fetishist who murdered and mutilated a mother of two in her home was given a ‘whole life’ jail sentence yesterday. Passing sentence at Winchester Crown Court, Mr Justice Burnett warned 39-year-old Danilo  Restivo: ‘You will never be released from prison.’ The Italian was found guilty on Wednesday of the murder of neighbour Heather Barnett, 48, in Bournemouth in 2002. He had bludgeoned her with a hammer before cutting her throat and mutilating her body. He left a clump of someone else’s hair in her right hand and left the body for Mrs Barnett’s children, Caitlin, then 11, and Terry, then 14, to find in the bathroom. Restivo was also linked during his trial to the murder of 16-year-old Elisa Claps in Italy in 1993, who was killed in a similar way. He is expected to be extradited to Italy to stand trial for Elisa’s murder. Restivo showed no emotion as he heard the sentence. A victim impact statement was read on behalf of Mrs Barnett’s daughter, Caitlin, 19, who described the ‘horror’ of finding her mother’s body and being told by police that she was dead. She said: ‘It was at that moment that I felt as if my heart had been ripped out. Scroll down for video . Life sentence: Danilo Restivo will never be free after . murdering Heather Barnett (left) in 2002.  He has also been linked to the murder of Elisa Claps (right) Stabbed: Jong-Ok Shin was murdered in 2002, with the case having 'similarities' to ones involving Restivo . ‘I was in a state of complete and utter shock and it took months before I accepted the truth. All . 12 members of the jury chose to return to Winchester Crown Court this . morning to hear Restivo's sentence. Some of them had wept when hearing . evidence read on behalf of Mrs Barnett's daughter and sister. Mr Justice Burnett told 'butcher' Restivo the murder was so serious that no minimum term would be appropriate. 'The seriousness of this offence is exceptionally high - namely the depravity of the killing, the careful planning and preparation, its sexual content and the previous killing of Elisa Claps - drive me to the conclusion that the alternative starting point (for a minimum prison term) of 30 years would not be appropriate. 'I can find no mitigation in this case, none have been advanced on your behalf. 'There is, in my judgement, no minimum period which could be properly set - you will never be released from prison.' This knife was found following a search of Danilo Restivo's car in May 2004 . Mr Burnett described the crime as of 'inhuman depravity', made worse by the fact that Restivo would have known his victim's children would find Mrs Barnett's body. He said: ""You knew an 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy would find their mother butchered on the bathroom floor. 'This feature of the case will haunt those who sat through it.

'Why you picked Heather Barnett as your victim I do not know, but it's clear that you did so to satisfy a sadistic, sexual appetite. 'The evidence in this case shows you are a cold, depraved, calculated killer.' Yesterday the victim’s daughter, Caitlin, who was 11 at the time, sobbed as Restivo was convicted. Now the Daily Mail can reveal that the Italian is also suspected of killing a student exactly four months earlier. A police handout photo of the area of the room where Heather Barnett was found murdered . The house in Bournemouth, Dorset, where Heather Barnett was found murdered in 2002 . Restivo killed Mrs Barnett in Bournemouth on November 12, 2002, and police believe he chose to kill on the 12th of each month. Elisa Claps, who was 16, vanished on September . 12, 1993, after arranging to meet Restivo at a church in Potenza, south . Italy. Her body was found in the loft only in March last year. Restivo . fled to Bournemouth in 2002 after being convicted of lying to police . about an injury to his hand on the day she vanished. He is now feared to have carried out a . third murder, that of a foreign student who died just three streets away from . his home, which he shared with his wife, Fiamma Marsango, 54, whom he . met online. Fetish: The court heard how Restivo enjoyed cutting women's hair . The trial of Danilo Restivo heard that the murderer had a fetish for cutting women's hair. Michael . Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury Restivo was responsible for . cutting hair from 15 women or girls while travelling by bus in the . Bournemouth area. This fetish, known as trichophilia, is when someone gets sexually aroused by human hair. The . court heard that a number of women had contacted police after their . hair had been cut while travelling on buses in the Dorset area. They . included a woman called Tessa Cox, who saw a male passenger lean towards a . female passenger and cut her hair with scissors and got off the bus when . he realised he was being observed, the court heard. The . girl whose hair was cut did not want to report it to police but on . February 7, 2008, Ms Cox was working at Bournemouth Hospital when she . recognised Restivo in a ward bed and contacted police. In . another incident, in late 2002, a schoolgirl called Katie McGoldrick . was on a bus when she felt her hair pulled and a man she described as . Italian or Arabic was sat behind her with his face very close to her . head. She later noticed her hair had been cut and in June 2004 she identified Restivo in a police identification procedure. Restivo . is also accused of cutting another woman's hair while he sat behind her . in a cinema in Potenza, Italy, the city where he used to live and where . teenager Elisa Claps was killed. Angela Campochiaro, 23, was at a cinema in Potenza with her then fiance Nicola Marino in 1992, the court was told. During the film, Ms Campochiaro realised that a man behind her was touching her hair and had cut about 10cm off. She . told Mr Marino who turned around and saw that the perpetrator, who he . recognised as Restivo, had his genitals exposed and had been . masturbating, the court heard. Jong-Ok Shin, 26, was killed on July . 12 and a clump of hair was found near her body. The South Korean was . stabbed three times in the back as she walked home in Charminster, Bournemouth, after a night out. Omar Benguit, 31, was convicted of her murder in February 2005. Now his . lawyers are appealing. Last night Dorset Police were facing . questions about why the force took nine years to bring Restivo to . justice. Italian officers had made contact in 2002 to alert the force to . suspicions that Restivo was involved in Miss Claps’s disappearance. Restivo lived just 50 yards away from . Mrs Barnett and had visited her six days before the murder to ask . about having curtains made. She had told her sister, Denise Le . Voir, she felt ‘concerned, hassled and distressed’ after Restivo stole . her house keys. Restivo falsified alibis on the day . of the murder – first buying a bus ticket during the morning and later . altering log-in records at his place of study. In another bizarre link . between the cases, jurors heard that 15 women had reported their hair . being cut on buses and in a cinema in Bournemouth and also in Potenza . around the time of the murders in 2002 and 1993. Restivo was charged with the murder . in May last year. Yesterday Mrs Le Voir said: ‘We see ourselves as . survivors, not victims ... and look forward to continuing our lives safe . in the knowledge this man will be in jail for many years.’ Detective Superintendent Mark Cooper, of Dorset Police, described Restivo as a ‘dangerous predator’. ‘Despite his guilt, Restivo never . moved away from his house that looked out on to Heather’s property and, . perhaps most chilling of all, he even consoled her two children the . afternoon following his cold and calculated actions.’ He has also been linked in Italy to four other killings.","'Butcher' faces Italian extradition as he is accused of brutally murdering Elisa Claps in 1993 .

The leaders of all three major political parties received bad news today after a poll revealed they are each unpopular with voters. Neither Labour's Ed Miliband, Lib Dem Nick Clegg nor Tory David Cameron achieved a positive rating. Mr Miliband scores lowest, at minus 21, followed by Mr Clegg at -20 and Mr Cameron at -5. Unpopular: From left, Labour's David Miliband, the Lib Dem's Nick Clegg and the Tory's David Cameron are all unlikeable, according to a poll . The withering verdict . on the Labour leader's first nine months in the job puts him on a par . with failed Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith when he was in . opposition. However, the survey - . carried out by ICM over the weekend for the Guardian newspaper - . revealed Labour is in fact ahead of the Liberal Democrats who have plummeted in . the public's opinion suffering a 14-year low with a score of 12 per . cent. Leader popularity: Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and David Cameron all have negative personal ratings - with the Labour leader's the worst . The Conservatives have clawed back a point from the Guardian's March survey to 37 per cent, whilst Labour clocked up 39 per cent. Last night, Lord Mandelson attacked Mr Miliband for being too timid and  too concerned with trade union interests. The former Business Secretary said the party leader was failing to speak to the public about . issues they understand and was not listening to what business wants. The poll showed he was particularly unpopular among older voters and men. Mr Clegg fell two points from the March poll - although he was already at -20 per cent. Prime .

The Coalition government itself also appears to have fallen from favour, with fifty per cent of voters thinking the Government is doing a bad job and only 35 per cent give it the thumbs up, representing a net rating of -15 per cent. However, it does have a 12 point lead on the economy and 40 per cent think the coalition's policies are best. In terms of health policy and eduction, Labour has taken the lead, but in terms of taxation and public services, the coalition is ahead of the game by a small margin. It has leapt ahead on the law and order front, by 13 points and 16 points in immigration. In June last year, when the coalition government took office, it was up 38 per cent as it enjoyed its honeymoon period. The poll came as voters have watched the Government tackle changes to the NHS and several public sector unions announcing industrial action, the Guardian said. Meanwhile, chancellor George Osborne also needs to claw his way back in with the public as 46 per cent believing he is doing a bad job.

Casey Anthony tonight rejected a jailhouse visit from her mother as her parents tried to speak to her for the first time since she was acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee. Cindy Anthony made an appointment to visit her 25-year-old daughter at Orange County jail, Florida, at 7pm but Anthony refused to see her. Mrs Anthony was due to go to the prison - where her daughter must spend another nine days after being found guilty of lying to police - without her husband George Anthony. Anthony’s refusal to speak to her mother is the latest sign of how estranged she is from her parents. The snub has led to speculation of where Anthony will go when she is freed next Sunday. Torn apart: Casey Anthony, left, refused to see her mother Cindy when she tried to visit her in prison today . Jail spokesman Allen Moore said: 'This morning under policy, Casey was told of the visit and she has declined the visit so it will not occur.' The snub came as it was revealed that Anthony will be only the second inmate in the past 15 years to not walk out the front door of the jail lobby when she is released from custody. The jail admitted that it has planned a secret exit for her protection when she walks free on Sunday July 17. The only other inmate who got such special handling was Noelle Bush, daughter of then-Governor Jeb Bush and niece of then-President George W Bush, who the Secret Service believed could be targeted by terrorists. George and Cindy Anthony have not spoken to their daughter since before her sensational six-week trial, which has caused outrage across the country. The family has been torn apart by accusations of incest, rape and adultery. Casey's parents George and Cindy, who have been married for 30 years, publicly supported their daughter from her initial arrest in 2008, as they continued to lead the search for their missing granddaughter, to the start of the murder trial. Behind bars: Casey Anthony will walk free from Orange County jail on Sunday 17 July . Stone-faced: Cindy and George Anthony were the first people to leave the courtroom after the verdict on Tuesday . But on the opening day of the trial, . the defence dropped a bombshell that Caylee was never missing but had . drowned in an accident in the family's pool on June 16. More . shocking was the accusation that George Anthony had sexually abused his . daughter when she was a child, and suggested the dysfunctional . relationship explained . Anthony's behaviour after Caylee's death. Defence lawyer Jose Baez said that Mr Anthony had a role in disposing the body and bullied his daughter, who he had molested from aged eight, into keeping it all secret. The family have denied the defence's account of events that Caylee drowned in their pool. In court, Cindy Anthony dismissed claims that she had left a ladder to the pool in place and George Anthony denied that he had ever sexually abused his daughter. But Mrs Anthony was accused of lying under oath to protect her daughter from the death penalty when she testified that it was her who had made repeated Google searches for chloroform and neck injuries on the home computer not daughter Casey. One of the most telling moments showing the animosity between Anthony and her parents came when Cindy Anthony left the witness stand and mouthed ‘I love you’ to her daughter, who rolled her eyes and looked away.","Anthony's mother made an appointment to see her tonight at 7pm .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:19 PM on 7th July 2011 . MPs and council officials in Essex have expressed their disbelief after it emerged that disgraced former peer Lord Hanningfield is still receiving his £11,500 councillor allowance despite being jailed for fiddling his Parliamentary expenses. The shamed Lord, real name Paul White, 70, was jailed for nine months last week after he was found guilty of illegally claiming £13,379 in parliamentary expenses. But despite the scandal he has still not resigned his post at Essex County Council. Still being paid: Lord Hanningfield, centre, remains in his post at . Essex County Council despite being jailed over his expenses claims . Lord Hanningfield, a former pig . farmer from West Hanningfield, near Chelmsford in Essex, was convicted . in May of six counts of false accounting relating to his House of Lords . expenses. However, despite being jailed he has retained his place as Essex County Councillor for the village of Stock - and is still receiving his councillor allowance of £11,500. On ECC's website it states that . councillors receive their allowance so they can do their duties, which . includes 'being accessible and available to all residents in their . electoral division'. But although he is under pressure to resign . from his post the council have said they are powerless to suspend or axe Lord Hanningfield until an . appeal against his conviction is complete. Councillor Mike Mackrory, Liberal Democrat deputy leader on Essex County Council, said the former Conservative peer should do the 'honourable thing' and step down. He said, 'It cannot be right that Lord Hanningfield will continue to receive his £11,500 a year allowance whilst serving his prison sentence. 'He cannot represent people in his ward from a prison cell so he should not be a councillor. He should do the honourable thing and resign his seat and save further embarrassment to Essex County Council. 'This would cause a by-election to be held, which would enable the 13,500 electors of Stock to be properly represented again at County Hall as soon as possible,' Cllr Mackrory added. ""The CPS said Hanningfield's case was one of the most clear cut examples of expenses fraud so he doesn't have a leg to stand on.' Bob Russell, MP for Colchester, said: 'I think most people would be amazed that someone in prison can remain a councillor. 'The judge has sentenced him to a term of imprisonment which should be an automatic disqualification.' Emma Boon, a spokeswoman for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'It's absurd to have a county councillor being paid while he is in jail. How can he be serving taxpayers while he is in jail? 'It's unacceptable that he's allowed to stay in his position once he's been convicted as a criminal. There's no way he should be allowed to continue as a county councillor.' Claims: Lord Hanningfield stayed at his home in Chelmsford, Essex, while claiming for overnight stays for his work at the House of Lords . Essex County Council has confirmed that Lord Hanningfield is still being paid councillor expenses pending the outcome of his appeal. A spokeswoman said: 'Essex County Council is now awaiting the outcome of Lord Hanningfield's application for leave to appeal his conviction. 'In the meantime we are continuing to co-operate with the police over the ongoing Essex investigation and it would not be appropriate for us to comment until that is complete.' Lord Hanningfield was found guilty of six counts of . false accounting in May and joins four ex-MPs and a fellow member of the . Lords convicted of dishonestly obtaining thousands of pounds from the . taxpayer. Lord Hanningfield, an unmarried . ex-Lords opposition frontbencher and former leader of Essex County . Council, has lodged an appeal. He denied fraudulently claiming parliamentary expenses totalling nearly £14,000 . between March 2006 and May 2009. The charges relate to six individual . one month periods. The . peer claimed £13,379 in parliamentary expenses for overnight stays in London . when he was not in the capital, as well as £382 in train fares and £147 in mileage by . doubling the seven-mile distance from his house to the railway station. He . told his trial that he treated the Lords expenses for staying overnight . in London as an allowance for living outside the capital and spent just . 'a minute a month' completing his claim forms. He . alleged that most other peers treated the House of Lords as a 'club', . turning up there for only 10 minutes to claim their daily allowance. Prison term: Lord Hanningfield was jailed for nine months despite claims he was in poor health . The shamed peer insisted his . parliamentary duties left him thousands of pounds out of pocket and said . he 'averaged out' his claims to recoup some of the money he spent. When . he was questioned by detectives, he told them to look at the records of . other peers and claimed he was not the only one claiming expenses in . this way. Unmarried Lord . Hanningfield told the trial that public service was his life and he . worked very long hours on Lords and county council business. He . said he re-mortgaged his bungalow to fight the case and was living on a . modest pension because he 'never got round to signing the forms' for . the local government pension to which he was entitled. But prosecutors rejected the peer's . 'feeble excuse' for his 'blatantly dishonest' behaviour, saying that . peers are meant to serve the public and 'not top up their income at the . public's expense'. Four . former Labour MPs - David Chaytor, Eric Illsley, Jim Devine and Elliot . Morley - have already received prison terms for fiddling their . parliamentary expenses. Illsley . has already been released from jail, and Chaytor was freed from Spring . Hill open prison, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on the day Lord . Hanningfield was convicted after serving just a quarter of his 18-month . sentence. Another Conservative peer, Lord Taylor of Warwick, was jailed for 12 months and faces being suspended from the House of Lords. In . mitigation, defence counsel Alun Jones said Lord Hanningfield had been . convicted of offences over a period of six out of 72 months. He . said: 'He is convicted of dishonesty in six months of the prosecution's . own choosing out of 72 months when the reality is that this man has . actually given his own money for public service for all the 40 years he . has been involved in it.'

An anomaly in Barack Obama's controversial healthcare law will allow millions of relatively well-off people to qualify for Medicaid, it emerged today. The loophole, which was only discovered after the complex bill was signed, will give some couples earning four times the federal poverty level entitlement to nearly free insurance meant for the poor. It means a married couple who have both retired early could have an annual income of about $64,000 and still get Medicaid, according to officials who make long-range cost estimates for the Health and Human Services department. After initially downplaying any concern, the Obama administration said late yesterday that it would look for a fix. Up to three million people could qualify for Medicaid in 2014 as a result of the anomaly. That's because, in a major change . from today, most of their Social Security benefits would no longer be . counted as income for determining eligibility. A married couple who have both retired early could have an annual income of about $64,000 and still get Medicaid, it has emerged . Medicare chief actuary Richard Foster says the situation keeps him up at night. ‘I don't generally comment on the . pros or cons of policy, but that just doesn't make sense,’ Foster said . during a question-and-answer session at a recent professional society . meeting. It's almost like allowing middle-class people to qualify for food stamps, he suggested. ‘This is a situation that got no attention at all,’ added Foster. ‘And even now, as I raise the issue with various policymakers, people are not rushing to say ... we need to do something about this.’ President Obama, surrounded by lawmakers, signs the healthcare insurance reform legislation during a ceremony in the the White House on March 23, 2010 . Indeed, administration officials and . senior Democratic lawmakers say it's not a loophole but the result of a . well-meaning effort to simplify rules for deciding who will get help . with insurance costs under the new health care law. Instead of a hodgepodge of rules, there will be one national policy. ‘This . simplification will stop people from falling into coverage gaps and may . cause some to be newly eligible for Medicaid and others to no longer . qualify,’ said Brian Cook, spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and . Medicaid Services. But states have been clamouring for . relief from Medicaid costs, complaining that just these sorts of federal . rules drive up spending and limit state options. The . program is now one of the top issues in budget negotiations between the . White House and Congress. Republicans are pushing for a rollback of . federal requirements that block states from limiting eligibility. Public . opinion: Protesters in California made their views clear. Critics have . also attacked Mr Obama over a system they feel mirrors Britain's ailing . NHS . People hold up signs as they attend a town hall meeting on healthcare reform in California . Medicaid is a safety net program that serves more than 50 million vulnerable Americans, from low-income children and pregnant women to Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes. It's designed as a federal-state partnership, with Washington paying close to 60 per cent of the total cost. Early retirees would be a new group for Medicaid. While retirees can now start collecting Social Security at age 62, they must wait another three years to get Medicare, unless they're disabled. Some early retirees who worked all their lives may not want to be associated with a health care program for the poor, but others might see it as a relatively painless way to satisfy the new law's requirement that all Americans carry medical insurance starting in 2014. It would help tide them over until they turn 65 and qualify for Medicare. The actuary's office said the three . million early retirees who would become eligible for Medicaid are on top . of an estimated 16 million to 20 million people that Obama's law would . already bring into the program, by opening it to childless adults with . incomes near the poverty level. Federal taxpayers will cover all of the . initial cost of the expansion. Heated issue: The debate over healthcare caused violent outbreaks at town hall meetings like this one is Ybor City, Florida in the summer of 2009 . A spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee, which wrote much of the health care law, said if the situation does become a problem there's plenty of time to fix it later. ‘These changes don't take effect until 2014, so we have time to review all possible cases to ensure Medicaid meets its mission of serving only the neediest Americans,’ said Erin Shields. But Republicans already see a problem. Former Utah governor Mike Leavitt said adding early retirees will ‘just add fuel to the fire,’ bolstering the argument from Republican governors that some of Washington's rules don't make sense. ‘The fact that this is being discovered now tells you, what else is baked into this law?’ said Mr Leavitt, who served as Health and Human Services secretary under President George HW Bush.","Some couples earning up to $64k a year - four times poverty level - entitled to free insurance for the poor .

"By . Sam Greenhill and Sophie Borland . Last updated at 1:49 AM on 24th June 2011 . A top surgeon who interrupted a photo opportunity for David Cameron and Nick Clegg has gone on leave. David Nunn, a leading hip replacement specialist, burst in on the pair when they were visiting patients at Guy's Hospital in  Central London last week. Mr Nunn complained about some of the Prime Minister's aides and journalists covering the visit not having their sleeves rolled up - a hospital hygiene stipulation - before being ushered outside. Scroll down to watch video... Startling: Nick Clegg and David Cameron look taken aback after surgeon David Nunn burst in last week. His bosses claim he 'requested' leave . The pair were with a group of aides . and journalists at Guy's Hospital in central London last week when David . Nunn, a leading hip replacement surgeon, burst in. Appearing to object to some members . of the group not having their sleeves rolled up, he told them: ‘Excuse . me, I'm the senior orthopaedic surgeon in this department. Why is it . that we're all told to walk around like this and these people...’ He was then drowned out by a perplexed-looking Mr Cameron and his aides who rushed forward to smooth things over. Perplexed: Mr Cameron diplays a quizzical expression as Mr Nunn stormed in . Telling off: Dr Nunn points his finger as he berates media for not rolling up sleeves . Before: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley joins the PM and Mr Clegg on a tour . They swiftly ushered the Prime Minister and the offending group out of the room - and away from rolling cameras. The medic was heard shouting ‘I'm not having it’ from outside the room. Now it has emerged he has gone on leave – and it is not known when he will return. The surgeon who disrupted David Cameron's photo opportunity is no stranger to media attention. Senior . orthopaedic surgeon David Nunn, 57, caused a storm of controversy in . 2002, when he criticised foreign nurses for failing to understand his . instructions. Mr Nunn, . who qualified in 1978 and is now regarded as one of the top hip . replacement specialists in the country, claimed he had to stop an . operation while his patient was still under the knife because assistants . did not understand his request for surgical instruments. The . doctor, who has performed more than 1,000 hip revision replacement . operations, accused the Government of setting 'arbitrary targets' for . the NHS, adding that political correctness was stopping the issue of . communication problems with foreign staff being raised. 'The . world has been scoured for nurses to shore up the health service and to . achieve arbitrary targets set by the government,' he told the Daily . Telegraph at the time of the controversy. 'All . are without doubt well-trained and dedicated professionals, but if . medical staff cannot communicate effectively then patients' care may be . put at risk.' Mr Nunn, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, has been a consultant at St Guy's Hospital since 1990. He . is listed on the Specialist Register of the General Medical Council and . is also a member of the American Academy of Orthopaedics. Yesterday one of Mr Nunn’s patients . claimed he was told the  surgeon had been ‘suspended’ for his . intervention, which was filmed by a BBC camera crew. Peter Hodgson, 63, from Clapham, South London, was seen by Mr Nunn on the morning of the Prime Minister’s visit on June 14. He returned for a follow-up . appointment this week, and said: ‘The registrar said Mr Nunn was on . gardening leave and had been reprimanded for what he did last week.’ It is understood that journalists in . the group had checked with the ward sister whether they needed to wash . their hands and roll up their sleeves, but were told it was not . necessary as they were not coming into close contact with patients. Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg had observed the drill because they were in contact with patients. In a bid to prevent doctors speaking . to the media about the issue, the Trust sent staff an internal memo . warning them to keep quiet. It read: ‘At this stage we do not . know when Mr Nunn will return to the Trust. Staff should be aware that . media may phone without identifying themselves as media. ‘It is imperative staff not answer any questions or provide information or personal opinions.’ Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust confirmed Mr Nunn was on leave but said he had requested it. A spokesman said: ‘With David’s permission, we are able to confirm that he is currently caring for his elderly mother.’ Regarding the internal memo, the . spokesman added: ‘It is normal Trust practice to provide staff with . information and guidance in situations where they may receive queries . outside their normal line of work, and to ensure media requests are . managed according to the Trust’s media policy. ‘This is to prevent misinformation and provide support for staff.’ Mr Nunn, 57, would not comment yesterday.",Reports suggest David Nunn may have been put on 'gardening leave' after being 'reprimanded' by bosses .
"By . Emily Andrews and Gabby Morgan . Last updated at 9:57 AM on 23rd June 2011 . For one it was the ecstasy of victory. But for two other Brits, it was the end of the Wimbledon dream. Our women players experienced mixed fortunes yesterday – but 2011 will still go down as one of their best years in recent history. There were high hopes for  teenagers Laura Robson and Heather Watson, but only Laura managed to get through to fight another day. Winning smile: Robson beams after seeing off Kerber in three sets, to the delight of home tennis fans at Wimbledon . Being stretched: Robson's first round victory was her maiden Grand Slam win . It was the 17-year-old’s first  ever . win at a senior Grand Slam event, and victory on the green grass of home . will have made it that much sweeter. Anne Keothavong, meanwhile, had . already made it through to the second round – but lost late last night. A . fourth Briton, Elena Baltacha, will play her second round match today. Three years ago Laura became the . darling of the All England Club when she won the Junior title and since . then expectation has been heaped on her shoulders. Recently she has struggled with injury and a growth spurt that has taken her to just under 6ft. But she battled back from a set down against the world number 76 to win. Laura is ranked 254th in the world. German Angelique Kerber, 23, looked like she would win easily in the first set, but Laura came through 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 . Double delight: Andy Murray salutes the Court One crowd after seeing off Germany's Tobias Kamke in straight sets, while Robson is ecstatic after her battling victory over Angelique Kerber . Tough task: Robson will have her work cut out in the second round against triple Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova . Here come the girls: Robson was joined in round two by British number one Elena Baltacha and number three Anne Keothavong, who both won on Monday . Meanwhile Heather, ranked 93rd in the . world, broke down in tears in her post-match press conference after . struggling with an elbow injury during her first round match against . France’s Mathilde Johannsson. The 19-year-old British number three started to sob as she criticised her performance. But she ignored an official’s offer to halt the interview. ‘I just feel like there’s no excuses . now. I know how to play tennis,’ she said through her tears. ‘This is . what I prepare for. This is why I play tennis every day, so I should be . ready. I feel like I should be winning these matches. ‘It’s so frustrating and I was just disappointed that I lost. Tender: Sir Bruce Forsyth rests his hand his wife Wilnelia's thigh as they settle down in the Royal Box on Centre Court . Actress Kim Cattrall was also spotted cheering on fellow American Venus Williams at SW19 . Bethanie Mattek-Sands - who has been hailed as . the Lady Gaga of tennis - arrives for her match against Japan's Misaki . Doi wearing a distinctive jacket . Royal approval: the Duchess of Cornwall was another famous tennis fan to take in the Venus Williams's dramatic Centre Court win . The Duchess of Cornwall shakes hands with Adam Tomes as she meets ball boys and girls on her first visit to the Wimbledon championships . Actress Felicity Kendal, left, watches the match with comedian Jennifer Saunders and her daughter Beattie Edmondson . ‘I’ve never felt anything like  this . and I just really wanted to win today. And I thought I had the match. But it’s just frustrating because I just really wanted to do well.’ The Guernsey teenager took the first set 6-2, but then felt her elbow go and had it strapped up soon after. Medics wrapped her arm tightly in . bandages to curb the pain but it clearly  had an effect on her play. She . went on to lose  2-6, 6-4, 6-4. There was some consolation though, as . the keen Manchester United fan was cheered by tweets from Rio Ferdinand . saying how impressed he was with her performance. He wrote: ‘Unfortunate to see Heather Watson lose today,  she looks a real prospect. Talent and guts.’ Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal were out on the practice courts in the rain ahead of their second round matches . Familiar scenes: Rain interrupted parts of the day's play but held off towards evening for Laura Robson's stunning win . Fans wait patiently for the rain to pass on day three of tournament. Organisers are already struggling with the backlog caused by Monday's rain . Wiping the tears away, Heather said: . ‘That’s really nice. I’m a Man U fan. I have to be Man U because my dad . is, he is from Manchester.’ Three second round qualifiers – . Laura, Miss Baltacha and Miss Keothavong – represents a high level of . achievement for British women’s tennis. Not since 2004, when four British women made it into the second round, has there been such success for our ladies. But Miss Keothavong lost her second round match last night in straight sets. Laura will face Russian former champion Maria Sharapova today. Hours of play were lost to bad weather on the outer courts . Shelter from the storm: At least those who came unprepared could pay a visit to the Wimbledon shop . The dreadful weather didn't dampen the spirits of these spectators as they waited for a break in the rain . As the British tennis No.1 he could be excused for regarding the Centre Court as his home. But yesterday Andy Murray was kicked off Wimbledon's premier court after other players had apparently complained of favouritism. Despite . the presence of the Duchess of Cornwall in the royal box, he was . shunted off to the less prestigious No.1 Court to make way for matches . featuring lesser-seeded players such as Venus Williams and Andy Roddick. Shunned: Andy Murray was relegated to Court One after other players complained of favouritism . No fancy roof yesterday to protect Andy Murray's game from the rain . Up until last year Murray, 24, had played all of his matches, save one, on Centre. However . after some of the top seeds suggested this was an unfair advantage, . particularly with the new roof ensuring it is the only court where rain . doesn't interrupt matches, the All England Club decided to rotate . Murray's appearances. Yesterday was only his third time on No.1 Court – and both fans and commentators alike ridiculed the decision. Three-times . Wimbledon winner John McEnroe said: 'If I had made the schedule, I . would have put Murray on this [Centre] Court. Roddick is a three-time . finalist and certainly a hall of fame player, but I'm not sure his match . is going to have people saying, “I gotta see that!”' Murray's . girlfriend Kim Sears was so unfamiliar with the No.1 Court that she got . lost and needed a steward to show her to her seat. Being on Court One did little to affect his game as Murray comfortably beat Tobias Kamke from Germany . Even the presence of the Duchess of Cornwall wasn't enough for organisers to let Murray play in Centre Court . Spectators were furious at paying upwards of £54 a ticket to see the Scot on Court One . Murray himself said: 'Being on Centre . Court is certainly a big help now because you know that, whatever the . weather, you're going to get on, so you can prepare for your match . knowing there won't be a lot of stopping and starting.' Centre . Court ticket holders who had paid upwards of £54 each expecting to see . the Scot's match were also furious that they didn't get to see it. Carol Haynes, who was watching with her daughter Kate, said: 'Murray should definitely be on Centre Court. 'He's British and this is a British tournament. 'Camilla and the rest of the royal box were obviously hoping to see a British player but they got Americans instead.' Tournament . director Ian Ritchie defended the decision, saying: 'We think in the . interest of fairness, and that covers all the players and all the top . seeds, that they can't play all their matches on Centre Court. So we . have to move them about a little bit and yesterday was the day we . decided to move Andy.' Responding . to criticism from fans, he said: 'We always make clear to all the . ticket holders that there is no guarantee of who they are going to see. However . the change of court clearly didn't faze Murray. He breezed through his . second round match against the unseeded German Tobias Kamke in straight . sets. Victorious: Until last year Murray had played all but one of his games on Centre Court . The . row over Monday’s closure of Murray Mount escalated into a full-blown . war of words yesterday, after the health and safety watchdog attacked . the decision. Judith . Hackitt, chairman of the Health and Safety Executive, issued an open . letter mocking Wimbledon chiefs’ move to switch off the giant screen on . the sodden slope in case fans slipped and injured themselves. She pointed out that ‘people have been walking up and down wet grassy slopes for years without catastrophic consequences’. The . All England Club appeared to be pressured into a U-turn, with the hill . remaining open during yesterday’s rain – heavier and more persistent . than Monday’s. Yet . chief executive Ian Ritchie said he and his officials were ‘staggered, . flabbergasted and amazed’ that Mrs Hackitt should get involved. U-turn: These fans make the most of Murray's Mount in the wet weather before the decision was made to close it over 'elf n safety' fears .","Win sees three female Britons in second round for first time in seven years .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:58 AM on 2nd September 2011 . A woman found hanging naked from a mansion balcony with her wrists and ankles bound committed suicide, her sister said investigators have ruled. Rebecca Zahau, 32, was found dead more than seven weeks ago on July 13, hanging from a second-floor balcony at the historic mansion in suburban Coronado, California. Her sister Mary Zahau-Loehner revealed the news but said she found investigators unconvincing when they broke their findings to her. Suicide: Rebecca Zahau, right, was found hanging naked at Jonah Shacknai's mansion in Coronado, California . ‘It doesn't add up,’ she said, after . she was visited on Wednesday at her home in in St Joseph, Missouri, by . investigators. ‘Nothing adds up.’ The San Diego County Sheriff's . Department declined to comment, but Sheriff Bill Gore is planning a news . conference on Friday to discuss findings. Ms Zahau was found dead two days after . a six-year-old boy under her care was seriously injured in a fall down . the stairs. Max Shacknai later died. Both were linked to Jonah Shacknai, an Arizona pharmaceuticals magnate who owns the 27-room waterfront mansion. Ms Zahau was his girlfriend of two years and Max was his son from a marriage that ended in divorce in 2008. Ms Zahau-Loehner said investigators told her they found no suicide note. They did share text messages on her phone from months earlier about ‘issues’ between her and Mr Shacknai's children. Tragic death: Max Shacknai died in a San Diego hospital days after tumbling down stairs at his dad's mansion . Ms Zahau-Loehner said she spoke with her . sister the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she . planned to take her life. She said she planned to bring Mr . Shacknai breakfast and a change of clothes the next morning to the . hospital where his son was being treated. 'It doesn't add up. Nothing adds up' Mary Zahau-LoehnerRebecca Zahau's sister . Ms Zahau also told her sister that she would call her parents in the morning on the way to the hospital. She emailed another sister in Germany to say she would be updating throughout the next day. ‘Too detailed planning for someone who's planning to end their life that night,’ Ms Zahau-Loehner said. When Max fell down the stairs, Ms Zahau was at home with a 13-year-old girl who was related to her, authorities say. He was hospitalised after paramedics found the boy wasn't breathing and did not have a pulse. Marriage plans: Tycoon Jonah Shacknai reportedly told friends he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her . Two days later, Mr Shacknai's brother, Adam, called 911 to report that Ms Zahau appeared to be dead, investigators said. The brother was staying in a mansion guesthouse. Jonah Shacknai was not at home. Investigators will also announce their . findings on the boy's death on Friday. They initially said they . believed the fall was an accident. 'We've obviously had an extraordinarily difficult time. We have undertaken some tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a lifetime' Jonah Shacknai . The home, known as the Spreckels . mansion, is one of the more storied properties in Coronado, a small . suburb of multimillion-dollar homes on the tip of a peninsula across a . bay from downtown San Diego. The home has unobstructed beach views . and sits near Coronado's main street, which is lined with palm trees and . upscale boutiques. Mr Shacknai bought the mansion in March 2007, when it was assessed at $12.75million. The home was built in 1908 and named . for its original owner, John D. Spreckels, who also owned newspapers the . San Diego Union and San Diego Tribune. Mr Shacknai founded Medicis . Pharmaceuticals and has been chairman and chief executive of the . Scottsdale, Arizona-based company since 1988. Tragic home: The historic 27-room Spreckels mansion in Coronado, an affluent suburb of San Diego, where Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend was found hanging naked . In a divorce filing, he filed a tax return that showed his income in 1998 at $17million. Medicis makes acne treatments Solodyn and Ziana and facial wrinkle treatment Restylane and Dysport, a competitor of Botox. Last year, the company earned $123million on $700million in revenue. 'There are many unanswered questions' Mary Zahau-LoehnerRebecca Zahau's sister . Mr Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his only child with his second wife, Dina. He told Medicis investors in August . that he was planning to resume his daily routine of showing up at the . office as soon as school resumed for his children in Arizona. ‘We've obviously had an . extraordinarily difficult time,’ he said. ‘We have undertaken some . tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a . lifetime.’ Ms Zahau, a native of Myanmar, was an . ophthalmic technician at Horizon Eye Specialists & Lasik Center in . the Phoenix area from April 2008 to December 2010. Ms Zahau-Loehner urged investigators keep the investigation open and said the family has hired an attorney. ‘There are many unanswered questions,’ she said.","Rebecca Zahau, 32, found dead at mansion in Coronado, California, in July .

Accidental death: Stuart James Bullas, 57, was crushed to death by his beloved classic car at his factory in Lye, near Birmingham . A company director and motor-racing enthusiast was crushed to death when his prized vintage sports car fell on him as he repaired it. Stuart James Bullas, 57, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, had broken several motor racing  records in amateur competitions with his beloved yellow Austin Healey Sprite Mark 1, which weighed more than half a tonne. Mr Bullas, who was divorced and had no children, was found dead on the shop floor of his family engineering firm BG Bullas Ltd in Lye, near Stourbridge, on April 10. He had been doing some last-minute work on the car, which had appeared on Top Gear and was driven by The Stig, before a race. Black Country coroner Robin Balmain . heard the business owner had apparently used a crane to lift the vehicle . but had not secured it properly on the frame. It fell out of a . cradle, crushing him as he lay on the floor beneath it, while clutching a . ratchet drive. His body was found by his driving partner Robin Johnson and some other friends. He was declared dead at the scene by . paramedics. Motor enthusiast: Mr Bullas was a keen race competitor in his beloved Austin Healey . Mr Johnson, of Kings Norton, who had known Mr Bullas . since he was 15, recalled how he tried in vain to life the car off his friend. Fighting back tears, he said: 'Stuart . must have used the crane to lift the car and it probably slipped off . the loop and fell on him.' Mr Bullas had usually been 'a . stickler for making sure things were properly done', Mr Johnson said, as . he had lost two fingers in a metal press when younger. They had co-owned the car and arranged to meet at the factory on the . day Mr Bullas's body was found, so they could go to Loton Park, near . Shrewsbury, for a race. Another friend Dave Powell described Mr Bullas as being 'careful and fearless'. Mr Bullas's older brother Graham, from Christchurch in Dorset, said: 'He was a lovely person - very generous and considerate and it was summed up at the funeral. There were hundreds of people there.' He added: 'Anybody working on a motor vehicle in the future who reads this sad story must take care to avoid such tragic accidents themselves.' Mr Balmain ruled Mr Bullas died of traumatic asphyxia due to being trapped under a motor vehicle and that it had been an accident.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:05 PM on 27th June 2011 . Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, was today found guilty of trying to sell Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat. He was convicted on 17 charges of corruption by a jury in Chicago this afternoon, after a retrial on allegations he abused his power to extort money for campaign funds. As the verdicts were read out, the 54-year-old turned to his defence lawyer and said: 'What happened?'. Then he sat back in his chair and whispered 'I love you' to his wife, Patti. He could now face up to 300 . years in jail, although federal guidelines are likely to dictate he will end up . with a much shorter sentence. Scroll down for video . Grim verdict: Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and his wife Patti hold hands as they leave court after a jury found him guilty of 17 counts of corruption. He could now face up to 350 years in jail . His wife broke down as the first guilty verdict was announced, collapsing into her brother's arms. He stroked her hair as she started crying, and she kept shaking her head and saying 'no' when the jurors left court. Blagojevich spoke only briefly as the couple left the courthouse in Chicago. He told reporters: 'Well, among the many lessons I've learned from this whole experience is to try to speak a little bit less, so I'm going to keep my remarks kind of short. In sombre tones, he continued: 'Patti and I are obviously very disappointed. I frankly am stunned. 'There's not much left to say other than we want to get home to our little girls and talk to them and explain things to them and try to sort things out. And I'm sure we'll be seeing you.' The verdict was a bitter defeat for Blagojevich, who had spent two-and-a-half years professing his innocence on reality TV shows and later on the witness stand. Media scrum: As his emotional wife looks on, Rod Blagojevich speaks to reporters gathered outside the courthouse in Chicago following the guilty verdict . Departure: Rod Blagojevich and his wife Patti drive away from the courthouse this afternoon . It capped a long-running spectacle in . which Blagojevich became famous for blurting on a recorded phone call . that his ability to appoint Obama's successor to the Senate was . 'f****ing golden' and that he wouldn't let it go 'for f****ing nothing'. His defence team had insisted that . hours of FBI wire tap recordings were just the ramblings of a politician . who liked to think out loud. The jury found him not-guilty on one . charge, of soliciting a bribe from a toll road authority, and failed to . reach an agreement on two more. The charges included wire fraud, attempted extortion, bribery and conspiracy. Convicted: Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich was convicted on 11 counts relating to his attempt to trade President Obama's vacant Senate seat in exchange for campaign funds and personal advancement . Of those, 11 concerned his attempts to . sell Mr Obama's Senate seat for personal gain after he was elected to . the White House in 2008. Today Rod Blagojevich was found guilty of 17 counts of corruption, which prosecutors divided into five separate incidents: . Senate Seat . He was found guilty on 11 counts relating to his attempt to trade President Obama's seat in exchange for personal advancement. Of those, eight were for wire fraud. They cover a number of calls in which he discussed the possibility of wealthy Democratic donors founding a charitable organisation that he could head, in exchange for appointing Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to the seat. They also include a conference call in which he discusses getting 'tangible, political support' in exchange for appointing U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. Prosecutors said this 'support' was $1.5million in funds from Mr Jackson's supporters. Another call recorded him and his advisers discussing 'personal benefits' in exchange for the Senate seat appointment. He was also found guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, and another of attempted extortion. He allegedly had an agreement with his brother, Robert, to demand things of personal value in exchange for the appointment. Children's Memorial Hospital . He was found guilty on one count of wire fraud, one of attempted extortion and one of solicitation of a bribe. They all refer to his attempts to solicit $25,000 in campaign contributions from the hospital's chief executive Patrick Magoon  in exchange for a state payment increase of paediatric doctors, and also in exchange for the state money for doctors treating Medicaid patients. Racetrack Executive . He was found guilty on one count of wire fraud, one of attempted extortion and one of solicitation of a bribe. These charges cover allegations he conspired with his former chief of staff Lon Monk to extort a racetrack executive for campaign contributions in exchange for signing a bill to grant money to the racetrack industry. Chicago Academy . Jurors failed to reach a verdict on allegations he demanded campaign contributions from then-U.S. Representative Rahm Emanuel in exchange for a state grant to a school in Mr Emanuel's district. Illinois Tollway . Jurors failed to reach a verdict on allegations he attempted to extort campaign contributions from road-building executive Gerald Krozel in return for giving state money to the Tollway. They found him not guilty on one count, 'solicitation of a bribe', concerning allegations he asked Mr Krozel for campaign money in exchange for approving a multi-billion dollar Tollway improvement plan. Blagojevich was also found guilty of . holding up official acts on the Illinois Tollway, a school grant, . horse-racing legislation and the Children's Memorial Hospital while he . demanded campaign contributions. He . has now been barred from travelling outside the northern Illinois area . without permission, and the judge set a status hearing for sentencing on . August 1. Federal . guidelines and previous sentences handed down to other Illinois . politicians guilty of corruption suggest he could get around ten years . in prison. But judges have a . huge amount of discretion, and can factor in a host of variables - . including whether a defendant took the stand and lied, something . prosecutors say Blagojevich did. He arrived at court with his wife Patti after Judge James Zagel said the verdicts would be read this afternoon. The former governor told reporters gathered outside his home this morning: 'My hands are shaking, my knees are weak.' He said he was praying for the best, but added: 'It’s in God’s hands.' The jury had spent three weeks talking through the evidence. Blagojevich was originally tried last . year, but the jury came back deadlocked after deliberating for 14 days, . the the judge ordered a retrial. They agreed on just one of 24 counts, convicting Blagojevich of lying to the FBI. He faces up to five years on that conviction. Today's verdict makes Blagojevich the second Illinois governor in a row to be convicted of corruption. His predecessor, former governor George Ryan, is serving a six-and-a-half year jail sentence. Prosecutors, . defence attorneys and dozens of reporters filed into the courtroom . today after the judge announced it had received word of a note from . jurors. Judge Zagel said: 'The jury has come . to a decision on 18 of the 20 counts.' He added that the jurors said . they were deadlocked on two counts and 'were confident' they couldn't . agree on those charges 'even with further deliberations.' Asked . how he should respond, both prosecutors and the defence indicated to . Zagel that the jury had deliberated long enough and should be asked to . deliver the verdicts. It was only the third note from . jurors in their deliberations. The two other gave no hint about how . deliberations were proceeding. Blagojevich was arrested in December 2008, after the FBI had wiretapped hundreds of his telephone calls at work and home. The Illinois Legislature impeached him a month later. Both trials hinged on whether the former governor's bold ramblings to aides and others on the telephone was just talk, as he insisted, or part of 'a political crime spree', in the words of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald. The case became a media spectacle, with the indicted governor and his wife appearing on television reality shows. The loquacious Blagojevich made theatrical appearances daily outside the courthouse during the first trial to profess his innocence and hug his remaining fans. Emotional: Rod Blagojevich was uncharacteristically brief as he spoke after being found guilty of corruption, including trying to sell the Senate seat once held by Barack Obama . Mobbed: Rod Blagojevich and hiws wife Patti almost disappear as a scrum of reporters gather outside Chicago's Federal Courthouse . In a case full of high-level name . dropping, defence attorneys in the retrial pulled into court Chicago's . new Mayor Rahm Emanuel and U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. Mr . Emanuel's appearance on the witness stand, the most anticipated by a . Chicago mayor in a federal courtroom in decades, was over in just five . minutes. Jackson was done in about half an hour. Overall, . though, the retrial had far less of the circus-like atmosphere that . accompanied the initial trial. Blagojevich himself also was more subdued . this time. Prosecutors dropped racketeering . counts against the ex-governor and dismissed all charges against his . then co-defendant brother, Robert Blagojevich. When there was still hope: Rod Blagojevich and his wife leave their home in Chicago this morning, left, and right, a wellwisher offers the shamed former governor a hug of support . They presented just three weeks of evidence - half the time taken at the first trial. They called fewer witnesses, asked fewer questions and played shorter excerpts of the FBI wiretaps that underpin most of the charges. There was also a new variable at the retrial: The testimony from Blagojevich himself. At the first trial, the defence rested without calling any witnesses and Blagojevich didn't testify despite vowing that he would. Retrial jurors saw a deferential Blagojevich look them in the eyes and deny every allegation, telling them his talk on the recordings was mere brainstorming. This time, jurors must decide if they believe him.","Blagojevich guilty on 17 of 20 corruption charges .

A homeless man who disappeared on his way to collect a $100,000 inheritance has finally turned up - saying the bus to New York broke down. Max Melitzer - who came into the money after his estranged brother died of cancer -  was found roaming a park in Utah by a private investigator hired by the family. He was expected in Albany bus station yesterday where his cousin Richard Goldfarb was waiting. But when he failed to appear, Mr Goldfarb began to get worried. Off the streets: Max Melitzer, left, in an . old mugshot and right, shortly after he was found living homeless in . Salt Lake City. He is set to inherit around $100,000 . Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Goldfarb said: 'He has arrived and is safe. 'He doesn't want to talk now until he speaks to a lawyer in New York and a lawyer in Utah.' The news comes after it emerged yesterday Mr Melitzer's heart-warming rags-to-riches story had a tragic beginning. Mr Melitzer's decline into homelessness began after his wife and two friends were killed in a car crash 21 years ago. Friend Karol Behling said Mr Melitzer was driving when the family tragedy happened and it may have led to his life on the streets of Salt Lake City, Utah. A private investigator tracked down Mr Melitzer, 65, last week to deliver the life-altering news of the inheritance left by a brother who died of cancer. Ms Behling said Mr Melitzer was deeply affected by the death of his wife, Janice, and his life on the streets seemed to begin after the accident. Windfall: Max Melitzer on the park bench in Salt Lake City where Mr Lundberg found him last week . ‘He was very much in love with his wife, I believe,' Ms Behling said. 'And it was really hard for him - one, to have her gone and, two, to have been driving.' ‘I’m sure that affected him a lot, and I'm sure he missed his wife a lot,’ she told the Deseret News. Mr Melitzer was driving through Wyoming in July 1990 when he lost control of his car, killing his wife and two passengers. Behling said she recalls Mr Melitzer . lost his apartment after the crash and bounced from place to place . between Ogden and Salt Lake City. Two months ago the Melitzer family hired private investigator David Lundberg to track down Max. Neither Mr Lundberg nor the family's law firm . have disclosed the amount Mr Melitzer will receive, but it is believed . to be around $100,000. ‘He'd have money where he could take care of himself or hire someone to take care of him,’ Mr Lundberg said. Success: Private investigator David Lundberg with Mr Melitzer. He is now set to inherit his late brother's entire estate, believed to be worth around $100,000 . ‘Apparently, he does have some emotional issues. The family just wants to make sure he's set up and he's taken care of.’ It took his cousin, Richard Goldfarb, more than a year to find Max, finally fulfilling his brother's deathbed request. The down-and-out was left 'in shock' when Mr Lundberg told him he stands to inherit just over $100,000 from . his brother, Morris, who he hadn't seen in 15 years. He was discovered wandering around a park in Salt Lake City last Friday, pushing his shopping cart in front of him. Refuge: Max Melitzer was a regular visitor to the Rescue Mission of Salt Lake City . Mr Goldfarb, the Melitzers' first cousin, said he was 'tickled pink' to have finally found Max. He told MailOnline: 'He ate his first seafood in over 25 years when Mr Lundberg took him out for dinner. ‘(The windfall) is not a fortune, but . to him it'll feel like a million dollars. I am tickled pink, now I . don't have to worry about finding him anymore. 'The family are all tickled pink, . we're all very happy that we have finally found him, and got him out of . the life he has been living.'","Bus carrying him from Utah to NYC broke down .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 2:35 PM on 2nd September 2011 . Former first lady Jackie Kennedy is said to have made the tapes within months of JFK's assassination . An ABC special with never-before-heard interviews with Jacqueline Kennedy will air on September 13 made only months after her husband's assassination and sealed until now. Viewers will hear the former first lady speak with historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr about life in the White House and with her husband, President John F. Kennedy. The tapes have been sealed in a vault since 22 November, 1963. There were previous reports that the tapes would contain explosive content and include details of JFK's affair with a White House intern and theories that Lyndon B Johnson and a cabal of Texas tycoons were involved in the assassination of her husband. Originally planned for one hour, the special will now fill two hours in prime time and feature Diane Sawyer's interview with the couple's daughter, Caroline Kennedy. After the famously private former first lady  did the interviews,  she steadfastly refused to publicly discuss any details with anyone else about that time in her life. ABC have denied rumours that jackie Kennedy will talk about how she became convinced that the then vice president, along with businessmen in the South, had orchestrated the Dallas shooting, with gunman Lee Harvey Oswald – long claimed to have been a lone assassin – merely part of a much larger conspiracy. Texas-born Mr Johnson, who served as the state’s governor and senator, completed Mr Kennedy’s term and went on to be elected president in his own right. Mrs Kennedy, who went on to marry Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, had ordered that they should not be released until  50 years after her death, with some reports suggesting she feared that her revelations might make her family targets for revenge. She died 17 years ago from cancer aged 64 and now her daughter, Caroline Kennedy, has agreed to release the recordings early. Scroll down for video . John and Jackie Kennedy with daughter Caroline, who allowed the tapes to be released to ABC in return for their cancelling of the mini series about the family . Jackie is said to reveal her affair with actor William Holden, right, which she did in retaliation for her husband's many flings . In the tapes, Jackie allegedly blames President Lyndon Johnson for the death of JFK, who took over the post from her husband after his assassination . Daughter Caroline Kennedy released the 'explosive' tapes . A source said to be close to an ABC executive said last month that the tapes also revealed that she too . had affairs – one with Hollywood star William Holden and another with . Fiat founder Gianni Agnelli – as a result of the president’s . indiscretions. It has also been claimed that, in the weeks before Mr . Kennedy’s assassination, the couple had turned a corner in their . relationship and were planning to have more children. Historian Edward Klein, who has . written several books on the Kennedy clan, said: ‘Jackie regarded the . pretty young things in the White House as superficial flings for Jack. She did retaliate by having her own affairs. ‘There was a period during which she was delighted to be able to annoy her husband with her own illicit romances.’ It is believed that Caroline, 53, . agreed to the early release of the tapes in exchange for ABC dropping . its £10million drama series about the family. The Kennedys, starring Tom Cruise’s . wife Katie Holmes as Jackie, critically charted the family’s political . and personal trials and tribulations since the 1930s. The series was . eventually broadcast on an independent cable channel,  and on BBC2 in . the UK, against Caroline’s wishes. A spokesman for ABC said the claims about the content of the tapes were 'erroneous'. He said: ‘The actual content of the tapes provide unique and important insight into our recent past from one of the most fascinating and influential First Ladies in American history. 'ABC isn't releasing any content from those tapes until mid-September, at which time it will be clear how off base these reports are.'","She will allegedly reveal affair with actor William Holden .

But many artefacts such as mobile phones, aeroplane engines and even a New York police car door survive to tell the tale of 9/11 at the Newseum in Washington D.C. The museum is expanding its war on terror exhibition with more artefacts from 9/11 and other terrorist attacks that have never previously been seen on public display. Memorials: Mobile phones and other communication devices found in the rubble from the September 11 attacks in 2011 on the World Trade Center are displayed as part of a new exhibit in Washington D.C. News wall: The damaged antenna from the North Tower of the World Trade Center and newspaper front pages about the September 11 terrorist attacks are seen in an exhibit at the Newseum . ‘I think the most powerful pieces here are the most personal,’ the Newseum’s Cathy Trost told CNN. ‘The things that people put in their pockets that morning not knowing that this was going to be a day that changed their lives forever.’ The Newseum, which charges admission fees of $22 for adults, is a 250,000 sq ft museum covering five centuries of news and features a 74ft marble engraving of the First Amendment. Its new exhibition, the ‘War on Terror: The FBI's New Focus’, will open on Friday after the museum chose 60 pieces of evidence the FBI had in storage for terror trials, reported CNN.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 11:31 AM on 26th June 2011 . Esther Rantzen has been involved in a high-profile advertising campaign for the Accident Advice Line. This weekend they insisted that did everything to comply with the law . Companies sending out 'illegal' nuisance texts telling mobile users they could be entitled to thousands of pounds compensation for their 'accident' are raking in £175million a year, it emerged today. 'Claim farmers' bombarded phone users with an estimated 12.75million spam messages last month alone. The shady companies are raking in up to £500 every time they refer a case to a 'no win, no fee' law firm - and £5 if the phone user replies saying 'stop' to end the unwanted texts. Other users have had messages about . debt management schemes and claiming compensation for the mis-selling of . payment protection insurance. Once a response has been received the operators know the number is genuine and in use so can sell the details on. When sent without the phone user's consent, the spam mail is classed as a 'cold call' - which is illegal. Firms . sending out unwanted mail can be prosecuted and fined up to £500,000. But as messages are often sent out by eastern European or Indian . companies from pay as you go mobile numbers they are very difficult to . trace. Text messages are often sent out in bulk from Indian call centres or from eastern Europe . High profile campaign: Esther Rantzen in the Accident Advice Helpline Advert . The firms claim that people receiving spam mail will have opted in to have their details passed on to third party companies. When someone responds with details of an accident their contact information is passed on to solicitors to assess whether the individual is eligible for compensation. Law firms often pay little attention to how the client details were obtained, the Sunday Telegraph revealed. The texts are sent out via computers to thousands of people urging them to make a compensation claim for their 'accident'. They . typically cost around 2p a time to send out - but the expenditure is . swiftly recovered by the vast fees that can be obtained. When a mobile user replies with details of an incident they are passed on to claim firms who in turn give the details to solicitors. Once a reporter provided details of an invented 'accident' they were given to leading claims firm the Accident Advice Helpline which has used television star Esther Rantzen in its adverts. The firm, which has a turnover of £12million a year, admitted last night they face difficulties working out how client details have been obtained. A spokesman representing the firm said that the Accident Advice Helpline were 'aware of their obligations' and said it was unlawful to send unsolicited text messages unless they opt in. He added that the firm carried out 'due diligence' and always got written confirmation from suppliers that the law had been complied with. But he added: 'The difficulty faced . by companies in this field is that whilst due diligence is possible on . the companies from whom information is purchased, those companies will . in turn purchase information from third parties.' Spam messages are raking in an estimated £175m a year . There is no suggestion that Esther Rantzen has done anything wrong. Regulators have called for referral fees to be banned to put an end to the shady practice. Although . the mobile number the nuisance message sent from can be blocked or . deactivated there is nothing preventing the firm from simply using . another phone number. Mike Lordan, chief of operations for the Direct Marketing Association, who are calling for a clampdown on unsolicited texts, said around three per cent of people reply to the unwanted messages. 'Our research shows that a large percentage of people are receiving spam and are unsure how to stop it and don't know who to make a complaint to,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. 'Mobile spam is causing distress to many people and seriously damaging the legitimate multi-million pound mobile marketing industry. 'Regulators have been unwilling or unable to take ownership and tackle this growing problem.'","A third of mobile users receive the nuisance texts .

A YOUNG mother whose son had been sent home from hospital despite being desperately ill with pneumonia was devastated to find him dead in his bed. But that was only the beginning of the nightmare for 20-year-old Abby Podmore. Within an hour she was arrested on suspicion of murdering Alfie, three. She said ‘heavy-handed’ police sent two riot vans and 17 officers to arrest her and she was held for questioning overnight. Miss Podmore was released the following day after post mortem examination results revealed the child had died of natural causes. Grieving mum: Abby Podmore from Birmingham whose son, three-year-old old Alfie Podmore died from natural causes . Devastated Miss Podmore soon found that a white police tent had been erected outside her home, and she was arrested on suspicion of murder just hours after her son's death. She was kept in custody overnight until a doctor acting under orders from the local coroner informed police that Alfie had died from natural causes. The dental nurse, from Quinton, Birmingham, has been unable to return home since the incident, with some members of the local community believing she played some part in little Alfie's death. Alfie was sent home from nursery on February 2 this year after he became unwell. He was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital the following day, suffering a high temperature, a rash and pain in his left shoulder. Just hours after Alfie's death Abby Podmore was arrested on suspicion of murder and remained in custody overnight . Doctors diagnosed the child with a gastric illness and prescribed him anti-acid medication before sending him home. But a post-mortem later revealed that he had suffered from pneumonia, a bacterial infection and septicaemia. He started improving, but the following day, February 6, he became ‘very restless’ and she was up with him until 4am. She said: ‘When I eventually woke up the following day my first thought was to check on him. ‘I ran upstairs and he was lying  on the bottom of his bed and  wasn’t breathing. ‘He was freezing cold and had blood coming out of his nose. I started trying to resuscitate him while phoning the ambulance. I was terrified.’ Miss Podmore, who is trained in life support, continued trying to revive Alfie until paramedics arrived. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragedy: Abby Podmore, 21, awoke in February this year to find that little Alfie, pictured with his mother, was not breathing . Police arrived shortly afterwards and told her to change her clothes and leave her house and stay at her brother’s home around the corner. She followed their instructions but now suspects they were already making preparations to preserve the scene and keep her clothes for forensic analysis. Miss Podmore has hit out at police, saying that she feels she was denied the chance to grieve properly for her dead son. She said: 'I was still struggling to cope with the news that my little boy had passed away when police officers came to tell me I was being taken into custody on suspicion of my son's murder. I wasn't even allowed to see his body for 10 days after he died. 'I am ashamed that they would even think that I would do that to my child who was my world and my everything. Alfie was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital and doctors thought he had a gastric illness . ‘My son had just died and I was thrown into a cell and branded a murderer,’ said Miss Podmore, who is separated from Alfie’s father. ‘I’ve been robbed of my chance to say goodbye to him and this has ruined my life.’ The grieving mother has made formal complaints to both the hospital, which admits it ‘let Alfie down’, and West Midlands Police. However officers have still not explained what prompted them to arrest her. She suspects that a neighbour told police she heard crying that night, but she said the noise would have been made by Alfie because he was in pain. Miss Podmore, who has not been able to return home since Alfie died due to the stigma surrounding her arrest, said that she wants others to avoid her experiences. She said: 'I love my little boy and did the very best I could for him. When he became ill my mother took him to hospital and when I got to the hospital we were later told he had a simple gastric illness and to take him home. 'The police later told us that things should have been done differently, they apologised and said that police protocols were not correctly followed but my whole life has been turned upside down because of what happened. 'I haven't even been able to return home or grieve properly and I wouldn't want anyone else to suffer as I have. I hope that speaking out will ensure valuable lessons are learnt.' Miss Podmore has also made a formal complaint to the police and this is being investigated by the Professional Standards Department. Guy Forster, a medical law expert from the Birmingham office of Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, who is representing the family, said: 'For Abby the past six months have been unbearable; firstly suffering the unimaginable pain of losing her only child and then being wrongly blamed for his death. 'Abby and her partner, who was also arrested, are still suffering as a result of the heavy-handed actions of the Police and feel that they have lost their good name and reputation, with some members of the local community wrongly being led to believe they had some part in Alfie's death.' A full inquest is now listed to take place on 29 September 2011 at Birmingham Coroners Court. A spokesman for the hospital said: ‘Investigations are still ongoing but it has become clear that there was more that we could have done to help Alfie.’",Abby Podmore said she has felt unable to return home due to the stigma surrounding her arrest .

Three men were shot and wounded in the clashes on Tuesday night and police were on stand-by for further trouble yesterday. At least five shots were said to have been fired - one hitting a news photographer. Two other men were hit in the leg. Violence: Loyalist rioters attack police in East Belfast as trouble flares for a second night running . Riot: Loyalist paramilitaries supposedly on ceasefire orchestrated a major riot in Belfast and opened fire on police near Short Strand, a Catholic enclave in the Protestant-dominated eastern part of the city . Hand-to-hand combat: Around 500 people were involved in the riots . The last two days have seen pitched . battles between loyalists and republicans in the Lower Newtownards Road . and Short Strand, notorious flashpoint areas of East Belfast. Police have blamed the loyalist . Ulster Volunteer Force for igniting the violence on Tuesday night, . apparently in protest at restrictions on parades through contentious . areas during the forthcoming marching season. Assistant Chief Constable Alistair . Finlay said of the UVF: 'Their hands are upon this, whether by direction . by omission or commission.' However the bullets are believed to have been fired by Republican sympathisers. A woman of 20 was arrested last night . on suspicion of possessing a weapon and assaulting police but she has . not been charged in connection with the shootings. At least 400 rioters are said to have . attacked officers in East Belfast with petrol and paint bombs. Officers . responded by firing 66 baton rounds and water cannon. At one stage, masked youths used . sledgehammers to attack police vehicles, standing on the bonnets trying . to rip protective grilles from the windscreens so they could reach . officers inside. Northern Ireland first minister Peter . Robinson promised that he was prepared to become 'directly involved' in . attempts to resolve the trouble in his east Belfast constituency. 'At this time, when many are working . hard to build a better and brighter future for all in Northern Ireland, . it is disappointing and deeply concerning to see this level of violence . return to our streets,' he said. Deputy first minister Martin . McGuinness, blamed a 'small minority of individuals clearly determined . to destabilise our communities. They will not be allowed to drag us back to the past,' he declared. Photographer Niall Carson has his wounds tended to by police while a woman walks in front of a mural showing two Ulster Volunteer Force members in a mainly Protestant area . However, police fear the trouble may well escalate. The Protestant marching season is a . little over two weeks away and dissident Republicans have carried out a . string of attacks on members of the security forces - including the . murder of Roman Catholic policeman Ronan Kerr in Omagh less than three . months ago. The wounded photographer, Niall . Carson of the Press Association, was in a stable condition at the Royal . Victoria Hospital in Belfast after a bullet passed through his left leg. Close call: A petrol bomb lands close to a police officer in East Belfast on the second night of rioting . Attacks: Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness condemned the rioting . Another photographer said he saw someone peering over a wall who then fired five or six rounds. 'We were all running,' he added. 'The next thing I know a colleague yells ""I've been shot"".' Local MP Naomi Long said one man had been struck on the head with a brick, which fractured his skull. She described the trouble as 'very serious' and said appeals from public representatives had fallen on 'deaf ears'. Masked men: Scores of people in camouflage clothing were at the centre of the co-ordinated attacks that ignited the disturbances .

There's brazen and there's brazen...and then there's James 'Whitey' Bulger. During the epic 16 years he spent evading authorities, the Boston mob boss enjoyed a day out to Alcatraz... where he'd previously been a prisoner for four years. Perhaps he just wanted to see how the San Francisco prison had changed. But for someone who didn't own a car and paid all his bills in cash to avoid detection, it was a pretty risky day trip. Still, he and long term mob moll . Teresa Stanley seemed to enjoy themselves, a source close to his family . who has pictures of the great event, told the New York Post. Bulger . even donned prison stripes outside 'The Rock' for a souvenir snap, . while Stanley slipped into a jumpsuit stencilled with 'Property of . Alcatraz.' Bulger was locked up in the island prison from 1959 to 1963 on federal armed robbery charges. The . source said the photo of the pair at the prison was definitely taken . while Bulger was on the run, but was unsure of an exact date. He . was reported to have been in San Francisco in the January of 1995, . weeks before fleeing to Boston to escape indictment for murder and . racketeering, according to The Boston Globe. Scenic: Bulger was back at the prison in the 1990s, this time as a tourist. Even though he was on the run from the FBI he took time to dress up in jailbird garb and pose for souvenir photos . The law finally caught up with him last week when the now 81-year-old and his long-term girlfriend Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica. Bulger is charged with 19 murders, extortion, money laundering and other crimes; if convicted, he faces life in prison or the death penalty. The FBI has long been criticised for not trying hard enough to find Bulger and the Alcatraz visit will only add fuel to that fire. But he seemed to be the master of evasion adopting an unassuming lifestyle, limited his social contact . to small talk and adhered to the code of silence from the mob life he . left behind. On the inside: Bulger would have strolled down 'Broadway' in the main cellhouse in the prison, all the while being one of the FBI's most wanted . When federal agents tracked him to his lair last week, it . was only after targeting the one part of his past that Bulger didn't . leave behind -  his girlfriend Catherine. By all . accounts, the two did little to ever arouse suspicion, posing as two . retirees holed up in a bland white 1970s apartment complex in Santa . Monica amid other buildings of the same era. Although Bulger was believed to have . millions of dollars stashed in secret accounts, and investigators found . $800,000 hidden in the apartment, the couple didn't live lavishly. They . paid $1,145 cash several days in advance each month for a . rent-controlled unit, while newer neighbours paid more than twice as . much. Greig shopped at a 99-cent store. Busted: Bulger, left, and his long term girlfriend Catherine Greig, right, were arrested last week . Occasionally, they splurged, even while remaining discreet. Andrew . Turner, the general manager of Michael's, recognised pictures of the . fugitives this week as the couple who dined occasionally at table No 23 . at the upscale institution. He had a record of them paying their $190 . tab in cash for a meal that included Grey Goose vodka cocktails, foie . gras, steak and lobster, topped off by wine, in September 2009 - the . month Bulger turned 80. The couple kept to themselves and were . unassuming, Turner recalled. 'This guy was just nice, mild and meek, milquetoast in a little apartment in Santa Monica,' said Bill Keefer, a . retired U.S. marshal who supervised the witness protection program in . Los Angeles, Hawaii and Long Island, New York. Unassuming: The couple lived in this top corner third floor apartment, upper left, in Santa Monica, California . 'This guy should have been a . supervisor with the marshal's witness protection programme. He did an . outstanding job, the louse.' Neighbours of the couple said they stuck close to home. Greig was . the more outgoing of the two while Bulger was sometimes cranky and . reclusive. Barbara Gluck, a tenant down the hall, described Greig as . sweet and lovely, Bulger not so. 'It was like she was hanging on to a time-bomb,' Gluck said. 'At one point, she said, ""he has a rage issue"".' Room 303: Neighbours said the couple were friendly but kept to themselves. One even said she would 'miss them' Others said the couple went out of their way to ingratiate themselves while also maintaining a distance. 'They were good neighbours,' said Catalina Schlank, 88. 'I will miss them.' Bulger's . wealth helped him maintain independence from family or former criminal . allies who might have given away his location, said retired FBI agent . Scott Bakken, who worked the Bulger case for a short time in 2002. 'Here you have somebody who is far more . sophisticated than some 18-year-old who killed someone in a drive-by,' Bakken said. 'To be a successful fugitive you have to cut . all contacts from your previous life. He had the means and kept a low . profile.'","Mob boss dressed in jailbird garb and posed for photos during 1990s visit .

"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 7:54 AM on 22nd June 2011 . Extraordinary attack: Prime Minister David Cameron . David Cameron launched an extraordinary attack yesterday on moaning military chiefs who openly questioned the length of the war in Libya. In a humiliating public slapdown, the Prime Minister told complaining top brass: ‘You do the fighting and I’ll do the talking’. His withering criticism came after the RAF’s second-in-command warned that the Armed Forces would struggle to respond to future emergencies if operations against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi dragged on beyond the summer. Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant said fighting simultaneous conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East was placing ‘huge’ demands on airmen and aircraft. Morale in the RAF was ‘fragile’ and ‘fighting spirit’ was threatened by being overworked and the impact of the Coalition’s unpopular defence cuts, he added. Air Chief Marshal Bryant’s assessment - contained in a leaked briefing paper to MPs - was the second time in a month a senior officer has cast serious doubt on the Government’s defence strategy. Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the head of the Royal Navy, claimed last week that Britain’s security would be at risk if the Libyan conflict lasted more than six months. He said ministers faced having to make ‘challenging decisions’ - including the possibility of withdrawing ships currently patrolling home waters. Mr Cameron’s woes deepened last night when General Sir Peter Wall, the head of the Army, appeared to question Downing Street’s timeline for withdrawing British troops from Afghanistan. The Chief of the General Staff told a BBC 2 documentary to be broadcast tonight WED that ‘we shall find out nearer the time’ if the 2014 deadline was implemented. The Prime Minister could barely conceal his frustration when asked about the latest intervention at a news conference in London. He said: ‘There are moments when I wake up and read the newspapers and think: “I tell you what, you do the fighting and I’ll do the talking”.’ Rebel fighters fire a Grad rocket at the front line west of Misrata yesterday. It is unlikely that Air Chief Marshal Bryant will face the same reprimand Sir Mark . On-going: Rebel fighters fire a Grad rocket at the front line west of Misrata, Libya. The RAF chief's comments add to growing concerns about the length of the Libya operation . Map detailing control of major towns and events in Libya . The Premier insisted that Chief of . the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards and Admiral Stanhope - . hauled into Number 10 last week for a dressing down - were ‘absolutely . clear that we are able to keep up this mission for as long as is . necessary’. He said: ‘I’m . absolutely confident that we can keep this pressure up. We can maintain . this mission for as long as necessary. Time is on our side.’ Mr Cameron said that airmen’s morale and enthusiasm appeared ‘extremely high’ when he had spoken to them. But Air Chief Marshal Bryant warned MPs that morale was ‘fragile’ and that many areas of the RAF were are ‘running hot’. The . RAF has six Typhoon and 12 Tornado fighter jets flying daily missions . in Libya and 10 Tornados, four Hercules transport aircraft and more than . 20 helicopters in Afghanistan. He said: ‘Two concurrent operations are placing a huge demand on equipment and personnel. ‘Should . Operation Ellamy [the codename for the Libyan operation] endure past . defence planning assumptions the future contingent capability is likely . to be eroded.’ First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, left, warned Britain's Navy would struggle if the conflict in Libya continued beyond a further 90 days. Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant, right, described morale as 'fragile' He added: . ‘Morale remains fragile. Although fighting spirit remains positive, this . assessment will be challenged by individual harmony targets as . Operation Ellamy endures [after September]. ‘There is decreasing satisfaction with the remunerative offer, and allowances cut and the pay freeze continues to bite.’ The RAF will be cut by 5,000 troops over the next three years, reducing its strength to 32,000 personnel. The . cuts made by the Government - another 12,000 Army and Navy personnel . will be axed alongside warships, aircraft and tanks - had led to dire . warnings of the consequences for Britain’s safety. Critics . believe Mr Cameron should reopen the Strategic Defence and Security . Review in light of its growing irrelevance in light of ‘Arab Spring’ uprisings. Wing Commander . Andrew Brookes, director of the Air League, said: ‘They are rightly . saying to David Cameron, “Yes, oh leader, we will do what you want but . we can’t do it for long because you have hobbled our services. ‘We . simply cannot fight war after war after war because there is a bill to . be paid in terms of resources and rest and recuperation of our troops.’ People stand at a house, which was damaged by coalition air strikes according to the Libyan government, in Tripoli yesterday . Liberal . Democrat MP Sir Menzies Campbell, a member of the Commons Foreign . Affairs Committee, said: ‘First the Navy, now the RAF: defence decisions . are coming home to roost. ‘You can have increased defence commitments and cuts but you can’t have both at the same time.’ Shadow . defence secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘Senior RAF officers are clear that . ministers’ decisions will mean within weeks our forces will be at their . limit. ‘We support action . in both Libya and Afghanistan, which are important for our own national . security, but it is vital that our forces are sufficiently equipped.’ The UN-sanctioned mission to protect Libyan civilians from Gaddafi’s regime has so far lasted three months. The RAF is enforcing a no-fly zone and carrying out bombing raids against the dictator’s military.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:57 PM on 21st June 2011 . Four inmates – including one jailed for his part in a killing and another who committed robbery with a chainsaw – have gone on the run from one of Britain's least secure prisons. The men absconded from the category D Sudbury open prison over the weekend. Three inmates walked out on Saturday though staff only noticed they were missing when they carried out a roll call that evening. The fourth left on Sunday. One of the men, a 33-year-old burglar, was recaptured by police in the West Midlands on Sunday. Killer Brett Frewin, left, who escaped from Sudbury, was among a gang of four who left father of three Tushar Makwana (right) for dead after he tried to stop them stealing a car. But burglar Warren Bamford, robber . Christopher Price and Brett Frewin, who killed a father of three in a . bungled burglary, were still at large last night. Despite being classified as fit to be held at an open prison, police have warned the public they should not approach the men. HMP Sudbury open prison has endured a string of problems in recent years. Last February a prison inmate turned an empty office into a major drugs factory - while out on day release from the jail on 'work experience.' In 2008 it was alleged prostitutes were being smuggled into Sudbury to spend the night with inmates. In September 2007, convicted murderer Raymond Kennedy escaped from the prison, becoming the 48th to go on the run that year. And last month burglars cut their way through a perimeter fence at HMP Sudbury Prison in Derbyshire before wrenching open the door of a workshop and making off with £1,000 of tools. Detectives say all the men have . connections to the West Midlands and officers are investigating if they . colluded over their escape. Police are appealing for information about their whereabouts, but say people should not approach them. Frewin was one of four teenagers jailed for killing award-winning DJ Tushar Makwana. The 37-year-old Heart FM presenter . suffered fatal head injuries when he tried to stop the quartet escaping . in a stolen car after he disturbed three of them breaking into his home. Leicester Crown Court heard the vehicle, a Citroen C5, was used 'like a weapon' to brush Mr Makwana off after the burglary at his house in Castle Bromwich, in February, 2004. Three of the gang kicked down his front door, with the aim of stealing keys to his BMW parked outside. But Mr Makwana, who was barefoot and wearing only a dressing gown, chased the trio to their getaway car, where the driver was waiting. He tried to get inside the Citroen but the vehicle sped off and Mr Makwana fell, suffering a fractured skull and brain swelling. He died in hospital three days later. Frewin, now 24, was jailed for 10 years for manslaughter and burglary in 2004. He is white, 5ft 9in and slim with short brown hair, brown eyes and a Birmingham accent. His last known address was in Castle Vale, Birmingham. Price, now 26, was part of a four-strong Birmingham gang who raided a shop armed with a chainsaw and a knife. A grandmother was working alone behind the counter when the masked gang stormed in and shoved her out of the way. She managed to push a panic button but the gang took £100 from a till before fleeing in a stolen car. Price admitted robbery and was jailed for five years and six months in 2009. He is white, 5ft 10in and of medium build with short brown hair, blue eyes. His last known address was in Yardley, Birmingham. Bamford, 34, was jailed for six years in 2009 for burglary. He is white, 6ft 3in with receding ginger hair and blue eyes. His last known address was in Bromsgrove. Sudbury, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, holds 580 inmates, but it has been plagued by prisoner break-outs. Fifty inmates absconded from the jail between October 2007 to March 2009. That figure was less than half the number who went on the run in the previous 18-month period, when 106 prisoners gave guards the slip.","A fourth man who escaped has since been caught .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:52 PM on 8th July 2011 . A Princess Diana lookalike and her husband ran a Europe-wide black-market empire which flooded the UK alone with £6million worth of illegal veterinary drugs, a court was told yesterday. Regine Lansley, 62, and Ronald Meddes, 73, supplied 1,800 clients from their 11-bedroom French farmhouse. Despite being known by villagers as ‘Ronnie and Reggie’, the couple appeared the epitome of respectability. Lookalike: Regine Lansley in Princess Diana-pose from her website, but she was jailed today for selling black market vet drugs to the UK . Lansley, who hired herself out for appearances based on her similarity to the late princess, claims to be an expert horsewoman. The real princess: Diana, who died in 1997, is pictured attending a private viewing and reception at auctioneers Christies in London . In her online profile for the actors’ agents Lynch Media Group, she describes herself as ‘very elegant with a dazzling smile, charismatic with an obvious “wow factor”.’ She adds: ‘People rarely believe my age and frequently say, “I wish I could be like you”. I have a certain talent and air about me that I am able to give high street clothes a designer look.’ Her husband, a disgraced ex-Lloyd’s trader and convicted fraudster, was also well known in equestrian circles and bought his wife the farmhouse, 80 miles from Paris, for her 50th birthday. Yesterday the couple were jailed and warned they would come out penniless after proceedings to confiscate the proceeds of their crime. Lansley was given 20 months and her husband 28 months after Croydon Crown Court heard that a raid on their farmhouse represented the largest seizure of illegal veterinary products in Europe. Such was the scale of their illicit operation that some medicines enjoyed the largest market share in the UK over legitimate products and just one of their delivery companies transported 8.5 tons of black-market drugs into the UK in two years. There was a threefold price mark up on some medicines brought in from India and investigators discovered paperwork showing total sales of £13.5million over a six-year period. Luxury life: Meddes and Lansley pictured at their French farmhouse close to Paris . The couple became so greedy that even after their farmhouse was raided in 2007 they moved across the border to Belgium and resumed trading. When that property was raided a year later they moved on again ‘undaunted’ and continued to sell while on bail. Their UK customer list included farms, stables, kennels, hunts, shoots and veterinary practices. The drugs they supplied included anti-inflammatories, anabolic steroids, tranquillisers, antibiotics, sedatives, painkillers and other miscellaneous products administered to horses, household pets and farm animals. Andrew Marshall, prosecuting, said: ‘It becomes a bit of a free-for-all and the food chain is placed at risk as well. ‘These animals and their welfare are being placed at risk.’ The couple evaded EU regulations by lying that the medicines were for export to Russia only. Different life: The couple, in a recent picture, were jailed at Croydon Crown Court . Meddes, now of Charing, Kent, admitted 19 counts of unlawfully supplying unauthorised veterinary medicines and Lansley, who gave her address as West Brompton, West London, although the couple are still together, pleaded guilty to two counts. Also sentenced today was a former employee of Meddes, Alex John, represented by solicitor Richard Gowthorpe of Lansbury Worthington Solicitors. After his client received a suspended prison sentence and 200 hours unpaid community work, her lawyer said: ""It is a huge relief that this prosecution has finally come to an end and without Alex being sent to prison. No-one realised this was illegal several years ago and Defra change the rules every year"".",Regine Lansley could be hired out for parties where she would impersonate the late Princess of Wales .
"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 11:02 AM on 4th July 2011 . The woman who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of rape allegedly grew angry when he refused to pay her for sex, it emerged today. The hotel maid, who has now been accused of working as a prostitute, allegedly performed a sex act on him in his room at the Sofitel in Manhattan. She originally told police she did not know who the former IMF chief and that he raped her in his suite. Celebration: Strauss Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair leave his Tribeca apartment after the former IMF chief was freed from his strict bail conditions . But the case against the millionaire has fallen apart after it emerged the woman had told prosecutors a series of lies. Sources now claim she was aware of his VIP status and became angry when he refused to pay her for her sexual services. A source close to the defence investigation told the New York Post: 'She figured he's a rich dude, and she would get paid. She was told by the crew she ran with that this was a gold mine.' The maid, a West African native, told police that on May 14, while she was cleaning Strauss Kahn's suite, he forced her to perform oral sex on him and violently groped her breasts and vagina, leaving her bruised. But the source told the Post that the 32-year-old maid regularly got paid for sex at the hotel and she performed oral sex on the Frenchman in exchange for money. But when they were finished and the woman demanded money from him, Strauss Kahn refused to pay. 'There was an expectation of money after the fact, but he was dismissive,' the source said. 'He turned his back on her and got dressed. Questions: The maid, who is believed to be a prostitute, cannot be identified for legal reasons . 'She remained in the room with him while he got dressed for at least nine minutes.' The humiliating exchange sparked the maid's anger, prosecutors suspect. Though she told police after she reported the alleged attack that she did not know who Strauss Kahn was - who at the time was being touted as the next President of France - she was reportedly on the phone the following day with a jailed drug dealer talking about a potential windfall if she pursued charges. A letter from prosecutors also revealed that she lied about what actually happened on the day. It said: 'In the weeks following the incident charged in the indictment, the complainant told detectives and assistant district attorneys on numerous occasions that, after being sexually assaulted . . . she fled to an area of the main hallway of the hotel's 28th floor and waited there until she observed the defendant . . . entering an elevator.' She said she then alerted her supervisor and waited for him. The maid later told this version of . events to the police and to a grand jury but then finally admitted that . she cleaned a nearby room and Dominique Strauss Kahn's room before she . reported the incident to her supervisor. Scene: The Sofitel in Manhattan where the alleged attack took place. The maid has admitted she lied to police and a grand jury . The DA's case has fallen into turmoil, and Strauss-Kahn was freed of his strict bail conditions. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. said prosecutors will keep investigating 'until we have . uncovered all relevant facts.' He said: 'Sometimes the road to get . to the truth has twists and turns in it, which are not always apparent . at the outset. What is important is not a win or a loss, but rather to . ensure the criminal justice system balances the rights of all those who . come before it.' Speculation is mounting that Strauss-Kahn may run for the French presidency in next year’s elections, but commentators have suggested that the case against him may still cause him damage. Michael Powell, columnist for the New York Times, said: ‘When the debate is between those who accuse you of rape and those who defend you as a mere disgusting cad, your image problems have not emerged from critical care.’ A poll last night revealed that the French people were split over whether Strauss-Kahn should run for the presidency. Some 49 per cent of those surveyed said they would like him to come back to French politics ‘one day’ while 45 per cent said no. Meanwhile Michele Sebban, one of Strauss-Kahn’s close allies, claimed yesterday that the court case was a ‘political assassination’. United: Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair arrive for a hearing at New York State Supreme Court on Friday . It was also revealed that while the maid . was being put up in a Brooklyn hotel by prosecutors, she continued to . work as a prostitute. According to the Post, a number of paying male visitors arrived at the maid's hotel in the weeks after Strauss Kahn's arrest. The source said: 'While she was under our supervision, there were multiple ""dates"" and encounters at the hotel on the DA's dime. That's a great deal for her. She doesn't have to cover her expenses.' The woman has a regular fleet of gentlemen callers who range from wealthy clients she met at the Sofitel to counterfeit-merchandise hawkers and livery-cab drivers, said sources close to the defence investigation. Some of her clients also gave her pricey jewellery, the source said. The woman is still being housed by the DA's Office but it is unclear if it is the same location or how much money has been spent to house her, the source said. Also, the DA suspects that the $100,000 she deposited into her accounts over the last few years included proceeds from sex-for-money exploits, said another prosecution source.","Source: Maid knew who the former IMF chief was .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:57 PM on 30th June 2011 . A 'hungry and unfriendly' Boa constrictor is on the loose, prompting a warning to parents today to keep children and pets indoors. The 7.5ft snake, called Diva, which squeezes its prey to death, has not eaten for three weeks and was due for a feed when it escaped in Ipswich, Suffolk. Police admitted they 'cannot rule out a danger to the public' as they launch an urgent search for it after it escaped yesterday. On the loose: Police are hunting for Diva, this 7.5ft Boa constrictor which escaped from a house in Ipswich, Suffolk . The nocturnal female snake eats small mammals and when hungry will climb trees and pounce on its prey. It disappeared from a home just 50m from a primary school, which was running four classes for 70 children despite the teaching strike today. A spokesman for Suffolk Police said that although Diva is not venomous she may bite if approached and warned anyone who spots her to dial 999. She said: 'The owner describes the snake as unfriendly, and it might bite if approached. However, it is not venomous. 'The snake is nocturnal and is likely to hunt at night and will bask in the warm grass or on rocks in the sun during the day. 'It will hide for example under sheds when not hunting or warming. She was last fed about three weeks ago and is due a feed. 'Suffolk Police cannot rule out a risk to the public and residents are advised to keep children and pets indoors. On the loose: Snake escaped from this cul-de-sac in Ipswich close to a playing field and a primary school . 'However, our understanding is that this snake will only feed on small animals such as mice and rats. 'It is possible the breeding season could have encouraged the Boa constrictor to go out hunting. 'The owner has searched her house and when she realised it had got out did the right thing and contacted police. Boa constrictors are powerful snakes and stealthy hunters. They travel at only 1mph. They live in tropical climates throughout most of Central and South America, where they hunt at night. The Boa's hunting technique is generally to ambush prey. The bigger it gets, the bigger its preferred prey becomes. It may start out eating mice and other small rodents. As it grows, it can handle big iguanas and wild pigs. They snakes are not venomous. Instead, boas grab and hold onto their prey with small, hooked teeth, wrap around the victim and squeeze them to death. It swallows its prey whole and food is digested by strong stomach acids. Boas will generally weigh more than 45kg and grow to about 13ft. The longest boa constrictor ever found was 18ft. In the wild, a Boa constrictor generally lives for 20 to 30 years.There are sometimes hunted them for their skins. 'She is quite knowledgeable about snakes and felt she had a duty of care to let police know.' The warning to more than 127,000 people living in Ipswich comes as thousands of children are at home because of teacher strikes. Diva was last seen at 6am on Wednesday and reported missing at 7pm. It escaped from a house in a cul-de-sac of 28 houses near playing fields. Neighbour Alexander Drummond, 59, said: 'We're right next to a school and I reckon if I were a Boa constrictor I'd be looking to hide out in the playing fields. 'There's plenty of grass and concrete it can hide under. I'm not too afraid of a Boa. 'If I see it I'll smack it over the head with something. If that doesn't work then I'm a fast runner.' Diva is described as 7.5ft long, dark and light brown patterned, with creamy white spots on her back, and a reddish brown mark at the end of her tail. South American Boa constrictors can grow up to 16ft in length and can live for up to 30 years. Anyone who spots the snake should not approach it, interfere with it or harm it but ring 999 immediately. If possible, they should keep the snake in sight, but from a safe distance until the police arrive.",Snake called Diva has not eaten for three weeks and is 'due a feed'
"By . Paul Bentley . Last updated at 8:11 PM on 11th July 2011 . The controversial Casey Anthony lawyer slammed for brashly celebrating her court victory with champagne and a finger up to the public has spoken out in defence of his client, insisting she never killed her two-year-old daughter Caylee. Cheney Mason, who has used his moment in the limelight following Anthony's dramatic six-week trial to slam those who have dared to criticise the verdict, said he has not 'for one minute' doubted the integrity of his client. He also took the opportunity to attack the 'stalker' at whom he infamously stuck up his middle finger, saying the man was 'lucky' he was protected at that moment by the walls of the bar he was outside. Scroll down for video . Spotlight: Attorney Cheney Mason has come under fire for his behaviour after the trial . In a spectacular turn of events for a . woman who was facing the death penalty, Casey Anthony was on Tuesday acquitted of charges that she killed her two-year-old daughter Caylee. The jury at court in Orange County found her not . guilty of first degree murder, aggravated murder and aggravated child . abuse. She was found guilty of four lesser charges of lying to police but she will . walk free from from jail on June 16 because of time already served and . good behaviour. In the wake of furious public backlash to the case's outcome, with repeated death threats sent to Anthony, her parents and her defence team, Mason took the opportunity to speak up for the reviled former murder suspect. Wink: Mason shares a glance with Casey Anthony during the dramatic six-week trial . Asked if he believed Anthony was innocent, Mason told NBC: 'I do believe her story. I . believed it from the first time I met her. Several weeks before I . formerly was on the team I went to her home, her room where all the . photographs are and talked to her. 'I have never for one minute had . any doubt at all. She did not kill her child. Period.' He added that while Anthony has a history of lying, he believes her story on Caylee's supposed accidental death was true. 'I don't think her story has changed since the very beginning,' he insisted. 'There's no . question that she told a lot of stories to friends for protective . mechanism and I think we presented evidence for that.' Uncouth: Mason flicks the bird at a 'stalker', left, while toasting his team's sensational court victory . Casey's . parents George and Cindy, who have been married for 30 years, publicly . supported their daughter from her initial arrest in 2008 to the . start of the murder trial. But on the opening day in court, . the defence dropped a bombshell that Caylee was never missing but had . drowned in an accident in the family's pool on June 16. More . shocking was the accusation that George Anthony had sexually abused his . daughter when she was a child, and suggested the dysfunctional . relationship explained Anthony's behaviour after Caylee's death. Tragic: Two-year-old Caylee died but no one has been convicted of murder . Defence . lawyer Jose Baez suggested this was why Casey had lied so frequently at first - to protect her dysfunctional family. He said Mr Anthony had a role in disposing the body . and bullied his daughter, who he had molested from aged eight, into . keeping it all secret. The family have denied the defence's account of events that Caylee drowned in their pool. In . court, Cindy Anthony dismissed claims that she had left a ladder to the . pool in place and George Anthony denied that he had ever sexually . abused his daughter. Mason insisted that Casey has, in fact, coped remarkably well under huge stress. 'She's under a lot of pressure,' he told NBC. 'Just imagine 23 hours a day for three years [in a solitary cell]. Most people would be drooling. 'She's a very intelligent person. And independent. 'We tried to keep her emotions down which is pretty . hard to do when your family is testifying against you and people are . calling for your blood like a lynch mob.' The attorney added that he was afraid for her safety in the wake of the trial. Asked where she would go after her release next weekend, he said: 'I don't know and if I did I wouldn't tell you.' He added: 'We're all concerned about her safety and her future. I don't know that anything is ever beyond repair. [but] I think with her parents that's pretty well burned. Appearance: Cheney Mason made the comments in defence of Casey Anthony . 'It's as much her country as anybody else's. She just needs some time and counselling and to be reintroduced into society.' Mason came under fire last week for celebrating the court victory with a champagne party at a local bar. In an apparent moment of madness, he turned to one camera pointed at him and rudely flipped his middle finger. Instead . of defending the action, however, Mason said he was gesturing towards a . 'stalker' who he threatened was lucky he did not come out to confront . him properly. Torn apart: Casey Anthony, left, has become estranged from mum Cindy after allegations of rape and incest . Behind bars: Casey Anthony will walk free from Orange County jail on Sunday 17 July . 'My frustrations were not with the news media itself or in general,' he explained. 'There . was one particular stalker that had been stalking our defence team . morning noon and night every day of the trial, yelling obsenities and . threatening and trying to embarrass and expose Mr Baez, myself and the . others on the team. '[He] went so far as to even ask some of the women on our team on the street if they were on their periods.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:39 PM on 28th June 2011 . Prisoners should be allowed to buy their way out of jail early, a Lib Dem councillor has said. Roy Davies says non-violent offenders should be able to pay £10,000 to have their six-month sentence halved. His proposal has won backing from colleagues in Blackburn, Lancashire. But political opponents have dismissed it as a 'crackpot' idea. Former Justice Secretary Jack Straw, the local MP, blasted it as 'totally wrong'. Cllr Roy Davies, left, says prisoners should be able to buy their way out of jail early. He has been supported by council leader David Foster, right . He said: 'It's the kind of thing we . oppose in other countries. It is the job of the court system to decide . the appropriate penalty and the court system should be blind to how deep . a person's pockets are, or it becomes completely unfair. 'There is also a question of where the criminals have got the money from in the first place.' Cllr . Davies, member for the town's Darwen ward, claims it would help ease . overcrowding in jail, and recoup money to make up for Government cuts, . such as closing the front counter at his local police station. However, Mike Cotton of the Campaign for Justice and Public Protection, said: 'I think it's a crackpot idea that wouldn't work. 'Most . of the people who go to jail do not have the finances to pay for that . kind of thing, and as it is, courts struggle to get fines of even £25 . off people. It just doesn't work like that.' Blackburn MP Jack Straw, the former Justice Secretary, has dismissed Roy Davies's proposal to have prisoners pay for early release . Cllr Phil Jones, leader of the For Darwen Party, says the idea would not work as people were likely to be paying the fines through criminally-obtained funds. He said: 'The better criminal they were, the more money they'd have available to cut their sentence. 'Rather than getting the criminals to pay with cash, maybe we should get them to work to pay off their sentence. 'Recycling . costs the borough a heck of a lot of money, so why don't we dump all . the rubbish in the prison yard and get the criminals to sort it out?' Cllr Davies's letter to the Lib Dem members outlining his plan: 'The more I think about the meeting that was held at the Library Theatre on Tuesday night the more concerned I am about who should actually be expected to hold the burden of the proposed reduction in police funding, which would be as I see it being placed on the public which actually pay now for their services. 'I think in all honesty this burden should be placed at the law breakers and the criminals. 'How could this be achieved? When a non-violent criminal is sentenced, part should be a custodial sentence and part a fine (ring fenced to go to police funds). 'Provided the criminal behaves themselves when in prison they will serve the sentence given. If they do not behave themselves they will serve a longer sentence. 'If this is introduced it could well be a win-win situation: not as many criminals stopping in prison longer this will ease the overcrowding, and monies collected will offset the need for cut backs in policing and will be seen in the public eye as making the law breaker pay for the police services. 'I think that this should be put to our leaders in central government as a way of reducing cut backs.' Cllr Davies made his suggestion in an email to Liberal Democrat members on the Blackburn with Darwen council. He said: 'The law-abiding people in this country are having to take on the problems caused by cutbacks. Why should we have to do this? 'The criminals should be made to pay fines for early release. 'They get time off for good behaviour, so why not allow them the chance to put money back to cover the cuts? 'It would be win-win. There would be less money spent on keeping them in prison, and more money for the police service to keep us safe. 'The money would definitely have to be ring-fenced to be spent only on covering budget cuts though.' Cllr Davies said his idea would only apply to non-violent crimes such as car theft, drug dealing, people trafficking and fraud. He said the amount payable should be decided by government in a unified way depending on the crime, but suggested that a fine of £10,000 could halve a six-month sentence. Cllr Davies added: 'A lot of criminals play the system, and some, like drug dealers have a lot of money hidden away that the court never get to know about. 'But if they couldn't come up with the money, then they serve a harder sentence, that's all. 'Some professional criminals who go from one sentence to another won't be bothered about getting off early, but others will.' Blackburn with Darwen Liberal Democrat leader David Foster said he supported Cllr Davies's idea and would be sending it on to ministers. He said: 'I think it's useful. We should always try and make criminals pay for their misdemeanours and this would be a way of them contributing back to the community. It could also be a way of them contributing to the police. 'Getting criminals to pay for what they have done is all to the good.'","They say it'll help ease overcrowding .

"By . Nick Pisa In Rome . Last updated at 3:41 PM on 22nd June 2011 . An identity card belonging to Pope John Paul I, who died mysteriously after just 33 days in the Vatican, has been sold on eBay for almost £5,000. Known as the 'Smiling Pope', he was elected in August 1978 but died dramatically amid rumours that he had been murdered by his enemies. The Italian identity card, which had been thought lost, was put up for sale by a priest in the late Pontiff's native city of Venice and bids quickly flooded into the auction website. Eventually it was sold for 5,200 Euros, £4,636. Valuable: Pope John Paul I's identity card was thought to be missing but a Venetian priest has sold it on eBay for almost £5,000 . A description below the card read: 'An exceptional sale for charity - this rare identity document that belonged to the Patriarch of Venice, Albino Luciani, later Pope John Paul I. 'It is being offered for sale by a priest close to him with the only aim being to raise funds for charity.' The card, issued by Venice council, gives the Pope's then profession as 'Patriarch', the traditional name given to the Archbishop of Venice. It lists him as celibate and having brown eyes and grey hair. Murdered?: Nuns and tourists in St Peter's Square in 1978 read a special edition of a Rome newspaper carrying the headline 'The Pope is Dead' Pope John Paul I was Archbishop of Venice and a Cardinal known for his humanitarian work. He was said to have been deeply shocked when he discovered the extent to which Freemasons had worked their way into the Vatican. At the time of his death he was about to name senior figures within the Vatican who were involved with a masonic lodge known as P2, as well as corruption within the Vatican Bank. Rumours had been circulating for months that the bank's then head, Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, was in league with a corrupt financier who had been laundering Mafia funds through him. Archbishop Marcinkus, who was from Chicago, looked more like a gangster than a man of the church and many suspected him and the Vatican's then Secretary of State Jean Marie Villot of being behind the Pope's death. Solemn moment: Italian cardinal Pericle Felici places a simple woollen pallium on Albino Luciani as he becomes Pope John Paul I at a ceremony in 1978 . Both men are now dead. The Vatican never held an autopsy on Pope John Paul I who they said had died from a heart attack - but even the circumstances of his body being found were controversial. At first the Vatican said he had been discovered by his secretary Bishop John Magee although it was actually a nun called Sister Vicenza who had made the grim find. However the Vatican thought it 'improper' to have the Pope found by a woman and said it was Bishop McGee. Years later the Bishop admitted it was Sister Vincenza who was first on the scene. She later took a vow of silence and has never spoken about the circumstances of Pope John Paul I's death. Her whereabouts are not known. A Vatican spokesman said today they had no comment on Pope John Paul's identity card being up for sale on eBay.",Pontiff was shocked by masonic corruption within the Vatican and was set to name figures involved .
