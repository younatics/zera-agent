"Bill Gates has come under fire over an illegal 'horse-waste storage facility' on his $8.7 million horse farm . Microsoft mogul Bill Gates has been causing a bit of a stink among locals in the tiny equestrian town of Wellington, Florida. The billionaire has come under fire over an illegal 'horse-waste storage facility' on his $8.7 million horse farm - and he's getting fined $250 a day  until he destroys it. Town inspectors claim the livestock manure dump on Gates' sprawling property  is only 18.75 feet from a narrow pond, while Wellington's code mandates that it be at least 100 feet away. According to Page Six, the businessman - who is worth around $80 billion - has racked up $40,000 in daily fines so far. A second code violation apparently relates to the businessman not having a proper permit for the storage bin in the first place. Gates, who is known to donate millions to environmental projects throughout the world, bought the sprawling property in cash last year. But despite several warnings about the two code violations dating back to July 18, the businessman has still not had the manure dump moved. The village of Wellington is known for its equestrian community and hosts more than 40 competitions a year, including the Winter Equestrian Festival - the largest horse show in the world. Gates' teenage daughter, Jennifer, trains at the Wellington estate - which includes space for 20 horses, plus training grounds - and competes in horse shows nearby.

Wellington's Code Enforcement Manager, Steven Koch, confirmed to Page Six that Gates' manure bin was in the 'wrong area', . But he added that after months of letters: 'We made contact with the contractor and the trustee today [Tuesday]. We don't know what triggered it.' He said that the manure dump is now being removed, and local inspectors will make sure it has been properly disposed of before the property works with the Wellington Department of Buildings to build a new bin.

"They are the brutal terrorist organisation that claims religious authority over Muslims across the world. The al-Qaeda offshoot is confusingly known by three names: Islamic State, ISIS and ISIL – but a terrorism expert says they have got their branding spot on. The murderous group, which now has around 50,000 fighters in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq according to August 2014 figures from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, until recently used the full Arabic name Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham - the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. In June, the terror group declared a caliphate - an Islamic state led by a supreme religious and political leader - and began using the simplified name 'Islamic State'. ‘ISIS is very smartly branding itself as THE Islamic State, that’s how it’s been able to attract so many followers,’ Dr Anne Aly, a Research Fellow at Curtin University, told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Terrorist leader: The Islamic State's leader, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been presented  as a rightful Caliph . ‘It is differentiating itself from al-Qaeda by saying “we are IT, we are what you haven’t been able to achieve all this time”.’ The counter-terrorism expert explained that by using the name Islamic State people believe they are signing up to support a legitimate and organised group. ‘They don’t understand, they think they are going to join a humongous well organised army called ISIS to give out welfare. They think they are joining something like a state with a humanitarian wing. ‘But it’s not like that at all because there are lots of different competing factions within Syria… there is the Free Syrian Army… so you get two brothers going over there, both thinking they are fighting for the Islamic state, but they end up on two different teams shooting each other, killing each other.’ News organisations, presidents, prime ministers and other world leaders are currently using a mixture of three different names to reference the organisation which is essentially one movement. The name ISIS – the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria - is used by American news organisations such as the New York Times and L.A. Times. Fooled: People are joining the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq because they think it is a well 'organised army', ' Dr Anne Aly, a Research Fellow at Curtin University, said . Supporter: The Islamic State has captured swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and has declared itself an Islamic Caliphate and called on factions worldwide to pledge their allegiance . Mission: The Islamic State are trying to create 'a state that does not recognise the previous borders of Iraq or Syria,' Dr Aly said . International publications such as The Guardian also use ISIS and the BBC uses a combination of ISIS and Islamic State. In a recent report condemning the group, the United Nations referred to the group as ISIS and by its original name. ‘Forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham have committed torture, murder, acts tantamount to enforced disappearance and forced displacement as part of attacks on the civilian population in Aleppo and Raqqa provinces, amounting to crimes against humanity,’ it said. The U.S. government, including President Obama, the Pentagon, and the State Department, uses ISIL which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group has used this name because it aspires to control what used to be the historic region called the Levant. This area includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus, and an area in southern Turkey that includes Hatay. However, the Islamic State’s ambitions are now even wider – it wants to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its direct political control. The Australian government, including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, also refers to the group as ISIL. Beheadings: The Islamic State notoriously kills people by beheading them. Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar is seen here holding up two severed heads in Syria . Control: The Islamic State flag (left) is waved by thousands of supporters in Syria and Iraq. This map (right) shows the areas controlled by the Islamic State in red, the areas claimed by the Islamic State in beige and the rest of Iraq and Syria in pale yellow . ‘There are hundreds of Westerners fighting with extremist groups such as ISIL – including at least 60 Australians in Syria and Iraq, and about 100 facilitators in Australia. That means we could be confronting more potential home-grown terrorists than ever before,’ Mr Abbott and Attorney General George Brandis said in a joint statement on 26 August. Similarly the UK government and Prime Minister David Cameron use ISIL. On 27 August, Mr Cameron’s office issued a statement after the brutal beheading of American photojournalist James Foley by the terror group. ‘The Prime Minister has condemned the barbaric and brutal murder of James Foley by ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Syria. This will not change our commitment to tackling this appalling organisation and doing everything we can to keep our country safe,’ it said. Murdered: American photojournalist James Foley was killed by an Islamic State terrorist in Syria. The group posted a graphic video of his murder online, nearly two years after he was first kidnapped, in August 2014 . Destroyed: In this photo people walk through the rubble of a Shiite mosque after it was destroyed in a bomb attack by militants of the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in the city of Mosul, July 23, 2014 . ‘The situation in Northern Iraq remains deeply worrying and we condemn the barbaric attacks waged by ISIL terrorists across the region. Around 500,000 people are displaced in Dahuk province alone and the United Nations has now declared the situation as the highest level of humanitarian emergency,’ it continued. Dr Aly said whether you use ISIL, ISIS or Islamic State is neither ‘here nor there’ but the fact they are calling themselves an Islamic State is important. ‘It is significant because what they are trying to create is a state that does not recognise the previous borders of Iraq or Syria. To say Islamic state is to symbolically say “we have created one state that does not respect the borders”. ‘It’s about a symbolic state - it also communicates their strategy or end goal of establishing true statehood in the region, which they are never going to get - let them dream,’ she said. Dr Aly explained that the Islamic State’s leader- Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi – has been presented at a very important time as a rightful Caliph, the head of state in a Caliphate. ‘Baghdadi is being brought forward as the rightful and true Caliph. He claims to have the right lineage, the way he walks and talks are also important for people to pledge allegiance to him. ‘That’s how you create a state - when everyone supports him,’ she said. Dr Aly said another big difference between al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations in the region, compared to Islamic State, is that they never really paid attention to ‘having a valid and rightful caliph’. ‘None of the leaders ticked all the boxes,’ she said.","World leaders and news organisations are using three different names to reference the terror group which is essentially one movement .

"Mothers who smoke during pregnancy or while breastfeeding could be endangering their sons’ fertility, research shows. Scientists have found it permanently damages the reproductive organs so they produce faulty sperm. They say many men now in their 30s and 40s may be suffering the effects of their mothers smoking throughout pregnancy. Around one in eight women now smoke when pregnant although this percentage was far higher in the 1970s and 80s when so little was known about its harmful effects. Scroll down for video . Australian scientists have found smoking while pregnant or breastfeeding damages unborn boys' reproductive organs, causing them to produce faulty sperm . Australian researchers studied mice who inhaled the equivalent of 24 cigarettes a day before giving birth. They found that the male pup mice produced far fewer sperm and they were of poorer quality. Although the study was only in mice the researchers say the findings are relevant to mothers. Professor Eileen McLaughlin, co-director of the Priority Research Centre in Chemical Biology at the University of Newcastle, in New South Wales, said: ‘It would be unethical to deliberately expose pregnant mothers and their offspring to the toxins in cigarettes. ‘We already know that smoking in pregnancy harms the baby in the womb as babies are often born small and vulnerable to disease. ‘So in this study we used a mouse animal model which directly mimics human smoking, to look at what effects the mothers smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding has on the fertility of their male pups. ‘Our results show that male pups of ‘smoking’ mothers have fewer sperm, which swim poorly, are abnormally shaped and fail to bind eggs. ‘This is the first time we have been able to prove conclusively that male baby exposure to cigarette toxins in pregnancy will damage later life fertility. The researchers said even if the boys never touched a cigarette during their teens or adulthood their cells could be permanently damaged from their mothers’ bad habits . ‘Although this is a study in mice, the findings are relevant to human health as many men, now in their 30s and 40s, were exposed to cigarette toxins in the womb when it was less well known that smoking affected babies’ health.’ The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Human Reproduction, say even if the boys never touched a cigarette during their teens or adulthood their cells could be permanently damaged from their mothers’ bad habits. They are now investigating whether mother’s smoking also affects the future fertility of their daughters. Doctors say that every time a pregnant woman smokes a cigarette it is like putting their foetus in a smoky room for 15 minutes. It has been shown to greatly increase the risk of stillbirth, miscarriage, prematurity and the baby being born underweight.","Australian scientists found smoking while pregnant permanently damages the reproductive organs causing them to produce faulty sperm .

"It's an old age question pondered by some of the greatest minds in the playground. Who would win: a crocodile or a shark? Now a British tourist has given a definitive answer to the riddle by capturing the moment one of the powerful reptiles munched on its aquatic rival. Holidaymaker Peter Jones, 62, witnessed the savage moment when he embarked on a river cruise in Kakadu National Park in Australia's tropical Northern Territory. So now we know: A massive saltwater crocodile eats a bull shark on the banks of East Alligator River in Kakadu . National Park in Australia's tropical Northern Territory . I always eat fish on Friday: British tourist Peter Jones, from Cambridge, described both the creatures as 'big ... even bloody huge, or perhaps enormous' As he travelled down the East Alligator River he was confronted by the sight of a massive saltwater crocodile scoffing on a helpless bull shark. The intrepid tourist group bravely tried to get closer to the spectacle, but the coy crocodile slithered away with its man-eating prey. Mr Jones, from Cambridge, told the Northern Territory News that after the boat left he saw the crocodile return to the bank with its dinner, before feasting on its catch. He said: 'It is hard for me to say how large they both were as I lack the experience in estimating the size of both crocs and sharks, both being very rare in rural Cambridgeshire. 'Big, springs to mind, even bloody huge or perhaps enormous. Our guide referred to both the croc and shark as being ""very big"". 'It finally answers the age-old question posed by school kids across the globe from time immemorial: Croc versus shark, which would win? Croc, as it happens.' Saltwater crocodiles are the largest of the crocodilians and have the most powerful jaws of any animal. They can grow to in excess of 20ft long and live to more than 100.",British holidaymaker witnessed the savage moment while on a river cruise in Kadaku National Park in Australia .
"Amanda Bynes has been arrested for a DUI again. The troubled Easy A actress was pulled over in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday at 4 am and taken into custody, the California Highway Patrol confirmed with MailOnline. She was cited for being under the influence of a controlled substance while driving her Mercedes-Benz. The 28-year-old star was released  at 12 noon that same day on $15,000 bail. The former child star is set to appear in court on October 23 in Van Nuys. Scroll down for video . Not a good turn of events: Amanda Bynes, pictured in June in LA (the last time she was seen in public), was arrested for a DUI on Sunday . Official: This sheet made available by the LAPD shows Bynes was booked at 7:06 am at the West Valley Station . It's just the beginning: A court date has been set for 8:30 am on October 23 at the Van Nuys Court House . Law enforcement sources told TMZ the She's The Man actress was on drugs, specifically marijuana, but the CHP has yet to confirm this. The former child star was  booked at the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys division on a misdemeanor DUI. The brunette movie and TV star had been living with her parents Lynn and Rick in a LA suburb as she has dealt with several legal problems from the past few years. She was last seen in public in June. A concerned father: Rick Bynes appeared distressed on Monday afternoon while talking on his cell phone outside his Los Angeles home . Booked: Her mugshot from April 2012 taken in West Hollywood after getting a DUI for alcohol . In early September Amanda was released from her conservatorship and moved out of her parents' house. She now lives in an apartment in Orange County. Once she started living on her own, that's when things started to go 'haywire,' according to a source. The arrest is causing a legal problem because Bynes is on probation for a  reckless conviction from last February. A tough time: The 28-year-old She's The Man actress had a difficult phase in 2012 and 2013; here she was spotted in September 2012 . The Sydney White actress was taking fashion design classes at the Fashion Institute Of Design And Merchandising in Irvine, California, earlier this year and seemed to be in good health. Amanda's legal troubles began in March 2012 when she was pulled over and ticketed by police for talking on a cell phone while driving. One month later the Family Guy star was arrested and charged with driving a DUI after side-swiping a police car in West Hollywood. Then in September the Thousand Oaks native was charged for two alleged hit and run incidents, one occurring in April and the other in August. The charges were dismissed three months later, however. A worrying time: At her worst, the Easy A actress shared Twitter photos where she wore wigs and had a cheek piercing, which she did here . Her DUI charged was also dropped in February 2014 but she was placed on probation. When she moved to New York City in 2013 the Hairspray star started displaying some odd behavior. In May she was arrested at her apartment for criminal possession of marijuana, attempted tampering with evidence, and reckless endangerment. She was also accused of throwing a bong out the window of her dwelling which was located on the 36th floor. A much-loved TV icon: The star at the 2011 MTV Movie Awards; she's had a big following thanks to her small-screen hits The Amanda Bynes Show and What I Like About You . Behind the wheel: Before the Family Guy star's legal troubles in 2009 . She seemed to be on the road to recovery: Things reportedly went sour in early September when the Love Wrecked star moved out from her parents' home in Thousand Oaks and into an apartment in Orange County; here she is seen in March . The Maxim cover girl then went under psychiatric evaluation and eventually (June 2014) the case was dismissed. Things got worse when she returned to LA. In July 2013 she was detained after trying to set fire to a neighbor's driveway. Bynes was then put on a 5150 mental health evaluation hold and her parents filed a conservatorship. Treatment at a Malibu facility followed. 'Amanda currently is on zero medication,' her attorney Tamar Arminak said in a statement to UsWeekly in April. 'She's devoted to living her life as healthy as possible. Her family is closely involved with her day-to-day life, but they try to give her as much autonomy as possible.'

"Hamas appeared to admit using human shields to fire rockets into Israel for the first time today, but refused to accept responsibility for the slaughter of hundreds of innocent Palestinians killed in retaliatory airstrikes. In a veiled confession that comes two weeks after the end of the Gaza war, a senior Hamas official said the group's fighters had no choice but to use residential areas from which to launch missiles into their neighbour's territory. But while Ghazi Hamad claimed they took safeguards to keep people away from the violence, he admitted 'mistakes were made', blaming Israel's heavy-handed response for the deaths of civilians. Scroll down for video . Evidence: This photo, provided by the Israel Defense Forces, shows the Gaza City neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan where it says Hamas used four rocket launch sites sitting next to a cluster of schools and nearby residences . Heated discussions: This is the same map without the IDF's markings. Increasingly, the discussion is not about whether the Hamas rockets were fired from civilian areas, but exactly how close they were to the actual buildings . Smoke and fire: Hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli airstrikes unleashed in response to Hamas rocket attacks, launched from residential areas . 'Gaza, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah in the south, is one uninterrupted urban chain that Israel has turned into a war zone,' said Mr Hamad, a senior Hamas official in Gaza. Increasingly, the discussion is not about whether the Hamas rockets were fired from civilian areas, but exactly how close they were to the actual buildings. 'The Israelis kept saying rockets were fired from schools or hospitals when in fact they were fired 200 or 300 meters (yards) away. Still, there were some mistakes made and they were quickly dealt with,' Hamad told The Associated Press, offering the first acknowledgment by a Hamas official that, in some cases, militants fired rockets from or near residential areas or civilian facilities. The questions lie at the heart of a brewing international legal confrontation: Did Hamas deliberately and systematically fire rockets at Israel from homes, hospitals and schools in the hope that Israel would be deterred from retaliating, as Israel claims? Or did Israel use force excessively, resulting in deaths among people not involved in combat operations? The answers could help determine whether Israel - or Hamas - or both are ultimately accused of violating the international laws of war in a conflict that caused tremendous damage. According to Palestinian figures, nearly 2,200 Palestinians were killed - roughly three quarters of them civilians and including more than 500 children - and 11,000 were wounded. The war also left some 100,000 homeless. Seventy-two people were killed on the Israeli side, including six civilians. Men evacuate a survivor of an Israeli airstrike that hit the Al Ghoul family building in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip. But many members of her family were not so lucky . Ahead of a U.N. investigation, the Israeli military has released reams of evidence, including satellite photos and aerial footage, to support its claims that it acted responsibly and attempted to minimize Palestinian casualties. It asserts that Hamas made no effort to disguise its attempt to maximize Israeli civilian casualties. Throughout the war, the Israeli air force compiled dozens of video clips showing alleged wrongdoing by Hamas, an Islamic militant group sworn to Israel's destruction. These videos, many of them posted on YouTube, appear to show rockets flying out of residential neighborhoods, cemeteries, schoolyards and mosque courtyards. There are also images of weapons caches purportedly uncovered inside mosques, and tunnels allegedly used by militants to scurry between homes, mosques and buildings. 'Hamas' excuses are outrageous, misleading and contrary to the evidence supplied by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) and the reality documented by international journalists on the ground in Gaza,' said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman. Confession: In a veiled confession that comes two weeks after the end of the Gaza war, a senior Hamas official today said the group's fighters had no choice but to use residential areas from which to launch missiles into their neighbour's territory . But a black-and-white satellite image released by the Israeli military illustrates the difficulties in proving the point. The army says the image, taken of the Gaza City neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan, shows four rocket launch sites sitting next to a cluster of schools and a nearby residential neighborhood. Such images, it says, are evidence that Hamas used built-up areas for cover - and carelessly exposed civilians to danger in Israeli retaliatory strikes. However, the image itself is grainy and shows no clear signs of rocket activity, though rocket launchers are often hidden underground. The army refused to say how it had made its conclusions. A visit to the area this week found three separate military sites - possibly training grounds - slightly larger than football fields located close to the state schools. Smoke trails behind multiple missiles fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip . The sites are mostly concealed from street view by barriers made of corrugated iron, but one bore the sign of Hamas' military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, while another bore the sign of the Islamic Jihad, a militant group allied with Hamas. The bases were deserted. Visible from the outside were human cutout figures and what appeared to be exercise hurdles. There were no overt signs of rocket launchers or craters in the ground outside, though dirt appeared to have been disturbed either by some sort of blast or the work of heavy military-type trucks. There were pieces of mangled concrete scattered on the ground. The school buildings appeared untouched. Hamas tightly restricts access to such facilities, and it was impossible for photographers to enter the sites. Israel confirmed the area was targeted in airstrikes. Another location identified by the Israeli military as a rocket-launching site is in northern Gaza around the newly built Indonesian hospital. Immediately to the north of the two-story hospital and across the road to the west are two Hamas military facilities. Both stand in close proximity to residential homes. The hospital stands intact, while nothing is visible from inside the bases. Hamad, the Hamas official, argued that many of the buildings shown in Israeli videos were either a safe distance from the rocket launchers or that the buildings had been kept vacant during the fighting. The ground in Sheikh Radwan, for instance, lies some 150 meters (yards) away from the neighborhood, and the schools were empty for summer vacation. During 50 days of fighting, many observers witnessed rocket launches from what appeared to be urban areas. One piece of video footage distributed by the AP, for instance, captured a launch in downtown Gaza City that took place in a lot next to a mosque and an office of the Hamas prime minister. Both buildings were badly damaged in subsequent Israeli airstrikes. There was other evidence of Hamas having used civilian facilities: Early in the conflict, the U.N. agency that cares for Palestinian refugees announced that it discovered weapons stored in its schools as they stood empty during the summer. 'I don't think there's any doubt urban areas were used to launch rockets from in the Gaza Strip,' said Bill Van Esveld, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'What needs to be determined is how close to a populated building or a civilian area were those rocket launches.' The issue may never be conclusively settled as both sides voice competing narratives over their conduct in the deadliest and most ruinous of the three wars since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Palestinians gather as rescue workers search for victims under the rubble of a house which witnesses said was destroyed in an Israeli air strike, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip . 'Yes, Hamas and others may have used civilians as human shields, but was that consistent and widespread?' said Sami Abdel-Shafi, a Palestinian-American who represents the Carter Center in Gaza. 'The question is whether Israel's response was proportionate.' The war erupted on July 8 when Israel launched a massive aerial bombardment of Gaza in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire by Hamas and other Gaza-based militant groups - part of an escalation that began with the killing by a Hamas cell of three Israeli teens in the West Bank. The Israeli army says Hamas fired almost 4,000 rockets at Israel, including 600 from close to schools, mosques and other civilian facilities, and scores of mortar shells. Israel carried out some 5,000 airstrikes, in addition to using powerful artillery and gunship fire. Frequently, Israeli arms struck hospitals, schools, homes, mosques, factories and office towers. Israel said the buildings had been used for cover by militant fighters, and that whenever possible, it provided warning to civilians that strikes on their buildings were coming. Israel disputes the makeup of the Palestinian casualty figures, saying that nearly half the dead were militants. Nevertheless, the death toll and number of civilian deaths have led to harsh condemnations of Israel and raised questions on the proportionality of Israel's response. In an apparent attempt to head off international investigations, the Israeli military said Wednesday it has opened criminal investigations into two high-profile cases involving Palestinian civilian casualties. Hamas also has been sharply criticized for launching rockets aimed at Israeli cities and towns. Israel says its own civilian death toll would have been much higher had it not been for its rocket defenses. The U.N. Human Rights Council has appointed a commission to look into the latest fighting. Its report is expected no sooner than March.","Official says group had no choice but to launch rockets from civilian areas .

"Childcare minister Elizabeth Truss said new rules would make it easier for schools to offer childcare . Teachers will be able to look after children after school hours under plans to help working parents. Childcare minister Elizabeth Truss said too many school buildings sit empty for much of the day when they could be used by youngsters. Rules which meant after-school clubs could look after fewer children than teachers will be scrapped and heads will be able to bring in outside companies to run services to cut down on paperwork. A survey last week found that more than half of parents in the UK are spending more than 20 per cent of their monthly salary on childcare, . And nearly a third are spending 30 per cent on a nanny, nursery or child minder. Many parents also struggle with getting their children from school to after-school clubs and childcare. Miss Truss said that parents often find provision is ‘frustrating’ and allowing schools to stay open for up to nine hours a day would help ‘children who might otherwise slip’. She added: ‘It would provide a safe, supervised place to do homework – and in particular, ensure everyone masters the core academic subjects – maths, English, sciences, languages, history and geography subjects that wealthier families have always encouraged their children into - and that our competitors like Germany and Poland now mandate for all children to at least 16.’ In a speech to the Resolution Foundation today, she announced major changes to the rules governing what schools can do after the official school day ends. Miss Truss said: ‘It’s about the fact that we have school buildings across the country, sitting empty for hours of each day. ‘The fact that children need a broad, rounded education – which too many are currently denied. The fact that parents struggle to do the school to care run.’ Schools which are allowed to look after up to 30 children per adult during the school day will be able to use the same ratio after hours . Rules which make family friends register with Ofsted if they look after children for more than two hours are to be relaxed. Childcare minister Liz Truss said the regulations were 'daft' and ignored the reality of parents trying to fit work in around school hours. She said: 'At the moment, parents aren’t allowed to pay a neighbour, or relative, if they want them to look after their children for more than 2 hours – unless they register with Ofsted. 'That’s just daft – especially when the gap between school finishing and work ending is more or less 2 hours exactly. 'So the plans released today make it easier, increasing the time they can rely on informal care from two to three hours.' Under current rules if a school wants to bring in an external provider to run on-site care, they have to carry out new registrations. If they want to offer extensions of the school day, they have to ‘struggle through a different set of staffing rules, different qualification rules, local consultations, and local authority permissions’, Miss Truss said. Chiuldcare rules mean there must be one member of staff for every eight children aged five to seven, but in schools in is one to 30 in the classroom . Miss Truss said: ‘We’re making the staffing requirements for out-of-hours the same – so that the school doesn’t need to worry about changing the numbers of staff, just because the clock’s struck four. ‘We’re improving the child development guidance, so they don’t need to worry about meeting unnecessary rules about pedagogy and instruction. ‘And we’re removing unnecessary central rules around setting up after school clubs – so if they want to bring in an external childcare provider, they don’t have to worry about a pile of new paperwork. 'So a longer school day; making it easier for schools to offer childcare; more sensible regulations.'","Childcare minister Elizabeth Truss says schools sit empty for much of day .

"A controversial anti-Islamic ad campaign will appear on the side of buses in Washington D.C. featuring the face of Adolf Hitler. The advert will be on 20 metro buses and depict a meeting between the leader of Nazi Germany and anti-Jewish Islamic leader Haj Amin al -Husseini during World War II. The group behind the campaign, the American Freedom Defence Initiative (AFDI), say they are concerned by the 'global jihad and Islamic supremacism', with the ads calling for an end to U.S. foreign aid to Islamic countries. The controversial ad showing Hitler and anti-Jewish Islamic leader Haj Amin al -Husseini during World War II . The caption by the side of the contentious picture of Hitler reads: 'Islamic Jew-hatred: It's in the Quran. Two-thirds of all US aid goes to Islamic countries. Stop Racism. End all aid to Islamic countries.' The head of the AFDI, Pamela Geller says the ads are in response to previous adverts, which featured on the city's metro buses by the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), that were anti-Jewish. She told the International Business Times: 'My intent is leapfrog over a media that is not even-handed, that is advancing the propaganda against the Jewish state.' The blogger also adds that she has wide ranging support for the ad, which will run for four weeks and says she has provided information that show the claims in the adverts are true. The ads will be on the side of 20 metro buses, such as this one pictured, for four weeks . It is expected that the ad will start running on D.C. metro buses this week. However, the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) has hit out the controversial campaign. Nihad Awad, National Executive Director of CAIR told WJLA: 'This is a propaganda campaign designed to incite hatred against American Muslims, and this campaign has been based on false information, taking things out of context from the Quran.' The organisation says it is considering the possibility of a response ad, and is offering free copies of the Quran.","The group behind the campaign is the American Freedom Defence Initiative .

"A lesbian student has been kicked out of college and arrested after it emerged she was behind a string of anti-gay messages slipped under her dorm room door, police said. After the notes were found in Alexandra Pennell's room at Central Connecticut State University in March, hundreds came out in support of the student at a campus rally against hate crimes. But when police hid a camera along the hallway outside her room, they allegedly caught her leaving the notes herself - and she admitted she had written them to get the attention of her roommate. Scroll down for video . 'Caught': Alexandra Pennell allegedly wrote anti-gay notes and slid them under her door, claiming she was the target of a hate crime. She is pictured at a campus anti-hate rally, sparked by the notes . She now faces charges of fabricating evidence, lying to police and making false statements. She has also been barred from attending any state university for five years, the Hartford Courant reported. It comes after Pennell, 19, reported to campus authorities that she had found the anti-gay notes scrawled on a board on her door and slipped into her room. Authorities took the report seriously and police were called in to investigate. On March 13, . hundreds of students attended an anti-hate rally where Pennell addressed . the crowd. 'All . I have to say is that I'm not going to be run out of my home, and I . will not be intimidated by hate,' she said at the rally. 'Attention-seeking': Pennell told police she slid notes into her dorm so her roommate would pay her attention. She has now been kicked out of college and barred from colleges in the state for five years . Speaking out: Pennell is pictured speaking at an anti-hate rally sparked by the notes found in her dorm . She reported the first note on March 7 . and police immediately launched an investigation. Six days later, she . told police she had found another note after returning from the shower. But a video surveillance system placed in her . room to identify the person behind the notes had been disabled just before the note was slid under her door and . police found that a cable had been pulled out of the device. Pennell suggested she may have pulled . out the cable when she opened a desk drawer, but when police . reconstructed this possibility, they were unable to dislodge the cable. So without letting her know, Lt. Edward Dercole of the CCSU police placed another camera in a hallway closet and watched as she allegedly slid a note under the door herself. Standing up: Hundreds of college students and staff attended the anti-hate rally in March . Serious: Police also immediately launched an investigation to find out who had sent the notes . When police first confronted her about the notes, she insisted she was not behind them. And when they told her about the second camera, she admitted she had left a couple of the notes, but said the rest had been real. Eventually, she admitted to posting all of the notes. She told police she had faked them to get the attention of her roommate, Siobhan Dooley. She said she hoped the incidents would make Dooley spend more time with her. Pennell also wrote a letter to Dooley in which she allegedly said she left the notes as she feared her close friends were slipping away, the Courant reported. She added that she continued leaving the notes because of the attention it brought her. Scene: When authorities set up a hidden camera in the hallway, they allegedly caught Pennell slipping a note under her own dorm room door, pictured . Anger: Pennell has now been kicked out of Central Connecticut State University . Pennell was arrested on May 2. She has been free on a written promise to appear in . court. She now faces eight felony counts of . fabricating evidence, eight misdemeanor charges of lying to police, . eight misdemeanor counts of filing a false police report and one count . of making a false statement to police. She has pleaded not guilty and is due back in court July 26. The university said it is saddened by the student's actions. 'We remain proud, however, of the campus community's response to what we believed was an act of bias, and we reaffirm now what was said then: Acts of bias and hate will not be tolerated at CCSU,' university spokesman Mark McLaughlin said.

"The Hawaii State Health Director who authorized the release of President Obama's birth certificate in 2011 died Wednesday when her plane went down in the Pacific near a remote island. Loretta Fuddy was the only person aboard the aircraft to die. The others, including the pilot, were either rescued by boat or swam ashore. Fuddy was on her way back to Honolulu after a visit to what was once Hawaii's leper colony on the island of Molokai when, officials said Thursday, the Cessna Grand Caravan went down due to engine failure. Only victim: Hawaii Health Director Loretta Fuddy was the only death among nine aboard the Cessna Grand Caravan that crashed in the ocean near Molokai, Hawaii on Wednesday . Proof? Fuddy entered the national spotlight briefly in 2011 when she authorized the release of Barack Obama's long-form birth certificate to put to rest so-called 'birther' conspiracies about the nation of the Commander-in-Chief's birth . Hated by birthers: Fuddy released the long-form birth certificate after years of 'birther' conspiracy theories about the president . One passenger was able to swim to shore and the others on board the Cessna Grand Caravan were rescued by helicopter and boat. The Makani Kai Air plane, which was . scheduled to fly to Honolulu at 3.15pm, went down at about 3.45pm, half a . mile northwest of Kalaupapa peninsula, Maui Fire Department spokesman . Lee Mainaga said. Fuddy had been booked on the flight along with the health department's . deputy director Keith Yamamoto, a spokeswoman for the department said. Two government sources later confirmed to Kitv that Fuddy had died. The 65-year-old, who had won awards for her work with children and social work, had been appointed as director in 2011. Fuddy and Yamamoto had been on an annual visit to Kalaipapa, a former colony for leprosy sufferers.

"A British photographer has discovered what could be the world's first hunch-back alligator whilst working in the wetlands of Brazil. Wimbledon-based snapper and travel guide Paul Goldstein was working in the Pantanal swamp region of the South American country when he stumbled upon the deformed reptile. Lurking in the reeds, the 11ft caiman was immediately recognisable due the unusual mound on the base of its back. Unusual: Locals in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil said they have never seen the deformed animal before . According to wildlife expert Mr Goldstein, it was also the first time that any of the Brazilian natives he works alongside had seen the caiman. Although they are known to travel in groups, or congregations, the ugly alligator was alone. But according to the photographer, the scaly giant was in good health and did not seem to be hampered by its hump. Mr Goldstein said: 'I have been to the Pantanal quite a bit and never seen this, more importantly, none of the local guides had either. One off: The hump may have been the result if an injury sustained in a fight with another caiman or birth defect . 'It was on its own, but apart from being light on caiman colleagues the eleven footer seemingly did not seem worse for wear.' It is thought the hunch may have either been the result of a historic fight injury or a birth defect. The Pantanal is a diverse wetland area and home to many species, including jaguars and caimans. Caimans are a four-legged reptile of the alligator family and closely resemble alligators in appearance.","Deformed caiman was found by Paul Goldstein in South American swamp .

"A U.S. government lawyer has reportedly conceded that tens of thousands of long-missing emails belonging to former IRS official Lois Lerner – messages the Obama administration has claimed were lost in a 2011 computer crash – were safely backed up along with the computer records of every other federal employee, claims conservative group Judicial Watch. The documents are key to a congressional investigation into a political targeting scheme Lerner allegedly masterminded, which involved singling out conservative nonprofits for especially intrusive scrutiny – based on words in their names like 'tea party' or 'patriots' – when they applied for tax-exempt charitable status. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, whose group is suing the IRS over its failure to provide the records to Congress, said Monday that the revelation came on Friday from an attorney who works in Attorney General Eric Holder's Justice Department. 'All the focus on missing hard drives has been a diversion,' he said. 'The Obama administration has known all along where the email records could be – but dishonestly withheld this information. You can bet we are going to ask the court for immediate assistance in cutting through this massive obstruction of justice.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . An irate Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said Monday that after 15 months of wrangling, the federal government has conceded that all of former IRS official Lois Lerner's emails are backed up somewhere . Lerner, the IRS Director of Exempt Organizations when the so-called 'tea party targeting' scandal developed, retired from government service in 2013 and is receiving her full pension . 'The Department of Justice attorney told the Judicial Watch attorney on Friday.' Fitton said during a Monday afternoon Fox News broadcast, 'that it turns out the federal government backs up all computer records in case something terrible happens in Washington and there is a catastrophe, so the government can continue operating.' The catch, he added, is that the DOJ attorney also claimed 'it would be too hard to go and get Lois Lerner's emails from that backup system.' The Justice Department is representing the federal government in the lawsuit. 'So everything we've been hearing about scratched hard drives, about missing emails of Lois Lerner, [and] other IRS officials, other officials in the Obama administration,' Fitton told Fox, 'it's all been a pack of malarkey.' 'They could get these records, but they don't want to. And they haven't told anyone about it, frankly, until we were able to get it out of them on Friday.' 'And there's no such thing as Lois Lerner's missing e-mails,' he insisted. 'It's all been a big lie. They've been lying to the courts, to the American people and to Congress.' IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest have been particularly insistent that Lerner's emails were gone forever. Koskinen told a congressional panel on June 20 that Lerner's hard drive 'was recycled then destroyed' because 'it was determined that it was dysfunctional and that, with experts, no emails could be retrieved.' Hours later during a White House briefing, Earnest was asked why two years of Lerner's emails were missing. 'Well, because there was – the computer crashed,' he responded. 'And what we've seen is a demonstrated effort by this administration and by the IRS to try to cooperate with legitimate questions that have been posed by [Congress] on this.' The FBI is running a parallel investigation into whether Lerner or anyone else in the Treasury Department broke federal laws by targeting conservative groups for political retribution, or by covering it up when Congress began to subpoena records from the administration. Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, one of the groups the IRS hamstrung for years, said Monday that the latest revelations are 'part of a continuing pattern of dishonesty and thuggery we've seen from this administration.' 'When the government launches intimidation campaigns against private citizens simply because they may not agree with the government – and then lies about evidence being ""lost"" – it should outrage all Americans.' IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has appeared in several Republican-dominated congressional hearings, insisting that Lerner's emails are gone for good and her faulty hard drive was 'recycled' 'Everything we've been hearing about scratched hard drives, about missing emails ... it's all been a pack of malarkey,' Fitton said Monday . Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan demanded two weeks ago that IRS officials sign sworn statements describing efforts that were made to recover the Lerner emails. None of the affidavits sent to his court so far has mentioned anything about an all-encompassing backup system where the records might still be awaiting discovery. 'We want to know why they hadn't told the court about this backup system,' Fitton said Monday on Fox. 'If this backup system is working, Lois Lerner's emails are there. There are half a dozen other IRS officials whose emails have supposedly disappeared as well. And we've heard from other agencies, like over in the HHS over Obamacare, emails disappearing there.' 'We've been led to believe that once they disappear they can't be found again,' he said, 'when in fact they back up everything, as most people suspected [and] now the government has confirmed.' Fitton's group plans to ask Judge Sullivan to rule that the Obama administration has gone out of its way to avoid turning over documents that it knew were readily available. If the IRS has been withholding evidence from the courts, it's also been withholding it from Congress. What about the backups? White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on June 20 that Lerner's computer 'crashed' and claimed the Obama administration had tried to 'cooperate with legitimate questions' 'Judicial Watch will press its concerns on Monday, August 25, before U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola,' Fitton said late Monday in a statement. Sullivan has appointed Facciola, an expert in the courtroom 'discovery' of electronic records, to manage the back-and-forth between the administration and Fitton's attorneys about missing records. Some of that wrangling concerns exactly what happened after Lerner reported that her hard drive had malfunctioned. An IRS information technology official wrote Friday in a sworn statement that while tech experts allegedly sent the device for testing and data recovery, no one thought to examine her government-issued Blackberry to see if copies of her emails could be saved. There is 'no record of any attempt by any IRS IT employee to recover data from any Blackberry device assigned to Lois Lerner in response to the congressional investigations or this litigation,' the IT expert, Stephen Manning, wrote.","A conservative group suing the IRS for a former official's emails tied to a political targeting scandal says the DOJ now concedes the records exist .

'They could get these records but they don't want to,' said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton .
New court records also show that after Lerner's hard drive crashed, the IRS never tried to recover data from her government-issued Blackberry .

"With its amiable discussions on greenfly and compost, it may seem as innocuous as a radio show could be. So regular listeners to Gardeners’ Question Time will be surprised to find it caught up in a race row. For an academic claims that Radio 4’s long-running programme is spreading covert racist stereotypes disguised as horticultural advice. The panel from BBC Radio 4's Question Time, which has been criticised as being full of racial language . Dr Ben Pitcher, a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Westminster, says the panel show is ‘saturated’ with racial language. From debates about native and non-native plant species to advice about the purity of different soil types, the programme’s resident green-fingered experts are secretly feeding nationalist and fascist fantasies, he claims. Speaking on another Radio 4 programme, Thinking Allowed, he said: ‘Gardeners’ Question Time is not the most controversial show on Radio 4, and yet it is layered with, saturated with, racial meanings. The context here is the rise of nationalism. The rise of racist and fascist parties across Europe. Nationalism is about shoring up a fantasy of national integrity. My question is, what feeds nationalism? What makes nationalism powerful?’ Dr Pitcher said there is a ‘crisis in white identity in multicultural Britain’ caused by the fact that ‘white culture’ is historically associated with racism and far-Right views. White people are therefore forced to find other ways of talking about white identity – such as through gardening – so they do not appear to be racist. Speaking on the same programme, Lola Young, a crossbench peer and former professor of cultural studies, agreed with Dr Pitcher’s argument. She added: ‘I remember back in the late 80s-early 90s when rhododendrons were seen as this huge problem, and people were talking about going out rhododendron-bashing. Dr Ben Pitcher said he believes the programme is saturated with racial language . ‘That was at a time when Paki-bashing was something that was all too prevalent on our streets. This kind of slippage of language into alien and native is a thread in our language.’ It is not the first time Gardeners’ Question Time has been embroiled in a race row. In 2008, listeners complained after a plant known as a ‘black man’s willy’ was mentioned. The BBC was accused of ‘pandering to political correctness’ after it apologised. Last night horticulturalist Stefan Buczacki, who was on the programme for 13 years, said Dr Pitcher’s claims were ‘utterly absurd’. ‘Many things have been said about Gardeners’ Question Time, but you can’t say it is racist,’ he said. ‘His comments show a complete lack of understanding of the natural world. ‘Gardeners understand the fluidity of species over space and time. ‘They come and go, and adapt to different environments. That is what we mean by native and non-native species. It has nothing whatsoever to do with nationalism or racism. ‘There is enough real racism in the world without looking for it in places it doesn’t exist.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The passing mention of Gardeners’ Question Time was part of a broader discussion about language and race... the comment simply reflected the programme’s use of accepted gardening and horticultural terminology.’ NATIVE VERSUS NON-NATIVE SPECIES: The show’s experts often warn gardeners of the dangers of introducing foreign species of plant to a garden, and the importance of weed control. But is this actually a racist code? SOIL: According to Dr Pitcher, nationalists often use the metaphor of soil to discuss ethnic purity. Are the Gardeners’ Question Time discussions about compost and soil types as innocent as they seem? RHODOCHITON VOLUBILIS: A 2008 episode outraged some viewers when a caller asked for advice on how to care for the perennial climber, commonly known as ‘black man’s willy’. SPADE: To most gardeners, it is no more than a simple garden implement. But in America, the word has long been a derogatory term for African Americans, equivalent to n*****.

"A 15-year-old schoolboy could save millions of lives after he invented a new, low-cost test that can detect the early stages of a deadly form of cancer. Jack Andraka from Crownsville, Maryland, developed a simple dip-stick test for levels of mesothelin, a biomarker for early stage pancreatic cancer found in blood and urine. It promises to revolutionise treatment of the disease, which currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages. Prodigy: Jack Andraka speaks after receiving Smithsonian Magazine's first annual American Ingenuity Award for youth achievement in Washington, DC. last November. He has invented a new test for pancreatic cancer . Jack's invention, for which he was last month awarded the grand prize of  $75,000 in scholarship funds at the 2012 Intel Science Fair, means that patients now have a simple method to detect pancreatic cancer before it becomes invasive. His novel patent-pending sensor has proved to be 28 times faster, 28 times less expensive, and over 100 times more sensitive than current tests. Thanks to the test, pancreatic cancer . patients could now get an early earning to seek medical help when it . still has a chance of working, which could, he claims, potentially bump . up survival rates to 'close to 100 per cent'. Deadly: Pancreatic cancer is the same form of the disease that caused late Apple CEO Steve Jobs' long decline and eventual death . The test works in a similar way to diabetic testing strips, with his paper strips using only a drop of blood to determine whether patients carry the mesothelin biomarker. It is said to be over 90 per cent accurate, practically instant - and costs only 3 cents. And what's more, his simple test can also be used to detect ovarian and lung cancer, and it could be easily altered to detect the biomarkers of a range of other conditions. 'What’s so cool about that is its applicability to other diseases…for example other forms of cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, environmental contaminants like E Coli, salmonella,' Jack told Take Part. 'All for three cents for a test that takes five minutes to run.' Jack was moved to come up with the . test after a family friend passed away from pancreatic cancer, but it . was as he surreptitiously read a journal article about carbon nanotubes . in a biology lesson that he had his 'epiphany'. But . that eureka moment was not enough; the persistent teenager was rejected . by 197 scientists he solicited for help with his research - with some . plainly telling him his idea simply would not work. A cluster of pancreatic cancer cells: The disease currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages when patients are less likely to respond to treatment . To come up with his new pancreatic cancer test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with conductive single walled carbon nanotubes. He used the mixture to coat strips of ordinary filter paper, making them conductive, and determined the optimal layering using a scanning election microscope. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was then tested against to the paper biosensor and any change in the electrical potential of the sensor strip (due to the changing conductivity of the nanotubes) was measured. Changes in conductivity occurred because the antibodies on the strips binded to the mesothelin and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes further apart and changing the electrical properties of the network. The more mesothelin applied, the more the antibodies would grow and the weaker the electrical signal would become. Andraka's sensor costs $3.00 and 10 tests can be performed per strip, taking 5 minutes each. The test is said to be 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than current testing methods. Finally Dr Anirban Maitra, a professor of pathology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, agreed to give him space in the lab and mentored him through the process of developing the test. To create the test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with single-walled carbon nanotubes used the product to coat strips of ordinary filter paper. The nanotubes make the paper conductive, but when mesothelin is applied the antibodies would bind to the biomarker and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes apart and changing the strips' electrical properties. The more mesothelin present, the more antibodies bind and grow, and the weaker the electrical signal becomes - allowing scientists to accurately measure the levels of the biomarker.

"A crocodile hunter who spent 17 years in pursuit of the dangerous animals now lives with the biggest captive crocodile in the world. George Craig, 84, from Green Island, Australia, captured dangerous crocodile Cassius - who is 18ft-long and weighs a tonne - 30 years ago, and the pair have lived together ever since. As a young man George spent 17 years hunting fierce and dangerous crocodiles, and relocating them to a safe enclosure, where they weren't a threat to humans. Scroll down for video . While George is sure Cassius knows who he is, he also believes that Cassius would eat him given the chance . George has fed Cassius every day for 30 years and has a soft spot for the gigantic animal . Hello Cassius! The 18 foot, one tonne reptile is the largest captive crocodile in the world . George captured Cassius in 1987 from a river in the Northern Territory, where he was notorious for his huge size - and was under threat of being hunted down and killed by the local population. Cassisus, who is missing his front left leg and tip of his tail due to vicious fights, was deemed a massive threat to humans after attacking boats. So George set about capturing him to save his life, and bringing him to live in his sanctuary. Cassius has lived at George's sanctuary, Marineland Melanesia, for the past 30 years, but even after feeding him every day, George knows Cassius would eat him in a second, given the chance. George has long been a brave adventurer. Here he is in Papua New Guinea in the 1970s . George rescued Cassius from angry Northern Territory, Australia, locals in 1987 . The crocodile hunter used just rope and his brave spirit to capture the aggressive animal . Billy Craig, George's grandson who helps run the sanctuary, has now released a series of photographs charting his grandfather's life with Casssius. Billy, 23, said: ‘George likes to feed Cassius personally and after 30 years of being his caretaker, he does have a soft spot for Cassius. ‘Cassius is aware of who George is but there are no illusions that he would eat him if he had the chance, without a doubt.’ ‘Cassius was a problem crocodile with a very aggressive nature. He was becoming notorious and he would have almost certainly been killed if he hadn't been removed and taken to a safe place by my grandfather. George spent 17 years of his life battling dangerous crocodiles and moving them to his safe enclosure . This real-life Crocodile Dundee owns Marineland Melanesa, a crocodile sanctuary . ‘He captured him the old-fashioned way - with ropes and brave spirit. ‘He was then transferred by a truck 1850 miles Cairns and then by boat to Green Island. George named him Cassius Clay the boxer.’ Cassius now lives at George's family business Marineland Melanesia, which was set up in 1969, in order to provide a place for the crocodiles to live safely. It was a long journey to bring Cassius home. George travelled him by truck to Cairns and by boat to Green Island . Cassius, in 2014, looks every bit as menacing as he did when he was captured .","84-year-old Australian man, George, has spent his life hunting crocodiles .

"Pregnant Josie Cunningham, who has cancelled tickets to the birth of her child after finding out she was expecting a girl . Pregnant wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has revealed she is to quit smoking and drinking and has cancelled tickets to the birth of her child after finding out she is expecting a girl. The 24-year-old, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, had originally thought that her third child, due in October, was to be a boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted' to discover it wasn't the little girl she'd hoped for. Then last month she announced to her 54,000 Twitter fans that the four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. Doctors had originally told Ms Cunningham, from Leeds that she was expecting a third boy but she asked for a second opinion after using a home scan kit which said she was expecting a girl. It is now thought she is indeed expecting a girl and has had a change of heart, cancelling the tickets, saying she wants to look after herself. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I want to enjoy my precious first few moments alone with my daughter and my mum - not share them with the world. 'I've really started looking after myself. I have never purposely put my child at any risk, but when I was originally told I was having a boy I just lost all willpower to avoid cravings. 'I've now cut down to just one or two fags a day. I'm about to get hypnotherapy to stop completely.' It is thought that three of the four tickets to be at the birth were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. Two had been sold for £10,000 each while the other two sold for £5,000 each. However, Ms Cunningham had suggested that some of the cash from the event could have been used to reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. Ms Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. The 24-year-old had previously admitted smoking a packet of cigarettes and having a glass of wine after she was told she was expecting a boy . Ms Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. Earlier this month she made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

"David Cameron admitted yesterday he will not try to cap the number of EU migrants who can come to Britain to work. Despite figures showing a surge in Romanian and Bulgarian migrants has pushed their numbers to nearly 200,000, the PM insisted free movement of labour was an ‘important’ right. He said he supported the ‘freedom to apply for a job, to go and work, in another country'. Romanian immigrants set up camp at Marble Arch, London. Police say the Romanians are being brought in by coach and dropped off at Marble Arch, even though it's not an official stop. About 60 rough sleepers have now set up camp there . Instead, Mr Cameron said he would try to curb ‘benefit tourism’ from the EU as part of his renegotiation of Britain’s membership ahead of a planned referendum in 2017. Yesterday Oxford University migration experts suggested the number of Romanian and Bulgarian workers living in Britain may have increased by 30,000 compared - a rise of 25 per cent compared with the same period last year. That would mean the population of migrants from those two countries in the UK was nearly 200,000 when students and dependents are included. Mr Cameron also gave a ‘cast-iron’ guarantee that he will hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017 if he is re-elected next year. He said that he will refuse to form a Coalition or lead a minority government unless he can ensure the referendum will go ahead. And he indicated that he could urge Britain to leave the EU if his attempt to claw back powers fails. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show he would not ‘sit on the fence’, adding: ‘We have the referendum whether or not I have successfully negotiated. I think the negotiation will be successful. Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva from the Migration Obseratory said he expected to see a 'big increase' in immigrant numbers. 'We would expect at least 30,000 more. It is difficult to predict, but that would be the minimum you would expect,' he said . Mr Cameron said that he wanted curb EU migrants’ access to benefits, with a longer waiting period before people to claim and an end to making child benefit payments to children living abroad. He also said he wanted Britain to be excluded from the EU’s historic drive towards ‘ever-closer union’ - a move that will require a change to the EU’s founding Treaty of Rome. The Prime Minister also repeated his view that future countries joining the EU, such as Turkey, should have to wait far longer before their citizens could come to the UK to work. Government sources have floated the idea in the past that ministers could try to impose an annual cap on EU immigration - a move that would lead to a furious stand-off with Brussels. But Mr Cameron yesterday indicated that he had no plans to limit EU migrant labour - the issue credited with driving support for Ukip. He said: ‘I think free movement within the European Union is important, but it needs to be returned to the original concept, which was the freedom to be able to go and work in another country. Now many British citizens go and work in other European countries. Other European citizens come to work here.' His comments on immigration will disappoint those Tory MPs calling for an end to free movement and the repatriation of border powers from Brussels. This week official immigration statistics are expected to confirm a spike in numbers since border controls were abolished in January. Police and Border Agency officials evict Romanian immigrants from a derelict site in Hendon, north London . Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva from the Migration Obseratory said he expected to see a ‘big increase’ in numbers. ‘It is almost certain that we are going to see an increase in that number from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter in 2014. ‘We would expect at least 30,000 more. It is difficult to predict, but that would be the minimum you would expect.' It appears impossible for ministers to hit their pledge to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the end of the Parliament. The figure fell to around 150,000 in 2012 but leapt again last year to 212,000 driven by the arrival of workers from southern European states in economic turmoil.","Nearly 200,000 Romanians and Bulgarians in Britain thanks to recent surge .

"Islamist militiamen stormed the residential annex of America's embassy in Tripoli on Sunday then took the time to give curious journalists in the Libyan capital a tour. The group  has taken up residence in the annex just over a month after diplomats fled to Tunisia over fears of mounting violence in the North African nation in recent months. An Associated Press journalist walked through the U.S. Embassy compound Sunday after the Dawn of Libya, an umbrella group for Islamist militias, invited onlookers inside. Windows at the compound had been broken, but it appeared most of the equipment there remained untouched.

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gadhafi's ouster. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gadhafi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army. Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy.

The fighting prompted diplomats and thousands of Tripoli residents to flee. Dozens were killed in the fighting. On July 26, U.S. diplomats evacuated to neighboring Tunisia under a U.S. military escort. The State Department said embassy operations would be suspended until the security situation improved.

Meanwhile, in the eastern city of Benghazi, heavy clashes broke out between the forces of a renegade general and Islamist fighters on Saturday, killing at least 10 people and showering the airport with rockets, medical and military sources said. Libya is being racked by factional violence as the armed groups which helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 turn their guns on each other in a struggle to dominate politics and the country's vast oil resources.

They have already overrun several army camps this month. Grad rockets hit the civilian airport, military sources and residents said. At least 10 soldiers from Haftar's forces were killed and 25 wounded, a hospital medic told Reuters. Western powers worry Libya will become a failed state as a weak central government cannot control the competing armed groups in a country awash with arms. Senior officials and the elected parliament have relocated to the remote eastern city of Tobruk after effectively losing control of the capital Tripoli, where an alliance of armed groups rules after expelling a rival force. The new forces controlling Tripoli, led by brigades from the western city of Misrata, have helped install an alternative parliament and prime minister. In a televised speech, Omar al-Hasi, not recognized as prime minister internationally, said his government wanted to lead Libya out of crisis and seek national reconciliation. 'We reject extremism and terrorism,' he said. 'I am not with a specific group, party, operation or city but stand for a government for all Libyans.'

"A new treatment developed by British scientists could significantly improve the ability of radiotherapy to save the lives of cancer patients. More than 50 per cent of people with cancer are treated with radiotherapy, which kills tumour cells and boosts the body’s own ability to fight off the disease. But its success is limited by the ability of some cancer cells to become resistant to the treatment. Those resistant cells stubbornly survive and in some cases can grow into new tumours. Now scientists at the University of Manchester have discovered the reason why radiotherapy does not always work - and they have worked out a way to boost its success. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered that radiotherapy does not always kill all cancer cells because a protein called PD-L1 forms a 'molecular shield' around some cancer cells which go on to grow into tumours . The findings, published this morning in the journal Cancer Research, could significantly boost the power of radiotherapy, potentially saving countless lives. Pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca is already starting large clinical trials in a bid to turn the discovery into a widely-available treatment. Dr Simon Dovedi, who led the Manchester team, said the breakthrough had come with the discovery of a ‘molecular shield’ which helped cancer cells survive the radiotherapy treatment. The shield – a protein called PD-L1 – tricks the body’s defences into thinking that cancerous cells pose no threat. Dr Dovedi and his colleagues found that injecting an antibody into the blood stream of mice could block the PD-L1 protein, destroying the shield and allowing the cancer cell to be killed. It is now being tested in humans and Dr Dovedi is confident of further promising results. He said: ‘This treatment is being tested in clinics already. We hope we can reduce the rate of people who see their cancer return after radiotherapy. ‘These are very exciting discoveries.’ Dr Dovedi, whose team was funded by Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca, said: ‘One of the ways that radiotherapy works is that it stimulates the body’s immune response against cancer cells. ‘But in some cancers patients with higher levels of this PD-L1 protein go on to do quite poorly. ‘It provides a molecular shield to the cancer cells, providing an immune escape so the body does not realise the cells are a threat.’ The new antibodies work by stopping the PD-L1 protein from working, allowing the immune system to destroy them. Researchers discovered that injecting an antibody could block the PD-L1 protein, destroying the shield and allowing the cancer cells to be killed. They called it an 'exciting discovery' PD-L1 proteins have been discovered in some patients with lung cancer, skin cancer and bladder cancer - and they may be active in other forms of cancer. Dr Dovedi added: ‘Combining certain immunotherapies with radiotherapy could make them even more effective and we’re now looking to test this in clinical trials to see just how much of a difference it could make.’ Professor Nic Jones, Cancer Research UK’s chief scientist, said: ‘Around half of all cancer patients are given radiotherapy and it has been at the heart of helping improve survival rates so that today one in two cancer patients will survive for at least ten years. ‘Doctors and researchers are constantly looking for ways to improve treatments and this approach could open the door to a whole new way of giving radiotherapy.’ Dr Robert Wilkinson, director of oncology research at MedImmune - the research arm of AstraZeneca - added: ‘MedImmune is committed to developing strong science led collaborations, and supporting research that helps further advance our scientific understanding in the important area of immunotherapy. ‘The findings described in the recent study with Cancer Research UK are extremely encouraging.’","More than half of cancer patients are treated with radiotherapy .

"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has drawn up a six-page action plan on how to tackle Ebola, warning US hospitals: 'now is the time to prepare'. It comes a week after the organization warned the disease is 'out of control', as it emerged a CDC worker has contracted the illness. World leaders have pledged to invest millions in health care in Liberia, where the disease is expected to rage for another 18 months at least. Urgent: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued an Ebola checklist to all American hospitals as it warns the disease, which is 'out of control' in a number of African countries could soon reach the US . But experts believe urgent work must be done at home as it is only a matter of time before the illness is widespread across America. Drawing up a three-stage plan for both small and large hospitals nationwide, CDC chiefs warn the disease has yet to be controlled and 'it is possible that individuals with EVD in West Africa may travel to the United States'. The checklist, released today, orders doctors and nurses to constantly review their approach to the disease and to place heavy emphasis on training staff. Every member of staff should be given a 'buddy' to help keep each others' hygiene in check. And all clinics need to train an employee in media relations in case they have to make a public statement or deal with intense attention. It then goes through each way staff can 'detect', 'protect' and 'respond' appropriately to a case of Ebola, also known as EVD. There is also a detailed document with diagrams showing staff how to put on and remove their scrubs - that they must study' frequently' to ensure they keep up standards. World support: The US military has pledged to invest millions in Liberian health care to tackle the disease . Action plan: The checklist is introduced with the warning, highlight in bold, that 'now is the time to prepare' Detailed: Staff must be paired up in 'buddies' to help them put on and take off their scrubs to keep up standards . Constantly changing: Officials warn staff to 'frequently' check CDC guidelines as they adapt to tackle the illness . The introduction to the checklist reads: 'In order to enhance our collective preparedness and response efforts, this checklist highlights key areas for hospital staff - especially hospital emergency management officers, infection control practitioners, and clinical practitioners - to review in preparation for a person with EVD arriving at a hospital for medical care.' It also warns: 'Many of the signs and symptoms of EVD are non-specific and similar to those of many common infectious diseases, as well as other infectious diseases with high mortality rates.' Last week, CDC chiefs said the world's worst Ebola outbreak is threatening the stability of affected and neighboring countries and a 'massive' response is needed to bring it under control. Dr Frieden said: 'We're likely to see significant increases in cases. Already we have widespread transmission Liberia. In Sierra Leone, we're seeing strong signs that that will happen in the near future.' The group, Doctor Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres - MSF), also warned on Tuesday that the world is losing the battle against the disease and said treatment centers have been 'reduced to places where people go to die alone' as authorities race to contain the disease. Doctors Without Borders President Joanne Liu said her organization is completely overwhelmed by Ebola outbreak in four West African countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. She called on other countries to contribute civilian and military medical personnel familiar with biological disasters. More than 1,500 people have died across West Africa from Ebola. American Ebola sufferers: Dr Richard Sacra (left) is being treated for Ebola in Nebraska where he has received a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly (right) who has recovered from the disease . A statement from SIM today read: 'Upon onset of the symptoms, the doctor immediately isolated himself and has since been transferred to the ELWA Ebola isolation unit. 'The doctor is doing well and is in good spirits.' Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, said today: 'My heart was deeply saddened, but my faith was not shaken, when I learned another of our missionary doctors contracted Ebola. 'As a global mission, we are surrounding our missionary with prayer, as well as our Liberian SIM/ELWA colleagues, who continue fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. We have gifted Liberian doctors, medical staff and support staff who are carrying on the fight.' One US doctor, Richard Sacra, is being treated for the disease in Nebraska, where he has received a blood transfusion from another doctor who recovered from Ebola. Last month, two Americans Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol were released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia after recovering from the deadly virus. The 33-year-old doctor contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, and was flown out of the country along with missionary Mrs Writebol, 59, to be treated. The two received an experimental drug known as ZMapp and recovered. The manufacturer says it has run out of supplies of the drug and it will take months to produce more. World Health Organization Director Margaret Chan warned that the outbreak would 'get worse before it will get better' and would require a larger global response. She thanked countries that have helped but said: 'We need more from you. And we also need those countries that have not come on board.'","Center for Disease Control and Prevention warns disease is coming to US .

"A boy of four was left in agony after pharmacists  mistakenly gave him powerful ear drops to deal with an eye infection. Archie Battersbee had been prescribed eye drops by a doctor to ease a bout of conjunctivitis.But the youngster was left  screaming in pain after blundering pharmacists at a Boots store handed his mother the ear medication instead. The astonishing mix-up left him  with a burn around his right eye. Archie Battersbee, 4, (left) has been left with a burn around his eye after his mother Hollie Dance (right) was given ear drops to treat his eye infection. Boots Pharmacy has apologised for dispensing the wrong medicine . Archie screamed in pain after Miss Dance put the medication in his eye . His . mother, Hollie Dance, said: ‘I put [the drops] in and Archie was . absolutely  screaming, so I read the box closely and it said they were . ear drops. ‘Fortunately, . I only used it once on Archie, but they’re ten times as  strong as the . eye drops so even then you could see it had  burned the  skin around the . corner of his eye. ‘I went back to kick off at Boots and made a formal complaint. ‘They . have now apologised and given us the right drops.’ Archie, who started . school earlier this month, is now terrified of  allowing anyone to put . medication in his eyes following his ordeal. Miss Dance, from Southend-on-Sea in Essex, added: ‘Unsurprisingly, Archie was scared of anything else going in his eye. Archie was left with a severe burn in the corner of his right eye (left and right) after using the medication once . ‘I . eventually managed to get them in and he said it didn’t hurt at all, . which is what it should’ve been like all along.’ It is not the first . time  such a mix-up has occurred at a Boots store. Logan Morley, six, was mistakenly given ear drops to treat conjunctivitis at a branch in Nottingham  in 2012. She suffered burning and swelling around her eyes after her parents used the medication on her. Logan . had been given the correct prescription at an NHS walk-in centre, only . for the pharmacists to hand out the wrong medication. Her . mother Claire Morley said the box was marked ear drops but the . prescription sticker, which was signed by two people, had stated eye . drops. The Boots Pharmacy on Southchurch Road in Southend, where the wrong medication was given to Miss Dance . Logan was taken to hospital, where she was given a cream to treat her burning, bloodshot eyes. Speaking at the time, Mrs Morley said: ‘It is ridiculous. I can’t believe they made such a mistake. ‘You never think to check it. You would like to think they had given you the right medicine.’ As . well as apologising to Archie and his mother for the error, Boots says . changes have been made to prevent the mistake from being repeated. A spokesman said: ‘We would like to once again offer our sincere apologies to the family. ‘At Boots UK, we treat any incident involving patient safety with the utmost importance. ‘After . this incident, a thorough investigation was conducted  and appropriate . remedial action was undertaken to ensure that  any necessary measures . were implemented.’ Six-year-old Logan Morley was left with swollen, bloodshot eyes after she was given the wrong medication . Boots Pharmacy has previously made the same mistake when it issued Logan Morley's parents with ear drops to treat an eye infection in 2012. The six-year-old was given the correct prescription by an NHS Walk-In centre in Nottingham but was given ear drops by pharmacists at Boots the Chemist on Riverside Retail Park in the city. Her mother Claire Morley said the box was marked ear drops but the prescription sticker, which was signed by two people, had stated eye drops. The drops caused a burning pain and Logan was left with swollen, bloodshot eyes and was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre, where she was given a cream to treat them. Speaking at the time, Mrs Morley, said: ‘It is ridiculous. I can’t believe they made such a mistake. ‘You never think to check it. You would like to think they had given you the right medicine.’ Tony Avery, Professor of Primary Care at the University of Nottingham’s Medical School, who conducts research into patient safety, said: ‘Overall, the rate of prescription errors in community pharmacies is quite low. ‘It’s less than one in 50, but often we are talking about very, very minor errors. ‘I’m not expert enough to say whether putting it in the eye at this high a dose would be likely to cause problems. ‘But clearly the dose of 0.5 per cent (of chloramphenicol) is designed for the eye, and the membrane of the eye is much more superficial than the ear, and you have got to be aware of how sensitive the eye is. ‘I would be surprised if giving it at five per cent would cause a sight-threatening adverse reaction.’","Archie Battersbee developed conjunctivitis after starting primary school .

"A new batch of emails from Lois Lerner released by a congressional committee shed light on the former IRS official's attempts to do damage control as the Tea Party targeting scandal gained steam. The emails show that Lerner tried to frame the harassment of certain non-profit groups as 'front line staff people using less than stellar judgement' to Treasury inspectors months before she acknowledged the mistake publicly. They also reveal that Lerner intended to apologize for those staff persons' inappropriate conduct during a speech at a conference in April of 2013, several weeks before she staged an apology during the question and answer portion of another conference, but that idea was ultimately nixed. The emails were part of a document dump made by the Democratically-controlled Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations last week, headed by Sen. Carl Levin, as it released a report clearing the IRS and Lerner, who retired from her position overseeing the tax-exempt division of the IRS after being placed on leave in 2013, of politically motivated targeting. Newly released emails from Lois Lerner show that the former IRS tax-exempt divisions head tried to convince Treasury inspectors that IRS employees in a Cincinnati office weren't scrutinizing conservative groups applying for non-profit tax statuses for political reasons . Republican members of the committee, led by Arizona Senator John McCain, released a report of their own on Friday that contradicts their colleagues and claims that conservative groups were less likely to receive tax-exempt status from the government agency that their liberal counterparts. The Republican report is consistent with a May 2013 report released by the Treasury Inspector J. Russell George. Senate Democrats, who disagree with George's findings, attempted to set the record straight on Friday by releasing 1,706 pages of new documents relating to the so-called targeting of conservative groups in the 2010 and 2012 election cycle. The newly released emails offer a glimpse into Lerner's thinking on the targeting scandal. Lerner has refused to testify before Congress on the issue on the grounds that she would incriminate herself if she did while insisting that she did not instruct employees to break the law. One email between a Treasury inspector involved in the investigation and Lerner from early 2013 show that the former IRS official tried to convince investigators that the actions of a Cincinnati division of the IRS only 'appeared to be politically motivated' but weren't. 'I am willing to take the blame for having not provided sufficient direction initially, which may have resulted in front line staff doing things that appeared to be politically motivated,' she told Treasury's Troy Paterson in a January 31 email, 'but I am not on board that anything occurred here shows that the IRS was politically motivated in the actions taken.' Lerner opined in the email that Treasury investigators were being 'too narrow in their view and have decided that because of the language used in our earlier [Be On The Lookout List] regarding Tea Party, everything that followed was tainted.' She says the IRS already 'owned up' to the fact that the Cincinnati office was 'struggling' to determine which applications should be subject to additional reviews and had sent a team out to train them earlier that month. Furthermore, Lerner states that Treasury officials expressed to her that her department's criteria for evaluating groups 'sounds reasonable.' However, 'they seem to be saying that reasonableness is overshadowed by the fact that the criteria look bad to folks on the outside, so there is no way we could cure the initial bad impression.' 'We understand why the criteria might raise questions,' she admitted but claimed that investigators could not provide her a 'clear definition of what they meant by targeting' and told her their investigation wasn't necessarily about political targeting. She also claimed in the email that inspectors told her they weren't looking at whether groups affected were conservative or liberal 'because that is too difficult to figure out' and that organizations of both political persuasions appear to be on the list. Sen. Carl Levin, left, talks with Sen. John McCain, right, on Capitol Hill in April of 2013. After investigating the IRS for more than a year, the two Senators - one of whom is a Democrat, Levin, and and one of whom is a Republican, McCain - said on Friday they disagree on whether Lerner's division treated conservative groups worse than their liberal counterparts when they applied for tax-exempt status. McCain says it did . In an email exchange with other IRS officials on the day that the targeting story broke, Lerner maintained that liberal groups may have been singled out by her department for added scrutiny. ''I can't confirm that there was anyone on the other side of the political spectrum,' she said. 'I think that sentence presumes that we keep track of which side of the aisle an [organization] falls --we don't. Lerner claimed the IRS only knows that certain organizations involved were conservative because they have been 'very loud in the press.' 'I think that line is dangerous,' she said, referring to IRS' admission that it selected more conservative groups for additional scrutiny than it did progressive groups. In a follow-up email to her colleagues, Lerner warned them that it 'doesn't look good if it looks like we check to see what side of the aisle an org is on.' A series of emails in mid-April between Lerner and other IRS officials, including former acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller, who resigned after the scandal broke amid pressure from the White House and IRS chief of staff Nikole Flax, show that the IRS tried to get out in front of the brewing scandal by slipping an apology into remarks Lerner planned to give at a conference on April 25. After Lerner suggested to Flax that she break the news in her speech, Flax brought the idea to Miller, who affirmed that the IRS 'may want to use it to burst a bubble.' Flax agreed that it may not be 'a terrible idea' for her get their side of the story out and 'discuss the issue a bit.' A draft of the speech contained in the set of documents released by the Senate subcommittee on investigations shows that Lerner planned to admit that the IRS' tax-exempt division was unprepared in 2010 to handle the influx all of the applications from organizations that may be engaging in political behavior. Lerner planned to admit that her team 'placed too much reliance on the particular name of an organization' and specifically and specifically went after groups with the words 'tea party' and 'patriot' in the title. '[L]et me be clear. The IRS should have done a better job of handling the review of the c4 applications,' she was supposed to say. 'We made mistakes for which we deeply apologize. 'But these mistakes were in no way due to any political or partisan reason.' Lerner was to go on to say that missteps were made because of 'insufficient sensitivity to the implications of some of our decisions' and explain how the tax-exempt has amended its practices. For undisclosed reasons, the section on the targeting and the Treasury inspector's related investigation never made it into Lerner's remarks as delivered that day. A few days later, the IRS began circulating talking points on the tax-exempt division's errant behavior, and on May 10 Lerner apologized during the question and answer portion of a speech before the American Bar Association. She and the IRS have been the subject of congressional investigations ever since, including two ongoing reviews in the House of Representatives being conducted by the Ways and Means Committee and the Oversight Committee. Republicans in the House are trying to determine if Lerner's division acted on its own or if coordinated with the White House. They are also trying to find out if the IRS attempted to engage in a cover up of the inappropriate activity before government investigators got involved.","The emails shed light on the thinking of the ex-IRS official - who has refused to testify before Congress .

"Authorities announced today that the Canadian tourist found floating dead in a water tank remains a mystery; the results of her autopsy have come back 'inconclusive.' The Los Angeles County Coroner's office said there was no signs of trauma on Eliza Lam's body. Medical examiners must now wait for toxicology tests to determine whether she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of her death on February 1. The health department has ruled the water in the Cecil Hotel in downtown Los Angeles as safe, despite Lam's body decomposing in a cistern that is connected to water taps throughout the building. But guests are fleeing the hotel in droves. This isn't the first grisly find at the Cecil - a hotel with a dark history that was home to two known serial killers. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Los Angeles fire fighters peer down at the water tanks on the roof of the Hotel Cecil as they try to figure out how to remove the body of a young woman found inside . Tragic: Police have identified the body as Elisa Lam who disappeared on January 31 after taking a solo trip to Southern California from Canada . Found: Lam was found wedged in the water tank above the Cecil Hotel by a maintenance worker after guests complained of low water pressure . The hotel, built in the 1920s but . refurbished several years ago, was the once occasional home to 1980s serial . killers Richard Ramirez - nicknamed the Night Stalker - and Jack . Unterweger. Ramirez was convicted of murdering 13 people and is currently waiting execution in California. Unterweger, an Australian journalist, was found to have killed 11 prostitutes across Europe and the United States. In the 1920s and 30s, several murders . were committed in the hotel. In 1962, a 27-year-old woman leaped to her . death from a window and killed a pedestrian on the street below when . she landed on her. Goldie Olsen, a well-known Los . Angeles face known as the 'pigeon lady of Pershing Square,' was found . strangled to death in her room at the hotel. It was revealed on Wednesday that guests at the Cecil drank, bathed in and brushed their teeth with water from a roof-top tank where a Canadian tourist's body floated, decomposing, for nearly three weeks. Wicked guests: Richard Ramirez - nicknamed the Night Stalker - murdered 13 people. Jack Unterweger, an Australian journalist, killed 11 prostitutes across Europe and the United states . Authorities confirmed that the body found in a tank on Tuesday was Lam, a 21-year-old University of British Columbia who disappeared on February 1. Police . still don't know how Lam died or even how she ended up on the roof of . the hotel - which is protected by locked doors and an alarm. A police source told the Los Angeles Times that her death may have been accidental. Los Angeles Police detectives have . characterized her disappearance as suspicious, but have not released . details about she ended up in a closed-off cistern. Tourists staying at the run-down Skid Row hotel said they were shocked by the discovery of a body in the hotel's water supply. 'The water did have a funny taste,' Sabrina Baugh, a British tourist who used the water in the hotel for eight days, told CNN. 'We never thought anything of it. We thought it was just the way it was here.' Ms Baugh and her husband Michael said they were disgusted by the revelation. Crime scene: LAPD homicide detectives were on the scene to investigate the body . Investigation: Police are now working to determine if the woman's death was accidental or a homicide . 'The moment we found out, we felt a . bit sick to the stomach, quite literally, especially having drank the . water, we're not well mentally,' Mr Baugh said. Los Angeles County health officials . said they are testing the water to determine whether it is contaminated. The water in the tank where Lam was found feeds taps and showers in the . hotel rooms, as well as a coffee shop and the kitchen downstairs. 'Our biggest concern is going to be fecal contamination because of the body in the water,' Terrance Powell said. 'The water did have a funny taste. We never thought anything of it. We thought it was just the way it was here.' Sabrina Baugh, British tourist who drank water at the Cecil Hotel for eight days . Investigators are now working to determine whether foul play was involved in Lam's death with an autopsy scheduled for Thursday. Law enforcement sources told the Times that a locked door and fire escape are the only ways to access the hotel's roof. The door, which only employees can reach, is also equipped with an alarm that notifies hotel staff if someone is up there. The water tank is also hard to access requiring authorities to work well into the afternoon to remove her body after a maintenance worker discovered it on Tuesday morning. 'The location of the water tanks is very small and configured in a very tight way so it's a little more difficult to get the body out,' said police spokeswoman Officer Sara Faden. A worker stands on a water tank on the roof of the Hotel Cecil where the 21-year-old was found . Luxury: The Cecil Hotel is a two-star hotel in downtown Los Angeles where Elisa Lam was staying during her visit to the city . Stange behavior: A surveillance camera on the elevator at the Cecil captured Lam acting in a peculiar, paranoid way  the night she vanished . Lam stayed in touch with her friends and family while traveling in California - up until the day she disappeared. A security video taken in an elevator . at the hotel and released by the LAPD last week showed Lam acting . strangely, hiding in a corner and repeatedly peering around the elevator . doors into the hallway. She never checked out of the hotel . positioned on the outskirts of Skid Row and employees said they never . saw her with anyone else.

"Crocodiles and alligators might be more creative than first thought when it comes to catching their dinner. New research suggests the reptiles use tools, including collections of small sticks, to lure water birds to their death. While this is clever, mugger crocodiles in India and crocodiles and alligators in Florida and Louisiana, seem to be aware of the seasons as they employed their techniques at the time of year when birds build nests and collect twigs. A Mugger crocodile balancing twigs on its nose to tempt birds collecting small branches to build nests with, at Madras Crocodile Bank, Tamil Nadu in India . Crocodiles are not the only animals to display baiting behaviour. Green . herons use feathers and twigs to attract fish when the hunt and . burrowing owls have been known to use faeces to attract dung beetles to . eat. The University of Tokyo first noted that Green herons bait fish using feathers, twigs or even berries. The study says: 'Bait fishing was used most frequently by the individual which fished often in open water with fewer suitable rocks, where the heron has to overcome the handicap of being easily seen by fish.' Only a few species of birds use the technique to try and catch their dinner. Zoologists from the University of Tennessee monitored the behaviour of crocodiles and alligators, which balance twigs on their snouts to attract birds, which probably think the sticks are floating on the water. They saw this behaviour exhibited by replies living at rookeries in Louisiana and during the egret and heron nesting season, between the months of March and April, when the birds are trying to build their nests. The zoologists systematically followed the behaviour of crocodiles at four sites in Louisiana for one year to come up with their findings. The research is the first to detail tools used by any reptiles and the first known case of predators timing the use of lures to a seasonal behaviour of the prey. The scientists said it is common for some bird species to choose to nest in trees growing in ponds and surrounded by crocodiles and alligators, as they use the reptiles as protection against tree-climbing nest predators, including snakes, monkeys and racoons. However, the birds ‘pay’ for this protection as any chicks that fall into the water are usually snatched by the reptiles, as well as adults looking for nesting material who are seduced by the twigs balanced on stealthy crocodile noses. In the study, published in the journal of Ethology Ecology and Evolution, the scientists, led by zoologist Vladimir Dinets who has authored a book about crocodile behaviour called DRAGON SONGS, note the behaviour has been spotted in two crocodile species, which raises the possibility that the behaviour is widely exhibited within the group. They studied anecdotes and research about crocodiles at a rookery that was home to egrets near Chennai, India. Here, an American alligator catches an egret after using its stick baiting technique. The scinetists saw this behaviour exhibited by replies living at rookeries in Louisiana, during the egret and heron nesting season, between the months of March and April, when the birds are trying to build their nest . In 2007, when researchers were observing the behaviour of large mugger crocodiles, they repeatedly saw them with small twigs balanced on their noses. On one occasion an egret moved to collect a stick and the crocodile lunged at it and later, similar activity was observed at large crocodile and alligator parks in Florida. Two of the authors of the study, who have worked at St Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park in Florida for 13 years, which is home to 600 wading birds, said they had regularly observed alligators floating in the pond with sticks balanced across their snouts. They said the stick baiting behaviour was only observed during the bird’s breeding and nest-building season from March to April, even though they were present at the rookeries until July. ‘Using objects as hunting lures is very rare in nature, having been observed in just a handful of species,’ according to the study. ‘At least one of them uses this method predominantly during the nest-building season of its prey. 'This is the first known case of a predator not just using objects as lures, but also taking into account the seasonality of prey behaviour. ‘It provides a surprising insight into previously unrecognised complexity of archosaurian behaviour.’ Crocodiles are not the only animals to display baiting behaviour, Scientific American reported.

"Slipping away by the second, she lies cradled in the arms of the motorbike rider who faces a desperate – and ultimately futile – race against time to save her life. Moments earlier, Genesis Carmona had been an ordinary 22-year-old woman on a street in the Venezuelan city of Valencia. Then she was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman who opened fire at anti-government protesters. Scroll down for video . Shot dead: Genesis Carmona is taken to hospital on a motorcycle after she was shot in the head during an anti-government protest in Valencia, Venezuela . Genesis Carmona, who won the title of 'Miss Tourism' in her home state of Carabobo, was rushed into emergency surgery but later died of horrific injuries. Miss Carmona, a marketing student and beauty queen, slumped to the ground. A bystander scooped her up in his arms and put her on his motorbike. But despite rushing her to hospital for emergency surgery, doctors were unable to save her life.  Last night Miss Carmona’s family were in shock. ‘How long are we going to live like this? How long do we have to tolerate this pressure, with them killing us?’ a relative said. ‘She only needed one more semester to graduate,’ he added. Miss Carmona, a professional model who won the title of Miss Tourism in her home state of Carabobo, was the most high-profile victim to date of violence in Venezuela. So far, five people have been killed in the demonstrations, sparked by opposition politicians with protestors demanding better security, an end to goods shortages and protected freedom of speech. The Venezuelan opposition has blamed the deaths and injuries on armed government loyalists whom they allege are firing into crowds, at anti-government rallies. Stunning: She was just a few months off completing her marketing degree . Tragedy: Five victims have been killed in the anti-government protests so far . The death of Carmona comes just over a . month after a former Miss Venezuela, Monica Spear, was murdered . together with her British husband in the street. It . also comes as Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez waits to . learn if he will be charged for violence that has erupted during . protests that have revitalized challenges to 15 years of socialist rule . in the oil-rich nation. Lopez . was due to appear before a judge in a closed hearing a day after . dramatically surrendering to authorities before thousands of cheering . supporters Tuesday. He was expected to learn what charges he would face for organizing mass demonstrations that have resulted in at least six deaths and more than 100 injuries over the past week. The government of President Nicolas Maduro has accused Lopez, a 42-year-old former mayor and the leader of the Popular Will party, of attempting to foment a coup in the South American nation and authorities had said he could face charges that include homicide and causing grievous bodily harm. A judicial official told The Associated Press that prosecutors were leaning toward discarding homicide and terrorism charges, opting instead to pursue less serious counts such as arson and incitement to commit crimes. Angry demonstrations: Women wearing homemade signs that read in Spanish; ""Freedom for Leopoldo,"" shout slogans in support of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez outside the Palace of Justice in Caracas, Venezuela . Arminda Alvarado, 85, supporter of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez stands outside the Palace of Justice to show her support, in Caracas, Venezuela . That would allow the possibility of Lopez being released pending trial, according to the official, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name because the decision had not been made public. Hundreds of supporters waited outside the courthouse for news of the decision, watched over by National Guard troops. Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, a member of a different opposition party, showed up at one point in a sign of unity among the foes of the Maduro government. 'We are all united in demanding the release of Leopoldo Lopez,' Ledezma told the AP. 'We are rallying behind him.' The crowd dissipated after hours of waiting when officials decided to hold the court hearing at the military jail outside Caracas where Lopez was being detained. The opposition has planned nationwide marches for Saturday to protest both his detention as well as the rampant crime, shortages of consumer goods and inflation rate of more than 50 percent that has made life difficult for many in the country of nearly 30 million people. The jailing of Lopez has made him a cause celebre among opponents of Maduro, eclipsing to some degree Henrique Capriles, the opposition's two-time losing presidential candidate who was building support for another challenge in two year. Demonstrations escalate: Supporters of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez hold up posters that read in Spanish "" Leopoldo Venezuela is with you, your fight is our fight""  and ""The only one that robs this government of sleep has a name, Leopoldo Lopez "" outside the Palace of Justice in Caracas, Venezuela . Pro-government demonstrators: Supporters of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, hold posters of him and of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez during a demonstration outside the Palace of justice in Caracas, Venezuela . Capriles attended a rally on Feb. 12 in Caracas led by Lopez but did not appear on the stage to address the masses of demonstrators. Clashes with police erupted afterward, after the opposition leaders had left, and resulted in three deaths. Maduro accused Lopez of leading a 'fascist' plot to oust the socialist government, the political legacy of the late Hugo Chavez, and authorities issued an arrest warrant for him. He surrendered theatrically on Tuesday, dressed in white to signify peace, adorned with a crucifix from his wife and surrounded by a sea of supporters. 'If my jailing serves to awaken a people, serves to awaken Venezuela ... then it will be well worth the infamous imprisonment imposed upon me directly, with cowardice,' he shouted from atop a statue of 19th century Cuban independence hero Jose Marti in a Caracas plaza. Much of the capital shut down afterward, fearing violent clashes, but the violence occurred in Valencia, the third largest city, where National Guard troops fired rubber bullets and unknown gunman on motorcycles fired live rounds at protesters. Genesis Carmona, a 22-year-old university student who had been Miss Tourism 2013 for the state of Carabobo, was struck in the head and killed by a bullet, a death that reverberated in a country that prizes beauty queens. Anti-government: Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez's supporters pose for a photos with Bolivarian National Guard, riot police officers outside the Palace of Justice in Caracas, Venezuela . Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez is flanked by Bolivarian National Guards after he surrendered, in Caracas, Venezuela . In southern Bolivar state on Wednesday, gunman firing from a rooftop at a pro-government demonstration killed one person and wounded four, Gov. Francisco Rangel Gomez said. Since the latest unrest began a week ago, six people have died — two supporters of the government and four backers of the opposition, including one 17-year-old struck and killed by a car at a rally Tuesday. Human rights groups have condemned the charges against Lopez, with Amnesty International and others saying they appear to be politically motivated. Secretary of State John Kerry earlier warned that arresting him would have a 'chilling effect' on freedom of expression. Some Venezuelans say attracting attention was Lopez's plan all along, with the charismatic, Harvard-educated leader seeking to catapult past Capriles and lead the charge against the government. But his fiery rhetoric and elite background — he studied economics in the U.S. on a swimming scholarship and speaks fluent English — make him an improbable figure to build bridges with the poor Venezuelans who elected Maduro and who, while increasingly dissatisfied with his handling of the economy, jealously guard their social gains under Chavez. 'The middle-class (protesters) on the street don't represent the masses,' said Carlos Romero, a political scientist at Central University of Venezuela. Monica Spear Mootz and her ex-husband Thomas Berry were killed in an armed highway robbery last month . The death of beauty queen Genesis Carmona comes over a month after Miss Venezuela 2004 Monica Spear Mootz, 29, was shot to death alongside her British ex-husband Thomas Berry in an armed highway robbery. The pair were killed after being robbed when their car broke down on the Puero-Cabello Valencia highway at about 10pm on Monday, January 6. Reports at the time suggested armed men came up to the car as the couple waited for a repair truck. The terrified couple locked themselves in their Toyota Corolla but the robbers are believed to have opened fire through the windows. The bodies of Mr Berry, 39, and Ms Spear, who had American citizenship, were found in the car with their five-year-old daughter, who had been shot in the leg. At least six shots are believed to have . been fired, hitting Mr Berry in the chest, his ex-wife in several places . and their daughter in the leg. The couple had reportedly separated a year before their death but remained close and went on vacations together to spend time with their daughter. They were on one such trip touring the country during the week leading up to the attack and their friends thought that it may lead to a reunion. Ms Spear was a famous TV actress following her pageant victory and appeared in a number of telenovelas [South American soap operas], with her roll in 'Forbidden Passions' the most notable. The University of Central Florida graduate had American citizenship and her parents live in Orlando, Florida. Mr Berry, an independent travel consultant from London, lived in the capital Caracas, it was reported. Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in . He was understood to have moved to Florida for a short time after he was shot 15 years ago in a robbery that killed his friend. 'He had already been shot once by robbers trying to steal his car,' close friend Luis Dominguez told The Telegraph. 'His friend died in the incident and although doctors saved his life, they couldn't extract the bullet and he still had it in his stomach.' ['Mr Berry] moved to the States to get away from things here for a while but missed Venezuela and came back,' Mr Dominguez added.

He said the family had spent New Year's in the mountains of the western state of Merida then traveled to the plains. Mr Dominguez said they were people 'who really loved the country' and had a good relationship despite the divorce. Seven people have been arrested in connection with the shooting.","Génesis Carmona shot in the head amid anti-government protests .

"Investigators for a House committee learned yesterday that ex-Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner's hard drive was merely 'scratched' and data was not 'unrecoverable,' as previously claimed by the IRS. The House Ways and Means Committee also said it is now uncertain as to whether Lerner's hard drive was actually recycled, per previous IRS testimony, or 'shredded' as a court filing states, after reviewing the agency's IT logs, which list the hard drive at one point as having been 'recovered.' 'It is unbelievable that we cannot get a simple, straight answer from the IRS about this hard drive,' Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said in a statement on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Congressional investigators have learned that former Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division head Lois Lerner's hard drive was scratched but not damaged beyond all recovery, as the IRS claimed . Ways and Means investigators made the discoveries after talking with IT professionals at the government agency who the committee claims were not previously made available for interviews. In the course of its probe into the IRS' targeting of conservative organizations, the committee says, it also ascertained that IT employees who worked on Lerner's hard drive recommended that it be reviewed by outside experts but the government agency declined to take their advice. If the IRS had sought outside counsel, it would have likely realized that the data from Lerner's damaged hard drive was most likely recoverable, the committee said on Tuesday after speaking to numerous law enforcement and Department of Defense forensic experts. The new information 'raises more questions about . potential criminal wrong doing at the IRS,' Camp said. 'If the IRS would just come clean and tell Congress and the American people what really happened, we could put an end to this,' he argued. 'Our investigators will not stop until we find the full truth.' Ways and Means is not the only congressional committee investigating the IRS for targeting conservative groups. A separate investigation being conducted by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is looking into the IRS' failure to inform Congress in a timely manner that Lerner's hard drive had crashed. In interviewing Thomas Kane, the IRS Deputy Associate Chief Counsel for Procedure and Administration, last week, the committee determined that the IRS knowingly kept the crash from Congress for four months. In partial testimony from Kane released on Monday, the IRS employee says that the agency knew in early to mid February about the hard drive crash. Yet, the IRS did not tell Congress about the crash until June, Republicans investigating the matter say. In a letter to the Justice Department on Tuesday, House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa and Oversight Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Job Creation, and Regulatory Affairs Chairman Jim Jordan, both Republicans, asked the department to appoint an independent special prosecutor to investigate why IRS Commissioner John Koskinen hid the information from Congress for so long. 'Until we know all the facts,' Jordan said at a hearing on the matter this morning, 'the committee will continue to press for the truth.' At the hearing Koskinen said that while Mr. Kane may have knew about Lerner's hard drive crash in February, but he did not know at that time. When he did find out in April, Koskinen said he did not immediately tell Congress because he was waiting to find out if the IRS had backup tapes of Lerner's lost emails. 'My theory is this, you guys were never going to tell us until we caught you,' Jordan shouted at him, claiming that the only reason the IRS came clean was because of a Freedom of Information Act request filed by conservative organization Judical Watch. 'It seems to me that before you're going to make that sort of a charging claim,' Koskinen fired back, 'you'd better have evidence.' Welcome back: Today's hearing marked the third time in the last month that IRS chief John Koskinen, right, was carted before the House Oversight Committee, led by Rep. Darrell Issa, right . Koskinen . said he had no idea what was going on with the back up tapes of Lerner's . emails at this juncture because the IRS Inspector General has taken . over the internal investigation into the matter and has asked that he . not interfere. 'At this point I have no information whether there's anything usable on those tapes,' Koskinen said. Asked later by Rep. Trey Gowdy about a June 13 memo he sent to two Senators in which he 'confirmed . that back-up tapes from 2011 no longer exist because they have been . recycled' and if he was still 'confirmed', Koskinen said: 'At this point . I have no basis for not being confirmed. 'At this point I know the IG is looking and hasn't found anything,' he said. He . also argued during the hearing it was not odd that Lerner and other . targets of the congressional investigation had hard drive crashes, as . 300 IRS employees experienced hard drive crashes during the time period . in question. Today marked the fourth time this year Koskinen had been hauled before the Oversight committee to discuss the missing emails, and the third time in the last month. The IRS chief said today that his agency had spent roughly $18 million  and between 100,000 and 120,000 hours responding to investigations into this matter. At one time or another, some 250 employees have been involved in the investigation, he said, it has become a 'significant distraction.' The complaint was the subject of a letter from Oversight ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat, to Issa on Monday. 'Requiring Commissioner Koskinen to testify . again this week not only takes him away from the day-to-day duties of . operating an agency with 90,000 employees, but it also diverts our . Committee from conducting responsible oversight on many key areas that . traditionally have been part of our jurisdiction,' Cummings said. Cummings and the ranking member on the Oversight subcommittee used their opening statements at today hearing to denigrate Republicans leading the hearings in Oversight as well as Ways and Means for engaging in a 'taxpayer-funded foot race' to make headlines on Lerner's hard drive and slowing down the investigative process by not working together. 'So its' something like a children's fairy tale, that were looking at,' Rep. Matt Cartwright said. 'This is unseemly. This is embarrassing. And it is not a proper way to run an investigation or spend millions in taxpayer funds,' Cummings said. Issa, chairman of the Oversight committee, responded to Cummings' comments by asking that he withdraw statements that 'disparage' him from his opening statement. The committee's investigation 'should not lead to personal attacks,' he said. It is the responsibility of the committee to provide 'vigorous oversight,' Issa added. In a statement yesterday, Camp blamed the Ways and Means committee's ongoing probe on the IRS' failure to provide all of the relevant information in a timely manner. 'It is these constant delays and late revelations that have forced this investigation to go on so long,' Camp said.","Interviews with IT employees of the IRS revealed that the IRS ignored recommendations to have hard drive sent to outside experts for processing .

"A beekeeping dog has been trained to sniff out a killer disease which wipes out hives and even has his own suit to protect him from stings. Bazz the black labrador was specially trained by beekeeper Josh Kennett to detect by smell a killer bee disease called American foulbrood. But Mr Kennett was forced to design him his own beekeepers suit after he kept getting stung while saving the buzzing insects. Bazz the black labrador (pictured in his special suit) has been trained by beekeeper Josh Kennett . A beekeeping dog is creating a buzz with a special outfit designed to protect him from stings . Now, the dog has to suit up every time he goes out to the hives. The beekeeper, from Tintinara in South Australia, created the incredible suit after a long process of trial and error. Mr Kennett said: 'The process of training Bazz and developing the suit has been an attempt to find a better way of controlling American foulbrood disease. 'There is no cure for the disease . Josh Kennett created the special suit . 'Detection and quarantine processes are essential to save our bees. 'I realised that Bazz was able to sniff out the disease, and save thousands of bees - but he didn’t like being around them too much when he was getting stung. 'So I’ve tried to develop a suit the dog can wear and hopefully avoid being stung.' The suit . is created to protect the dog as it attempts to detect the devastating . disease which wipes out thousands of beehives every year. The . fatal Paenibacillus larvae caused by the infection are usually only . visible under high-magnification microscope, but thanks to Bazz’s mesh . protected nose, that’s not necessary. The dare-devil dog is protected from bee attack to let him get close enough to sniff out the hives. After a lengthy training regime Bazz was ready to take on the challenge and began detecting the disease. Mr Kennett said: 'We’ve now proven the concept, he can find the infected hives. 'The only challenge now is getting the dog comfortable with the suit. It’s hard to change a dog’s habits overnight. 'To . fully cover a dog up and expect it to do the same thing, it takes time . to change how he behaves and to get used to that suit. 'But he’s a quick learner and he’s never let us down before.' American Foulbrood is caused by a spore forming bacterium called Paenibacillus larvae. These spores are the infective stage of the disease and infection begins when food contaminated with spores are fed to larvae by the nurse bees. Once in the gut of the larva the spores germinate, bateria move into the larval tissues, where they multiply enormously. American Foulbrood is caused by a spore forming bacterium called Paenibacillus larvae . Infected larvae normally die after the cell is sealed and millions of infective spores form in their remains. Spores are very resistant to extremes of heat and cold and to many disinfectants. The most common method of transmission from infected hive to healthy hive is the beekeeper. The spores can easily transferred, if frames of honey or brood are moved between hives, or if other contaminated equipment is used. However, robbing by adult bees of dead or dying infected colonies is also an important mode of transmission. If left to run its course, all colonies infected with AFB will eventually die from the disease. All infected colonies are normally destroyed. The first stage is to destroy the adult bees and brood combs by burning, then the hives and any appliances are sterilised by scorching with a blow lamp.","Bazz the black labrador has been trained by beekeeper Josh Kennett .

"President Barack Obama vowed Tuesday to use the power of executive actions to bypass the unfriendly Republican-controlled House in order to advance his liberal economic agenda. Obama focused on improving the up-and-down economic recovery as he convened his first Cabinet meeting of 2014 and made clear he'll be doing so with or without the help of the embattled Congress. 'We're not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we're providing Americans the kind of help they need,' the president said. Scroll down for video... Making it clear: Obama's Cabinet members look on as the president outlined his plan to push economic recovery through executive actions and orders in the coming year . He said he would instruct his department heads to 'use all the tools available to us' to assist the middle class. With two weeks left before delivering an economy-focused State of the Union address to Congress, Obama is picking up the pace of his jobs message and demonstrating how he can advance his economic agenda administratively and through his ability to coax action from important interest groups. On Wednesday he will go to North Carolina to draw attention to the type of manufacturing innovation hub that he promoted in his 2013 State of the Union speech. On Thursday he has invited college presidents to discuss ways to improve workers' skills. Later this month, he is convening CEOs at the White House to lay out plans for hiring the long-term unemployed. ‘Overall, the message to my Cabinet, and that will be amplified in our State of the Union, is that we need all hands on deck to build on the recovery that we're already seeing,’ Obama said. ‘The economy is improving, but it can be improving even faster.’ 'I've got a pen, and I've got a phone': In his first Cabinet meeting of 2014, Obama vowed to use the power of the pen to bypass the unfriendly and embattled Congress on economic issues . At center, Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius looks on as Obama addresses members of the press on Tuesday . The approach has strong echoes of Obama's 2012 ‘We can't wait’ campaign that sought to depict Obama as an impatient executive in the face of inaction from Congress, particularly in the Republican-controlled House. 'We are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we're providing Americans the kind of help that they need,' the president said . Obama's reliance on his executive powers and his bully pulpit - at the White House it's called his ‘pen-and-phone’ strategy - illustrates the means at his disposal to drive policy but also highlights the limits of his ability to work with Congress. Only through legislation can Obama obtain some of the most ambitious items on his economic agenda - from a higher minimum wage to universal preschool to an overhaul of immigration laws, three items in his 2013 State of the Union that will make a return appearance in this year's address. As long as Republicans in Congress are unreceptive to his legislative priorities, he will have to settle for more incremental and narrower solutions that don't necessarily have the staying power and the force of law. Last week, Obama announced that five communities had been designated as ‘promise zones,’ fulfilling a goal he set out in his 2013 State of the Union speech. Last year, Obama also announced that he intended to launch three manufacturing hubs like the one he will showcase Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C. But in an example of his limitations, he also called on Congress to create 15 more similar hubs, a request that went unanswered. Obama's determination to use the power of executive orders and administrative actions as well as his decision to convene key figures from private enterprise, education and other interest groups to help advance his agenda underscores some of the built-in powers of the presidency. Clinton-era White . House chief of staff John Podesta, who is joining the White House as a senior adviser, has long pressed Obama to use his executive authority to get around congressional opposition. Podesta co-authored a report in 2010 for the liberal Center for American Progress that was essentially a treatise on presidential authority. It argued that both presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton had enacted aspects of their agendas even in the face of a divided Congress. ‘The upshot: Congressional gridlock does not mean the federal government stands still,’ Podesta wrote. ‘This administration has a similar opportunity to use available executive authorities while also working with Congress where possible.’ Can do it all alone: Obama urged Congress to extend unemployment insurance and pass immigration reform as well as help bring down skyrocketing college tuition .","Obama told his first Cabinet meeting of 2014 he won't 'be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we're providing Americans the kind of help they need'

"A single mother of eight who can no longer have children says she will use a surrogate to have another two – and claim more in benefits. After putting so much strain on her body by having eight children in 13 years, Marie Buchan has been forced to have a hysterectomy. But even though she admits struggling to control the large brood she has now, the 32-year-old plans to have two more using a surrogate mother. Scroll down for video . We are family: Marie Buchan (centre), of Selly Oak, Birmingham, pictured with her children (from left)  Joshua, eight; Mikayla, four; Tia, 12; ten-month-old Olivia; Leah, 11; Latoya, nine; Amelia, two; and Alisha, six . Marie Buchan says she will use a surrogate to have another two children and claim more benefits . Miss Buchan, who boasts about how . easy it is to abuse the benefits system, admits that having a larger . family will boost her chances of getting a five-bedroom house at . taxpayers’ expense. She has also calculated that she will get an extra . £70 a week in welfare payments. The mother, who caused outrage last . year by saying her large family ‘couldn’t survive’ on state handouts of . more than £26,000-a-year, confessed: ‘It is easy to claim off the state. I was devastated when doctors told me I could not have more [children]. ‘I love being pregnant and surrounded . by kids. If I can’t have more babies myself, the next best thing would . be to use a surrogate. People might criticise me. But it is my right to . have as many children as I want.’ Unemployed Miss Buchan made headlines . eight months ago when she complained that her benefits payments – which . were reduced from £582 a week to £500 a week after the Government . introduced a cap on handouts – are not enough for her family to survive . on. She also said that her £200,000 three-bedroom semi-detached council house in Selly Oak, Birmingham ‘isn’t big enough’.

Miss Buchan, with her children Mikayla, four, Amelia, two, and ten-month-old Olivia, who share the same bed . But despite her complaints, she has . now admitted life on benefits is ‘easy’ and that she even has enough . money to buy luxury items for herself and an iPad or tablet for seven of . her eight children. She said: ‘Being on benefits gives me an easy lifestyle. I have got more than enough money to pay the bills and feed the kids. ‘I am constantly buying clothes for myself and I like to make sure the kids have nice clothes. ‘I treat them to takeaways weekly and they have all got computer tablets apart from the youngest.’ Crowded: Miss Buchan, who began dating her boyfriend at 14, first became pregnant at 19 . She receives more than £2,200 a month . in state handouts – £440 in child benefit, £1,604 in tax credits and . £183 in income support, which leaves her with a monthly disposable . income of £600. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said last night: ‘People can’t expect the . taxpayer to pick up the bill if they want to keep having children.’ Miss . Buchan’s relationship with her former partner and father of all her . children ended last year because he couldn’t handle the stress of having . so many children. He now sees them at weekends. So the young mother is raising Tia, . 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, . Amelia, two, and ten-month-old Olivia on her own. Miss Buchan, who first became pregnant at 19, had six of her children in seven years, which took its toll on her body. By her seventh pregnancy she had developed severe back and stomach pain. A scan revealed the tissue . surrounding her womb was at risk of rupturing and doctors warned her . against an eighth baby. However, she went ahead regardless. She admitted: ‘I adored the attention . I got when I was expecting and, as I started having more children, my . benefits money went up – which made it easier to have a good lifestyle. The more children I had, the more chaotic it was. But I loved having a . big family. ‘My friends and family told me I was irresponsible and my partner did not want another baby. ‘But we were lax with contraception and it just happened,’ she told Closer magazine. ‘It is hard work. I am up at 6am to . get the kids ready for school and often don’t get into bed until 3am . after I have done the housework.’ After giving birth to Olivia, she was . warned by doctors that her womb was in danger of collapsing and was . urged to have a hysterectomy. Despite having the procedure, it has not deterred her from wanting child number nine and ten. ‘I don’t feel ready to stop,’ she added. ‘I have realised that I could still have children with a surrogate. I would love it if my ex-partner could be a sperm donor, as I want my kids all to have the same dad.’ The Department for Work and Pensions said it cannot comment on individual cases. A spokesman added: ‘We are reforming . the benefits system to make sure those who can work do, and support is . better targeted at those who need it most.'","Marie Buchan, 32, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, has got to have hysterectomy .

"A Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because of religious beliefs has been told by the Civil Rights Commission that he can't discriminate against customers. The state's commission has told Jack Phillips that his religious objections to same-sex weddings did not trump Colorado's anti-discrimination statues. The unanimous ruling upheld an administrative law judge's finding in December that Phillips violated civil rights law when he refused an order from a gay couple in 2012, who later sued. Overruled: Baker Jack Phillips has been told he can't discriminate against same-sex customers because of his Christian beliefs . 'I can believe anything I want, but if I'm going to do business here, I'd ought to not discriminate against people,' Commissioner Raju Jaram said. Phillips, a Christian who owns the Masterpiece Cakeshop in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, said the decision violates his First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of his religion. 'I will stand by my convictions until somebody shuts me down,' he told reporters after the ruling. He added that his bakery had been so overwhelmed by supporters eager to buy cookies and brownies that he does not currently make wedding cakes. Dave Mullins and Charlie Craig, who sued Phillips, were pleased that the commission roundly rejected Phillips' arguments. 'We're just thrilled by that,' Mullins said. Gay marriage remains illegal in Colorado. Mullins and Craig were married in Massachusetts and wanted a wedding cake for a reception to celebrate their union at their home in Westminster, another Denver suburb. Barred: Charlie Craig, left, and Dave Mullins sued after Phillips refused to make their wedding cake in December 2012 . An attorney for Denver baker Phillips says they are considering appealing the ruling . State law prohibits businesses from refusing to serve customers based on their sexual orientation. The panel issued its ruling verbally. It ordered Phillips to stop discriminating against gay people and to report quarterly for two years on staff anti-discrimination training and any customers he refuses to serve.

"After indulging in a three-month nap, it is unsurprising that one of the world's largest crocs might wake up a little peckish. Emerging from hibernation at Wild Life Sydney Zoo in Darling Harbour, one of the city zoo's most ferocious inhabitants attracted attention as he gorged on his first feast of the summer. Rex, one of the world's largest crocodiles, burst from the water at the zoo's Kakadu Gorge enclosure to snap his giant jaws around the carcass of a dead chicken.

Snap happy: Bursting from the water, thrashing his powerful tail, the five-metre crocodile leapt for the dead bird . Exploding through the surface, thrashing his powerful tail, Rex devoured the bird dragging it down to the water mimicking the technique used in the wild to drown prey. Devouring the bird in one sharp bite, the predatory saltwater croc, revealed why his kind are considered one of 'nature's ultimate killing machines'. The saltwater species or estuarine crocodile is the world's largest of all crocs and there are thought to be between 200,000 and 300,000 living in the wild. They are not thought to be at risk of extinction but illegal hunting and habitat loss has put pressure on the population. Giant predator: Rex, a saltwater croc, is one of the world's largest. There are thought to be between 200,000 and 300,000 of the species living in the wild throughout parts of India, southeast Asia and northern Australia . Lurking: Mimicking hunting techniques in the wild, Rex lurks close to the surface, ready to explode and pounce on his prey . More likely than their reptilian peers to eat a human, the giant beasts reach an average of five-metres and 450kgs, but males reaching seven-metres and weighing 1,000kg are not uncommon. Rex's home at Sydney Zoo's Kakadu Gorge enclosure aims to replicate the diverse eco-system where these creatures thrive in the wild in eastern India, southeast Asia and northern Australia. In the wild the competent swimmers are often spotted far out at sea. The opportunistic predators lurk beneath the surface close to the shoreline waiting for their next meal to stop for a drink. While Rex, who weighs 700kg, is partial to a chicken, the saltwater croc will eat anything it can get its jaws around, from water buffalo to monkeys, wild boar and even sharks.","Sydney Zoo's resident saltwater croc bursts through water to feast .

"'Overtly racist': Some Minneapolis locals are irate over a Bar Louie's posted dress code, which lists clothing most often associated with young black men . A popular Minnesota bar is under fire for posting a dress code that some are calling 'overtly racist.' Bar Louie in Minneapolis has a sign on the door proclaiming they strictly enforce a policy that bans anyone wearing 'excessively' baggy clothing, large chains, long white t-shirts and other outerwear often associated with young black men.

"This is the moment an adorable baby chimp took his first faltering steps away from his mother. His beard and wrinkles belying his tender years, the brave youngster looked a little unsteady on his feet as he determinedly approached the camera in a bid to show off his confidence. But his courage soon faded and he fled back to the safety of his family. Brave explorer: The tiny chimpanzee wobbles slightly as he tries to look tough for the camera . Growing up: The young animal is clearly keen to become independent, left, but is still deeply reliant on his doting mother, right .

"The bodies of 21 German soldiers entombed in a perfectly preserved World War One shelter have been discovered 94 years after they were killed. The men were part of a larger group of 34 who were buried alive when a huge Allied shell exploded above the tunnel in 1918, causing it to cave in. Thirteen bodies were recovered from the underground shelter, but the remaining men had to be left under a mountain of mud as it was too dangerous to retrieve them. Nearly a century later, French archaeologists stumbled upon the mass grave on the former Western Front in eastern France during excavation work for a road building project. Mass grave: The bodies of 21 German soldiers entombed in a perfectly preserved First World War shelter have been discovered in France 94 years after they were killed . Amazing condition: The soldiers were buried alive in mud inside the underground shelter (left) which contained items including beds, a bottle and a helmet (right) Some 7.5million men lost their lives on the Western Front during World War One. The front was opened when the German army invaded Luxembourg and Belgium in 1914  and then moved into the industrial regions in northern France. In September of that year, this advance was halted, and slightly reversed, at the Battle Of Marne. It was then that both sides dug vast networks of trenches that ran all the way from the North Sea to the Swiss border with France. This line of tunnels remained unaltered, give or take a mile here and a mile there, for most of the four-year conflict. By 1917, after years of deadlock that saw millions of soldiers killed for zero gain on either side, new military technology including poison gas, tanks and planes was deployed on the front. Thanks to these techniques, the Allies slowly advanced throughout 1918 until the war's end in November. Many of the skeletal remains were . found in the same positions the men had been in at the time of the . collapse, prompting experts to liken the scene to Pompeii. A . number of the soldiers were discovered sitting upright on a bench, one . was lying in his bed and another was in the foetal position having been . thrown down a flight of stairs. As . well as the bodies, poignant personal effects such as boots, helmets, . weapons, wine bottles, spectacles, wallets, pipes, cigarette cases and . pocket books were also found. Even the skeleton of a goat was found, assumed to be a source of fresh milk for the soldiers. Archaeologists believe the items have been so well-preserved because hardly any air, water or lights had penetrated the trench. The 300ft-long tunnel was located 18ft beneath the surface near the small town of Carspach in the Alsace region of France. Michael Landolt, the archaeologist leading the dig, said: 'It's a bit like Pompeii. Everything collapsed in seconds and is just the way it was at the time. 'Here, as in Pompeii, we found the bodies as they were at the moment of their death. Some . of the men were found in sitting positions on a bench, others lying . down. One was projected down a flight of wooden stairs and was found in a . foetal position. 'The . collapsed shelter was filled with soil. The items were very . well-preserved because of the absence of air and light and water. 'Metal objects were rusty, wood was in good condition and we found some pages of newspapers that were still readable. Leather was in good condition as well, still supple.

"The prospect of an epic train journey from New York to London might seem like a distant dream for those seeking the ultimate railway holiday. But booking a ticket from Grand Central to St Pancras Station could be a step closer after Russia gave the green light for plans for a 65-mile tunnel under the Bering Strait. The Kremlin this week gave its support for a $99billion scheme that would link Asia and North America and allow for a potential once-in-a-lifetime train journey. Trip of a lifetime: The Kremlin has given the green light for a £60billion tunnel linking Siberia to Alaska through the Bering Strait . The views would be breathtaking: A snowmobile makes its away across the frozen tundra in Alaska . Better wrap up warm: If the tunnel was ever built, the train journey would probably take the best part of three weeks in sub zero temperatures . The proposed tunnel would pass underneath the Big Diomede and Little Diomede islands and straddle the international dateline to link East and West. Engineers have said there is no technical reason the tunnel could not be completed and it could provide a cheaper way of shipping freight around the world, The Times reported. The idea was first raised by Tsar Nicholas II in 1905, but was this week endorsed by Aleksandr Levinthal - deputy federal representative for the Russian Far East - at a conference on developing infrastructure in the country's remote north-east. A dream too far? The plans would see a 65-mile tunnel, twice that of the Channel Tunnel, bored through the international date line in the Bering Strait (pictured) Rejuvenation: Russia will open a £900million extension to the Trans-Siberian railway to Yakutsk and could link to the north-eastern tip of Siberia by 2030 . An East to West train route would require both Russia and the U.S. to construct railway lines in Siberia and Alaska. Currently, . train services extend as far east as Chita or Vladivostock in Russia, . while you would need to take a ferry between Bellingham and Anchorage to . get anywhere near the Bering Strait on the U.S. side. At present it would take just over two weeks to get as far along the route as physically possible. Here's how: . London - Brussels - Cologne - Moscow: 18hrs 30mins . Moscow - Chita: 106 hours . Train route from Chita to Anchorage . Bellingham - Anchorage: 7 days - by ferry . Seattle - Bellingham: 2 hours . New York - Philadelphia - Pittsburgh - Chicago - Seattle: 64hrs 30mins . Total journey time: 14 days 23 hours . The three-day conference, held in the eastern city of Yakutsk, brought delegates from the U.S., China and Britain and was aimed at capturing the economic potential of the resource-rich region. Mr Levinthal told The Times: 'We should see advanced development of road and rail infrastructure here [in the Russian Far East] and improvement in the investment climate in Russia as a key aim.' A 500-mile railway line stemming from the existing Trans-Siberian line to Yakutsk - costing £900million and due for completion in 2013 - is part of Kremlin plans to extend rail lines 2,360 miles to the north-eastern tip of Siberia by 2030. That could open up the way for the construction of a tunnel - which could take up to another 15 years to complete. The route would be twice the length of the Channel Tunnel, in a sparsely populated area miles from large population centres. It would also require U.S. engineers to create through train lines in Alaska, linking it with cities in Canada and onwards. Currently, travellers would have to get a ferry to Anchorage, Alaska, from the U.S. west coast and train services in Russia would only take you as far as Chita or Vladivostock, before they move down into China and Mongolia. It remains to be seen whether Russia could finance such an ambitious project, but it opens up the possibility of a breathtaking train journey through picturesque Siberia and Alaska.","Trip of a lifetime would take the best part of three weeks through picturesque Alaska and Siberia .

"It was hailed as proof of alien life, a mummified visitor from another planet. Ten years after the remains of a six-inch ‘space alien’ were first discovered, they have been confirmed as ‘human’ by Stanford scientists in a new documentary film Sirius. Since the remains of the small humanoid - known as the 'Atacama Humanoid' and nicknamed Ata - were discovered in Chile's Atacama Desert 10 years ago there has been much speculation about its origins. Theories have included that the bones were those of an aborted fetus, or a monkey, or even an alien that had crash-landed on earth. Scroll down for videos . A new documentary film Sirius has revealed that the mummified remains of a six-inch supposed 'space alien' are in fact human . Scientists say DNA tests have revealed the ususal remains to be human rather than alien . A comparison of foetus x-rays show a remarkable difference between human fetus skeletal development and the x-rays of the Atacama humanoid, the researchers claim in a report published today . Dr Steven Greer, who led the project and documentary, has hit back at critics who claim the body is a hoax. 'The CAT scan clearly shows internal chest organs -lungs and what  appears to be the remains of a heart structure,' he said. 'There is absolutely no doubt that the specimen is an actual organism and that it is not a hoax of any kind. 'This fact has been confirmed by Dr. Nolan and Dr. Lachman at Stanford.' In the weeks leading up to Monday’s premier of Sirius, UFO enthusiasts had grown increasingly excited that the film could announce a major breakthrough in the search for extra-terrestrial life forms. Experts say the small skeleton certainly bears many of the hallmarks of what we have come to believe aliens look like, in particular a large head overshadowing a small body. According to Chilean local newspaper, a man called Oscar Munoz found the remain on Oct. 19, 2003 when he was looking for objects of historical value in La Noria, a ghost town in the Atacama Desert. Near an abandoned church, Munoz found a white cloth containing, according to the newspaper, ‘a strange skeleton no bigger than 15cm [the size of a pen]. It was a creature with hard teeth, a bulging head with an additional odd bulge on top. Its body was scaly and of dark color. Unlike humans, it had nine ribs. A DNA sample from bone marrow extracted from the specimen, was analyzed by scientists at a prestigious American university . Scientists believe the unusual skeleton is human, yet it has nine ribs . 'After six months of research by leading scientists at Stanford University, the Atacama Humanoid remains a profound mystery,' said physician and Disclosure Project founder Dr. Steven Greer. 'We traveled to Barcelona Spain in late September 2012 to obtain detailed X Rays, CAT scans and take genetic samples for testing at Stanford University. 'We obtained excellent DNA material by surgically dissecting the distal ends of two right anterior ribs on the humanoid. 'These clearly contained bone marrow material, as was seen on the dissecting microscope that was brought in for the procedure,' Sirius premiered in Los Angeles on Earth Day and will be released online and in select theaters worldwide, starting April 22 . The humanoid was first discovered in 2003 in the remote Atacama desert region of Chile . In the new documentary, a DNA sample from bone marrow extracted from the specimen, was analyzed by scientists at a prestigious American university. They concluded that it was an 'interesting mutation' of a male human that had survived post-birth for between six and eight years. ‘I can say with absolute certainty that it is not a monkey. 'It is human - closer to human than chimpanzees. It lived to the age of six to eight,’ said Garry Nolan, director of stem cell biology at Stanford University's School of Medicine in California. 'Obviously, it was breathing, it was eating, it was metabolizing. 'It calls into question how big the thing might have been when it was born.' The small skeleton bears many of the hallmarks of what we have come to believe ETs look like, in particular a large head overshadowing a small body . ‘The DNA tells the story and we have the computational techniques that allows us to determine, in very short order, whether, in fact, this is human,’ Nolan, who performed the DNA tests, explains in the film. In addition to studying the origins of Ata, Sirius explores the subject of UFO and ET visitation, the disclosure of secret UFO files, and the investigation of advanced energy and propulsion technologies extra-terrestrial civilizations are using to travel to Earth. Based on evidence gathered over the past 20 years by physician and Disclosure Project founder Dr. Steven Greer, Sirius reveals how and why these energy technologies are being suppressed in favor of maintaining the current petrochemical system. Sirius premiered in Los Angeles on Earth Day and will be released online and in select theaters worldwide, starting April 22.

'In light of this incident, the administration has taken the step of re-circulating our guidance ... to make sure people are aware there is an important protocol that should be implemented.' Earnest explained the unlikeliness of a massive outbreak, saying 'The reason for that is that it is not possible to transmit Ebola through the air. ...

"Eric Frein, 31, belonged to a 'military simulation unit' (seen here) whose members play the role of soldiers from eastern Europe . The suspect in last week's fatal ambush outside a rural Pennsylvania State Police barracks belonged to a 'military simulation unit' whose members play the role of soldiers from Cold War eastern Europe. Eric Frein, 31, 'appears to have assumed that role in real life' as he seeks to avoid capture, Lt. Col. George Bivens said. Hundreds of law enforcement officials spent a fifth full day Wednesday looking for the gunman who concealed himself outside the Blooming Grove barracks late Friday and shot two troopers with a rifle, killing one and injuring the second. Frein, named as the suspect after police searching an abandoned Jeep found his driver's license and spent shell casings matching those found at the crime scene, shaved his head recently in a style resembling a Mohawk, Bivens said. 'Investigators believe that this change was made as part of the mental preparation to commit this cowardly act,' he said. Today it was revealed Frein learned to shoot from his father, Eugene Michael Frein, 64, a retired Army major with 28 years of service. He told state police his son was a better marksman than he and someone who 'doesn't miss.' Authorities hunting for Frein chased down several mistaken sightings Wednesday as schools closed down and the public remained on edge. Scroll down for video .

It is not clear when these photos were taken . Law enforcement massed in a forested area to check out one of the latest tips, from workers who said they saw an armed person wearing camouflage, according to Trooper Tom Kelly, a state police spokesman. Police have been 'getting sightings all over the place,' but none have panned out so far, he said. Frein, of Canadensis, is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson, a 38-year-old married father of two, and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. Cpl Byron Dickson Dickson (left) was killed and Trooper Alex Douglass (right) was badly injured in the attack .

Eric Matthew Frein, 31, learned to shoot from his father, Eugene Michael Frein, 64, a retired Army major with 28 years of service . Dickson's viewing was being held Wednesday in Scranton, with his funeral scheduled for Thursday. State police have warned the public that Frein is dangerous, calling him an anti-law enforcement survivalist who has talked about committing mass murder. Two school districts closed Wednesday because of safety concerns for students and staff. Bivens urged residents to remain 'alert and vigilant' and report any suspicious activity they see to 911 or a tip line, and to lock doors and keep house exteriors well lit. But he said he is 'convinced Frein is engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement, particularly the Pennsylvania State Police, and will likely stay focused on that fight.' Frein has nursed an unspecified grudge against law enforcement and government in general at least since 2006, Bivens said. As he has on previous days, Bivens used a news conference Wednesday to address the suspect directly. 'In the event you are listening to this broadcast on a portable radio while cowering in some cold, damp hiding place, I want you to know one thing: Eric, we are coming for you. It is only a matter of time until we bring you to justice for committing this cowardly act,' Bivens said. After opening fire on troopers at the remote barracks in the Pocono Mountains Friday night, Frein evidently tried to make his escape in a 2001 Jeep Cherokee, authorities said. Instead, he drove into a swamp about 2 miles away, where a man walking his dog stumbled across the partly submerged SUV three days later and called 911.

Lt. Craig Gallow of the Schuyler County Sheriff's Department in New York said Mr Frein was wanted for failure to appear in court to face charges of burglary and grand larceny. He said he was forced to seek an arrest warrant for Mr. Frein in March 2005, because he failed to turn himself in. Lt. Gallow said he did not know the outcome of the case.

"Enrique Iglesias' latest music video co-stars some of Galicia's most stunning landmarks but the fee local government paid for their inclusion has hit a raw nerve throughout the country. The Galician regional government paid Universal Music Spain €302,500 (£222,000) to lure the Spanish-American pop icon to the north-west of Spain for the filming of his new track Noche y día (Night and Day), reports thelocal.es. The opening moments appear to be money well spent, with helicopter shots of the Sil Canyon, Cabo Home lighthouse, Lugo's Roman walls and the stunning cathedral of Santiago de Compostela all taking centre stage. Galician officials paid Universal Music Spain €302,500 (£222,000) to get Enrique Iglesias video filmed there . The opening moments of the video feature landmarks including the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela... .. And the Cabo Home Lighthouse, but once the electronic dance track kicks in the video is indoors . Even after the star's name and those of his guest artists, electro Latino act Juan Magan and Puerto Rico's Yandel, are flashed on screen 'Galicia, Espana' gets its moment. But after the moody introduction the obligatory electronic dance track kicks in, the bevvy of beautiful young people multiplies and the sore point comes - the majority of the video to follow, barring the closing moments, is shot as a rave scene inside a beautiful but nondescript monastery. Spanish media say these scenes could have been anywhere and some calculate that less than a fifth of the video features the region - not enough bang for their euro in their view. An article by newspaper 20 minutos was headlined 'Enrique Iglesias y el presunto robo de 300.000€ Gallegos', which translates to 'Enrique Iglesias and the presumed theft of 300,000 Galician euros'. The Sil Canyon also appears in the opening shots but Spanish media say Galicia didn't get value for money . Iglesias' film clip for Noche y día (Night and Day), featuring Juan Magan and Yandel, was filmed in Galicia . Another of the papers, La Voz de Galicia, counts that while 10 recognisable locations are seen in the video they take up a paltry minute of the overall clip's four minutes and 43 seconds. The publication also worries that with the landmarks at the start and end of the clip – with the energetic middle element that also includes a women being oiled-up for a massage, happening mostly indoors – they could be cut out when it's shown on music video programmes. Iglesias' Twitter plugs his new video and its filming location: 'Video of day and night out on February 27. I leave you a ""preview"" of what we record in #Galicia! @xunta . Iglesias appears happy with the result, plugging its February 27 release to his Twitter (right) and Instagram followers, including a hashtag nod to Galicia and linking to the government Twitter profile. its February 27 release to his Twitter (right) and Instagram followers, including a hashtag nod to Galicia and linking to the government Twitter profile.

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke still expects the Qatar World Cup to be switched to autumn or winter. The European Club Association, an umbrella organisation representing the interests of 214 teams from the continent, is set to lobby for the finals to be played in April and May 2022 when a taskforce set up to look at the issue meets on November 3. Dyke met with FIFA president Sepp Blatter recently and believes the sport's most powerful man is certainly of the view that the 2022 finals cannot be held in their traditional June-July slot because of the searing heat in the Gulf state at that time of year. Greg Dyke (above) still expects the 2022 World Cup to be held in November or December in Qatar . Dyke said FIFA president Sepp Blatter (above) experienced the searing heat of Qatar in July for himself . ""Mr Blatter had flown to Qatar straight after the World Cup (in Brazil) so he was there in July and I think he just realised how unbelievably hot it is,"" Dyke told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. ""His view is that we can't possibly hold it in the summer. There seems to be some going back on that now, that we could hold it in the summer after all. ""But I just don't think it's possible and I don't think he thinks it's possible."" Dyke said he felt the finals would ultimately be held in either November-December 2022 or January-February 2023. On Friday, the ECA, which counts 10 English clubs among its membership, told Press Association Sport: ""ECA is indeed considering alternatives to the November/December and January/February proposals. April/May seems to be a possible option. Our official proposal with all details will be presented and discussed at the FIFA Task Force meeting on November 3."" Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani holds the World Cup after Qatar were chosen as hosts of 2022 event . Bringing the event forward to January or February 2022 has been mooted, but a clash with the Winter Olympics presents a potentially insurmountable obstacle. Another alternative, apparently favoured by Blatter, would see the World Cup take place in November and December, when the climate would be more suited to football. But that would represent a huge disruption to many domestic leagues - a prospect that could wreak havoc with European structures - effectively splitting the 2022-23 campaign in two as well as having a knock-on effect to future seasons. Now it seems ECA, formed in 2008 and backed by the power of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St Germain as well as the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and both Manchester clubs, will push for its own vision. An artist impression of the Doha Port stadium, one of 10 Qatar have pledged to build for the 2022 World Cup . May temperatures in Qatar would still be stifling, but unlikely to be significantly higher than those experienced in Mexico (1986), the United States (1994) or Japan and South Korea (2002). The stadium cooling technology that Qatar has long promised will be available and could also come into play in such circumstances. The FIFA taskforce, which consists of a wide span of stakeholders, will receive representations from ECA at its forthcoming meeting and will recommend its preferred dates for the finals to FIFA's executive committee next year.","Greg Dyke said Sepp Blatter feels Qatar too hot for summer World Cup .

"ISIS appears to be stepping up its campaign to attract an international support base after clothing and memorabilia promoting the group appeared online. The sale of Western clothing - including T-shirts, hoodies and baseball caps - bearing the Islamist group's name and slogans is a worrying development in ISIS' growth as a global 'terror brand'. The jihadist group - which has taken control of large areas of Syria and Iraq in a shockingly brutal campaign that has been condemned as too extreme even by Al Qaeda - has previously been described as 'social media savvy' thanks to its widespread use of Twitter to spread propaganda. Controversial: Indonesia-based retailer Zirah Moslem describes itself as a seller of clothing of 'Islamic style', including this pro-ISIS T-shirt. It also sells items promoting other groups, such as Hamas and the Taliban . Brazen: Another image shared online shows ISIS promotional clothing sold openly on hangers in a shop. The photograph was apparently taken in the popular Bagcular area of Turkey's capital Istanbul . ISIS is in almost constant contact with its supporters in the West thanks to dozens of social media accounts maintained by militants fighting in Syria and Iraq. Now those following the updates are being encouraged to show their loyalty to the group by purchasing clothing adorned with slogans and images promoting ISIS' militant Islamist message. Much of the jihadist clothing is sold on Indonesia-based websites, and appears to have been available to purchase for several months, according to Vocativ. One online retailer, Zirah Moslem, has over 9,000 likes on Facebook and is in regular contact with the users of its page, who place orders by posting messages beneath photographs of the clothing while making no effort to conceal their identities. Support: The sale of Western clothing - including T-shirts, hoodies and baseball caps - bearing the Islamist group's name and slogans is a worrying development in ISIS' growth as a global 'terror brand' Cynical: One of the Indonesia-based websites selling Islamist clothing also offers cuddly toys of Isis fighters.

Murdoch: 'The Daily was a bold experiment in digital publishing' The Daily, Rupert Murdoch’s struggling iPad-only newspaper, is to close after less than two years in the latest costly Internet disaster for the media tycoon. News Corporation said that the paper would publish its last edition on December 15 with staff redundancies expected. According to the New York Times, The Daily was losing around $30m a year, meaning that over its two year lifespan it will have cost Murdoch at least $60million. Scroll down for video . Short lifespan: CEO Rupert Murdoch sits on stage with The Daily editor Jesse Angelo, right, and Eddy Cue, VP of Internet Services at Apple, for the launch of his new online newspaper on February 2, 2011 . Its editor Jesse Angelo will become . the publisher of the New York Post, which is also owned by the company, . with some journalists moving to the paper too. The closure will be a huge embarrassment to Murdoch, for whom The Daily was one of his pet projects. In a statement, he admitted the paper did not get enough readers and it was hemorrhaging money from the off too. In . its second quarter in business, The Daily reported losses of $10 . million and just four months ago it shed a third of its staff - around . 50 employees.

Critics said that even though it was the first iPad-only newspaper in the world, it would not work in a world where consumers expected their news on the Internet for free. Subscriptions for The Daily were 99c per week or $39.99 annually. The announcement about The Daily was slipped out in a press release detailing the new structure of News Corps as it's splits into two. It includes the appointment of Wall Street Journal editor Robert Thomson to the post of CEO of News Corp’s new publishing arm. The new entity was set up in the wake of . the phone hacking scandal in which journalists working for the now . shuttered British tabloid the News of the World, which was owned by News .

In a statement, News Corporation said that The Daily brand would live on in ‘other channels’ but did not elaborate. Murdoch said: ‘From its launch, The Daily was a bold experiment in digital publishing and an amazing vehicle for innovation. ‘Unfortunately, our experience was that we could not find a large enough audience quickly enough to convince us the business model was sustainable in the long-term.’ Murdoch has yet to make any further comment on his Twitter feed but the closure of The Daily is another chapter in his inglorious history when it comes to forays in the Internet. He bought MySpace, the social networking site for $580m and sold it just six years later for $35m having admitted that he ‘screwed up’ with the purchase.

"People off sick for more than four weeks could face a fitness-to-work test under a new crackdown on the ‘sick-note culture’. Family doctors would no longer authorise long absences from work, under new government plans reported in The Times. Instead they would pass their patients on for assessment by a private occupational health firm, it is understood. But asking GPs to refer the long-term sick for fitness-to work tests will reduce them to an 'arm of the benefits system', doctors have warned. British workers who are off sick for more than four weeks could face a fit-to-work test, which has already been piloted in 20 GP surgeries across the UK  and is set to be rolled out nationwide (file picture) More than one million people take sick leave for more than one month each year - costing the economy more than £9billion. The programme of fit-to-work tests has been piloted in 20 GP surgeries since last month, through the company Health Management and is set to be rolled out nationwide in the coming months. Patients must agree to be referred to the company and would face an in-depth assessment of their physical and mental abilities. Those deemed fit for work would be given access to a range of treatment such as physiotherapy, counselling or help to manage debt and workplace bullying while they try to get back into a job. While the plans were welcomed by businesses who lose out from long-term sick leave, doctors have indicated they will strongly oppose them if they are compulsory. Lord Freud, the welfare minister told the newspaper that the scheme would help to cut the cost of sick pay and benefits. He said: ‘The introduction of the Fit for Work services is an important step in supporting employees, GPs, and employers to manage sickness absence better. ‘Providing support where it’s needed most will help to reduce the amount of time employees take off sick, which in turn will cut sick pay costs, improve economic output, and reduce the chances of people falling out of work and having to claim benefits.’ Welfare minister Lord Freud (pictured) said the test would help to cut the cost of sick pay and benefits and could help employers manage sickness better . Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'Enabling people to return to work is good for their long-term health. 'However, many patients require active support to be able to return to work. It must not become the job of GPs to police who is and who is not entitled to welfare support.' The British Medical Association, who have been in negotiations with ministers over the scheme, said it would boycott the plans if they forced people back into work. Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the BMA’s GP committee warned minister against bowing to ‘political pressure’ to be punitive. Dr Vautrey said it was ‘a myth’ that thousands of patients were gaming the system. He said: ‘If GPs feel that this is a helpful and supportive service with occupational advisers who are very much on the side of the patient and doing their best, then GPs will support it. ‘If they feel it’s somehow a punitive or lip-service arrangement without any meaningful support, or is seen as an arm of the benefits system to effectively drive people off benefits, then GPs will very quickly disengage.’ David Cameron warned three years ago that a sicknote culture in the workplace is acting as a ‘conveyor belt to a life on benefits’. He said at least one in five of the 300,000 people absent on long term sick leave should either have not been signed off in the first place or could go back to work. The Prime Minister said it was frustrating for GPs as well as business as doctors ‘want to focus on making people better, not spend their time policing the benefit system.’ The programme, if rolled out, stands to receive up to £34 million a year in a payment-by-results scheme. Lena Levy, the CBI’s head of labour market policy, said the medical profession and businesses needed to work together on long term sick leave. She said the CBI had previously called on the government ‘to encourage GPs to consider the service as a default option for those absent for four weeks or more and look towards mandating this in the future.’","British workers off sick for more than four weeks could face fit-to-work test .

"Dozens of debutantes from around the world turned out in their best outfits for a Russian ball to revive the tradition of holding the lavish events abroad. About 1,000 people gathered for the ball in London last night, which saw a surprise performance by the Bolshoi ballet. Guests who paid up to £790 a ticket for the prestigious event were treated to performances from Russian opera singers and orchestras while debutantes danced the Waltz in impressive flowing gowns. Scroll down for video . More than 100 debutantes took part in the Russian ball on Sunday evening, to revive the tradition of holding the dances abroad . The event aimed to recreate the lavish balls of Tsarist Russia that have previously been held abroad, marking the 'coming out' of young debutantes and giving them the opportunity to meet potential suitors. Sixty couples with Russian heritage opened the ball - including 25 from the UK who competed for the places earlier this year. Applicants had intereviews where they were judged on their knowledge of foreign languages, literature, history and art. Russian debutantes were required to be able to dance the waltz, while for the English attendees classes were held throughout the summer to ensure they perfected their steps for the main event. Other debutantes at the ball came from America, Georgia, Malta and Estonia, and all danced the Waltz of the Flowers from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker. Venera Gimadieva, a soprano who sang at Glyndebourne Opera Festival this season and has previously appeared at the Proms, and Vasily Ladyuk, Russia's number one baritone, performed at the event held at Old Billingsgate Hall in London. The Russian Virtuosi of Europe chamber orchestra, conducted by Felix Korobov, as well as the Vienna State Ballet also appeared at the ball. Debutantes have spent months preparing their dance moves and their dresses for the Russian ball, held in London last night . A total of 120 debutantes from Russia, the UK, America, Estonia and Malta were at the event where tickets cost as much as £790 . Couples dance at the Russian ball, the second to be held in London, after the inaugural event was hosted at the Royal Albert Hall in 2013 . Among the attendees were Olga Kostyantynivna Kurylenko, a French actress, and Russian princess Olga Andreevna Romanoff, a descendant of the House of Romanov. Dances included the Russian quadrille, Polonaise​, Viennese waltz, cha-cha-cha and rumba. Debutante balls have been seen throughout history as a rite of passage for young upper class women. The tradition of the debutante ball was first introduced by King George III in 1780 as Queen Charlotte's Ball to celebrate his wife's birthday. Up until 1958, young debutantes used to be presented to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, until Prince Philip pointed out that it was 'bloody daft'.

Organisers tried to revive the tradition with last night's ball in Old Billingsgate Hall, London . Princess Olga Andreveena Romanoff, a descendant of the House of Romanov (left in blue) was at the event where attendees spent thousands on immaculate white dresses, as well as some more extravagant outfits (right) for the ball held on Sunday evening in London . The debutante ball started with a performance by The Russian Virtuosi of Europe chamber orchestra before the couples danced . Debutantes at the ball have spent months perfecting their outfits and dance techniques for the anticipated Russian Ball in London . Princess Olga Romanoff agreed to be patron of the event and said: 'I would like to believe that the Russian Ball will become a good tradition, and the bringing together of cultures will continue despite everything that is happening in the world.' Girls taking part in the Russian ball had to be at least 16 and no older than 25. They also had to be single and either employed or studying at University. Men were required to be no older than 28. Dr Elisabeth Smagin-Melloni, one of the organisers, said: 'My mission is to bring together people from different cultures and give them the opportunity to form lasting bonds through their appreciation and enjoyment of music and the performing arts.' Girls at the event stuck with the debutante tradition and wore white. But the event was not as strict as the Viennese Debutante Ball, held earlier this month, where all wore matching white gowns and lace gloves. This ball is one of the most highly anticipated in the social calendar in Rome. The inaugural Russian ball was held at the Royal Albert Hall last December, where the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Prima Ballerina of the Bolshoi Theatre, Evgenia Obraztsova, performed.","Sixty debutantes from Russia, America, Malta and the UK opened the Russian debutante ball in London last night .

"From winking about a 67-year-old sex worker to bringing back the budgie smugglers - it's been a bumpy year for Tony Abbott. The Prime Minister will mark his first 12 months in office this Sunday on Father's Day. And while it will be a cause for celebration, it also presents the opportunity to reflect on some of Mr Abbott's more memorable missteps since last year's federal election. Scroll down for video . How time flies! It's 12 months since Tony Abbott took the top job and he's been busy putting out fires at home and abroad . September 7, 2013. Tony Abbott prepares to deliver his victory speech before the party faithful . Perhaps appropriately Mr Abbott finds himself overseas at the moment, in India, for he has been lauded for his handling of some international affairs - particularly the tough stance taken with Russia over the MH17 tragedy and most recently the humanitarian involvement in northern Iraq. But the former rugby union prop has also been guilty of dropping the ball at home and abroad. The list of faux pas ranges from winking when, during a radio interview, a pensioner told him she had to work on a sex line, to effectively telling the Scots to pull their heads in, as they seek independence. And yes, there was that rather awkward impromptu interview on morning television, in all his budgie smuggling glory. But it was when he took to the air-waves to discuss Budget matters with Gloria the Grandmother, where the Prime Minister was truly exposed. The eyes have it. One wink is all it took for the PM to be dragged into a public relations disaster when he seemed to make light of Gloria the Grandmother's predicament . She told how the planned $7 GP co-payment and increased cost of medication would leave her out of pocket up to $850 a year. 'I would like to ask you if you'd like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation,' she said. 'I'm a 67-year-old pensioner with three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life-threatening. 'I'm just surviving on around $400 a fortnight once I pay my rent and I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. That's the only way I can do it.' It's what Mr Abbott did on hearing Gloria's phone sex admission that put his public standing in a spin - the Prime Minister clearly winking at radio show host Jon Faine. Mr Abbott has not only butted heads with battlers but the big names have also taken a shot at him. The claim he made a few years ago that climate change was 'absolute crap' has come back to haunt him on an global scale. English actress Emma Thompson had a very clear message for the Australian Prime Minister on climate change, as she travelled through the Arctic as part of a Greenpeace campaign . British actress Emma Thompson slammed the PM for failing to act on climate change while travelling through the Arctic as part of a Greenpeace campaign. The Oscar winner appeared in a photograph on a Greenpeace ship near the Smeerenburg glacier, holding a sign which read: 'Tony Abbott climate change is REAL I'm standing on it!' A second photograph featuring the 55-year-old, saw her holding a second sign with the words: 'Where I stand should be ice'. Ahead of becoming prime minister, Mr Abbott had been prone to the most notably shrugging off the death of Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney in Afghanistan by suggesting to soldiers 's*** happens' and pointing out the 'sex appeal' of female candidates. A noted monarchist, the PM won few friends in Scotland last month when he said: 'As a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it's hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent Scotland'. The pro-independence Scots were having none of it, ahead of their September 18 poll. 'Tony Abbott has a reputation for gaffes, but his bewildering comments have all the hallmarks of one of the Westminster government's international briefings against Scotland, a spokesman for Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said. 'Many Australians, including the great number with close Scottish connections, will look on in bafflement at these remarks - Australia is a country that has gained its independence from Westminster and has never looked back.' At least his Canadian gaffe was little more than an embarrassing slip of the tongue. At an Ottawa media conference he said: 'They're very forthright remarks, and I think that they're perfectly appropriate remarks for the Canadian Prime Minister to make. Canadia, Canada, probably has more involvement in the affairs of Europe than Australia often does.' 'Tony Abbott has a reputation for gaffes', so said the Scots when the PM bought into their push for independence . The relationship with Indonesia was strained, to say the least, when it was revealed Australian spy agencies had spied on that country's president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. When details were revealed of how his mobile phone had been tapped by officers, Mr Abbott's reply was not as conciliatory as Indonesia had hoped. 'Australia should not be expected to apologise for the steps we take to protect our country now, or in the past, any more than other governments should be expected to apologise for the similar steps they have taken,' Mr Abbott said. 'Importantly, in Australia's case, we use all our resources including information to help our friends and allies, not to harm them.' He went on to say that the surveillance was 'reasonable'. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono made his protests known on Twitter . SBY sought a clear public response from his Australian counterpart . The Indonesian President was clearly very unimpressed by Tony Abbott's 'belittling' of the spy scandal . On the home front, Mr Abbott struggled to keep the nation's indigenous leaders on-side during a recent speech, by repeatedly stating that the arrival of the First Fleet 'was the defining moment in the history of this continent'. 'It was the moment this continent became part of the modern world. It determined our language, our law and our fundamental values. Yes, it did dispossess and for a long time marginalise Indigenous people,' Mr Abbott said. 'As Noel Pearson frequently reminds us, modern Australia has an important Indigenous and multicultural character. Still it's British settlement that has most profoundly shaped the country that we are.' But Warren Mundine, chairman of the Prime Minister's own Indigenous Advisory Council, fired back that white settlement was in fact 'a disastrous defining moment for indigenous people'. Matilda House, head of the Stolen Generation Council for NSW, also disapproved. 'I can't fathom how a ship or a boat sailed into Sydney Harbour can overtake the 60,000 years before.' But it was when the Prime Minister tried to tackle the issue of home-grown terrorist sympathisers, with a call to arms under the 'Team Australia' banner, that social media went into meltdown. 'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia,' Mr Abbott implored. 'Everyone has got to put this country, its interest and its values and its people first.' Twitter exploded into action once the PM had made the 'Team Australia' remark . Plenty of tweets provided novel ideas of just who, instead of Tony Abbott, should lead 'Team Australia' The 'Team Australia' call was the source of countless satirical tweets . Australians will no longer have the 'right to be a bigot'. This was a back-flip which backfired, as the Abbott government dropped from its controversial plan to overhaul the Racial Discrimination Act. The backlash from ethnic community leaders and from within his own party led to the PM and his Attorney-General George Brandis admitting defeat on the so-called 'Bolt Laws'. Almost overnight he went from being seen as too hard to being too soft. Back-flip on the 'right to be a bigot' laws.

There's been a few wrong turns. Mr Abbott chats with Treasurer Joe Hockey in the House of Representatives. Mr Hockey has had a trying 12 months too, including the infamous 'poor people don't drive' gaffe, comments which the PM quickly distanced himself from . Perhaps just as damaging within the party room was the Melbourne trip scandal, which led Bill Shorten to claim the PM was 'not fit to govern'. The Prime Minister was alleged to have told party colleagues the reason he was late to a meeting was that he had organised a last-minute trip to a cancer clinic to 'justify billing taxpayers' for the trip. And one other broken pre-election promise which hasn't gone unnoticed was his pledge not to be caught swanning around in his Speedos. But there here was in his favourite swimwear, fresh out of the surf and fending off questions, in the most awkward of breakfast television interviews. The noted fitness fanatic, insisted in a radio interview that he had the necessary energy levels for the top job. Mr Abbott visited a cancer clinic during a trip to Melbourne last month amid accusations he told party room colleagues that it was organised so he could 'justify billing taxpayers' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten claimed that Tony Abbott was 'not fit to govern' in the wake of the revelations regarding his Melbourne trip . 'I’m lucky in that I’ve got quite a bit of stamina, I don’t need more than six hours sleep a night,' he said. 'I can bound out of bed at five o’clock in the morning, I find I can go through the day 'til about ten o’clock pretty comfortably.' The Opposition pounced, arguing that a Prime Minister who doesn't realise that 10am to 5pm is actually seven hours, can't be trusted to balance the books.

"A woman broke down in tears in a West Virginia court after being found not guilty in her father-in-law's murder trial in what prosecutors claimed was a drug-related robbery gone wrong. Rebecca Hatcher was suspected of killing Thomas Hatcher, her husband's father and the former mayor of their town of War, West Virginia who she lived with at the time of his death. In the trial, witnesses described the acrimonious relationship between the two and said that the 72-year-old would lock his bedroom at night so that he wouldn't be robbed in his sleep. 'I would never hurt him,' Rebecca said during her time on the stand. Overjoyed: Rebecca Hatcher, 32, was found not guilty of murdering her father-in-law . Emotional: Hatcher, 32, is not done with her legal drama as a mistrial has been filed regarding her charge of conspiracy (seen here on Wednesday) The Hatcher family has faced some problems in the past as a result of the mayor's son's drug addiction, which Tom Hatcher opened up about in an interview with Playboy just months before his death. In the article, he revealed that Rebecca, . Tom's son John Hatcher and their then-11-year-old son lived in a spare . room in the Mayor's house and he made the decision to lock his door at . night because John had previously stolen money to buy prescription . pills. Helping: Mayor Thomas Hatcher had his drug addict son and his wife and child living with him in his home at the time that he was found dead . 'I hate living like this. I hate being an addict, but I can't shake it,' John told the interviewer. John went to rehab four times at different programs. His name was never mentioned during the trial and is currently in prison on an unrelated charge. Local station WVNSTV reports that the 32-year-old woman was found not guilty of first degree murder, but the case does not close there as the judge declared a mistrial in the conspiracy charge against her. Her brother, Earl Click, is suspected of being involved with the mayor's death and will be tried for first degree murder as well but not until next year. A lack of evidence undoubtedly helped Ms Hatcher's case, as she claimed she was out of town on the night of her father-in-law's murder. The prosecution had nothing to prove her claim false. 'The only person that had access to his bedroom because unbeknownst to him she had gotten the key is the defendant, Becky,' county prosecutor Edward Kornish said in the trial. Their would-be smoking gun came from . the discovery of a plastic bag in the elderly man's bedroom which the . prosecutor claims the alleged suspects used to suffocate him. The mayor's cause of death has not been reported. Rebecca's . defense attorney said that the fact that the bag was in the room should . be used as a point in her favor, not against her. Suspects: Rebecca Hatcher (left) has now been found not guilty of murder but her brother Earl Click (right) faces his own trial for the same charge in January . Remote: War, West Virginia only has 862 residents and the surrounding area is one of the areas in the country hardest-hit by prescription drug abuse . 'Why'd they leave the bag behind?' lawyer Keith Flinchurn said. 'The one item that is supposed to have smothered and killed Tom Hatcher... they leave it behind.' The small town of War, made up of only 862 people and located in the southern part of the state by the Virginia and Kentucky borders, was rocked by Mr Hatcher's death. Though Rebecca, who is known in the area as Becky, has been cleared of the murder charge, commentors on the case see it as a judicial mistake. 'What a SHAME! This is not justice. What is wrong with the State's Prosecution?' wrote one unidentified reader of the local NBC affiliate. 'This . should have been an open and shut case-guilty. It is no secret that she . wished Tom to die. How many times did Becky instigate arguments with . him? She often referred to Tom as ""old hateful"" or ""walking death."" Unusual circumstances: Rebecca, her 11-year-old son and husband were all living in her father-in-law's house because of her husband John's drug addiction . 'Tom tried to give Becky a chance at a decent life and the opportunity to be a mother to her son as well as a home to live in. Instead, Becky chose to throw all that away for a life of drugs and thievery. She was an ungrateful, narcissistic virago towards Tom.' Another commentor who used the username of 'candice' suggested the 12-person jury was prejudicial. 'This trial should have been moved out of the state, for a fair trial to have been given,' the person wrote. 'Even without all of the overwhelming evidence against her, there are so many testimonies against her, that should have been enough alone to convict her!'","Rebecca Hatcher, 32, was accused of killing her father-in-law .

"Superbrain: The Victorian naturalist Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionised understanding of life . It was an era of glorious scientific discovery. And the reason for the Victorians unprecedented success is simple – they were ‘substantially cleverer’ than us. Researchers compared reaction times - a reliable indicator of general intelligence – since the late 1800s to the present day and found our fleetness of mind is diminishing. They claim our slowing reflexes . suggest we are less smart than our ancestors, with a loss of 1.23 IQ points . per decade or 14 IQ points since Victorian times. While . an average man in 1889 had a reaction time of 183 milliseconds, this . has slowed to 253ms in 2004. They found the same case with women, whose . speed deteriorated from 188 to 261ms in the same period. The . research team from Umea University, Sweden, the University of Amsterdam . and University College Cork said IQ scores are excellent predictors of . job performance and those with higher intelligence are both more . productive and creative. But . the scientists were unable to directly compare IQ from different eras . as earlier generations had limited access to education, improved . nutrition and hygiene, which would have boosted modern results. Instead, . they compared reaction times, which they claim ‘can be used to . meaningfully compare historical and contemporary populations in terms of . levels of general intelligence’. The . figures indicate a decline in brainpower since the Victorian era, which . contradicts the so-called Flynn effect, which has found a worldwide . increase in measured IQ scores of three points a decade since the Second World War. Researcher Dr Michael Woodley said: ‘They actually indicate a pronounced decline in IQ since the Victorian era, three times bigger than previous theoretical estimates would have us believe.’ Michael Faraday, left, the physicist who discovered the laws of electrolysis and electromagnetic induction. Right, Charles Babbage, who invented the his analytic engine, the precursor to the modern computer, in 1837 . The report in the journal Intelligence found: ‘The Victorian era was characterized by great accomplishments. As great accomplishment is generally a product of high intelligence, we tested the hypothesis that the Victorians were actually cleverer than modern populations. ‘We used a robust elementary cognitive indicator of general intelligence, namely measures of simple reaction times.’ And with the research looking at historical reaction time data, the scientists claim the drop in modern IQ could be even more dramatic than predicted.

"A man convicted of stabbing to death a suburban Chicago high school freshman during a 2011 burglary of her home was sentenced Friday to 160 years in prison. Career criminal John Wilson Jr, 41, learned his fate today after a hearing during which the mother of 14-year-old Kelli O'Laughlin testified. Prosecutors contended the teenager was killed in her Indian Head Park home when she interrupted Wilson ransacking the residence. Justice for Kelli: John Wilson Jr, 41 (left), has been sentenced to 160 years in the stabbing death of 14-year-0-old Kelli O'Laughlin (right) during a 2011 home invasion . Crime scene: The deadly incident at 6309 Keokuk Road, pictured, came after summer burglaries in the area in which a suspect used Google to target homes . Brenda O'Laughlin testified she wished she'd been the one who walked into the house that day ‘to see that evil killer.’ 'I cannot even begin to imagine or endure her last moments of life with that evil man,' the mother said in court. 'Kelli was a true innocent victim. What physical threat could she have been?' After stabbing the girl, Wilson sent the mother taunting texts from the girl's cellphone. When questioned by the judge, Wilson said he didn't know why he was in court and ‘the voices in me told me not to talk to you.’ During the sentencing, Judge John Hynes called the girl's murder 'a crime that shocked the conscience of the community.' The prosecution argued that Wilson, a 38-year-old parolee with a lengthy criminal history, used a landscaping rock wrapped in a red knit cap to smash a window and break into the O'Laughlin's $500,000 house. They claim Kelli surprised Wilson in the family room during the break-in when she got home from school about 3.40pm on October 27, 2011. Satisfied: Kalli's parents, john and Brenda O'Laughlin, told reporters after the sentencing they were glad Wilson will never be able to harm another child again . Wilson grabbed an eight inch carving knife from a butcher's block and stabbed Kelli in the neck, back and chest. One of the wounds pierced her aorta. He then dragged her lifeless body from the family room into the kitchen, before ransacking the home. Wilson fled with a bowl of coins, an iPod Touch and Kelli's phone. Prosecutors said he caught a cab home and used the coins to pay for the fare. When Brenda O'Laughlin came home from work at around 5.30pm that day, she discovered her daughter in the kitchen lying face down in a pool of blood. Kelli died in a hospital that night, but at about 11.30am the next day Brenda started receiving disturbing text messages from her daughter's stolen smart phone. One of the texts read: 'She wanted to tell you something before I killed her.' Innocent: The high school freshman was found by her mother in the kitchen lying face down in a pool of blood after being stabbed in the chest, neck and back . Wilson was arrested on November 2. DNA evidence recovered from the knit cap matched Wilson's, and three witnesses also identified him from a police line-up. In court Friday, Wilson sat stone-faced and even pretended to be asleep during the hearing, except to taunt the victim's mother after she delivered her impact statement, ABC 7 Chicago reported. 'We was in a relationship, Bren. What happened? Are you serious?' he said with a grin. Speaking to the media outside the courtroom, John O'Laughlin said he was glad the case was over. 'One hundred sixty years doesn't seem like long enough, but it's the maximum,' said the grieving father. Kelli's mother told reporters that she was satisfied with the overall outcome of the trial . 'Justice will never be done because Kelli’s never coming home,' Brenda O’Laughlin said. 'But, as far as the sentencing, I am very pleased with it because he will never be out on the streets again to harm another child.' The family are now planning to focus their attention on Kelli's charitable foundation. : .","John Wilson Jr, 41, was convicted in September of murdering Kelli O'Laughlin, 14, on October 27, 2011 .

"Luke 'Sasha' Fleischman, the 'agender' teenager who was set on fire in an alleged hate crime on an LA bus . An 'agender' teenager set on fire by another boy on a bus in Los Angeles is allegedly thought to have been the victim of a 'hate crime.' Luke ‘Sasha’ Fleischman, 18 - who does not identify as a man or woman but rather as ‘agender’ - was set on fire on an AC Transit bus in Oakland by another teenager on Monday. Thousands of dollars have already been raised for a fund, set up in the victims hometown, to pay for his treatment for second and third degree burns, according to local sources. The Maybeck High School student is expected to need several surgeries, including skin grafts, and months of recovery time. Police say they used surveillance video to track down the 16-year old accused of the attack to Oakland High School.  He is now in custody and has been charged with the crime. The suspect, who has not been named, is alleged  to have used a lighter to set fire to Fleischman’s skirt. ‘This is extremely disturbing,’ said Oakland police spokeswoman Johnna Watson. ‘This is a horrific crime: a human being set another human being on fire. I mean, that’s senseless and horrible.' Investigators are still looking for a motive in the incident, including the possibility it is a hate crime. Luke 'Sascha' Fleischman was set on fire on a Los Angeles bus as it travelled through the city . ‘This could happen anywhere to anyone, unfortunately it happened to our victim,’ said Johnna Watson. By Wednesday morning backers at raised more than $8,300 towards their $18,000 goal to pay for the teenager's treatment at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, according to Kron4 News. The incident happened  when the victim was asleep in the rear of an Alameda-Contra Costa Transit bus in Oakland, shortly after 5 p.m on Monday. Fleischman woke up with his clothing was on fire and tried to put it out himself. Other passengers came to his aid but he suffered severe burns to his legs. Once the bus driver realized what happened, he stopped the bus and called for assistance but the suspect fled the scene before police arrived. The Helping Sasha Have a Speedy Recovery fund is aiming to raise over $20,000 dollars for the teenager.","High school student,18, will need skin grafts and months of treatment .

"An Egyptian court has condemned the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and 682 of his supporters to death, a year after the Islamist group was ousted from power in a military coup. Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's general guide, and his fellow defendants faced charges over an attack on a police station in Minya in 2013 in which a policeman was killed. If confirmed by Egypt's Grand Mufti, it would make him the most senior Brotherhood figure sentenced to death . since one of the group's leading ideologues, Sayed Qutb, was sentenced . and executed in 1966. The decision sparked hysteria outside the court as several women fainted upon hearing news of the verdicts, while others wailed: 'Why? This is unfair!' But after sentencing Badie and his followers, the judge then overturned the death penalties of another 492 Muslim Brotherhood members, jailing them for life instead. Scroll down for video . Grief: The decision sparked hysteria outside the court as several relatives fainted upon hearing news of the verdicts . Overcome: Egyptian women overcome by emotion fall to the ground after a judge sentenced to death more than 680 alleged supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood . Appeal: Death sentence recommendations in the case involving Badie will now be passed on to Egypt's Mufti, the highest religious authority. His opinion, however, is not legally binding and can be ignored by the court . They were among 529 men sentenced to death in March in one of a series of mass trials that have been widely . condemned by human rights campaigners in and out of the country. The . other 37 convicts from those proceedings were told they would remain on . death row. In . announcing the 683 death sentences for violence and the killing of . policemen, Judge Said Youssef also said he was referring his . ruling to the Grand Mufti, the nation's top Islamic official - a . requirement under Egyptian law, but one that is considered a formality. It does, however, give a window of opportunity for a judge to reverse an . initial sentence. Both . Monday's and the March trial are linked to deadly riots that erupted in . Minya and elsewhere in Egypt after security forces violently disbanded . sit-ins held by Brotherhood supporters in Cairo last August. Three . policemen and a civilian were killed in those riots. Hundreds . were killed as part of a sweeping campaign against supporters of former . President Mohammed Morsi, ousted by the military last July. The removal . of Morsi - a year after he was elected - came after millions . demonstrated against his rule, demanding he step down for abuse of . power. Egypt's interim, military-backed government has branded the Brotherhood a terrorist group, a claim it denies. Some 16,000 people have been arrested since the military ousted Morsi last July, including most of the group's top leaders. Large numbers of pro-Morsi protesters have also been rounded up and detained by police. Fear: The biggest trials in Egypt's modern history have reinforced fears among human rights groups that the military-backed government and anti-Islamist judges are bent on crushing dissent . Anger: There were hundreds of supporters of the defendants outside court who reacted angrily at news of their family-members' fate . After Monday's . ruling, which followed a single session in the case held last month, . Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Human Rights Watch's . Middle East and North Africa Division, said the defendants were not . given the chance to properly defend themselves. The proceedings went on . without the judge even verifying that the defendants were present, she . said. 'The fact that the death sentences can . be appealed provides little solace to hundreds of families that will go . to sleep tonight facing the very real prospect that their loves ones . could be executed without having an opportunity to present a case in . court,' she said. 'There is no more serious violation of the most basic . right of due process and the right to a fair trial than that.' According to a judicial official who . oversaw the investigation in the case, evidence presented in the trial . consisted mostly of footage of the defendants showing them attacking and . looting a police station in Cairo and setting fire to several . government buildings. The defendants faced nearly 14 charges, five of . them punishable by death, said the official. 'This . is a public opinion case, there must be a swift, deterrent punishment,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was . not authorized to talk to the media. 'Yes, the verdict is very harsh, . the number of people on trial is shocking, but it's proportional to the . crimes.' Badie . was not at the hearing in Minya but in another court, in . Cairo, where he faces charges of murder and incitement to murder along . with 16 other Brotherhood leaders in a case connected to deadly protests . outside the group's headquarters last June. Pain: A woman weeps after learning that her relative will be put to death . On guard: Egyptian policemen stand guard outside the court. Once the Mufti reviews Monday's ruling, the same court will hold another session on June 21 to issue the final verdicts . Wives, sisters, mothers and children of the 683 men sentenced to death cried, shouted and collapsed into each other's arms . Once the Mufti reviews Monday's ruling, the same court will hold another session on June 21 to issue the final verdicts. As . the ruling was announced, an outcry erupted outside the court among the . families and relatives of the defendants. 'My three sons are inside,' said a woman who only gave her first name, Samiya, as she screamed in . grief. 'I have no one but God.' Sitting . on the pavement in front of the police cordon, 58-year-old Fatma, who . also would not give her second name fearing for her relative on trial, . broke into tears and screamed: 'This judge is a butcher.' The father of another defendant, Mohammed Hassan Shehata, said his son Mahmoud was arrested in January, six months after the alleged violence he was charged with. 'There is no evidence whatsoever,' he said. 'If my son is guilty, behead him but if he is innocent, there will be a civil war.' Another woman who also only gave her first name, Safiya, 48, could not believe her brother and son were sentenced to death. 'I swear, they don't even pray, they don't go to mosques,' she said. 'They are not Muslim Brotherhood.' Condemned to death: Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood's general guide, and his fellow 682 defendants faced charges over an attack on a police station in Minya in 2013 in which a policeman was killed . Pleading: A relative pleads with police upon hearing of the verdicts outside court .

I make games because it’s fun. ‘I don’t make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits. I can’t be responsible for something this big. It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.’ Mojang confirmed the studio’s three founders would all be leaving as a result of the purchase.

Minecraft has been dubbed ‘digital Lego’ for its retro building blocks graphics and cult following. Since the launch five years ago, it has become a global phenomenon. It is mainly played by boys aged from seven on formats from laptops, iPhones, iPads, Xboxes or PlayStations. They can join friends in tasks online but there are no winners and no prizes. Players collect resources – without extra cost – including wood, stone, coal and iron to build a hut, a house, a castle, a city and even an entire civilisation. They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Everything is assembled one block at a time. Fans have speculated that it is called Minecraft because you have to mine materials and craft them into new objects. According to psychologists, it could actually be good for development. Dr Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, says the game requires children to collaborate on building projects, it fosters teamwork skills.

"A Minnesota farmer turned the snow that was ruining his greenhouses this winter into a spectacular 50-foot snowman that is now attracting national media attention and visitors from miles around. Greg Novak knew he had to clean up the nuisance snow, but he also thought it would be a great way to perk up his Gilman community deep in the winter doldrums. Hundreds of hours and about five weeks later, people began flocking to Novak's farm as news of his impressive creation filled up newsfeeds, inboxes and social media across the web. Scroll down for video . Impressive: Greg Novak stands next to the giant 50-foot snowman he created on his farm in Gilman, Minnesota . Practical solution? Novak decided to build the snowman he's dubbed Granddaddy after heavy Minnesota snows inundated his greenhouses . Popular: People eager to gawk at the snowman have flocked to the little central Minnesota town and a media frenzy has erupted around Novak's farm . 'As long as you're moving it, might as well do something practical with it,' Novak remembers thinking. Though anyone could debate the usefulness of a 50-foot snowman, the longtime farmer at least took to building the sculpture in a practical way. Friends and family pitched in to help with Granddaddy, or to do farm chores while Novak worked on building the snowman using a skid loaders to pile snow and a silage blower to direct snow into stacked cylinders, the St. Cloud Times reported. After the arduous but enjoyable labor of love, Granddaddy clocked in at an impressive 50 feet and people immediately took notice. Gerald and Diane Harbarth were among the amused onlookers this past Sunday. They drove more than 70 miles from Brownton to get a look at the mammoth snowman. 'This is unreal,' Gerald Harbarth told the Saint Cloud Times. The Harbarths learned about Granddaddy on a television news report, . but craning their necks to see it in person was something else entirely. Novak . took a break from the Minnesota snow with a vacation to Las Vegas, . where he said he's even been contacted by the BBC and the Discovery . Channel. Novak told the St. Cloud Times that he's looking forward to flipping through the guestbook . when he returns home to see how far people have come to gawk at . Granddaddy. Heavy duty: Novak had help from friends and family. They used heavy machinery including this loader and even a silo conveyer belt to move the snow into giant plastic ring forms . Larger than life: Since a carrot just wouldn't do, Novak used a trash barrel for a nose . For Novak, that was the whole point of creating Granddaddy. 'It puts a smile on people's faces,' Novak said.

"A man has been arrested after claiming he had a bomb on board a Ryanair flight from Krakow, Poland, to Shannon, Ireland. The plane was just north of Dresden on Monday night when the pilot and crew decided the only option was to make an emergency landing after the 33-year-old allegedly made several comments about having a bomb. Flight FR-3326 landed at Berlin Schönefeld airport in Germany, where the man was arrested and is in the custody of the German Police. A Ryanair flight was forced into an emergency at Berlin Schönefeld airport landing after a man claimed to have bombs on board (File Photo) After the passengers had disembarked the plane, a full search was carried out by the police and special forces, but no bomb was found. The search lasted several hours, meaning the Boeing 737-800 didn't land at Shannon until 5am yesterday morning, five hours behind schedule. Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: 'This flight from Krakow to Shannon diverted to Berlin following a hoax security alert. 'Customers disembarked while the aircraft was inspected by police, who detained one individual, before the aircraft was cleared to depart for Shannon. The plane was forced into an emergency landing at Berlin Schönefeld airport in Germany . 'Ryanair sincerely apologised to all customers affected by this delay to their journey, however the safety of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. 'This is now a matter for German police.'","Flight FR-3326 was en-route to Shannon Airport from Krakow, Poland .

"It's the bane of cyclists around the world, but now the hassle of a puncture could be about to become history. A bike tyre that never gets a puncture because it is devoid of air is to go on sale. The solid tyres, which weigh the same as a normal tyre, still work after running over nails and shards of glass. They are made from nanofoam, an ultra-light polymer that absorbs the piercing and impact of sharp objects, and has a constant pressure. Scroll down for video demonstration . London-based company Tannus has made solid tyres for bikes (shown). The company claims the tyres never get a puncture. They are made from a polymer called nanofoam - also found in trainers . The weight of the tyres, made by company Tannus, is 0.95lbs (430g) which is 0.01lbs (5g) less than a traditional tyre and inner tube. Made of Nanofoam, it is a similar technology to that used in lightweight trainers. They contain no rubber, but have a similar flexibility and are 100 per cent puncture resistant, according to the company. They fit all bikes with common clincher wheels including folding bikes and regular road bikes, and come in a range of sizes from children to adults. The tyres also have a lifespan of 6,000 miles (9,650km), but the company adds that skidding on the tyres would void the warranty as they are not built for it. Tannus says it is now ready to produce more than three million of the tyres per year. The tyre has already proved popular in the Far East as a reliable commuter tyre where it has been fitted on more than 200,000 bikes. In the UK the developers are also in discussion with folding bike company Brompton and a number of other international bike manufacturers. There is no air in the tyres so they do not need to be pumped up. If nails, glass or other items become wedged in the tyres, they can simply be pulled out with a pair of pliers (shown) The weight and size of the bike tyres are nearly identical to a regular tyre. They have a range of 6,000 miles (9,650km) and cost from £89 per pair . Jazz Walia, a cycling entrepreneur who is behind the innovation, said: 'Commuters can leave their house on their bike, safe with the knowledge that they will not get a puncture. Back in July a Philadelphia company unveiled its innovative bike for children that never falls over. Called the Jyrobike, it makes clever use of gyroscopes to keep the bike balanced even when a child leans from side-to-side. According to the company, this means a child can learn to ride the bike in just one day. The Jyrobike works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds. Inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc. This creates a gyroscopic force that balances the bike even when it is ridden slowly, as might be expected for a child getting behind the handlebars for the first time. 'Riders don't have to worry about reliability. They never have to worry about getting to work late, changing a punctured tyre in the freezing weather and worrying about what time they will get home on their bike. 'They don't need the fuss of pump, spare inner tubes or tyre levers. 'We are hoping this will open up cycling to people who would previously have never considered getting on a bike. 'In that way the tyres represent a major shift in cycling history. 'The fundamentals of cycling have barely changed in more than a century - but this represents a revolution. 'Solid tyres have been looked at before, but none were as light, as safe or reliable in the long-term.' The tyres, which come in 14 different colours, are currently being sold in a handful of London Cycling shops including The Solid Tyre Bicycle Shop in Whitechapel, East London and online at the website for Tannus.

"Robin Williams did not have any illegal drugs or alcohol in his system when he committed suicide, the coroner's report has revealed. The troubled comic was found hanging from a belt at his home in Marin County, California, on August 11. He was 63. On Friday, authorities formally ruled the star's death as suicide as it was revealed he was struggling with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, anxiety, depression and paranoia. Scroll down for video . 'Very difficult and emotional': Robin Williams found filming the scene in World's Greatest Dad hard. He played the father of a son who killed himself accidentally through auto-erotica . The report states the Mrs Doubtfire star - who had battled drink and drugs in the past - had four drugs in his system at the time of his death. Toxicology reports found two anti-depressants and two caffeine compounds and there was no alcohol in his system. When authorities found Robin's body, the reports states they saw a closed bottle of Seroquel, a drug that treats schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and depression. It was prescribed a week before he died. Robin, a dad of three, was found dead in a bedroom at his Tiburon home. Most poignantly, the report tells how Susan wanted to see her husband's body before it was taken away, and that she was joined by Sheriff's deputies as she prayed over him. She was also asked by authorities if her husband was interested in auto-erotica, which she said he was not. But she added that he was left troubled by his work on his 2009 movie, World's Greatest Dad, in which his character's son died after hanging himself for sexual gratification. The scene where Robin discovered his son's body was 'very difficult and emotional for Mr Williams', according to the coroner's report. In the film, Robin tries to cover up the manner of death by making it look like a suicide. The legendary comic battled paranoia, according to the report, and the night before he died, he placed several wristwatches in a sock and gave them to someone because he was worried about their safe keeping. Devastated: Robin Williams' widow Susan Schneider prayed over his body before she allowed it to be removed from their home following his death on August 11 . Talented: Robin Williams, pictured in World's Greatest Dad, was found hanging at his home. Today, the coroner ruled his death as suicide . Today, a statement issued by the Marin County Sheriff's Office said: 'On August 11, 2014 the Marin County Sheriff’s Office Investigations and Coroner Divisions began investigations into the death of Robin McLaurin Williams who had been pronounced deceased at 12:02 pm at 95 St. Thomas Way in unincorporated Tiburon, California. 'The investigations into Mr. Williams’ death have concluded with the Coroner Division issuing the following findings: Cause of Death: Asphyxia due to Hanging, Manner of Death: Suicide. 'Toxicological evaluation revealed the absence of alcohol or illicit drug. Prescription medications were detected in therapeutic concentrations.' The report says the last outgoing call from Robin's phone was at 7.08 PM the night before he died. He had called his wife Susan, and it lasted 38 seconds. Susan told authorities he called because he was picking up magazines for her at a bookstore. When asked about his behavior, Susan said he seemed well and had taken his iPad from their closet which she took to be a good sign because he hadn't watched TV or read anything in about six months. The web browser had several tabs open to websites discussing medications, including Lyrica, an anti-seizure drug, and propranolol, which treats blood pressure and tremors. Tragic: One of the last pictures Robin Williams posted on his Instagram account. Posing with Crystal the monkey, who had co-starred with him in the Night at the Musem films.  Williams posed with his furry friend on his 63rd birthday on July 21, writing, “Happy Birthday to me! A visit from one of my favorite leading ladies, Crystal' Heartbroken: Fans lay flowers as a tribute to Robin Williams outside his California home following his death . The couple were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Susan admitted, because Robin was having trouble sleeping and would talk loudly in his sleep. The last time she saw him was around 10.30pm on Sunday night and said he seemed 'excited'. According to the report, Robin had experienced Parkinson's symptoms since 2011. He had a tremor in his left arm and movement in his left hand had slowed. He had recently started taking Levodopa to treat the symptoms.

"A Maine judge gave nurse Kaci Hickox the OK to go wherever she pleases, handing state officials a defeat on Friday in their bid to restrict her movements as a precaution against Ebola. Judge Charles C. LaVerdiere ruled Hickox must continue daily monitoring and cooperate with health officials if she chooses to travel. The judge said there's no need to restrict her movements because she's not showing symptoms of Ebola. In his ruling, LaVerdiere thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and wrote that 'people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational'. It was also claimed today, the 33-year-old nurse's roommate in Sierra Leone had been treated for Ebola but the court reportedly said that any risk had passed. Scroll down for video . Kaci Hickox and her boyfriend Ted Wilbur spoke to the media today outside their home in Fort Kent, Maine after a judge ruled there was no need for her to restrict her movements . Fox reported the detail on Miss Hickox's roommate following the court ruling. According to the affidavit, a CDC official in Maine said: 'The Respondent's roommate in Africa became infected without knowing how she became infected with Ebola.' At a press conference outside her home on Friday, Miss Hickox said the information that her roommate had Ebola was inaccurate but did not offer any more details. She said: 'I am humbled today by the judge's decision and even more humbled fro the support we have received. 'I know that Ebola is a scary disease. I have seen it face to face and I know that we are nowhere near winning this fight. She continued: 'To my fellow healthcare workers in West Africa, both national and international staff risking their lives to fight this disease my thoughts, prayers and gratitude remain with you. As a global community we can end Ebola.' She told reporters that at the moment she had no plans to go into Fort Kent because she did not want to make anyone uncomfortable. She said: 'I'm going to have Ted make my favorite Japanese meal and watch a scary movie since it is Halloween.' Maine Governor Paul LePage disagreed with the judge's decision, but said the state will follow the law. 'As governor, I have done everything I can to protect the health and safety of Mainers. The judge has eased restrictions with this ruling and I believe it is unfortunate. However, the State will abide by law,' LePage said. The Governor had said on Thursday that he did not want any Maine citizen 'within three feet' of Miss Hickox. With the judge's ruling, a state police cruiser parked outside her home drove away.

Nurse Kaci Hickox leaves her home on a rural road in Fort Kent, Maine, to take a bike ride with her boyfriend Ted Wilbur on Thursday.  The couple went on an hour-long ride followed by a Maine State Trooper . The state went to court Thursday to impose restrictions on Hickox until the 21-day incubation period for Ebola ends on November 10. Hickox, who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, contended confinement at her home in northern Maine violated her rights. The judge thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and acknowledged the gravity of restricting someone's constitutional rights without solid science to back it up. 'The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,' he wrote. 'The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational.' Hickox, 33, stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey. After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine. She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease. A worker from the Centers for Disease Control leaves the home of nurse Kaci Hickox after a brief visit, on Thursday to monitor her for symptoms of the virus . Fort Kent Police Chief Thomas Pelletier leaves the home of nurse Kaci Hickox after a brief visit on Friday . 'I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based,' she said earlier in the week. In a court filing, the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention backed away from the state's original request for an in-home quarantine and called for restrictions that fall in line with federal guidelines. Hickox remains at risk of being infected with Ebola until the end of a 21-day incubation period, Dr. Sheila Pinette. 'It is my opinion that the respondent should be subjected to an appropriate public health order for mandatory direct active monitoring and restrictions on movement as soon as possible and until the end of the incubation period ... to protect the public health and safety,' she wrote.

"The policeman shot and blinded by Raoul Moat has formed a close friendship with a survivor of the 7/7 terror attacks. Pc David Rathband, 43, has been photographed out with Lisa French days after splitting with his wife. Lisa French, 34, who was seriously injured in a blast on board a bus six years ago, was introduced to Pc Rathband at a charity event, the Sunday Mirror reported. Close friendship: Pc Rathband walking with 7/7 survivor Lisa French after splitting from his wife . The pair were pictured out walking together days after the officer announced on Twitter that he was divorcing Kath, 41, after 20 years. Pc Rathband, a father-of-two, was blinded after being shot in the face by Raoul Moat while he was sat in his police patrol car. Shot: Fugitive Raoul Moat blasted Pc Rathband while he was sat in his patrol car in July last year . Lisa, who was a BT human resources manager, was knocked unconscious by the bomb which killed 12 people on the No 30 bus in Tavistock Square in July 2005. Miss French lives close to Pc Rathband in Newcastle and was on a trip down to London six years ago when she was caught up in the atrocity. She told the 7/7 inquest how she decided not to sit next to bomber Hasib Hussain, 18, because she had her laptop with her and didn't think there would be space as he had such a large bag. Instead, Miss French sat four rows in front of him on the upper deck. She suffered perforated eardrums as well as broken teeth, cuts and bruises in the blast – and described herself as ‘very lucky’. Pc Rathband separated from his wife after being arrested on suspicion of assault by his colleagues in Northumbria Police. The former traffic officer was spoken to at the scene and officers gave the couple advice before leaving. No further action was taken. The couple remained in contact with one another and appeared to be rebuilding their marriage. However, two weeks ago he wrote on Twitter: 'Sad to announce Mrs R has called time on our marriage. Separation permanent.' Break-up: Pc Rathband, 41, announced he was splitting from wife Kath, 43, on Twitter . In response, minutes later she Tweeted: 'Slight inaccuracy in the tweet by @pcdavidrathband - He left us and refuses to come home.' Just a day later Pc Rathband was pictured out with Lisa French near his home. PC Rathband was shot twice at close range by Moat as he sat in his traffic car at a roundabout in the West Denton area of Newcastle in July last year. Blast: Lisa French was seriously injured after Hasib Hussain blew himself up on this No 30 bus in Tavistock Square on 7/7 . He was left with more than 200 pellets lodged in his skull yet gave evidence at the trial of Moat’s two accomplices, Karl Ness and Qhuram Awan. Both were jailed in March this year. Since then PC Rathband, who has won bravery awards, has launched his own charity, the Blue Lamp Foundation, to help emergency service personnel injured in the line of duty.

"A Harvard student group that relishes in conversations about erotic sex has been officially recognized by the prestigious university based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The group, which goes by ‘Harvard College Munch,’ first began its meetings in one of the university’s dining halls to discuss personal stories and broader issues related to BDSM and other forms of ‘kinky sex’, the Harvard Crimson reports. Munch’s membership has grown to about 30 members from seven when it began more than a year ago and is one of 15 student organization that will be approved by Harvard’s Committee on Student Life this Friday. Prestigious institution: Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts . None of the group’s members quoted by the media have been willing to give their full names. One group member, who goes by ‘Marie,’ told the New York Observer that she enjoys ‘Bondage, handcuffs and ice play.” ‘I’ve been hit with a riding crop, a belt, a paddle, canes, a flogger,’ she said, ‘Floggers are my favorite.' The group’s founder, who goes by ‘Michael,’ said there are many benefits to being officially recognized on campus such as being able to poster for. The expected approval from the school’s student life board will entitle Munch to officially meet for on-campus meals, promote on school grounds and apply for grants from the school's Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors organization. Whipped: A black whip, commonly used in BDSM . ‘If you come to campus and you have the sexual interests we represent, you may not even suspect that such a group exists,’ Michael told the Crimson. Munch attempted to gain recognition from the college last semester, but due to troubles finding a stable adviser and constitution problems left the group waiting another few months. ‘Pretty much everyone who joins this club always thought they were alone,’ Michael said.

"The landing site for Rosetta's Philae probe that will try to land on comet 67P next week now has an official name. Previously known only as 'Site J', the area is now called Agilkia and will be the location of the first-ever attempt to land on a comet on 12 November. If successful, Philae will study the surface of the comet with a variety of instruments until March 2015 at the latest. Esa, headquartered in Paris, has named its comet landing site. Called 'Agilkia' - previously just 'Site J' - it will be the target of the Philae lander next week (illustration of landing shown). The name was picked for its relation to the Egyptian origins of the probe . The name was selected by a jury comprising members of the Philae Lander Steering Committee as part of a public competition run from 16 to 22 October by Esa and the German, French and Italian space agencies. Agilkia was one of the most popular entries, proposed by over 150 participants. The committee selected Alexandre Brouste from France as the overwall winner, although more than 150 others had also suggested the name. The landing site, previously known as 'Site J', is named for Agilkia Island, an island on the Nile River in the south of Egypt. A complex of Ancient Egyptian buildings, including the famous Temple of Isis, was moved to Agilkia from the island of Philae when the latter was flooded during the building of the Aswan dams last century. Its relation to Philae, the name of the lander, was one of the reasons it was such a popular choice for entrants and ultimately chosen. The name echoes the Egyptian origins of Rosetta and Philae, named in recognition of milestones in decoding hieroglyphics, the sacred writing system of ancient Egypt. As a prize, Mr Brouste will be invited to Esa's Space Operations Control Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, to follow the landing live. 'The decision was very tough,' saidProfessor Felix Huber of the DLR German Aerospace Center, chair of the Steering Committee. 'We received so many good suggestions on how to name Site J, and we were delighted with such an enthusiastic response from all over the world. We wish to thank all participants for sharing their great ideas with us.' Dr Fred Jansen, Esa Rosetta Mission manager, added: 'It couldn't be a more appropriate name. 'The relocation of the temples of Philae Island to Agilkia Island was an ambitious technical endeavour performed in the 1960s and 1970s to preserve an archaeological record of our ancient history. 'On 12 November, we'll be attempting a unique comet landing, an even more ambitious endeavour to unlock secrets of our most remote origins.' Below is a short science fiction film made for the Rosetta mission starring Aidan Gillen from Game of Thrones . Philae will attempt to land on the surface of Comet 67P (illustration shown) on 12 November. If successful it will study the surface until March 2015 at the latest. Rosetta's mission will continue much longer. Images of the comet recently revealed dunes and boulders on its surface . As the Rosetta space probe prepares for its historic attempt to deploy a lander on comet 67P, BAE Systems revealed the technology it has pioneered to make the £1 billion ($1.6 billion) programme possible. At its Advanced Technology Centre in Great Baddow, Essex, a team of engineers developed a 'smartphone-like system' that enables Esa to communicate with and control the movements of the probe, which is currently more than 310 million miles (500 million kilometres) away. In addition, BAE Systems' technology makes sure all the imagery of the comet and scientific data Rosetta is capturing to be received back on Earth. The recent decision that the mission is 'go' for Site J confirms the timeline of events leading up to the landing of Philae on Rosetta. Rosetta will release Philae at 08:35 GMT/09:35 CET on 12 November at a distance of approximately 14 miles (22.5km) from the centre of the comet. The landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 GMT/16:30 CET. During the seven-hour descent, Philae will take images and conduct science experiments, sampling the dust, gas and plasma environment close to the comet. It will take a 'farewell' image of the Rosetta orbiter shortly after separation, along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface. It is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on Earth several hours after separation. Once safely on the surface, Philae will take a panorama of its surroundings. Again, this is expected back on Earth several hours later. The first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours, constrained by the lander's primary battery lifetime. Longer-term study of the comet by Philae will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge, which in turn is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels. In any case, it is expected that by March 2015, as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the Sun, temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations, and Philae's science mission will come to an end. The Rosetta orbiter's mission will continue for much longer. It will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer Solar System. The system, known as the Intermediate Frequency Modem System (IFMS), is capable of measuring Rosetta's speed to within fractions of a millimetre per second. It can also measure its distance to within 3.3ft (one metre) anywhere in the solar system, factors which are critical to the success of the mission. When used at two ground stations, it uses triangulation to determine the direction with an accuracy of a millionth of a degree- equivalent to the apparent diameter of a coin 620 miles (1,000km) away. Nick James, BAE Systems' lead engineer for the project, said: 'Approaching, orbiting, and landing on a comet requires delicate and supremely accurate manoeuvres. 'The target comet is a relatively small object about 4 kilometres [2.5 miles] in diameter, moving at incredible speeds through the solar system. 'To help make any of this possible, what we have done, in layman's terms, is create a 'smartphone' for inter-planetary communication that gives Esa the capability to communicate with and control the Rosetta probe throughout its 10 year mission as it travels more than five times Earth's distance from the Sun.' The interplanetary 'smartphone' guiding the Rosetta Space Probe is pictured here. As Rosetta prepares for its historic attempt to deploy a lander on comet, BAE Systems revealed the technology it has pioneered which makes the programme possible, known as the Intermediate Frequency Modem System (IFMS) Esa released this mosaic of Rosetta's comet last week. It reveals fascinating details on the surface including boulders. Dunes of dust can also be seen drifting across . Last week, the IFMS was used to transmit new images of the comet back to Earth, revealing its surface in unprecedented detail. In the pictures, an incredible amount of detail can be spotted - including boulders on the surface and dust moving across plains.

When used at two ground stations, it uses triangulation to determine the direction with an accuracy of a millionth of a degree- equivalent to the apparent diameter of a coin 620 miles (1,000km) away. The latest images of comet 67P were taken from a distance of six miles (9.8km) from the comet's centre and revealed in a blog post by Esa. Four new images were released and combined into one mosaic image. In those images the scale is about 26 inches (66 cm) per pixel. The mosaic covers about 3,940 to 4,430ft (1,200 to 1,350 metres) on the comet's surface. Towards the upper left of the image is an area of bright material that was cast in shadow in previous images, possibly at the base of a cliff. A recent landslide of sorts may have uncovered this material. Esa adds, though, that the brightness of the images is a little bit misleading, as the comet is actually blacker than coal. In order to make features, visible the images are grey-scaled and also set to a high contrast to make them appear brighter. 'Also not seen previously in this much detail are the two boulders just below the centre of the mosaic, one of which takes on a heart-shaped appearance from this angle,' Space Science Editor Emily Baldwin wrote for Esa on their blog. 'Zooming in reveals hints of a layered structure and both objects seems to be appearing from beneath the dusty layer, just like some of the smaller 'boulders' around them.' Within the images can also be seen a mysterious pyramid-shaped rock that was previously spotted by Esa. It can be seen just above the middle in the mosaic. At around 82ft-tall (25 metres), the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history.

"A daffodil-destroying bug is on the march and is spreading through more and more British gardens. Entire beds of daffodils in back gardens, city centre parks, even on moorland hills, are being reduced to drooping disasters within days by the larvae of the large narcissus fly. The pest used to be confined to the Scilly Isles and Cornwall but - thanks in part to councils planting huge swathes of daffodils on every available patch of land - it has become widespread and is now turning up as far north as Scotland. The narcissus fly lays eggs on the leaves of daffodils. After hatching the larvae burrow down into the bulbs . The larvae then eat the bulb from the inside before crawling out, pupating in the soil, then emerging as flies . It lays eggs which hatch into larvae which burrow into the daffodil bulb and munch it from the inside. The 116-year-old Daffodil Society has warned there is ‘now no chemical preventative or curative for this pest available to the amateur grower’ to head off the crisis. The society says: 'Once this was considered a serious pest only in the South-West of the British mainland. 'However, in recent years as a result of ‘global warming’ and/or the influence of large plantings of daffodils by public authorities, it has now become a common problem even in the North of Scotland.' The fly, which resembles a small bumble bee, is easily recognised by the high pitched whine it emits in flight. It is only active when the temperatures are in excess of 68F (20C) on windless days. Eggs are laid on the daffodil foliage near to ground level and hatch in seven days. At this point the larvae crawls down and enters the bulb by chewing through the base plate, where it remains, increasing in size by eating the centre of the bulb. It emerges from the bulb in March to pupate in the ground, and the adult flies emerges in April and May. The daffodil society recommends checking if your bulbs have turned soft, which indicates there is already a grub inside, or for small holes near the base plate which means it has recent been infested. The society says that pouring hot water over the bulbs will kill the grubs, but by then the damage has already been done. The bug used to be confined to Cornwall and Devon, but is now found as far north as Scotland thanks largely to an increase in councils across the country planting daffodils . A spokesman added: 'Should this pest be a particular problem in your local area then consideration should be given to covering the beds with either fleece or enviromesh to prevent the fly reaching the foliage to lay its eggs. 'It must be remembered that this will not be effective against flies that emerge from the ground when the cover is in place. 'It is also worth noting that this fly also use snowdrops as a host plant and this may be the reason for localised troublesome populations.' The Royal Horticultural Society said: 'None of the pesticides available to amateur gardeners will control the fly larvae. 'Adult bulb flies like warm sheltered places, so the level of infestation can be reduced by growing daffodils in more shaded and exposed places. 'And after flowering, firm down the soil around the plants to make it less easy for female flies to deposit their eggs. 'Avoid introducing large narcissus bulb fly and other bulb problems into your garden by buying firm, good quality bulbs from reputable suppliers. 'Newly acquired high value bulbs can be protected by covering them with insect-proof nets such as Enviromesh, during mid-May to June when the female flies are laying eggs.'","Narcissus fly larvae burrows into bulbs and eats them from inside .

"South Korean scientists have created soft contact lenses fitted with LEDs, bringing the possibility of transparent, flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures or scan a step closer to reality. Researchers at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology combined graphene with silver nanowires to form a thin, transparent electrode capable of stretching, which overcome the weaknesses of each individual material. The newly invented electrodes have widespread possibilities, including taking pictures with soft contact lenses. Last year, South Korean scientists created soft contact lenses fitted with LEDs, bringing the possibility of transparent, flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures a step closer to reality . Fact or fiction: Contacts capable of scanning data no longer exist only in movies such as Mission Impossible 4 . 'We believe the hybridization between two-dimensional and . one-dimensional nano materials presents a promising strategy toward . flexible, wearable electronics and implantable bio sensor device,' Jang-Ung Park, . professor of the School of Nano-Bioscience and Chemical Engineering at Ulsan, told Science Daily. High-tech eye wear such as Google Glasses and augmented reality contact lenses are nothing new, but the South Korean scientists are the first to be able to create a flexible, transparent material that can be used in soft contact lenses. Microsoft and the University of Washington have been working on similar projects, that seem more like a prop in movies such as Mission Impossible 4. Mastermind: Nano bio-science professor Jang-Ung Park helped create the new contact lens . In January last year, they created a prototype of a hard augmented reality contact lens capable of receiving radio signals and transmitting them to the brain through optical nerves, according to Desktop Engineering. Transparent electrodes are more commonly used in touch screen computers, flat-screen TV and light-emitting devices. However, the material used to make them, indium tin oxide, is brittle and expensive because of its limited availability. The alternative was networks of randomly distributed mNW electrodes, which are cheap but not as stable. Graphene and silver nanowires are also limited by their capabilities. The new hybrid material however, has a high electrical and optical performance with mechanical flexibility and can be stretched for flexible electronics. Scientists discovered little change in its resistance when bent or folded. The hybrid transparent electrode has a low ""sheet resistance"" and high transmittance. It was also able to preserve its electrical and optical properties against thermal oxidation condition. To demonstrate its possibilities, researchers at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology created a soft contact lens with LEDs. A rabbit made to wear the lens for five hours showed no irritation or health problems, such as having a blood shot eye or trying to rub the area.","South Korean researchers develop futuristic electrode .

"WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES OF INJURY . One of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time suffered a horrific injury in front of millions of fans Saturday night after he broke his leg during a championship fight that was being broadcast live around the world. Anderson Silva, 38, snapped his left leg when his opponent Chris Weidman blocked his kick with his knee. Pictures show Silva's shin buckling as it smashes against Weidman's knee. Although the injury happened too quickly to be seen by most naked eyes in Las Vegas, the sound of Silva's cracking shin could be heard at cageside. Thousands of fans cringed when the replay was shown on the arena's big screens. Scroll down for video . Horrific: This is the moment Chris Weidman, left, broke Anderson Silva's leg when he blocked Silva's kick with his knee. Experts fear the injury could end Silva's career . Unnatural: Silva's leg buckled at a horrible angle and broke after coming in contact with Weidman's knee . Agony: Silva falls to the canvas in pain after his leg broke in his fight with Weidman . A moment later, Silva collapsed to the mat. Referee Herb Dean waved off the fight when Silva fell back, clutching his leg with both hands. Silva left the octagon strapped to a stretcher with a brace on his leg, screaming in pain. Experts fear the injury could be the end of Silva's career as a fighter. Many are already saying it is the end of an era in UFC fighting, where Silva held the middleweight title belt for six years - the longest reign in the history of the sport. UFC orthopedic surgeon Dr. Steven Sanders said Sunday that Silva had broken his tibia and fibula in the lower part of his left leg. He underwent emergency surgery in which Dr Sanders repairs the broken tibia and stabilized the fibula. Recovery could take more than six months. 'Following Saturday evening's UFC 168 main event, former champion Anderson Silva was taken to a local Las Vegas hospital where he underwent surgery to repair a broken left leg. The successful surgery, performed by Dr. Steven Sanders, the UFC's orthopedic surgeon, inserted an intramedullary rod into Anderson's left tibia,' UFC said in a statement. Silva's leg can be seen here, bent at an odd angle. He was carried off the mat in a stretcher, still screaming in pain . 'The broken fibula was stabilized and . does not require a separate surgery. Anderson will remain in the . hospital for a short while, but no additional surgery is scheduled at . this time. 'Recovery time . for such injuries may vary between three and six months. Anderson is . deeply touched by the outpouring of support from his fans and the entire . MMA community. There has been no immediate decision about his future, . and he would kindly ask for privacy at this time as he deals with his . injury and prepares to return home to recover.' The . Brazilian was bidding for revenge after losing his UFC middleweight . title when he was knocked out by the undefeated American in July. But . after suffering a torrid first session, his leg broke as he aimed a . kick at the champion, forcing a premature end to the much-hyped clash in . Las Vegas. Weidman was dignified in his celebration, kneeling beside his stricken opponent as he writhed on the canvas. 'I knew coming into the fight that what he could hurt me most with was the leg kicks,' Weidman said. 'We trained checking the kick a lot. The idea is to pull your leg and for their shin to land at the knee. That's exactly what I did, and I felt his leg go right away.' He added: 'There's no real excitement in a fight finishing like that, because you never want to see anyone get hurt like that.' Weidman paid tribute to his opponent, who he has beaten twice in a row now, saying 'He's still known as the greatest fighter of all time.' In pain: Silva clutches at his leg and writhes in pain after he injured himself against Weidman . Danger: Silva spent much of the first round on his back as Weidman looked to dominate on the canvas . Thousands . of fan from his homeland - including retired football star Ronaldo - . filled the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Former heavyweight boxing . champion Mike Tyson was also in the crowd. Roy Jones Jnr, who had hoped to face Silva in a boxing match, had been in the former champion's dressing room before the fight. Unlike . before their first meeting, the boxers touched gloves before the . opening round and, after a tentative start during which Silva kept his . hands held high, Weidman landed a front kick before executing a . takedown. The . challenger recovered quickly before knees were exchanged on the cage . wall. But Weidman regained control, dropping Silva with a huge right . hand before attempting to finish the job. In trouble: Weidman enjoyed the better of the first round but Silva made it to the end of the session . Silva . fought off his repeated flurries but remained on his back at the . halfway stage, taking an elbow and a succession of hard blows. But by the end of the session, it was Weidman who was bleeding by the nose despite dominating the round. What happened next will linger long in the memory. Silva later told his corner he cracked his shin bone with his first kick before breaking it with his next attempt. Weidman, . who will fight Vitor Belfort in the second defence of his title next . year, revealed he injured his knee during the fight. Still champion: Weidman celebrates after retaining his middleweight title when Silva broke his leg . 'It's . knee on shin, so when he goes to kick, you put your knee on his shin,' he added. 'It has happened in sparring and guys take a minute off and . walk around, and at least it stops them from kicking you. 'To break someone's leg, I've never done that before. I didn't want to see Anderson get hurt like that.' Earlier, . Ronda Rousey was taken past the first round for the first time in her . career but still submitted Miesha Tate with her signature armbar in the . third session. There were also impressive victories for Travis Browne . against Josh Barnett, for Jim Miller against Fabricio Camoes and for . Dustin Poirier over Diego Brandao.","Anderson Silva broke his shin in front of millions of horrified fans in a much-hyped UFC match Saturday night .

"So, Mauricio Pochettino’s plan was to wipe the floor with Fiorentina before next week’s second leg in Stadio Artemio Franchi. If only this European lark was so easy. Working out what to do next in the Europa League, against a team sitting fourth in Serie A, is part of Pochettino’s coaching education. Tottenham’s manager learned some valuable lessons here. It is a cardinal sin to concede at home in the first leg of European knockout football and Spurs must score in Florence now to stand any chance of progressing to the round of 16. Roberto Soldado, left, opened the scoring for Tottenham with a stunning volley to give Spurs an early lead against Fiorentina . TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1): Lloris 6; Walker 6, Fazio 6, Vertonghen 6.5, Davies 6; Bentaleb 6, Paulinho 6.5 (Mason 84min); Chadli 7 (Kane 65, 6), Eriksen 6, Townsend 7.5 (Lamela 72, 5.5); Soldado 7. Subs not used: Vorm, Dier, Rose, Dembele, Mason. Booked: Soldado. FIORENTINA (3-5-2): Tatarusanu 7; Savic 5.5, Rodriguez 4.5, Basanta 6.5; Joaquin, Fernandez, Pizarro 7, Valero 6.5 (Badelj 78), Pasqual 5 (Alonso 65); Salah 6.5, Gomez 6.5. Subs not used: Neto, Aquilani, Babacar, Ilicic, Richards. Booked: Rodriguez, Savic. Man of the match: Andros Townsend. Referee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain). Ratings by Riath Al-Samarrai . Pochettino needs a strategy because his side will play in three competitions — Barclays Premier League, Europa League and Capital One Cup — in an eight-day period. Each has its own selling point. Buying into the idea that Spurs can win all three seems unwise because they allowed Fiorentina back into this first leg at White Hart Lane following Roberto Soldado’s dreamy opener. Little wonder Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella thanked his coaching staff at the final whistle. The Italians are the only football nation who seem to prefer draws to wins. European football is a different discipline, requiring tactical nous and improvisation, adjusting to the needs and demands of the tie as the clock runs down. What a shame for Tottenham, because until Jose Maria Basanta’s cruel, 36th-minute equaliser, they had been much the better team. Even without Harry Kane, strangely left on the substitutes’ bench after a nine-day rest since his last outing against Liverpool, they played with conviction in the first half. ‘They played a high-tempo pressing game as we expected, but they could not keep it up,’ said Montella, justifiably. It was still a joy to watch Soldado get on the scoresheet with just over five minutes gone, steering his volley beyond Ciprian Tatarusano direct from Paulinho’s corner. He puffed out his chest after that, finding the encouragement he needed to attempt an outrageous overhead kick from Christian Eriksen’s 18th-minute cross. Tottenham striker Soldado (right) has scored 10 of his last 11 goals at White Hart Lane . Soldado and team-mate Jan Vertonghen show their delight after securing an early lead against Fiorentina . Fiorentina defender Jose Maria Basanta scored the equaliser in the 36th minute against Tottenham . Basanta stabbed the ball home after goalkeeper Hugo Lloris failed to deal with Mathias Fernandes' fierce free kick . Tottenham’s energy was infectious, with Andros Townsend like a Duracell bunny as he shuttled up and down the right wing. Everyone is plugged into Pochettino’s ideas. Townsend’s cushioned back-flick into the path of Paulinho, haring down the line at the midway point of the first half, was delicious. Eventually Townsend tired, and was replaced by Erik Lamela late in the second half when his legs could no longer give him the advantage over left back Manuel Pasqual. By then Fiorentina had the upper hand, closing this first leg down in a way only an Italian team can. They are masters at this stuff. Fiorentina’s goal punished Soldado’s reckless foul, for which he was inevitably booked, on the edge of Tottenham’s penalty area. It is hard to apportion blame for the goal because keeper Hugo Lloris did a mighty fine job in getting across his line when Mathias Fernandes smashed the free-kick towards his near post . Andros Townsend will have forced his way into the thoughts of Roy Hodgson with lung-bursting runs down the right wing . Fiorentina defender Gonzalo Rodriguez was forced to take drastic action to stop the lively Townsend . Mauricio Pochettino's side started strongly but lost their way after Fiorentina equalised before half-time . Pochettino sent on in-form striker Harry Kane as a second-half substitute as Spurs went in search of a second goal . Pochettino faces a selection headache for second leg because the match is just three days before the Capital One Cup final . The botched clearance, if it deserves to be called that, fell to Bastana for the Fiorentina defender to stab beyond the France No 1. Spurs failed to respond, unable to find any rhythm after this setback. It happens in Europe, but dealing with it is everything. They eventually had 13 shots on goal, with an effort from Nacer Chadli hitting the bar as the home side searched for a goal that would have given them room for manoeuvre in Florence. ‘We were better in the first half,’ said Pochettino. ‘We created a lot of chances and we didn’t run out of energy.’ When Eriksen spooned another effort into the stands, he slapped the side of his head twice in the style of Andy Murray. He knew as well as anybody, it is advantage Fiorentina. Tottenham and Fiorentina players compete for a corner during the Europa League round of 32 match .

"A couple who scooped a £148million lottery jackpot have blamed  the ‘stress’ of becoming overnight multimillionaires on their decision to divorce. But while Adrian and Gillian Bayford claim the huge sum led to the split, there’s also the small matter of a rumoured affair between Mrs Bayford and the couple’s gardener –  and accusations that Mr Bayford ran over his alleged love rival with a golf buggy. Mr Bayford, 43, is now being sued by landscaper Chris Tovey, who claims he was deliberately mowed down in the 200-acre grounds of the pair’s mansion. Scroll down for video . All change: Just over a year since their £148m lottery win Gillian and Adrian Bayford have confirmed their marriage is over . Payout: The Bayfords won £148million in August, one of the biggest lottery jackpots in history . Friends also say that while Mrs Bayford revelled in the luxury lifestyle afforded by their EuroMillions win, Mr Bayford struggled to enjoy the high life and had not settled in at the couple’s country estate. Just 15 months after they scooped the  second biggest ever lottery prize, he has left the £6million Georgian mansion where his wife still lives. Facing the world: Lottery winner Adrian Bayford at his home in Suffolk today, after it emerged her recently split from his wife Gillian . He has moved into a more modest £500,000, four-bedroom home in Haverhill, Suffolk – the area where the couple originally lived. Mr Bayford told the Mail last night: ‘Gillian and I have split.’ He denied that there was anyone else involved, saying: ‘There’s never been anything like that at all.’ Instead, the stress of managing their fortune meant they had not spent time together – and their Grade-II Cambridgeshire pile became a chore to maintain, he claimed. ‘When you win the lottery it’s so stressful,’ he said. ‘I’ve worked so hard on those grounds [at the mansion], I’ve not had a break, we’ve never had time together as a couple. 'I mean you cannot change what’s happened. It is just something that happened. But we’re great friends, we’re still getting on.’ He added: ‘Things happen. Sometimes in life you have to move on. We’re all happy now and life goes on.’ Friends last night dismissed the rumours over an affair between Mrs Bayford and Mr Tovey, 40, as nonsense. The golf buggy crash that has left Mr Tovey on crutches seven months on was not deliberate, they claim. Best friend Richard Hudspith said: ‘Adrian was driving an off-road vehicle on his private land when the accident occurred in April this year. 'There were two witnesses who  have given testimonies that it was an accident. Chris was injured but he did not suffer a broken leg.' New life: Mrs Bayford is said to be living in the couple's £6million Georgian mansion, which has more than 100 acres of land . Court claims: Chris Tovey said he was hit by a golf buggy . According to friends, Mr Bayford had never learned to drive and could not enjoy the couple’s new fleet of cars – or even the golf buggy they bought, which they say he crashed while trying to navigate his grounds. But Mrs Bayford revelled in the luxury lifestyle afforded by their win – she has had a makeover and slimmed down, and enjoys their fleet of cars, which includes an Audi, a Mercedes and a sporty Mini. However, a former friend said the win had ‘changed her’ and that she had lost touch many of her old acquaintances. Cindy Smith, 46, said: ‘She’s definitely changed since she won the money, which is a real shame.’ Mrs Bayford opened a children’s play barn with Mrs Smith in May after the win, but they fell out and it has since closed down and been sold. ‘I’ve deleted her numbers from my phone,’ she said. Friends of Mr Bayford said he preferred a more humble lifestyle to his wife. Mr Hudspith, who ran a second-hand record shop with Mr Bayford until shortly after the win, said: ‘Adrian didn’t want to do anything special after winning all that money. Down the road: Mr Bayford is now living in this £500,000 house around 10 minutes away from his wife in Suffolk . Luxury: The new house purchased by lottery winner Adrian Bayford as it was announced he had split with his wife . Swish: The £500,000 house includes this swimming pool, and is just a short drive from where Mr Bayford's wife lives . Pretty: The property has perfectly manicured lawns and flower beds fit for a multi-millionaire . ‘They didn’t want to move abroad and sit in the sun. They had the kids to look after.’ Colin Richards, who runs a video rental store near Mr Bayford’s old shop, added: ‘He doesn’t drive, he doesn’t go out, you don’t see him in town. I know different people like different things, but if I had won it I would have motor cars and all the nice luxuries in life – helicopters and boats. 'But he doesn’t seem interested in anything like that. He could not even drive the golf buggy he had up there, he crashed it.’ The couple, who have a daughter aged . eight and a six-year-old  son, announced their split in a  statement . from Mrs Bayford that said their marriage has ‘broken down . irretrievably’. The couple’s . win in August last year put them 516th on Britain’s Rich List – but . they celebrated with a budget holiday in a Scottish caravan park. Happy day: Adrian and Gillian celebrate winning the jackpot in August 2012, which put them in the top 500 richest people in Britain . Off to work: EuroMillions jackpot winner Adrian Bayford, opens his small shop in Haverhill, but gave it up after he was plagued by people begging for money . Old life: The Bayfords lived in this modest house before they got rich and said they were 'like ships in the night to earn the income we needed' Mrs Bayford later said she hoped the windfall would allow the family to spend more time together. The former healthcare assistant at Cambridge’s Addenbrooke’s Hospital said the pair – who married in 2004 – were like ‘ships in the night’ to earn the income the family needed. ‘This money has come at the right time for us and is going to benefit the whole family,’ she said. Mr Tovey, who lives with his wife in a small terraced house in Haverhill, told the Mail last night: ‘I’ve got a lot at stake and I’m not willing to comment. 'They’ve separated, which is news to me, and I played no part in their separation.’ His wife, Teri, added: ‘He was nothing to do with their marriage.’ A string of lottery winners have discovered that a huge fortune cannot always buy happiness. Notorious Michael Carroll, pictured right, of Downham Market, Norfolk, was 19 when he won £9.7million in 2002. Carroll, who had a history of petty crime, became known . as the 'Lotto lout' when he collected his jackpot wearing an electronic . tag. In 2010 he said he was being forced to sell his house and wanted to work as a dustman after squandering his fortune. Iorworth Hoare, from near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was dubbed the 'Lotto rapist' after scooping £7.2 million in 2004 when he bought a Lotto Extra ticket while on day release from prison. Details of his rape conviction came to light after the win. The High Court later ordered that he pay close to £100,000 to his victim in a landmark ruling. His bill for legal fees reportedly reached almost £1 million. Mark Gardiner, a glazier from Hastings, Sussex, won a half share of £22.6million in 1995. Years later he spoke about how the money had ;ruined my life'. He said he met with jealously, false allegations and legal claims from ex-girlfriends. 'If I could turn the clock back, I would move to a different area,' he added. Roger and Lara Griffiths, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, netted £1.8 million on the National Lottery in 2005. He had worked as an IT manager and she as a performing arts teacher but both quit their jobs. Mrs Griffiths later spoke of how the win wrecked their marriage while Mr Griffiths said he had been left with just £7 in the bank. She told ITV's Daybreak programme said she had been forced to sell her collection of designer handbags to get by. Callie Rogers, from Workington, Cumbria, became Britain's youngest ever lottery winner at 16 when she won £1.9 million in 2003. Ten years later she said she had frittered the money away on drugs and alcohol and became so depressed she attempted suicide. The mother-of-three said she had been left with just £2,000 but added: 'I'm finally truly happy.'","Adrian and Gillian Bayford won huge EuroMillions jackpot 15 months ago .

"Coach Roberto Donadoni believes financially-stricken Parma have been abandoned by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and he wants someone to take responsibility for the situation. For the second successive week the FIGC have called off a Parma Serie A fixture and Donadoni said the governing body should take some blame. 'No one has taken responsibility for what has happened to us, they (the federation) has allowed the people that have created this disaster to do as they pleased so they should also take some of the blame,' Donadoni told a news conference on Saturday. Parma coach Roberto Donadoni says the Italian Football Federation must take some responsibility . Parma's game has been postponed and Alessandro Lucarelli and the team have not been paid all season . 'We are like a carcass in the middle of the desert and around us there are vultures and jackals.' The FIGC called off Parma's match against Genoa on Sunday after the squad threatened to strike over unpaid wages. A week earlier the home game against Udinese was postponed because the club could not afford to pay stewards or police. 'We're not playing tomorrow because we want public opinion to know what's going on and not because we can't afford to travel to Genoa,' Donadoni said. The FIGC agreed to call off the Genoa fixture but warned that it was not feasible to continue postponing games. A banner on the locked gates says the Ennio Tardini stadium is now ‘Closed for robbery’ Parma have an illustrious history, but the club are in dire straits financially and could go out of business . 'Considering the morale of the players I have agreed to postpone the game but I can't do it every Sunday,' FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio explained in a statement. Donadoni and team captain Alessandro Lucarelli said the situation needed to be resolved to safeguard the future of the young Parma players. 'Lucarelli and myself, we've had our careers but there are 16, 17 and 18-year-olds who have a bright future in front of them and need to be protected,' the coach added.

"A Florida mother who fled to Canada rather than face 30 years in jail for having sex with a 16-year-old boy has been told she has been granted asylum. Denise Harvey has been told she will not be extradited back to the United States to serve her prison term. The 47-year-old successfully argued that her sentence was 'cruel and unusual punishment,' according to The National Post. Despite the Canadian government trying to kick her out of the country, an immigration appeals board granted her leave to stay. Denise Harvey, 47, was convicted of five counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor in 2008 for having sex with a 16-year-old friend of her son . The Canadian government had already appealed the decision once before and now appears to be out of legal options. Immigration Minister Chris Alexander said that he found it 'mind-boggling' a U.S. citizen would apply for asylum in Canada. 'It . is mind-boggling that individuals from the United States, which has . been designated a safe country precisely because it respects human . rights and does not normally produce refugees, think it is acceptable to . file asylum claims in Canada,' he told CBC News. Harvey will now be able to apply for Canadian citizenship. Harvey claimed her pending 30-year prison sentence was 'cruel and unusual punishment' Officials told the National Post that cases like this are rare - although three asylum claims were accepted from the United States in 2013 alone. The married mother fled from her home in Florida in 2010 after being convicted of having sex with a 16-year-old who was friends with her teenage son. She was sentenced to 30 years but while out on bail fled to Canada with her husband and family. She was granted refugee status after saying she faced 'cruel and unusual punishment' from the lengthy prison sentence. Canadian authorities agreed to allow her to stay ruling her actions would not constitute a crime if she had carried them out in Canada where the age of consent is 16. The Federal Court of Canada reversed the decision and stripped her of the refugee status. Prosecutors in Vero Beach, Florida were hopeful that Harvey would be sent back to serve her sentence. But now the Federal Court in Canada has decided not to take any further action against Harvey - meaning she can continue the life she has made for herself in Saskatchewan. Harvey, from Vero Beach, was convicted of having sex on multiple occasions with the boy she met at her son's baseball games in 2008. She began flirting with him and the pair had sex on five occasions, including at the victim's home and in her office where she worked as a mortgage broker. The victim's sister tipped off police after she once walked in on them having sex. After police launched an investigation, Harvey was recorded telling the teen to lie to police and tried to blackmail his sister not to help authorities. After being sentenced to 30 years in jail in 2010 Harvey appealed, and when that failed she fled. She was arrested in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan in April 2011. A lawyer for Harvey refused to comment. Denise Harvey isn't the first American to flee the American justice system and find a home in Canada. During the Vietnam War, up to 125,000 deserters and draft dodgers found safety from the Defense Department in Canada. Initially, the Canadian government resisted and required American requesting residency to show they had been discharged from their military service. However, by 1968, the government began to look the other way and young American men poured across the border. While the men were not granted formal asylum, they took advantage of Canada's lax immigration policy, which allowed nearly anyone to claim permanent residency in the country. Many of the draft dodgers, who fled rather than face going to war, returned to the United States when they were pardoned in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.","Denise Harvey, 47, fled her home in Vero Beach, Florida, after she was convicted of having sex with her son's 16-year-old friend in 2010 .

"'My goal is to own John Lennon's DNA': Canadian dentist Michael Zuk, who plans to clone the late Beatle from genetic information in a wisdom tooth . These are the first pictures of the dentist who wants to clone John Lennon from DNA taken from the assassinated Beatle's wisdom tooth. Michael . Zuk from Alberta, Canada, bought the molar for nearly $33,000 at an . auction two years ago and now hopes to extract enough genetic data from . it to recreate the musician. 'If . there is enough DNA to sequence it, it could be basically genetic real . estate,' he told television vet Mark Evans, who tracked him down for a . Channel 4 programme. 'My goal is to own John Lennon’s DNA.' Dr . Zuk revealed that, once cloning technology is far advanced enough to . replicate humans, he would clone Lennon and raise him as his own son. 'He could be looked at as my son but I . don’t think I would be the one, you know, owning his property, he would . have the rights when he was old enough to make a claim,' said Dr Zuk. Asked . how he could ensure the new Lennon ended up a rockstar, and not a . dentist like his own son, Dr Zuk replied: 'He would still be his exact . duplicate but you know, hopefully keep him away from drugs and . cigarettes, that kind of thing. 'But you know, guitar lessons wouldn’t hurt anyone right?' Mr . Evans sought out Dr Zuk as part of Channel 4 series Dead Famous . DNA, in which he employs geneticists to apply the latest . advances in DNA testing to whatever samples he can get hold of. Aside . from Lennon's tooth, the series follows Mr Evans as he travels the . world to track down body parts purportedly once belonging to . high-profile figures including Adolf Hitler, Elvis Presley, John F . Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, Napoleon, Marlon Brando and King George III. He asked Dr Zuk if he believes he would really 'own' John Lennon. 'I . think I can, because of the laws,' the dentist told him. 'Depends where . you do these things. If it can’t be done in one country you can do . these things in another.' Dr . Zuk added: 'To have John Lennon's DNA sequence outside of the family . protection to me, and full access to it, is worth millions.' Precious: Dr Zuk shows Mark Evans the tooth which he paid nearly $33,000 for at auction . The . dentist said that if the first version of John Lennon Jr didn't quite . work our as planned, he might be willing to try cloning the musician . more than once. 'Well, if . it works once it’s going to work again, right?' he said. Mr Zuk has . previously admitted that it might be some time before he is able to . realise his vision of Lennon mkII. 'Animal . cloning still has some glitches they are working out but they are . already cloning species. Once the glitches are worked out humans will . follow,' he told cosmetic dentistry comparison site Teethwise last year. 'There . are people in history that everyone is fixated over ... JFK, Martin . Luther King, Marilyn ... it will be possible ... and because of this, . like the nuclear bomb, it will be happen.' Yellow: John Lennon's tooth pictured before its sale at auction. Dr Zuk bought the tooth, which he says is probably a wisdom tooth, in 2011 . A musical genius who became mired in controversy over his outspoken peace activism and radical political views, Lennon was shot dead in New York by Mark Chapman 34 years ago. As of 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the U.S. exceeded 14million and, as writer, co-writer or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. Assassinated: Lennon, who was shot dead in 1980, gave the tooth to his housekeeper after he had it pulled. It was put up for auction in 2011 by her son . In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 . Greatest Britons voted him eighth and, in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him . the fifth-greatest singer of all time. The . tooth that Dr Zuk now owns was given by Lennon to his housekeeper . Dorothy Jarlett, who between 1964 and 1968 lived in Weybridge, Surrey. She later moved to Canada where she married and had kept it with her ever since. But . as the Beatle's former employee reached 90, her son Barry Jarlett . decided to sell it so that the 'unique' piece of memorabilia was not . lost. Lennon formed a close bond with Miss Jarlett. He also gave her a . pearl necklace and a wallet which her family decided to keep. The pensioner provided an affidavit to confirm that the tooth was genuine. Dr . Zuk bought the tooth, which he says is probably a wisdom tooth, after . it was sold through Omega Auctions in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in . 2011. At the time he said he was ‘buzzing’ after the purchase, adding that it would join his collection of dinosaur teeth.","Michael Zuk from Alberta says the tooth is 'basically genetic real estate'

"Rising numbers of teenagers are turning their backs on traditional  A-levels in favour of apprenticeships, Government figures show. The number of 16 and 17-year-olds in apprenticeship schemes has risen by 15 per cent from 41,738 last year to 49,228 this year. The Department for Education statistics come after a recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research warned that the majority of teenagers are likely to be better prepared for the future workforce by shunning higher education in favour of practical, jobs-based training. The number of 16 and 17-year-olds in apprenticeship schemes has risen by 15 per cent from 41,738 last year to 49,228 this year . The Coalition has reformed apprenticeships – where students work towards nationally recognised qualifications while being paid – to make them a respected alternative to academic study.

"If you've ever been annoyed by your colleagues or complained about noise in an open plan office, spare a though for Facebook's engineers. The firm today revealed the final plans for its new office building - which includes a giant room housing 2,800 engineers. At more than 435,000 square feet, spread across 22 acres, the new building also boasts tunnels to Facebook's current campus, and even a rooftop park filled with cafes and barbecue areas. Scroll down for more pictures and video . Designed by Frank Gehry, the new Facebook campus is built above a surface-level parking lot with a massive rooftop park . Architect Frank Gehry (left), Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (center) and Craig Webb (right), from Gehry's office, share a laugh as they discuss plans for an addition to the Facebook campus . The huge roof dips and rises from 45 to 73 feet, and makes the building blend into the surroundings. There will be seating, cafes and barbecue areas on top -all above a giant, open plan office. The entire office is built above a surface-level parking lot, and topped with a park. Mark Zuckerberg enlisted architect Frank Gehry to expand Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, near Palo Alto, California. Gehry was charged with creating a space for 2,800 Facebook engineers to work on developing the campus for the social networking site now struggling to prove its dominance in the market. Early plans show the company's team of techies will congregate in a massive open room, which will be the largest open office space in the world, in keeping with Zuckerberg's mission to make the 'world a more open place.' A model of the vast campus under construction at Frank Gehry's office. The team worked closely with Mark Zuckerberg on the project . The building will be topped with trees and will be connected to the company's main offices by an underground tunnel. 'I'm excited to work with Frank Gehry to design our new campus,' said Zuckerberg when the plans were revealed. 'The idea is to make the perfect engineering space: one giant room that fits thousands of people, all close enough to collaborate together.' 'It will be the largest open floor plan in the world, but it will also have plenty of private, quiet spaces as well. The roof of the building will be a park that blends into the community with a long walking trail, a field and lots of places to sit. 'From the outside it will appear as if you're looking at a hill in nature.' Early plans show the Facebook team will congregate in a massive open room. The building will be topped with trees and will be connected to the company's main offices by an underground tunnel. Experts say the buildings are the latest round in the hi-tech war - but may not be a good sign. 'It signals a desire, a statement, to say that we're special, we're . different,' said Margaret O'Mara, associate professor of history at the . University of Washington, who has written about the building of Silicon . Valley. 'We have changed the world and we are going to continue to . change it - and it's also a reflection of robust bank accounts, they have a lot of cash.' However, some believe the vast offices could spell the beginning of the end, and many believe the obsession with new premises often comes at a high point in the firm's existence. 'I've been thinking the Apple spaceship is going to get nicknamed the 'Death Star' because the project is so big and the timing is so bad,' said hedge fund manager Jeff Matthews of Ram Partners. The building is coming to fruition just as Apple's product cycles may be maturing, he explained. 'It is such a classic contrary indicator that you just get the shakes',' he told Reuters. The new building dips and rises from 45 to 73 feet, and is virtually impossible to see from the side. Facebook's West Campus to be built in Menlo Park by 2016 and designed by Frank Gehry . It will feature the world's biggest open plan office, with 3,400 Engineers sitting together - and is designed to replicate a college campus . The building will pit Facebook against Google, Amazon and Apple, all of whom are working on new offices. Amazon is the most recent to reveal its plans. It plans to build a trio of . 65,000-square foot glass domes in Seattle as parts of its new . headquarters to take on Apple's plans for 'spaceship' headquarters in . Silicon Valley, San Francisco.

"The latest deadline for the Russian Football Union to pay national coach Fabio Capello has passed without action. Capello last received his wages in June amid financial problems at the RFU, and Russian authorities set a deadline of January 19 for him to be paid before pursuing possible legal action. The Russian Federal Labour and Employment Agency, known by its Russian abbreviation Rostrud, made no mention of any court case in a statement on Monday, saying only that it would conduct an 'unscheduled inspection' of the RFU to enforce demands that Capello be paid. Fabio Capello has not been paid his wages by the Russian Football Union since June 2014 . Under Russian law, RFU president Nikolai Tolstykh could be banned from his post for up to three years for failing to pay an employee. He told Russian media on Tuesday it received an unspecified amount of 'extra funds' from FIFA last week that it wanted to use to pay Capello, but these were not enough to cover the whole debt. For 2018 World Cup host Russia, the case has become a major embarrassment. During a visit to Russia on Tuesday, UEFA head Michel Platini called the situation 'a very bad advertisement for Russian football,' according to comments quoted by Russian newspaper Sport Express. Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who is also a FIFA executive committee member and played a key role in bringing Capello to Russia in 2012, said last Friday he was 'ashamed' to have to discuss the Italian's unpaid wages at a joint news conference with FIFA president Sepp Blatter. 'This topic of the contract needs to be dealt with soon,' he added. The 68-year-old led Russia to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, finishing first in Group F . Capello watches his Russia players during a training session at Stamford Bridge in 2013 . Under the terms of a four-year contract extension signed a year ago, and ending after Russia hosts the 2018 World Cup, Capello has a reported salary of 8 million euros ($9.3 million) a year, with a large penalty for early termination. Rostrud began investigating Capello's unpaid wages last year and says it has identified more than 181 million rubles ($2.8 million) in unpaid wages from June through November. The RFU has missed further payments since then. Capello's contract is believed to be denominated in euros but paid in rubles according to the exchange rate at the time of payment. Following a collapse in the value of the ruble, that means salary payments from the summer may cost the RFU almost twice as much as if they had been paid on time. Capello has insisted the unpaid money is not a factor in Russia's poor form - his side have just one win in their last eight competitive matches, including a winless group-stage exit at the World Cup in Brazil. He said in October he was 'getting close to the limit' of his patience with the salary situation, but has not expressed any discontent since. The RFU has struggled with debts for years. On Monday, oil billionaire and Spartak Moscow owner Leonid Fedun said he was owed 300 million rubles ($4.6 million) by the RFU after lending it money to fund the national team's preparation for last year's World Cup. Capello took charge of Russia's national side in 2012 following the resignation of Dick Advocaat .","Russian Football Union has failed to pay national coach Fabio Capello .

"With her soft dark hair and huge doe eyes, her lips gently pursed and her daughter seated on her lap, Annie Barker looked every inch the respectable Edwardian wife. But with war just around the corner, life for Annie, a mother-of-two who lived in East London, was about to be turned upside down. After her husband was sent to fight on the Western Front, Annie took a job in a cafe and it was there she would meet and fall in love with a docker named Richard Luck. Tragically, it was a meeting that would have fatal consequences. Scroll down for video . Family: Annie Baker with her husband Arthur and their baby daughter Florence in a pre-war photo in 1912 . ‘I have loved this man, and he loves me, from the first time I met him . . .’ Annie wrote in her diary at the time. Less than a year later, Annie’s life was in freefall, ending with her suicide in 1918. Now the story of Annie and her doomed love affair have been turned into a novel - although this is one tale where the truth is even more shocking than fiction. 'There was great pressure to conform to . the strict moral codes of the ""respectable"" working classes,' explains author Juliet West, who first came across Annie's story while working as a journalist at the Daily Mail. 'When war . came, women were expected to do their duty, to roll up their sleeves and . support the war effort wholeheartedly.' In 1915, when Annie was 23, her husband Arthur was called up, joining the Poplar and Stepney Rifles in the December of that year. Horrors: Wounded soldiers from one of the London regiments struggle away from the frontline in 1916 . Story: Juliet West, a former Daily Mail journalist, has turned Annie's story into a novel, Before the Fall . With Arthur shipped off to France shortly afterwards, Annie was left to bring up two children on the meagre separation allowance of 3s 6d a week, topped up to 7s by the Government. It wasn't enough and so, Annie took a job in a cafe. There, she regularly encountered a handsome young docker named Richard Luck and the two swiftly embarked on an affair. 'I can imagine she might have been . reluctant to work in the munitions factories,' adds Juliet. 'Although the work was . well-paid, handling the chemicals could have a serious effect on . workers’ health. 'The café must have seemed a much safer option and . another perk was that Annie was allowed a meal with each shift. Food . became scarce as the war dragged on, so this would have been a . bonus.' Despite the affair, Annie, who was described by her employer as ‘respectable, sober and hard-working’, continued to write regularly to her husband as he fought in France, Greece and Egypt. But in late summer 1917, Annie's carefully constructed world came crashing down when she discovered that she was pregnant. 'It would have been clear that the father was not Annie’s husband – he had been away for 16 months without leave,' says Juliet. 'Annie was shunned by her family and forced to leave her job. She moved out of the East End terrace she’d been sharing with her sister without leaving a forwarding address.' In fact, Annie hadn't moved very far at all, taking her two children and moving in with Luck in a fourth-floor flat in Whitechapel. But even then she wasn't able to escape the opprobrium heaped on her for falling in love with a man not her husband. Tough times: London was subjected to regular Zeppelin bombing attacks during the First World War . Privations: Many amenities, among them London buses which were used to ferry troops, were unavailable . 'There’s another ""d"" word which would have haunted Annie – the notion of disgrace,' adds Juliet. 'It’s not a word we hear so often now, but for much of the 20th century it was a standard insult to women who had fallen foul of the strict moral codes which governed working class families. 'Annie would have been branded a disgrace to herself, to her family, and to her country.' Worse was to come. In July 1918, six weeks after baby Annie Elizabeth was born, Annie received a letter from her husband that announced he was being allowed home from the Front on leave. Convinced that his return would mean being separated from her children and a life in the workhouse, Annie could see only one way out. On the morning of July 18th, police arrived at the flat in Whitechapel to find Annie and her baby lying dead in bed. Both had died from poison. Annie was just 26. 'Well, there are plenty like me,' wrote Annie in what would prove to be her last diary entry. 'I shall not be missed for long.' Luck, then 32, attempted to follow by throwing himself under a train at Aldgate East station but was unsuccessful and instead found himself under arrest for the murder of Annie and her child. Double tragedy: Annie's husband Arthur, already reeling from the horror of the trenches, never recovered . Story: The tragic tale of Annie Baker and Richard Luck has been turned into a novel . Two months later, he was convicted of their murder and spent the rest of the war in prison before being recommended for release in 1921. 'The law stated . that if there was a suicide pact and one person survived, the survivor . was automatically charged with murder,' explains Juliet. 'Richard was sentenced to hang . but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after a . petition was sent to the Home Office. 'In 1921, Richard was recommended . for release, but there the trail goes cold. The most likely explanation is that Richard . changed his name when he was released.' Annie's two children, a son and a daughter, were left to be brought up by relatives while her husband Arthur was devastated by his wife's death. Baker, a decent, straightforward man, was both bewildered by his wife's actions and left distraught by her death which he was told of in a blunt telegram that read: 'Wife and baby dead. Suicide.' According to his granddaughter Joan, Arthur 'never recovered from what happened'. 'He tried to drown his misery with . drink,' adds Juliet. 'He died in hospital in the 1940s.' Annie herself was largely forgotten, sensationalised in media reports at the time but left in the shadows by her own family who wanted nothing more than to forget what had happened. 'I don’t think Annie was a bad or . immoral person so I truly think she reasoned it out and . decided that suicide was the most honourable escape,' says Juliet. 'Poverty plays a huge part. There was simply no money, and once her husband discovered the affair – . he was finally due home on leave in July 1918 - the separation allowance would have been stopped. 'The next option would have been a . home for ""fallen women"" or the workhouse. She would have been separated . from her baby and her older children and she would never have been able . to live down the shame.'

Anne Frank wrote her now-famous diary . while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II. The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from German in 1933 - the same year the Nazis gained control over Germany. Not happy: People took to Twitter to express their dismay over the pop star's disrespectful comment in the Anne Frank House guestbook . By 1940 the Nazi had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped in Amsterdam. In 1942 the family went into hiding in the hidden rooms of Otto Frank's office building, as persecution of the Jewish population increased under the Nazi regime. But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945. Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame. The Anne Frank House has been open to the public as a museum since 1960.

"A delicate pink peony perched atop her Jane Taylor hat and her neat Alexander McQueen coat falling in razor sharp pleated folds to her knees, the Duchess of Cambridge couldn't have chosen a more appropriate ensemble yesterday. From the soft cream colour of the coat came a subtle nod to white, the colour of peace, while the summery bloom echoed the fresh flowers laid on the war memorial at St Symphorien cemetery in Mons by her husband, Prince William. And the Duchess wasn't the only one to send a message with her clothes. Queen Mathilde of the Belgians chose a delicate soft blue, a colour redolent of motherhood, peace and tranquilty.

"A woman in China has undergone surgery to extend her stunted left leg by a huge nine inches. Xu Juan, 21, suffered from a bone infection when she was a child. Due to poor medical facilities in her hometown, her thigh bone was eroded by bacteria. Xu Juan, 21, has undergone surgery to extend her stunted left leg by 23cm so she can walk without crutches . This left her left leg nine inches (23cm) shorter than her right and meant she had to walk with the aid of crutches for most of her life. However, over the years her parents saved everything they could and recently were able to pay for her to have surgery. Dr Hu Yihe said: ‘Her condition was very complicated. As she not only had a shorter leg, but her knee and hip joints were also underdeveloped and had to be replaced. ‘So we made a treatment plan of two phases. The first phase was to extend her left leg and make the two legs evenly long. 'The second phase of surgery was replacing the left knee joint and left hip joint.' Ms Xu had four operations in total between October 2012 and October 2013. To lengthen her leg, a metal cage was fitted to her left leg and each day she had to turn a screw to stretch her leg a little more. Ms Xu had a cage fitted around her leg so that it could be gradually stretched. X-ray (left) shows her leg before treatment and (right) shows it with the metal cage fitted. She also had to have knee and hip replacements . Ms Xu (pictured before her surgery) developed a bone infection when she was a child and poor medical treatment meant a large part of her thigh bone was eaten away by the bacteria . Dr Hu said: ‘After the surgeries, each day Xu Juan needed to turn the toothed gear to extend her left leg 1mm. ‘The extension must go very slowly, as nerves and vessels need time to be extended. If the extension went too fast, the nerves or vessels could snap, causing permanent paralysis.’ It took a year to lengthen Ms Xu’s leg, after which she had surgery to fit an artificial left knee and hip joint in October 2013. Her treatments finally finished at the end of February this year and doctors say that after a few months of rehabilitation, she will be able to walk normally. Ms Xu (pictured after surgery) is expected to be able to walk normal after rehabilitation . Doctor Hu Yihe said: 'Her condition was very complicated. As she not only had a shorter leg, but her knee and hip joints were also underdeveloped and had to be replaced'","Xu Juan developed a bone infection when she was a child .

"Egypt is the latest country to be the target for a futuristic building, designed to be the pinnacle in eco-construction. The multi-billion pound complex, called The Gate Residence, will be built in Cairo and in addition to environmentally-friendly features such as solar panels, wind turbines and heating tubes, the property will house 1,000 apartments. There will also be three levels of offices and even a shopping centre with four levels of underground parking, valet services, babysitting and a 24-hour pharmacy. Called The Gate Residence, the project was designed by architect, Vincent Callebaut and will feature geothermal cooling, solar panels, heater tubes and wind turbines. The property will also house 1,000 apartments, offices and even a shopping centre, while the roof will transform into a community garden, swimming pools and a sports area . The state-of-the-art project was designed by Belgian architect, Vincent Callebaut. Built into the property, windcatchers, geothermal cooling, solar panels, solar heater tubes and wind turbines will generate electricity for the residents and manage the building's temperature and energy waste levels. In Egypt, windcatchers are known as Malqaf and function in three ways - directing airflow down using direct wind entry, directing airflow upwards using a wind-assisted temperature gradient, or directing airflow upwards using a solar-assisted temperature gradient. A series of nine so-called 'megatrees' will be the nine windcatchers for The Gate Residents, and will improve cooling during warm seasons, and night cooling rates. In The Gate Project, Mr Callebaut plans to build air shafts into the cores to naturally cool each apartment. Then, using ground loops, the geothermal heat pumps will move heat energy back and forth between the building and the earth to provide an efficient and environmentally-friendly way of heating and cooling apartments and commercial spaces. They will additionally provide hot water. Windcatchers .

A series of nine so-called 'megatrees' will be the nine windcatchers in the project, and will improve cooling during warm seasons and night cooling rates. Passive geothermal cooling and heating system . Passive Cooling is a technique that controls and movs heat around a building in order to improve indoor temperatures, without using a lot of energy. It works by either stopping heat entering the interior, known as heat gain prevention, or by removing heat from the building, or natural cooling. In The Gate Project, Mr Callebaut plans to build air shafts into the cores to naturally cool each apartment. Then, using ground loops, the geothermal heat pumps will move heat energy back and forth between the building and the earth to provide an efficient and environmentally-friendly way of heating and cooling apartments and commercial spaces.

Then, using ground loops, the geothermal heat pumps will move heat energy back and forth between the building, and the earth, to provide an efficient and environmentally-friendly way of heating and cooling apartments and commercial spaces. They will additionally provide hot water . Solar photovoltaic cells . Conventional solar cells use visible and infrared light to generate electricity, but photovoltaic cells use ultraviolet radiation. In the project, the solar roof will be covered by walkable solar creating shadows above the patios and the promenade. They will generate electricity for the building. The solar cells will be integrated in a double glass layer that will be easy to clean, too. Solar water heating tubes . Solar water heating, or solar hot water systems, are designed to deliver hot water to all the bathrooms and kitchens of the building for most of the year, explained Mr Callebaut. Glass-metal tubes collect heat from the sun, and heating the water will be managed using elliptical shapes covering the rooms in each core on the roof. The primary cause of heat build-up in cities is the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings, explained the architect. The Gate Resident will feature green walls that reduce overall temperatures, and by covering the surface with plants, they will also be a way of recycling water. In the project, the nine megatrees will be covered by living walls (pictured) Vertical axis wind turbines . Vertical-axis wind turbines are a type of turbine where the main rotor shaft is set vertically, and the main components are located at the base of the turbine. This allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground, making it easier to service and repair. These helical twisted wind turbines will be built along the inner street on the roof, to benefit from the winds, and generate electricity. Green/living walls . The primary cause of heat build-up in cities is the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings, explained the architect. The green walls will reduce overall temperatures of these building, and by covering the surface with plants, they will also be a way of recycling water. In the project, the nine megatrees will be covered by living walls. These walls will also be fitted along the inner street. Smart home automation . The technology will be built-in to the offices and apartments, meaning homeowners will be able to control the different zones, rooms and temperatures. Multi-sensors will be used to detect the number of people in a room, motion, temperature, and light levels before adjusting to reach the perfect climate. This is expected to save wasted energy. In the project, the solar roof will be covered by walkable panels creating shadows above the patios and the promenade. They will generate electricity for the building. The roof of the building will be turned into a community garden, complete with orchards, infinity swimming pools and a sports area, and there will be multiple rooftop areas connected by foot bridges. While green walls will reduce overall temperatures of these building, and by covering the surface with plants, they will also be a way of recycling water. Vertical-axis wind turbines (illustrated) are a type of wind turbine where the main rotor shaft is set vertically, and the main components are located at the base of the turbine.

In the project, the nine megatrees will be covered by these living walls, and walls will also be fitted along the inner street. And inside the building, smart home automation technology will be fitted to the offices and apartments, meaning homeowners and workers will be able to control the different zones, rooms and temperatures. Multi-sensors will be used to detect the number of people in a room, motion, temperature, and light levels before adjusting to reach the perfect climate, and this is expected to save wasted energy. In total, the complex will cover 4.8 million square feet (450,000 square metres) and is set to cost £3.9 billion (£4.5 billion Egyptian pounds). In total, the complex will cover 4.8 million square feet (450,000 square metres) and is set to cost £3.9 billion (£4.5 billion Egyptian pounds). Mr Callebaut said work will start on the new building in March next year and it will be completed in 2019 . 'It is time for Cairo to witness the creation of an iconic sustainable building that would express the future of the city,' said Mr Callebaut. 'In the heart of this new Cairo, the Gate Residence is an innovative design idea for a green building, representing the combination of trees and building, and [transforming] the city into a vertical, green, dense and hyper-connected ecosystem.' The ambition of the Gate Project is to create a new prototype of inhabited ecosytem that will create 50 per cent energy savings. The building is also designed to decrease its carbon footprint, and to recycle a part of its own waste, for example. Mr Callebaut said: ‘The main objective behind this urban proposal is to raise awareness of green sustainable architecture to fight against global warming. ‘The project shows a high ambition in green energy and technology. The objective is to create a sustainable landmark in Cairo by transforming this efficient building mass, multiplying the perspective views towards the streets, into a huge urban oasis.' Mr Callebaut said work will start on the new building in March next year. It will be completed in 2019.","Called The Gate Residence, the billion-pound project was designed by Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut .

"The moment you need to send an urgent text is usually the same moment your battery dies. But now U.S. engineers claim to have developed a solution that allows you to generate power using 'thin air.' The technology, known as ‘ambient backscatter’, taps into TV and Wi-Fi signals both for device communication and as a source of power. Scroll down for video . As well as powering your mobile, everyday objects could be enabled with battery-free tags to communicate with each other. For instance, a couch could use ambient backscatter to let the user know where his keys were left. Researchers at Washington University built small, battery-free devices with antennas that can detect, harness and reflect a TV signal, which can be picked up by other similar devices. Two devices where then shown to communicate with each other by reflecting the existing signals to exchange information. ‘We can repurpose wireless signals that are already around us into both a source of power and a communication medium,’ said Shyam Gollakota, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Washington University. ‘It’s hopefully going to have applications in a number of areas including wearable computing, smart homes and self-sustaining sensor networks.’ Using ambient backscatter, these devices can interact with users and communicate with each other without using batteries. They exchange information by reflecting or absorbing pre-existing radio signals . Ambient backscatter transforms existing wireless signals into both a source of power and a communication medium. It enables two battery-free devices to communicate by backscattering existing wireless signals. Since it uses the ambient radio frequency signals that are already around us, it doesn't require a dedicated power infrastructure. Eventually, the technology could lead to . networks of devices and sensors that send data by reflecting existing . signals to exchange information, without the need for batteries. Eventually, the technology could lead to networks of devices and sensors that send data by reflecting existing signals to exchange information, without the need for batteries. ‘Our devices form a network out of thin air,’ said co-author Joshua Smith, a Washington University associate professor of computer science and engineering and of electrical engineering. ‘You can reflect these signals slightly to create a Morse code of communication between battery-free devices.’ It could potentially be built into mobiles phones to provide emergency power when the battery has died. Everyday objects could also be enabled with battery-free tags to communicate with each other. For instance, a couch could use ambient backscatter to let the user know where house keys were left. Researchers demonstrate how one payment card can transfer funds to another card by leveraging the existing wireless signals around them. Ambient RF signals are both the power source and the communication medium . Smart sensors could be built and placed permanently inside any structure, then set to communicate with each other. For example, sensors placed in a bridge could monitor the health of the concrete and steel, then send an alert if one of the sensors picks up a hairline crack. The researchers tested the ambient backscatter technique with credit card-sized prototype devices placed within several feet of each other. For each device the researchers built antennas into ordinary circuit boards that flash an LED light when receiving a communication signal from another device. Groups of the devices were tested in a variety of settings in the Seattle area, including inside an apartment building, on a street corner and on the top level of a parking garage. These locations ranged from less than half a mile away from a TV tower to about 6.5 miles away. VIDEO: How ambient backscatter transforms existing wireless signals into both a source of power and a communication medium . Researchers then demonstrated how one payment card can transfer funds to another card by leveraging the existing wireless signals around them. Ambient radio frequency signals became both the power source and the communication medium. They found that the devices were able to communicate with each other, even the ones farthest from a TV tower. The receiving devices picked up a signal from their transmitting counterparts at a rate of 1 kilobit per second when up to 2.5 feet apart outdoors and 1.5 feet apart indoors. This is enough to send information such as a sensor reading, text messages and contact information. The researchers now hop to advance the capacity and range of the ambient backscatter communication network.","Ambient backscatter uses TV and Wi-Fi signals as a source of power .

"With sunglasses tucked into his shirt, an Australian terrorist smiles as he holds up two decapitated heads for the camera in Syria. Sydney born boxer Mohamed Elomar casually poses with the severed heads in photos posted on Twitter by his friend, convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf. Another image, uploaded on Friday, shows the heads of alleged Syrian solders being impaled on metal railings. Scroll down for video . Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men . Like something out of the 18th century, the heads were left on show in a sickening display that aims to cause terror and fear. The photos were uploaded by terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, alongside disgusting tweets such as 'bucket full of heads any1 in aus want some organs please dont be shy to ask I would love to assist u with body parts [sic]'. His disturbing rant continued 'few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff abuhafs u keep cutting those infidel throats but the last 1 is mine! [sic]' Elomar and Sharrouf, who spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne, are believed to be fighting with terror group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Disturbing: Sharrouf also posted a photo of two men placing severed heads on a metal railing . They are thought to have flown to Syria together late last year after Sharrouf fled the country on his brother Mustafa's passport. Meanwhile, Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 charged with 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'. On Thursday night Attorney General George Brandis's spokesman told The Australian that 'if real, these photos are evidence of serious crimes against Australian law and possible war crimes.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Attorney General's office for further comment. Khaled Sharrouf posted the photos on Twitter alongside captions such as 'this guy lost his head!!! Lol' The convicted terrorist said he wanted to cut 'infidel throats' He directed his tweets to people in Australia and joked about organ donation . Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has threatened the Australian Federal Police and his countrymen on his Twitter account . Sharrouf, also a former Sydney resident, last week taunted Australian police via his social media account, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians. The jihadist is currently in the Middle East fighting with the extremist group after he evaded authorities in December. The tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations. Fatima Elomar hides under a burqa as she emerges from the Downing Centre court complex with her lawyer Zali Burrows (right) and four children after appearing on terrorism related charges . On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'. Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police. 'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said. He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'. On July 14, Sharrouf tweeted he loved to slaughter Australians to the AFP . He said it would have been easy for him to attack Australia if he wanted . These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account. Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts. Speaking to media on Thursday, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'. 'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said. Director General of Security and ASIO chief David Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots. 'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said. When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'.

"A hunter in North Carolina has solved has food bill for the next year after tracking and killing a mammoth wild boar weighing in at over 500 pounds.

Veteran hunter Jett Webb, of Conetoe, North Carolina, bagged the beast last month using his .308 caliber rifle after baiting it for over a month .

Webb estimates that he has got enough meat from the giant hog to feed his family for the next year . Once the beast was dead, it took a major effort to transport it as it took up the entire bed of a pick-up truck . A month ago Webb spotted the wild beast roaming and quickly realized that it was the same behemoth that other members of the White Oak Ranch Hunting Club had been trying to capture for years after it was first spotted on trail cameras. 'The Mohawk down the back,' said Webb, 'the tusks really lean, the muscular big front end. This is far from a domesticated docile pig that we're used to.' Once the beast was dead, Mike Mansell, president of the hunting club, said it took a major effort to transport it. 'It takes your breath away for a second to realize how big this hog is,' he said. 'It took up the entire bed of the pick-up truck.' The boar had very distinct tusks that were really lean, left, while it took tobacco scales to weigh it .

"This is the Dutch millionaire suspected of flooding the continent with 50,000 tons of 'beef' that has had to be urgently recalled amid fears it contains horse meat. Willy Selten, of Oss, Netherlands, is the owner of Wiljo Import en Export BV and Vleesgroothandel Willy Selten - the firms identified earlier this week by Dutch officials as having sold the enormous consignment of suspect beef. Earlier this week the Netherlands Food . and Consumer Product Safety Authority said 370 companies around Europe . and 132 more in the Netherlands were affected by the vast recall, because . they bought meat from the two companies. Accusations: Dutch tycoon Willy Selten owns two meat wholesalers under investigation in the Netherlands . Supplier: Willy Selten owns Vleesgroothandel Willy Selten in Oss, named this week by Dutch authorities as a supplier of the enormous consignment of dubious meat . The British Food Standards Agency has . confirmed that some of the dubious meat, sold by Selten's firms between . January 2011 and February this year - came to factories supplying UK . supermarkets. Last year meat supplied by Selten's wholesaler tested positive for the veterinary painkilling drug phenylbutazone - or bute. This year his factory was shut down temporarily and Selten was taken to court in February, but he was later allowed to begin operating again under strict supervision, according to a report in the Mirror. The report said the tycoon is facing legal action from some employees after failing to pay his workers since the beginning of March. Dubious: Dutch authorities ordered the urgent withdrawal of 50,000 tons of beef supplied by Selten's two firms earlier this week . 'Quiet': Neighbours who live close to Willy Selten's home near Oss, Netherlands, have described him as a 'family man' with an 'aristocratic air of wealth' Father-of-two Selten, described by neighbours in Oss as a 'quiet family man' with an 'aristocratic air of wealth', admitted mixing horsemeat with fat from beef after the court case in February, when he is said to have told a reporter: 'Yes, we've processed horsemeat. 'There was also horsemeat mixed with fat from beef, ordered by and in co-operation with a company that delivered the horsemeat,' he added at the time. Of the decision to allow Selten to continue operating after the court case, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Food Safety Authority said its policy in the Netherlands is that 'everybody should be given a second chance'. Following the recall of thousands of tons of meat this week, the Dutch food authority said in a statement that, because its exact source could not be traced 'its safety cannot be guaranteed'. It added that Dutch authorities had 'no concrete indications that there is a risk to public health'. The British FSA said earlier this week: ‘We have been informed by the Dutch authorities that a small number of UK businesses may potentially have received products from the company implicated in their investigation.'The FSA is following up with these businesses as a matter of urgency to determine if they have received products from the Dutch company.’The suspect shipments began in January 2011, according to the European Commission.A spokesman said: ‘At this stage, the origin of the meat is unknown but the Netherlands authorities acknowledged that horse meat had been mixed with beef.’Other countries known to have bought the affected meat include France, Germany and Spain. Probe: Selten's factories were closed in February and he faced a court case, after which he was allowed to trade again under supervision . Officials in the Netherlands admitted yesterday it was probably too late to recover most of the recalled beef because much of it probably has been eaten in the past two years. Some of the meat may be in frozen meals with long expiration dates still in supermarket freezers, it said. 'We do not know [exactly] how much has been eaten or sold. We expect that a reasonable amount has been eaten because we are talking about [a] period of over two years,' Benno Bruggink, spokesman for the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, said. The food authority fears the beef may have been mixed with horsemeat because Dutch meat exports labelled 'pure beef' tested in March contained horse. There have been no indications the meat is harmful if eaten, but the Dutch food authority said because the origin could not be verified it had been declared unfit for consumption. Dutch authorities have warned the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, which had ordered a recall by national authorities. Willy Selten has not commented on this week's recall.","Willy Selten owns Dutch wholesalers that sold the meat to European firms .

"Former POW Bowe Bergdahl is being allowed to wander off the Texas base where he is being held as part of his 'reintegration', it has emerged. While under supervision, the solider, who was released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees, has visited a library, a supermarket, stores and fast-food chains near to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. During the . trips, Bergdahl sometimes wears civilian clothing and other times . dresses in his military uniform, leading passersby to recognize him and . shake his hand, an Army spokesperson told CNN. The details have emerged as soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 revealed they have still not been contacted by military investigators. Scroll down for video . Questions: A new investigation has been launched to determine whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, deserted his post or went AWOL when he was reported missing in Afghanistan in 2009 . The former . soldiers have said that they believe the Army has failed to contact them . because it has already made up its mind about how Bergdahl ended up in . the hands of the Taliban. Members . of Bergdahl's unit - including the platoon leader - have previously . said they believe he deserted his post in June 2009 before seeking out . the enemy. But when he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, President Obama gave him a hero's welcome and said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health. Two-star general Major General Kenneth Dahl is now conducting a new investigation to determine whether Bergdahl did desert his post or went AWOL, which would suggest he intended to rejoin. But for former platoon leader Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, who left the Army in 2012, the answer is the same as it always was. 'I think it's very clear he . deserted his post,' Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he . was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have . witnesses who saw him walking away. Left out: Former platoon leader and Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, pictured in a previous Fox interview, said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened . 'And if you’re walking away in one of . the worst, most dangerous areas of Afghanistan without your weapon and . gear, I don’t believe you’re planning on coming back.' Former Army Sgt. Evan Buetow . Of the investigation, he added: 'They've already concluded what they want to be said. They know exactly what happened.' Former Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant also said he had not been contacted by Army officials, but said there are probably still sworn statements by the unit's members made after he left the post. 'I have confidence that they're going to do what’s right,' Vierkant said. 'I just feel this should've happened a long time ago and it should've been public.' Vierkant also believes that Bergdahl deserted his unit, which means he should be court martialed. Speaking out: Former Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant, pictured in a previous interview on CNN, also said he had not been contacted by Army officials and believes that Bergdahl deserted the unit . Bergdahl is . now receiving outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio and . has ventured off base to the library, a supermarket, stores and . restaurants as part of his reintegration process. After his reintegration process, he will be assigned to an Army unit, according to the official. But if Army officials determine that he did desert, Buetow said the one-time 'good soldier' should be court-martialed, demoted and dishonorably discharged .

When he threatened security workers, a police officer working in the network's security detail knocked the knife from Johnson's hand, according to the New York Post. Johnson was swiftly arrested and taken to the Midtown South police station where he allegedly told investigators he wanted to kill Strahan. A studio source told The Post that Strahan, a former NFL star, was not in danger or aware of the . incident until later in the afternoon. Members of the public were not affected. 'An individual lunged at one of our employees and was heroically tackled by a police officer,' ABC News' Heather Riley told The Wrap. 'We understand the man was taken in for psychiatric evaluation.

"The French government is coming under fire from World War II vets - nearly all of them in their 90s and 100s - who say the European nation is breaking its promise to fly them to Normandy to celebrate the 70th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, 1944, 73,000 American troops landed in northern France and eventually helped liberate the nation from four years of Nazi occupation. Now, at least one US Congressman says France is reneging on its obligation to the few remaining veterans who stormed the beachheads on Normandy. Some 73,000 Americans landed in France on D-Day and helped to liberate the nation after four years of Nazi occupation . Representative Michael Grimm told the New York Post that France should keep its promise and foot the bill for combat veterans who fought in Normandy to fly to France. 'Our chief-of-staff heard it from the French Embassy in DC - that they would be flown out to France,' spokesman Nick Iacono told the newspaper. But a French Embassy spokesman told the Post that the nation had never made such a promise. 'France was supposed to pay for our airfare, hotel and transportation,' Theresa Tarangelo told the Post. 'Now they’re telling us they have nothing to do with it . . . It’s really frustrating.' Ms Tarangelo's father,  Felice John Tulli, landed on Normandy on D-Day Plus One. His unit didn't face the intense firefight of those who breached the Nazi beachheads, but he still saw heavy action as the Allies drove the Nazis out of France. He is now 90 years old.

US Army Master Sergeant Manuel Perez, whose job is to coordinate between D-Day families and the French government, said it was 'common knowledge' that the French government would pay travel expenses for veterans and their spouses to fly to France for the D-Day commemorations this year - up to $7,000 in travel expenses. After all, he says, the government did it for the 60th anniversary of D-Day in 2004. Now Mr Tulli and his family are pooling their finances so that he can be in Normandy to honor the men he served with one last time.","Congressman Michael Grimm says the French government promised to fly veterans of Operation Overlord to France for an anniversary celebration .

"The video of the moment when a gay rights activist heckled the First Lady was caught on tape and has now been released to show the tense exchange. After she was interrupted, Michelle Obama threatened to leave the Democratic National Committee fundraiser unless the activist, identified later as Ellen Sturtz, was removed. 'It felt like she was within a few inches – in my face,' Ms Sturtz told ABC News, in an account that several witnesses have corroborated. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The beginning: Michelle Obama was speaking at a DNC fundraiser on Tuesday when she was interrupted by a heckler . Taking action: She then stepped down from the platform and went right up to the heckler and had words before walking in the other direction and flashing her hand . The video, obtained by CNN, shows how the First Lady got down from her platform and went directly over to the heckler and told her to stop or else she was going to leave and allow her to finish. The crowd cheered for Mrs Obama and told the heckler to stop talking. The First Lady then walked aside, going over to talk to other supporters briefly- as if to shake off the incident- before returning to the lectern. Starting off smiling: The First Lady approached the heckler with a smile but when the woman would not stop Mrs Obama turned stiff . Losing her cool: The heckler said that the First Lady 'got up in her face' Striking a deal: She offered the choice of her leaving or the heckler . With the crowd cheering for her, she headed back on stage to continue the talk on education . Moments before the confrontation, . Sturtz had interrupted Obama to demand that her husband sign an . executive order barring discrimination by federal contractors based on . sexual orientation. Don't mess: Mrs Obama said dealing with hecklers was 'one thing I'm not good at' 'One . of the things I don't do well is this,' Mrs Obama replied to loud . applause, according to a pool report. 'Listen to me or you can take the . mic, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.' The . crowd urged the first lady to stay, and she returned to the podium to . continue speaking. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later said . that Mrs Obama handled the interruption 'brilliantly.' Sturtz . described herself to ABC News as an 'old, grey-haired lesbian' and said . she felt compelled to interrupt Mrs Obama because she doesn't feel she . has the time to wait around for action on gay rights. 'I’m too old to wait for it,' she said. 'I don’t want to see us continue to be second-class citizens.' Sturtz is an activist for the pro-LGBT rights group GetEQUAL and she was one of four protestors a the event. But when the White House's transcript arrived, The Daily Caller . reported Tuesday night, it didn't include any indication of an . acrimonious exchange -- and was missing Mrs. Obama's threat to leave the . event. The only indication in that transcript that anything was amiss is a note about an '(Inaudible audience interruption.)' Back to the routine: After asking the audience if they wanted the heckler to talk or for the First Lady to continue speaking, she decided to go back up on stage . 'I lived and worked in the closet, hiding who I was in order to earn a living,' Sturtz said in a statement late Tuesday night. GetEQUAL activist Ellen Sturtz heckled Michelle Obama on Tuesday night, demanding that the president sign an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating in their hiring on the basis of sexual orientation . 'I had planned to speak tonight with DNC officials but, as the First Lady was talking about our children's future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives, I simply couldn't stay silent any longer.' 'I'm looking ahead at a generation of young people who could live full, honest, and open lives with the stroke of the President's pen,' she insisted. The home where the heckling happened . belongs to power couple Karen Dixon and Nan Schaffer, formerly of . Chicago, who have hosted fundraisers for the Obamas in the past, . including one that raised $1.4 million for the president's reelection . campaign in February 2012.

Her spouse, Schaffer, is a . veterinarian who works to preserve the rhino population through . artificial insemination. She is also a minority shareholder in Windy . City Media Group and founded Outlines, a Chicago newspaper, in 1987. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney took an oddly coincidental . question earlier in the day during his regularly scheduled briefing . about the same discrimination issue that had Sturtz shouting at the top . of her lungs.

'I don't have any . updated status on that for you,' Carney said. 'I can tell you that the . president has long supported, as you know, an inclusive Employment . Non-Discrimination Act. ... And his administration will continue to work . to build support for it.' White House press secretary Jay Carney took a moment Tuesday from his 'patent troll' discussion to parry a question about the presidents plan to ban federal contractors' workplace discrimination against gays . 'The president's record on support for LGBT rights is significant and well known,' Obama's chief spokesman added. Mr. Obama, he said, 'believes that the right approach to this problem is an . inclusive piece of legislation, and that’s the approach that we're . taking.  It was the approach that we took with repeal of ""don't ask, . don't tell.""  And we continue to support this effort.'","First lady loses her cool and said: 'Listen to me or you can take the mic, but I'm leaving.

"A horrifying video has emerged of three men being publicly executed in a town square in Syria.

Posted on the internet this week, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed Tuesday's killings. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: Video has emerged of three men being executed in a public square in Syria . The two and a half minute clip shows three soldiers sitting on a plinth in the centre of the square, surrounded by masked gunmen. They are wearing green blindfolds and holding their hands together anxiously as a crowd gathers in the background. A masked gunman can be seen standing next to a van, reading from a piece of paper - it looks as if he is reading into a microphone. Announcement: Leading up to the shooting a masked gunman can be seen standing next to a van, reading from a piece of paper . Killed: After the speaker gives a gesture, a man wearing a dark flowing robe walks up to the first victim and shoots him in the head at close range, before he falls back.

He then moves along the line and shots the other two men. The trio are seen lying on the ground twitching as more men pump bullets into them while the militants raise their weapons in celebration. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said: 'Rebel fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Bilad al-Sham (Syria) have summarily executed three men in the middle of a square in Raqqa city,' the Observatory said. Horrific: The amateur video posted on the Internet on Sunday shows Khalid al Hamad, a founder of the rebel Farouq Brigade who is well known to journalists as an insurgent from Homs, cutting into the torso of a dead soldier . Gory: Brandishing the organs for the camera to see, Al Hamad  continues his rant against Assad's government . 'The jihadis stated that the detainees were officers from the Syrian army.' The video is the latest in a series of horrifying videos to emerge from the war-torn country. Earlier this week a clip emerged of a Syrian rebel filmed cutting out and eating the lung of a dead government soldier. The man in the brutal video identified himself as Khalid al Hamad and insists that the brutality of the regime had driven him to the extreme act. He was seen standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while ranting against President Bashar al Assad. Using a knife, the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog.' He then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite.

President Barack Obama and Western leaders had warned Bashar al-Assad . that using chemical weapons would be crossing a 'red line.' Injured: . A video posted on Facebook and YouTube appears to show victims of a . Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth suggesting the use . of sarin gas last month . If the the latest claims are correct it could lead to greater Western military involvement in the two-year war. Intelligence . gleaned by both the UK and US indicated there is evidence that the . increasingly beleaguered regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad had . used the weapons and in particular the devastating nerve agent sarin, . officials said . Last . month two Syrian officials have denied the government has used chemical . weapons against rebel forces, saying the regime had no need for them. Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama has said . that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a 'game changer' while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said . the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for . their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalist . Syrian . official Sharif Shehadeh called the U.S. claims 'lies' and likened them . to false accusations that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction . ahead of the U.S. invasion of that country. The . CIA believes Syria has had a chemical weapons programme for years. There is grave concern in the UK and US that its stockpile of chemical . weapons – approximately 1,000 tons, stored in 50 towns – could fall into . the hands of Al Qaeda to be turned on Western targets. Last . month a video posted on the Facebook page of a British-trained doctor . appeared to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at . the mouth and showing symptoms consistent with a chemical weapons . attack. Witnesses said that containers were dropped from an aircraft and scattered their contents across the area. Battle: The mother of a Syrian rebel cleaning a rifle, in Aleppo, Syria . The video was posted on the Facebook page of British-trained doctor Niazi Habash, who treated some of the Aleppo victims. He . said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including . foaming at the mouth, constricted pupils and difficulty breathing. They were treated using chemical weapons antidote Atropine, Dr Habash claims. Experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on Khan al-Assad, near Aleppo. In the April 13 assault, 15 people were injured.

He . told the Telegraph: From what we've seen and the descriptions of the . containers being dropped from the air, it certainly seems that the . regime is using sarin in an unprepared state in these attacks. 'But, as in the Tokyo subway bombings, sarin does not need to be weaponised and placed in missiles to kill. 'It is still lethal when people are exposed to it.' UK . Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last month that a soil sample . taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent.

"They had sworn their loyalty to her . father. They risked their necks in his name, too. There was only one . guest of honour they all really wanted to see yesterday. And her bow to . them and to their fallen comrades said it all. If . the protocol and the crowd control fell short (to be honest, at times . it fell apart), it certainly didn’t bother the Queen as she was thronged . by her father’s men yesterday. And . after a day of emotion, frantic diplomacy – enlivened by the presence . of both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders – and some delightfully barmy . French theatricals, the 70th anniversary of D-Day concluded last night . with a forceful and personal speech from the Queen. Cheers: The Queen toasts President Hollande during the state banquet held at Elysee Palace in Paris. In a powerful concluding speech, she said 'Everything we do, we do for the young' Toast: The Royal raised her glass with the French leader at the elaborate venue. She also said: 'Each year has  compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War' Tribute: Hollande said HRH 'personified the phrase Keep Calm and Carry On' in a warm toast at the event . Conversation: The Queen listened carefully to Mr Hollande during the banquet - where foie gras was served . ‘The true measure of all our actions . is how long the good in them lasts,’ she declared. ‘Each year has . compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World . War. Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in . 700 years as they do after 70.’ Noting . ‘the joy of becoming a great-grandmother’, the 88-year-old Queen added a . telling sentiment that will, no doubt, be much quoted by future . historians: ‘Everything we do, we do for the young.’ To . Normandy’s beaches had come the grandest gathering of world leaders . since the London Olympics. It included seven monarchs and ten . presidents, assorted prime ministers and cheeses of great magnitude from . a couple of dozen governments and armed forces. Yet the true stars of the show were those who had been on these very sands 70 years ago this very dawn. They . ‘marched’ through the streets of Bayeux, feted by flag-waving children . and cries of ‘Merci’ as they made their way to Normandy’s largest . Commonwealth cemetery. There, . they were joined by the one head of state who could well recall every . moment of that longest day; who served in uniform; who heard her father . broadcast to the nation that night; and who has always had a . distinguished war veteran at her side – as he was yesterday. The . arrival of the Queen and Prince Philip was heralded by a full quartet . from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight – two Spitfires, a Dakota and . the mighty Lancaster.

Salute: Former sailor Peter Smoothy aged 89 from Herne Bay, Kent pays his respects to fallen comrades . The . sound of their Merlin engines and the sight of the Monarch, unmissable . in bright green, galvanised several old chaps up and out of their . wheelchairs. Helpers sprung . into action. They were struggling to their feet again as the bugle . sounded the Last Post and the Queen laid the first of many wreaths, . followed by the Prince of Wales, the Prime Ministers of Britain, . Australia and France and the Governor-General of New Zealand. And once the formalities were over, everyone wanted to have a word with the Sovereign. ‘My . Dad’s meeting the Queen!’ shouted a lady from Southend charging through . the crowd with a mobile phone. Don Sheppard, of the Southend branch of . the Normandy vets, was indeed having a word. Display: Thousands of attendees enjoyed a fantastic firework display at the International D-Day commemoration ceremony on Sword Beach . Show: Alpha jets, part of the Patrouille Acrobatique de France, leave trails of smoke in the colors of the French flag during the ceremony . So . was Ronald Elliott, 92, from Yorkshire, who had come ashore on Juno . Beach. Staying on the safe topic of weather, he said: ‘You didn’t order . it did you?’ ‘I might have,’ the Queen replied. Everyone . had a story to tell. I met Jim Booth who sat in a midget sub waiting to . guide the D-Day fleet. French-born Louisette Whitmore sheltered a badly . injured RAF officer after his plane came down; he became her husband. David . Cameron heard Leonard Bloomfield, 93, had served with the Duke of . Edinburgh in Gibraltar and steered him through the crowd to reunite him . with the Duke. Many veterans . wondered if there was something different about the place this year. Indeed there was. A few years ago, the Commonwealth War Graves . Commission noticed many of its Second World War graves were . deteriorating at a much faster pace than those from 1914-18. Group: The Queen and President Hollande stand before sitting at the top table along with Prince Philip, right . Royal welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip arrive at the Parisian venue this evening for a state banquet . Dressed for the occasion: Her Majesty wore an elaborate white gown and her crown for the Paris event . Greet: The Queen shakes hands with President Hollande - tonight's host - while Philip leaves the royal vehicle in the background. Her Majesty requested that Foie Gras was on the menu tonight . It . turned out that as Britain emerged from chaos in 1945, Whitehall – . shamefully – requisitioned all top grade Portland stone to repair . government buildings. The commission ended up with the cast-offs. So it has spent two years and £4million replacing 8,000 of the most vulnerable Normandy graves. Among . those paying their respects at a new headstone was four-year-old Megan . Grey, plus doll, whose great-grandfather died on D-Day. After . meeting the commission team, the Queen went on to lunch with all the . heads of state at the Chateau de Benouville, a wartime hospital. First . came a group photo at which she was glad-handed by new Ukrainian . president Petro Porochenko. Hellos: The royal couple were actually a few minutes late for the state banquet - most likely delayed following a long day of arrangements for the 70th anniversary of D Day . Arrival: Hollande, who is single and so is attending the event alone, steps aside to allow The Queen and Prince Philip to walk up the red carpet towards the elaborate Palace . All . eyes were on Russia’s Vladimir Putin, not least because of the Prince . of Wales’s observations on his foreign policy. To the relief of British . diplomats, the Prince was lunching with veterans elsewhere and Mr Putin . kept a respectful distance. To be on the safe side, the Queen made sure . she was deep in conversation with President Obama as they went through . to lunch. French diplomats . had thought long and hard about where to seat Mr Putin. The solution was . to slot him near the top of the table but in tranquil waters – between . the Queen of Denmark and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg. After . lunch, the leaders made the short journey to Sword Beach. Here the . hosts erected a vast arena where the 3rd British Infantry Division came . ashore on D-Day morning. A thousand British troops were killed or . wounded on this spot, although the landings were more successful on . Sword than anywhere else. This . was where Lord Lovat and his commandos came ashore to the sound of Bill . Millin as he marched up and down playing the bagpipes. Smiles: The Queen stops at the top of the steps outside Elysee Palace for photographs. The royals will dine on a menu of saddle of lamb and garden vegetables followed by Bourbon vanilla ice cream . Event: The Queen smiled for cameras outside the Parisian location. Hollande tonight said Her Majesty embodied the phrase 'Keep Calm and Carry On' in a warm toast to the royal . There were pipes once more here yesterday. President Francois  Hollande could have staged this ‘spectacle’ anywhere along D-Day’s 50-mile battlefront. But the French made much of the fact that they wanted to arrange things around the Queen. This had been a British beach. And, as by far the longest-serving head of state present, she had the honour of arriving last. It seems pre-ordained that every anniversary of D-Day should turn into a shambles. It happened on the 50th and 60th and yesterday was no different. As 7,000 guests sat baking in 26-degree heat, the world leaders ended up spending an extra hour over lunch. We later learned Presidents Putin and Porochenko had been having a meeting at the chateau. This might have been of great significance  in geo-political terms. But it was  of little solace to more than 1,000  veterans waiting for the show. Worthy of note: the warm applause for Angela Merkel. No German Chancellor has ever had a welcome like that at one of these events. Also worthy of note: Barack Obama chewing gum throughout. Official: The Queen and Mr Hollande pose for a few pictures before making their way in to the top table . Guests: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and his wife Anne Gravoin stop for photographs on the red carpet . It was fabulously French. Black-clad dancers bounced on stage depicting the Nazi conquest while pyrotechnics did the rest. Eventually, they were replaced by D-Day dancers plus much waving of flags. Finally, all the veterans took a bow, to thunderous applause. The Queen’s state visit to France continues this morning. Last night, she was the guest of honour at an Elysee Palace banquet. The day, she said, had left her filled ‘with sorrow and regret, remembering the loss of so many fine young soldiers, sailors and airmen; with pride, at the sheer courage of the men who stormed those beaches, embodied in the veterans among us; and with thankfulness’. D-Day, she observed, reminded us of a great truth: ‘We should weigh our actions not by immediate acclaim, but by their benefit for future generations.’","Queen arrived at Elysee Palace, Paris, for state banquet hosted by Hollande .

"Photographer Eric Lafforgue has pictured unique tribes in remote locations around the world but when he first tried to seek out the Rashaida in Eritrea, Africa, he couldn't find a driver willing to take him. Then when he tried to meet them at a camel market in the United Arab Emirates he was warned by Pakistani workers: 'Do not try to meet them, do not talk to them, they are crazy!' Eric told MailOnline: 'When I first planned to visit the . Rashaida, I couldn't find a driver who was willing to . take me to their villages in the nearby desert. They regard them as . dangerous ""gypsies"". ""They will rob you and then try to steal my . taxi,"" they all told me. Simple life: The Rashaida people live in tents in the desert despite having vast sums of money acquired through selling camels . Travellers: The nomadic tribe came to Eritrea from Saudi Arabia about 200 years ago . Fearsome reputation: Some members of the tribe have been known to be involved in human trafficking and torture . Striking look: The women wear a veil which covers their nose (a very sexual facial feature in their culture) and their mouth, but not all of their hair . Young bride: A woman must be married by the age of 16 or she is considered too old to be a wife . Battle of the sexes: Daughters are desired over sons because their mother will be paid thousands when she marries. Marriages can be arranged when girls are as young as six . 'After tough negotiations, one driver finally . agreed to drive me to the Rashaida, but he dropped me off 200 meters . from the camp.' So why have the Rashaida, who have led a nomadic lifestyle in the barren and hostile desert for centuries, built up such a fearsome reputation? The Rashaida originally came from Saudi Arabia but can now be found in areas including Egypt, Libya and the Sudan. They move from place to place in search of grass for their camels - which helps them make a fortune as they can sell their prized animals to wealthy sheikhs for as much as £16,000 each. Despite their wealth, they live in tents with no electricity and no running water - although some do embrace modern technology in the form of cars and mobile phones. When Eric eventually meets the Rashaida, he is told by Salam Swalim Muhammed, the chief of the Massawa Rashaida village in Eritrea, of their business selling camels: 'Yes it is a lot of money, but you know . we have big families to take care of! We work a lot, . trading with Yemen, Libya, Sudan, Saudi Arabia...' Mobile business: The Rashaida travel from place to place seeking grass for their prized camels . Lucrative creatures: Their camels can be sold for £16,000 each . Wary: The Rashaida can frequently be found at camel markets- although not everyone is brave enough to approach them . Traditional: The tribe earn a fortune from their camels but still live primitive lifestyles . The chief revealed that they shun much of modern technology, including TV because 'the . television shows sickness and disasters. Instead of buying . sickness with your money, it is better to live happily, peacefully, and . freely.' However, as the people's fearsome reputation suggests, not all members of the Rashaida live as peacefully as Muhammed suggests. A United Nations report explains that . they are the master smugglers of everything from guns to people, getting involved in hostage taking and human trafficking. Eric explains: 'Rashaida also make their money . from a less legitimate business. In the . refugee camps around Kassala in Sudan, Eritrean people attempting to . move on are kidnapped by the Rashaida. Once they kidnap an . Eritrean, the victim will have to ask their relatives to wire ransom money . to one of the kidnapper’s accounts around the world. If there is any . delay in transferring the money, the victim will be physically abused. Testimonies say the more the money transfer is delayed, the more the . victim is tortured.' One reason the Rashaida need money is to marry. The groom must pay up to £40,000 to the bride-to-be's mother for her hand in marriage. Such marriages can be arranged when a girl is as young as six. If a woman is not married by the time she is 16, it's considered too late for her to become a wife. Beliefs: The people abide to Saudi Sharia law . Segrated: Rashaida live in isolated communities, preferring not to live with people of other tribes . The men 'look Arab and wear loose white clothing'. Their simple appearance belies their wealth . Many of the tribe shun modern technology as they prefer to 'live happily, peacefully, and freely' Different sides: While those pictured are peaceful, others are master smugglers of everything from guns to people . Muhammed explained to Eric that daughters are desired over sons because of the riches they can bring via marriage. If added: 'If a man wants to get married but isn’t . rich enough to afford the wife, then the Rashaida from Libya, Sudan, . and Saudi Arabia contribute so the groom can afford his bride.' Eric saw no evidence of the Rashaida's wealth or violent pastimes when he was invited to join Muhammed to drink tea under his tent, when he eventually tracked down one of the tribes in Eritrea. He learnt that the Rashaida stay in isolated communities, preferring not to live with people of other tribes. But says . Muhammed: 'When we travel, we will be welcomed everywhere by other . Rashaida.' Some Rashaida have moved out of the desert to live in towns  such as Kassala in Sudan so their children can go to school. But one ten-year-old boy told Eric that he prefers living in the desert despite the harsh conditions. Describing the enigmatic Rashaida people he met during his stay, Eric said: 'Rashaida men have no special appearance: they look Arab and wear loose white clothing. On the other hand, the women are very striking. They all wear colourful traditional dresses and a veil which covers their nose (a very sexual facial feature in their culture) and their mouth, but not their hair. 'This is rather unusual in the Muslim culture. With long hair, some of them have an amazing style with long black locks jutting out in all directions. 'However, since the Rashaida follow Saudi Sharia law, and more and more have enough money to make the Hadj to Mecca, they come back with new precepts from Saudi Arabia, asking their women to cover the hair.'","Photographer Eric Lafforgue pictured the nomadic tribe .

"In a recording obtained by the Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of a looming £30bn-a-year black hole in the Health Service’s finances . The NHS is about to run out of cash and ‘absolutely vital services’ will have to be slashed unless billions can be saved, a health minister has claimed. In a recording obtained by the Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of a looming £30billion-a-year black hole in the Health Service’s finances. By 2021, he said, the scale of the funding gap threatens ‘dire’ consequences for patients. It is the first time a minister at the Department for Health has admitted the financial problems facing the NHS. Speaking at the Orange Book Conference – a Liberal Democrat event held last month – Mr Lamb, minister of state at the Department of Health, said that the NHS faces a ‘funding gap of £30billion per year’ which austerity measures meant the Government would not be able to fill. ‘If you take health…by 2021 if things carry on as they are, there is a funding gap of £30billion, £30billion per year, and so to be in the position to suddenly find vast amounts of extra money to throw at service, and given the state of public finances and indeed the changing ratio of people of working age to people who aren’t, quite dramatic in our society, that seems to be an unlikely prospect,’ he said. ‘The potential consequences of the status quo are that across the country you lose absolutely vital services which people rely on, and for me the consequences of that are too dire to contemplate. ‘So there is an absolute imperative that we think about how we get a better value from public services.’ NHS England has warned that within the next few years the service is ‘about to run out of cash in a very serious fashion’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied there is any existing black hole in the NHS, and insisted the Government is making savings to contend with increasing demand for services. Asked if he would have to request a bailout from Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Hunt told Radio 4’s Today: ‘No, and I think it is wrong to describe it as a black hole. ‘Every year, because of an ageing population, we have additional demand for services and we have to make efficiency savings. Over this Parliament, we have found about £20billion of efficiency savings which we are investing in more doctors and nurses on the front line. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied there is any existing black hole in the NHS, and insisted the Government is making savings to contend with increasing demand for services . ‘And every year we have a challenge in the NHS to find those efficiency savings. ‘We have had a very difficult few years as a country but every family up and down the country has learned to live within its budget, and we too must live within our budget in the NHS. We are doing that and I’m sure we will continue to do that.’ Some members of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet want the party to commit to increasing National Insurance by a penny to pay for extra NHS spending. The rise would replicate Gordon Brown’s 1 per cent rise, which was introduced in the 2002 Budget to increase investment in the Health Service. David Cameron told MPs this week that for the first time, the independent Commonwealth Fund had ranked the UK’s Health Service as the best in the world. ‘It has happened only under this Government,’ he said. But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘You can’t trust the Tories with the NHS. ‘Despite hubristic claims to the contrary, we now know there is a crisis, and it’s due to the bad decisions and botched reforms David Cameron has made.’","In recording obtained by Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of crisis .

"Using a rusting pair of scissors to trim his greying beard, Vasile declares his love for the Queen.‘It is the Queen who helps and protects her people,’ he says, brushing the hair clippings from the duvet under which he has been sleeping rough. ‘The Queen cares for her people — everyone knows that. That is why we came from Romania, so she can help us, too.’ The 52-year-old Roma gipsy is one of about 30 Romanians sleeping on a now grubby patch of grass on a central reservation in London’s Park Lane near Marble Arch. Scene of squalor: Birds peck their way between the beggars sleeping rough in Park Lane - one of London's most expensive addresses . The rag-tag encampment with rows of soiled duvets, battered suitcases and cardboard boxes is in stark contrast to the nearby luxury car showrooms and pristine Georgian terraces. As the city comes to life shortly after dawn, bare feet are thrust into grimy trainers and flip-flops, and lighters flare as the first cigarettes of the day are sparked up. The younger women are dispatched to get coffee from a café while the older women roll up the duvets and cram them into dustbin liners. Early morning joggers in Hyde Park have to dodge the Romanians who have gone to find a secluded spot to use as a toilet. Sleeping it off: A Romanian uses duvets and a mattress to turn a park bench into a bed. 'We're waiting for your Government to give us jobs and somewhere to live,' says their leader . Vasile, a stocky man with deep brown skin, grins to reveal a solitary crooked tooth. He acts as leader of the group and with a single wave of his hand silences younger men who dare to speak. ‘We want to find work. We did not come here to commit crime or beg,’ he says. ‘At the moment the only thing we do all day is scavenge for food in the rubbish bins. ‘We hope that someone from the Government will intervene and give us work and shelter, somewhere to live.’ Despite his protestations, it is believed that some of the Romanians beg on the streets of the West End. They have also been linked to pickpocketing gangs, as well as age-old scams such as pretending to have found a ‘gold’ ring on the street which they then sell for £20 to someone gullible. Rise and shine: The women prepare to spend the day begging for money and scavenging for food . Philippa Roe, leader of Westminster City Council, says: ‘There is an influx of these Romanians every year and it is a source of absolute frustration. The Government has to do more. 'I think we are particularly vulnerable and the UK may be an easy touch compared to other countries. There’s also a sense of intimidation with aggressive begging. ‘It is costing the council a huge amount of money to tackle the problem and that’s money we do not have. The residents and business community are not happy.’ Vasile, a father of four, arrived from Botosani, northern Romania, by bus at Victoria coach station just over a month ago. He and his family decided to sleep rough in Marble Arch because it is near a series of subways that offer shelter if it rains. First cigarette of the day: A gipsy lights up while another huddles in blankets among the camp's detritus . Oxford Street, Green Park and Hyde Park are minutes away, as well as some of the most affluent neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Marylebone. Councillor Nickie Aiken, responsible at Westminster for community protection, says: ‘We are spending thousands of pounds cleaning up after rough sleepers. ‘The particular problem here is largely with Roma people who have Romanian identity cards, some of whom drift into low-level crime, nuisance and intimidation.’ Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa-free travel to the UK in 2007 when their countries joined the EU. Bagged up: It is the women's job to put the duvets in plastic sacks to keep dry . The open-borders policy means they can enter Britain legally and then have three months to prove they can support themselves. If not, the UK Border Agency can have them removed. Many people are concerned that the crisis of Eastern Europeans living on the streets will deepen from January 2014 when all 29 million citizens of Romania and Bulgaria gain full rights to live, work and claim benefits here under EU ‘freedom of movement’ rules. Vasile, who refused to give his full name, remains determined to stay in the capital over the summer.‘I haven’t been stopped by the police,’ he says. ‘London is very beautiful. Perhaps the Queen will drive past us one day and take pity on us. That is what we hope.’","A group of 30 Romanians are camped out near  Marble Arch in London .

"The bugle that sounded the catastrophic orders for the Charge of the Light Brigade has emerged on TV’s Antiques Roadshow. The instrument was carried into the suicidal battle of the Crimea War in 1854 by Private William Brittain, Lord Cardigan’s duty trumpeter. He took orders directly from Lord Cardigan, who led the cavalry, and blew on his bugle several times to signal the men to walk, canter, trot and charge at the Russian guns. Scroll down for video . Historic: The bugle that sounded the catastrophic orders for the Charge of the Light Brigade where 245 men were injured has emerged on TV's Antiques Roadshow . Damage: The instrument, pictured above showing a cleave made by a Russian Cossack's lance, would have been carried and played by Private William Brittain at the time of battle . Some 673 cavalrymen headed into what became known as the ‘Valley of Death’ and were mercilessly cut down by the Russians. There were 245 casualties which included 118 dead. Trumpeter Brittain was mortally wounded in the battle and taken to the same hospital where Florence Nightingale served, along with his trusty instrument. He later died from his wounds and the bugle was given to his family. It was bought at auction by a publican from Newcastle in the early 20th century and then donated to the Queens Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum in 1964. Iconic: Bill Harryman talks to Capt Nick Holtby about the historic bugle on the show - due to air on Sunday . Sound of battle: Capt Nick Holtby - who will play the horn to finish the show this weekend - attempts a blast on the historic bugle . A large hole on its horn end is said to have been caused by a Russian Cossack who used his lance to try and cut the bugle from Brittain but was unsuccessful. Captain Nick Holtby, the curator of the museum, took the brass instrument along to a recent Antique’s Roadshow event. Although the value of it cannot be given ahead of this Sunday’s show on BBC1, it is worth many thousands of pounds. Bill Merriman, from the Antiques Roadshow, said: 'This is a fantastic piece of iconic British military history. Painting: A painting of the Charge of the Light Brigade which hangs in the National Army Museum in Chelsea . Carnage: The Charge of the Light Brigade, in 1854, is one of Britain's most notorious military disasters . 'You can reach out and actually touch history with this and it’s fantastic.' The Charge of the Light Brigade was the bloodiest of the 1854 Crimean War. The charge was part of the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October. On the fateful day, Brittain - instructed by Lord Cardigan - would have signaled for the cavalry to walk down into the so-called 'Valley of Death'. He then sounded the bugle for charge, taking the men further into the valley where they were cut down by the Russians. There were 245 casualties, which included 118 dead. According to some sources, the massacre can be blamed on confusion surrounding the order to attack and the relationship between George Bingham GCB, the 3rd Earl of Lucan and Lord Cardigan. The two didn't like each other - which made for turbulent working conditions. Trumpeter Brittain was mortally . wounded and taken to Florence . Nightingale's hospital. He later died from his wounds. The bugle, which the Private had taken to hospital with him, was given to his family following his death. It . was bought at auction by a publican from Newcastle in the early 20th . century before being pass on the actor Laurence Harvey. It was then donated to the Queens Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire . Yeomanry Museum in 1964. The massacre at Balaclava in the Crimea was blamed on the relationship between Field Marshall George Bingham GCB, the 3rd Earl of Lucan, who was in overall command, and his brother-in-law, Lord Cardigan. The two men didn’t like each other which led to confusion surrounding the order to attack. Capt Holtby said: 'William Brittain was Lord Cardigan’s duty trumpeter on the day of the charge. 'When Cardigan gave the fateful order to go down the valley it would have been for the cavalry to walk. 'William Brittain raised this bugle and his signal was picked up by other trumpeters in the other regiments and they relayed the call. 'It started off as an advanced walk and Brittain then sounded the bugle for canter and then the charge. 'He was unhorsed and badly wounded by the last volley fired by the Don Cossack battery. 'He was picked up by comrades who started the retreat and brought him back to the British lines. 'He was taken to Scutari where he was nursed by Florence Nightingale but sadly died. 'But the kept remained with him all the time and that was passed to his family.' In the 1960s the bugle was sold at auction and bought by the actor Laurence Harvey, who was hoping to star in a film of the charge. He presented it to the museum in 1964. Capt Holtby said: 'It is a bit battered and it does have a hole in it from where a Russian lancer tried to pick it up off the floor but failed.' Viewers of the Antiques Roadshow will see Capt Holtby blow the bugle to signal the end of Sunday’s show.","Historic instrument carried into bloody battle of Crimea War in 1854 .

"It has long been assumed that J. Crew Factory simply sells old, unwanted stock at a heavily discounted price. But these 'deals' might not be what they seem. Rather, the outlet store is actually selling knock-offs of its own products, creating a separate line of lower-quality goods that look similar to what can be found in the main retail store. According to Buzzfeed, most outlet items from J. Crew, Gap and even Off 5th are simply 'based on (full-price) products sold in previous seasons'. Spot the difference: J. Crew's linen Carrie Dot . dress from last summer, $148 (left) is available online at J. Crew . Factory for $104.50 (right), however the outlet dress is made from cotton and . features a mismatched seam . Saks Fifth Avenue factory store, Off 5th, even admitted to investors last year that only 10per cent of the outlet merchandise is leftover Saks inventory. With 25per cent of the factory stock made up of private-label goods from brands like Rag and Bone and Alice + Olivia, the rest, 65per cent, is actually merchandise created specifically for Off 5th by 'brand-appropriate' vendors. Nordstrom Rack, the department store's popular discount store, does this too. The company notes in a press release: 'The Rack carries merchandise from Nordstrom stores and Nordstrom.com, as well as specially-purchased items from many of the top brands sold at Nordstrom.' Close match: J. Crew's Darby striped loafers, $168 (left) feature leather soles and are made in Italy; the J. Crew Factory version, $74.50 (right) features a man-made sole with slight style differences . Flower power: Last summer's Punk Floral Print scoop dress, made from silk dupioni, retailed at J. Crew for $178 (left); the near identical dress is selling at J. Crew Factory for $74.50, but it is made from polyester . To an untrained eye, J. Crew Factory's version looks like it is the same dress, just two seasons old. But in fact, the near identical dress, selling for $74.50, is made from polyester. Items sold at the J. Crew Factory, both online and in store, will often use the same prints as full-priced items, but the fabric can be markedly different. Take for example, last summer's Punk Floral Print scoop dress, which was made from silk dupioni and retailed at J. Crew for $178. To an untrained eye, J. Crew Factory's version looks like it is the same dress, just two seasons old. But in fact, the near identical dress, selling for $74.50, is made from polyester. Similarly, J. Crew's well-known linen Carrie Dot dress from last summer ($148) is also available online at J. Crew Factory. However, the outlet dress ($104.50) is made from cotton, and unlike the full-priced version, a mismatched seam can be found at the back. LearnVest noted that retailers recognize the profitability of attracting people who are looking for a deal, so they are building an industry around outlet shopping that is completely separate from their regular business . These 'potentially misleading marketing practices by outlet stores' are now being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission after four members of Congress looked at 'the difficulty in identifying made-for-outlet goods' and the 'deceptive reference pricing.' And J. Crew isn't alone. Bebe told investors that it sustains its outlets with 65per cent made-for-outlet merchandise, while American Eagle has said it anticipates carrying 75per cent made-for-factory items starting this year. Under Armour said in September that its outlets carry 75per cent made-for-outlet goods, while Coach and high-end luggage maker Tumi have said 85per cent of their outlet goods are made-for-factory. LearnVest noted in 2011 that as retailers have begun to recognize the profitability of attracting Americans -- and even tourists -- who are looking for a deal, they are now building an industry around outlet shopping that is completely separate from their regular business. Saks Fifth Avenue factory store, Off 5th, admitted to investors last year that only 10per cent of the outlet merchandise is leftover Saks inventory . An outlet buyer for a luxury department store in New York, who wished to remain anonymous, explained: 'I would guess that only about 10-15per cent of our outlet’s stock was actually items that the main store carried. The rest of it was merchandise we bought or produced for the outlets.' While there are sometimes ways to tell whether the merchandise came from a full-price store or whether it's a cheaper version of the real thing -- J.Crew Factory puts two some dots on its tags and the Gap outlet marks its products with three dots -- customers continue to feel duped. 'I personally am unhappy with the way J. Crew is handling their outlet merchandise,' said one commenter named Courtney on the blog J. Crew Aficionada. 'Don't get me started on the outlet t-shirts that look very similar to the perfect fit t's, but they tend to lose their shape and pill.' She continued: 'I was at the outlet last weekend and I decided to try on a pair of cropped black ""mini pants"" and as a put my leg into the pantleg it split from inseam to knee.

"An explosion in a Nigerian shopping mall has killed at least 21 people just an hour before the national football team played Argentina in the World Cup. Witnesses said the blast left body parts scattered around the Emab Plaza in an upmarket district of Abuja, as billows of black smoke could be seen from a mile away. It turned what should have been a national celebration into a national tragedy as Nigeria secured its place in the World Cup's knockout stages for the first time since 1998. It came a week after 14 people were killed by a suicide bomb while watching the Brazil v Mexico match in Damaturu, Nigeria. Nigeria football coach Stephen Keshi said after the bombing: 'How much of a victory is football going to give for those lives? What are they doing these guys? They did it the first game, and they now they did it again, it is sad.' Scroll down for video . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Devastating: An explosion has killed at least 21 people in a shopping mall in the Nigerian capital Abuja an hour before the national football team started playing in Brazil . Wounded: At least 17 more people were injured in the blast, including this man being helped to safety. The government has said it will check the activities of 'insurgents' Brutal: Rescue workers carry the remains of a person in a body bag after the bomb in the crowded mall. Witnesses reported seeing shoppers covered in blood . Rescue: Police Superintendent Frank Mba said 17 people were wounded and 21 bodies were recovered, with rescue work still ongoing at the shopping mall in the capital . Devastation: A Nigerian soldier at the scene of the explosion which killed 21 people and wounded 17 more in the capital Abuja. Violence is becoming more frequent . The blast is the latest in a series of violent attacks blamed on the Islamic extremists Boko Haram, who have a stronghold in the northeast of the country . Smoke: Several cars were left burnt-out by the bomb, which unconfirmed reports suggested could have been dropped off next to the mall by motorbike . No one has yet claimed responsibility, but the attack bears hallmarks of Boko Haram extremism. One local man, Shuaibu Baba, was in a . shop making photocopies when the blast hit, killing his taxi driver who . was waiting for him outside. 'I lost a driver. And why? Because I came to photocopy for 10 naira ($0.06) a page,' he said. 'I begged him to take me here and this is the end.' Officials said the explosion hit while the district was at its busiest, packed with shoppers and rush-hour commuters. 'I . heard a loud blast, it shattered the windows of the shop. We ran out. A . lot of people ran too, some with bloodstains,' said Gimbya Jafaru, who . was shopping nearby. Police Superintendent Frank Mba said 17 people were wounded and 21 bodies were recovered. He also said one suspect has been arrested and investigations have already started. Another suspect was killed by soldiers as he tried to escape on a motorcycle, the spokesman for Nigeria's National Information Centre said. The blast came as Nigerians were preparing to watch their country's Super Eagles come up against Argentina at the World Cup in Brazil. Crowded: The shopping centre was reportedly teeming with people at the time of the explosion this afternoon. 'I heard the explosion and (felt) the building shaking,' said Shuaibu Baba, who had a narrow escape. He said he rushed downstairs to find that the driver who had dropped him a few minutes earlier was dead . Burnt-out: Smoke rises from vehicles after the bomb exploded in an upmarket district of Abuja. Several cars around the shopping mall caught fire after the blast . Rescue work: The blast came as Nigerians were preparing to watch their country's Super Eagles come up against Argentina at the World Cup in Brazil . A government spokesman said 'every step is being taken to check the activities of insurgents in the country' and advised Nigerians to remain vigilant of strangers . Many shops at the mall have TV screens, but it was unclear if the explosion was timed to coincide with the match. One . witness said he thought the bomb was dropped at the entrance to the . mall in the Wuse 11 suburb by a motorcyclist, but Mba said it was too . early to say. Chiamaka Oham, who was near the site of the blast, told the BBC: 'We heard a really loud noise and the building shook, and people started screaming and running out. 'We saw the smoke and people covered in blood. It was just chaos.' The group stage match in Porto Alegre, Brazil, went ahead between Argentina and Nigeria, with Nigeria losing 3-2 but still qualifying for the tournament's knockout stages. Argentine star Lionel Messi scored twice during a tense match which was clinched in the 50th minute. But the game was more of a lap of honour for both Group F teams, as they were already guaranteed a place in the knockout stages after beating Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iran. Around 1,000 Nigerians made the trip to Brazil's southern city of Porto Alegre, and some wore t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan 'Soccer against Boko Haram.' One supporter, Kenneth Okechu-Kwu Onfemere, said: 'We need God's intervention to stop this from happening. I don't think these people are humans. They are hiding behind masks. 'Football can bring love, happiness and unity. It can make us forget our problems.' Emergency: Workers carry a man who was injured into the Maitama general hospital. The explosion was at Emab Plaza, near  the Banex Plaza shopping district . Guard: Nigerian soldiers lined the streets as chaos gripped the capital in the wake of the attack. Many are pointing the finger at the militant group Boko Haram . Constant threat: Abuja is in the centre of Nigeria and Boko Haram militants have spread their attacks to the capital from their stronghold in the north east . The blast is the latest in a series of . violent attacks blamed on the Islamic extremists Boko Haram, who have a . stronghold in the northeast of the country. The . bomb would be Abuja's third in three months and comes as the Nigerian . government and military face rising public anger over their inability to . protect citizens from daily gun and bomb attacks across Africa's most . populous country. Witnesses said the blast shattered windows, sent smoke billowing into the air and carved out a large crater. Boko Haram attracted international . condemnation for the April mass abductions of more than 200 schoolgirls, . and is blamed for this week's abductions of another 91 people — 31 boys . and 60 girls and women with toddlers as young as three. Abuja residents were urged 'to remain . calm and go about their normal business' by government spokesman Mike . Omeri, who issued a statement saying that security agencies are . 'handling the situation.' He . said that 'every step is being taken by the government to check the . activities of insurgents in the country' and advised Nigerians to remain . vigilant and conscious of movement of unidentified people. Tragedy: People could do little but watch as a plume of thick black smoke rose into the air, which could be seen a mile away from the site of the explosion . Helped: People crowd around an injured woman outside the shopping mall following the blast. Police had already detained a suspect in the hours following the explosion . Abuja residents were urged 'to remain calm and go about their normal business' by government spokesman Mike Omeri, who issued a statement after the bomb . Horror: Surrounded by blood stains on the floor, those injured in the bomb blast waited for treatment at the Maitama general hospital in Abuja, a relatively wealthy city . Cordon: The area around the popular shopping centre - hit at its busiest time of the day at around 4pm - was sealed off as rescue workers retrieved the dead . Demolished: One car's bumper became detached and lay in the road as rescue workers surveyed the damage from the blast, widely blamed on militants . Abuja is in the centre of Nigeria and . the militants have spread their attacks to the capital. Two separate . explosions in Abuja in April killed more than 120 people and wounded . about 200 at a busy bus station. Both were claimed by Boko Haram, which . threatened further attacks. A . bomb at a medical college in northern Kano killed at least eight people . on Monday, and last week, at least 14 died in a bomb blast at a World . Cup viewing site in Damaturu, a state capital in the northeast. In .

"Microsoft pays no tax on £1.7billion of online sales in the UK thanks to a legal loophole, it has been reported. The technology monolith is funnelling cash generated by online sales of Windows 8 software to Luxembourg to sidestep tax obligations, according to The Sunday Times. If the allegations are true the company will join a growing number of foreign companies coming under scrutiny for avoiding UK tax, such as Amazon, Apple and Google. Earlier this week coffee chain Starbucks caved to public fury and announced it would pay Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to pay £20million over the next two years. Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates at the company's annual meeting of shareholders last month. The company allegedly uses a base in Luxembourg to avoid paying tax on its UK sales . Money trail: How Microsoft channels its money to avoid paying corporation tax in the UK . The Sunday newspaper's investigation led it to an office in Luxembourg where a small number of staff handle sales from throughout Europe and transfer the money to the company's European HQ in Ireland, where it is then routed to Bermuda. The legal process allows Microsoft to bypass UK corporation tax on sales of £1.7billion. Luxembourg's favourable tax laws have enticed a number of companies to set up headquarters there, including Amazon, Skype, Facebook, eBay, AOL and Apple. In 2011 Microsoft's UK operation paid £19million in corporation tax, 2.8 per cent of revenue totalling £663 million. UK corporation tax currently stands at 24 per cent. Microsoft is avoiding tax on UK sales of its Windows 8 operating software, according to reports . Microsoft has its main European headquarters in Ireland, where the corporation tax rate is roughly half of that. Richard Murphy, of the Tax Justice Network, a global tax watchdog and thinktank, said: 'Like many other companies, Microsoft is trying to avoid tax. 'It has tried hard to represent itself as doing the best thing for the world, but if you really want to solve the world's problems, pay taxes. '£159million would more than pay for a hospital, or provide IT training for young people so they can work in that industry. 'They are withholding money from the people who need it.' A spokesman from Microsoft said: 'Microsoft pays all due taxes, as required by law, worldwide. Microsoft subsidiaries are fully subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which we operate. 'We are regularly audited by major tax jurisdictions, which ensure the company is complying with all rules and regulations.' Tax haven: A number of major international companies have set up in Luxembourg because of favourable tax laws . The Sunday Times also reported that the Luxembourg office of international law firm Dechert, where Nick Clegg's wofe Miriam Gonzalez is a partner, lent £17m to the London office. The loan interest paid allowed the partners to claim tax relief back. The company said the money was for a refurbishment, not tax avoidance. A BT subsidiary based in Luxembourg which made a profit of £136m paid less than 0.5 per cent tax, according to the paper. BT responded that it derives no tax benefit from the arrangement.

"President Barack Obama is on pace this year to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007, even as he has postponed until after Election Day his promised unilateral action that could shield millions more from deportation. According to an analysis of Homeland Security Department figures by The Associated Press, the federal agency responsible for deportations sent home 258,608 immigrants between the start of the budget year last October and July 28 this summer. During the same period a year earlier, it removed 320,167 people — meaning this year saw a decrease in deportations by nearly 20 percent. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, left, speaks as former President Bill Clinton, right, listens during an AmeriCorps Pledge ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House this afternoon. Data obtained from the Department of Homeland Security shows that Obama is on pace this year to deport the fewest number of immigrants since at least 2007 . Over the same period ending in July 2012, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 344,624 people, some 25 percent more than this year, according to the federal figures obtained by the AP. The figures, contained in weekly internal reports marked 'Official Use Only,' reflect the marked decline in deportations even as Obama has delayed announcing what changes he will make to U.S. immigration policies through executive action. Obama had said he would act before the end of the summer, but White House officials said last weekend that the president would postpone his decision until after November's elections much to the chagrin of Latino leaders, many of whom believe Obama's deported too many immigrants . Since taking office, Obama's administration has removed more than 2.1 million immigrants. There are several reasons why fewer immigrants already are being deported. First, the president directed the Department of Homeland Security in the summer of 2011 to focus deportation efforts on criminal immigrants or those who posed a threat to national security or public safety. Many others who crossed into the United States illegally and could be subject to deportation are stuck in a federal immigration court system. Last month the backlog in that system exceeded 400,000 cases for the first time, according to court data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. For each case, it now takes as many as four years for a judge to issue a final order to leave the U.S. As Border Patrol agents detain more people from countries in Central America, not Mexico, the volume and circumstances of the cases take more time for overwhelmed immigration officials and courts to process because, among other reasons, the U.S. must fly such immigrants home rather than letting them walk back across the border into Mexico. A surge in the number of immigrant families, mostly women and young children, has swamped temporary holding facilities, leading the Homeland Security Department to release many people into the U.S. interior with instructions to report back to authorities later. Amid the crush of immigrant families and children caught traveling alone across the border, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has promised that most will be sent home. 'Those who cross our border illegally must know there is no safe passage and no free pass,' Johnson said in July. 'Within the confines of our laws, our values and our resources, they will be sent back to their home countries.' As of early September, only 319 of more than 59,000 immigrants who were caught traveling with their families have been returned to Central America. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine patrols the Texas-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas last Friday. The White House said today that the tumbling deportation numbers could be related to the amount of resources going toward border security . Asked for comment, Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Gillian Christensen told the Associated Press that the agency has not released removal numbers for this budget year and officials are 'still assessing a number of factors that inform ICE's ability to remove individuals.' 'ICE remains focused on smart and effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of convicted criminals and recent border entrants,' Christensen said in a statement. Also, under U.S. law, immigrant children from Central America caught crossing the border alone can't be subjected to speedy removal proceedings without appearing before a judge. The government interviews Mexican and Canadian children to make sure they aren't trafficking victims, then send home quickly. A 2008 law disallows immigration officials from treating illegal children from other countries the same way. Questioned about the falling deportation numbers at a daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that deportation decisions are made by law enforcement officers at DHS. 'This is not something that is mandated by the White House,' he said, moments before acknowledging that the president had directed DHS to shift it's resources to the humanitarian situation at the border. 'The shifting of those resources may have something to do with those numbers,' Earnest admitted. Earnest was also asked about potential actions Obama could take to slow deportations down further. The Obama spokesman said that 'most of the work has been completed' on Obama's immigration plans, 'and we are positioned to make an announcement before the end of the year.' He said those plans had not yet been finalized however, and the president was still meeting with his advisers to cross the t's and dot the i's. It remains unclear exactly what actions Obama will announce after the elections. The president said earlier this month the U.S. would be better off if immigrants — who in some cases he said have been in the U.S. for longer than 10 years and have American children — 'have a path to get legal by paying taxes and getting aboveboard, paying a fine, learning English if they have to.' But there are limits under U.S. law to actions that Obama could take without approval from Congress. He can't generally give large groups of immigrants blanket permission to remain permanently in the United States, and he can't grant them American citizenship. He  could delay indefinitely efforts to deport immigrants already in the U.S. illegally, however, and he could give them official work permits that would allow them to legally find jobs, obtain driver's licenses and file tax returns. The president said this month that a partisan fight in July over how to address a surge in the number of immigrant children caught crossing the border had created the impression that there was a crisis — and a volatile climate for taking the measures he had promised. The president sent his chief of staff to the Capitol on Thursday to reassure unhappy Latino lawmakers that he still plans to act by the end of the year. Lawmakers say that some vented their anger during the meeting with Denis McDonough, who heard them out and pledged action. 'We’re going to fix it and we’ll do it before the end of the year,' McDonough told reporters after the meeting, according to Politico.","The U.S. has deported 20 percent fewer illegal immigrants this year than it did last year .
Obama may shield millions of additional immigrants from deportation with an executive order later this year .
The surge of unaccompanied Central American children at the border has contributed to low deportation rates this year ."
"If your iPhone 6 Plus has become bent out of shape, Apple may offer you a replacement. A support employee told The Next Web during a web chat that the decision would be '100% up to the store' in which the device was returned to - and that it would be on a case-by-case basis. But, the employee added that if, following an inspection, the damage met certain guidelines then a free replacement would be covered by the phone's warranty. Scroll down for video . Since the iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) launched on Friday, reports have emerged that 'a small but growing number' of owners are claiming the frame bends if the device is left in pockets for an extended period of time. An Apple support employee has since revealed the firm may replace bent devices - but only on a case-by-case basis . Apple has not released an official line about the replacements, and is not commenting on reports that the larger handset is vulnerable to being bent. The problem, dubbed 'bend gate' by some . on social media sites, is due to the phone's thinner aluminium exterior - . but can be solved by ensuring the middle of the phone is not subjected . to a large force. It is believed that the thinner  model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the frame to deform. A video, uploaded to YouTube by user Lewis Hilsenteger, shows the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers. It has already been viewed more than 18.5 million times. MacRumors detailed on Tuesday that 'a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets just days after launch'. During the web chat, The Next Web journalist asked if a 'bent enclosure occurring during normal use' would be covered by a warranty. The support employee, replied: 'That is 100 per cent up to the Genius you speak with at the store.' A Genius is an Apple employee (stock image) who works in stores . The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move. According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot. This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending. This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot. These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend. To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone. For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending. Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option. Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied. During the web chat, The Next Web journalist Josh Ong asked if a 'bent enclosure occurring during normal use' would be covered by a warranty. The support employee, who has not been named, replied: 'That is 100 per cent up to the Genius you speak with at the store.' A Genius is an Apple support employee who works in stores around the world. The online employee continued that the Genius would carry out a test known as a Visual Mechanical Inspection, and if the damage was within the guidelines, Apple would be able to cover it. It . has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5-inch phone and the use of aluminum on . the frame will cause the new iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) to bend if pressure is applied . The bendy feature of the new iPhone (pictured) has been met with wide criticism on social media . The bendy feature of the new iPhone was met with wide criticism on social media and some hashtagged 'bendgate' as they poked fun at the defect. One user wrote: '@tim_cook hi Tim, I absolutely love my new iPhone 6 Plus!! My favorite feature is the flexible display.' However this isn't the first time iPhone frames have warped while the issue isn't unique to Apple, Mashable reports. It was further mentioned the thinner design and the use of aluminum on the frame causes the phone to misshape if pressure is applied. However, other Twitter users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure. App developer ‏@drbarnard said: 'It’s actually impressive that the 6 Plus doesn’t break. Seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage.' While TechCrunch co-editor @panzer added: 'Just an anecdote: I carried around the iPhone 6 Plus for 5 days in a pocket at Disneyland on rides & coasters and did not bend it.' Reports in 2012 claimed that the iPhone 5 had similar frame weaknesses. The iPhone 5S release last year was met with similar complaints. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) announced on Monday the firm sold over 10 million of its 'bigger than bigger' models, setting a new three-day sales record. It beat the iPhone 5S and 5C's record of 9 million . The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch display. Both . models also include the Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation . 64-bit desktop-class architecture, said to boost performance and power . efficiency. They . also have advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and users in the US . will also be able to use the devices to pay for goods using Apple Pay. Besides larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments. In the US, the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for 32GB on a two-year contact, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB. A SIM-only handset starts at £539 in the UK. The iPhone 6 Plus costs $299 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $399 for 64GB, $499 for 128GB. Unlocked, the handset starts at £619 in the UK. Samsung devices are also vulnerable, and the Galaxy S4 in particular was found to bend under pressure, as did Sony's Xperia Z1. Other . devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to . have a curved frame, including the LG G Flex and the Samsung Round. Both devices were said to be more comfortable to hold, and easier to place in a back pocket. Apple . announced on Monday it sold over 10 million of its 'bigger than bigger' model, setting a new record since it launched three days after the . launch on Friday. This beat the previous record of 9 million for last year's iPhone 5S and 5C. However Apple has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment regarding the issues with the latest model. This isn't the first time iPhone frames have bent or warped (pictured), and the issue isn't unique to Apple. Reports in 2012 claimed that the iPhone 5 had similar frame weaknesses. The iPhone 5S release was met with similar complaints. Samsung devices are also vulnerable, and the Galaxy S4 in particular was found to bend .

Both devices were said to be more comfortable to hold, and easier to place in a back pocket. And as Apple's bad week continues, the firm was forced to remove its latest software update following reports it broke certain features on the new handset. Users began reporting overnight that the upgrade to iOS 8.0.1 robbed them of signal, data service and the Touch ID capability. As its the second major issue to arise with Apple's newest iPhone since it was launched on Friday, many are claiming the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the most troubled new products since the iPhone 4 and 'antennagate.' Shortly after the iPhone 4 launched in 2012, customers struggled to get signal when the phone was held on the lower left edge of the frame. Apple issued a statement advising customers should 'avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner' when making or receiving a call, which was met with even more complaints. However, the company acted quickly to pull iOS 8.0.1 from the Apple store when users began reporting the problems within minutes of its release. The glitch appears to affect only the newest iPhones - not iPhone 5C or 5S, or older models. Apple users on networks across the US, Britain and Canada were reporting problems via Twitter and official support forums after updating their operating systems. Apple announced it was investigating the glitch, but in the meantime recommended that owners of affected iPhones restore their devices by connecting to iTunes. In an official statement, the tech giant said: 'We apologise for the great inconvenience experienced by users, and are working around the clock to prepare iOS 8.0.2 with a fix for the issue.' Other devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to have a curved frame, including the LG G Flex (pictured). The phone is said to be more comfortable to hold, and easier to place in a back pocket .

Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which has been described as Egypt's most dangerous militant group, has released a shocking new video in which four men, accused of being Israeli Mossad spies, are beheaded . In the video, the captives can be seen kneeling on the floor with armed men in black masks standing behind them as one of the militants reads out a statement. Minutes later the four men have been beheaded . Security sources have said four headless corpses were found in the Sinai Peninsula earlier this month . Security sources said four headless corpses were found in the Sinai Peninsula earlier this month - the first time any decapitations had been made public in Egypt. The men had reportedly been abducted by gunmen two days earlier while driving in the town of Sheikh Zuwaid, which is just a few miles from the Gaza Strip. The filmed killings are reminiscent of images posted online by militant group Islamic State, which has seized parts of Iraq and Syria. This has led to suggestions that Sinai-based Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis might have been inspired by the group, notorious for beheadings and executions. The Sinai militants are not believed to be officially linked to Islamic State insurgents. However, Egyptian intelligence officials say the group has influenced Egyptian militants who are based just over the border with Libya, Reuters has reported. The officials say the Libya-based fighters have also established contacts with Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis. In the video, militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis presented what it said were confessions by the men . Two of the men said they had spent time in Israeli jails for smuggling. The other two said Mossad had paid them for information . The group said the men provided intelligence used in an airstrike on July 23 in northern Sinai that killed three of its fighters . Militants in the Sinai have stepped up attacks on policemen and soldiers since then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July 2013 . Though the four dead men were civilians, security sources had said initially that they might have been targeted for their perceived allegiance to the police and army.

The filmed killings are reminiscent of images posted online by militant group Islamic State (pictured), which has seized parts of Iraq and Syra . The attacks initially targeted security forces in Sinai - a remote but strategic part of Egypt located between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal - but they have since extended their reach, with bombings on the mainland. It was reported today that Islamic State had released a new decapitation video, threatening America for the second time and urging the Kurds to break from their alliance with the West against the caliphate. Just hours after Islamic State released shocking footage of the mass execution of 300 Syrian national army soldiers in the Syrian desert, the group issued a second warning to the United States. The grainy video, accompanied by the hashtag '2ndAmessagetoAmerica', shows the vicious beheading of a Kurdish soldier, who was part of a group of 15 fighters likely to have been captured by Islamic State during the fighting in Iraq. It was reported today that Islamic State had released a new decapitation video, threatening America for the second time and urging the Kurds to break from their alliance with the West against the caliphate . The group's first warning ten days ago was entitled 'A Message to America' and showed the decapitation of American journalist James Foley. In the latest video, the captors first issue a warning they will continue to decapitate prisoners should America continue to support the Kurds in their fight against the Islamic State. They then behead one of the captives on a sandy roadside in Iraq, where the Great Mosque of Mosul can be seen in the background.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A casualty unit that David Cameron personally promised would stay open is due to be closed, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Days before council elections in May, the Prime Minister visited Hammersmith in London and stated that Charing Cross Hospital in nearby Fulham ‘will retain its A&E and services’. But the organisation that runs the hospital intends to close the department and replace it with an ‘urgent care centre’, NHS papers show. Shutdown: The A&E unit at London's Charing Cross Hospital will be replaced with an 'urgent care centre', according to NHS papers seen by The Mail on Sunday - despite David Cameron pledging to save it in May . Urgent care centres can be run by GPs and nurses rather than A&E consultants, and have far fewer facilities to care for the seriously ill or injured. Charing Cross’s A&E will move to St Mary’s Hospital four miles away in Paddington, according to papers presented in July to the board of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs five of the capital’s hospitals. By 2020, Charing Cross will be left with ‘urgent and emergency care services appropriate to a local hospital’ – NHS-speak for a hospital stripped of a fully staffed and fully equipped A&E and its emergency wards. More than half the site will be sold off as inpatient beds are slashed from 360 to 24. Andy Slaughter, Labour MP for Hammersmith, accused the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of dishonestly claiming Charing Cross would keep its A&E when they knew of plans to downgrade it. He said: ‘It’s entirely dishonest. Mr Cameron knew exactly what the Trust would be doing.’ Bedside manner: David Cameron promised personally that the unit would remain open just four months ago . Charing Cross was one of four A&Es across north-west London recommended for closure in a controversial multi-million-pound review. Last October Mr Hunt agreed to closures at Hammersmith and Central Middlesex – which will shut on Wednesday. But he appeared to step in to save the units at Charing Cross and Ealing, telling Parliament that they ‘should continue to offer an A&E service even if it is in a different shape or size to that currently offered’. In June, Mr Hunt repeated his message, saying: ‘They will be full A&Es. Anyone suggesting otherwise is just engaging in political scaremongering.’ However, Mr Slaughter accused Mr Hunt and Mr Cameron of ‘double-speak’ and ‘betrayal’. He said: ‘By continuing to say there will be an A&E at Charing Cross they are misleading people.’ MPs from all parties are worried about the closures. Last month The Mail on Sunday told how Tory MP David Burrowes feared for his life as he waited almost 36 hours for an emergency appendix operation in ‘chaotic’ North Middlesex Hospital. It is having to cope with 40,000 extra patients a year due to the closure of Chase Farm Hospital’s A&E in Enfield, North London, when only 26,000 were predicted. Blow: The closure at the hospital (pictured) follows another at nearby Hammersmith Hospital in west London . Karen Buck, Labour MP for Westminster North where St Mary’s is located, is concerned that the hospital will not cope. She said: ‘The bottom line is that you don’t close A&Es in the middle of an A&E crisis. And we are in the middle of an A&E crisis.’ Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust claimed that while its clinical strategy stated Charing Cross’s A&E would be replaced, this was not actually the case. A spokeswoman said: ‘There is no proposal to close the A&E at Charing Cross Hospital. We are awaiting further guidance from NHS England.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The Health Secretary has already been clear that Charing Cross Hospital should continue to offer an A&E service which provides high quality urgent and emergency care services 24/7. 'Local doctors will have the final say about the exact range of services provided at this hospital, but no decisions have been made yet.’","EXCLUSIVE: Mail on Sunday can reveal plans for Charing Cross Hospital .

"And that’s the way we like it. There is your advert for racism, right there at Richelieu-Drouot Metro station in the heart of Paris. This poison has just been driven deeper underground, further than we ever thought possible on a night when football should have been celebrating the return of the Champions League. It has resurfaced, a filthy stain on the game and the rest of society after an incident that took us to another era. Scroll down to watch the video . Chelsea fans stopped a black man getting on the train before their side's match with Paris Saint-Germain . The man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform . Fans were also filmed chanting 'We’re racist, we’re racist and that’s the way we like it' while on the train . Click here to read our story about the fans preventing a black man from boarding . This is a throwback to Colin Ward’s book Steaming In, the depressing account of terrace culture at Chelsea, among others, in the Eighties. What a way to remember the return of the Champions League, with a bunch of hoolies terrorising a black commuter as he attempts to board the subway in the centre of the city. ‘We’re racist, we’re racist and that’s the way we like it,’ they chant after successfully forcing the guy back on to the platform before the doors slam shut. How did he feel when he heard their slurred words, a stranger in his own city as a mob of filthy fans hurled their racist abuse at him on the platform? We should be embarrassed. We are embarrassed. This is thug life, pervasive attitudes that have no place in society or this sport. Those images, filmed by another passenger, are deeply disturbing because a pecking order quickly evolves, a clear delineation of cultures and colour. There was a clear hierarchy, a ranking system based on numbers and a deep, underlying conviction that they could do what the hell they liked based on the colour of their skin. It is difficult to frame that, to imagine how that is even possible. They looked down on that commuter, twice shoving him off the carriage before the train doors closed and they made their way towards the Parc des Princes. There is a greater shame here because we foolishly, naively, believed the issue of racism among our football supporters was a thing of the past. We kidded ourselves, travelling to European cities convinced that this is an issue that was dealt with a long time ago. Confronting it is difficult, too, because the temptation is to shy away, to cop a deaf ‘un and leave it to the authorities to pass on their message. That is the easy way out, to be ignorant of the facts and wait for Chelsea to sift through the CCTV footage and hope they can identify the individuals concerned. The incident is a throwback to the depressing terrace culture at Chelsea, among others, in the Eighties . Mounted police disperse football fans at Stamford Bridge during Chelsea's defeat by Sunderland in 1985 . UEFA continue their campaign to drive racism out of football . The morning after, as those Chelsea supporters head back to London via Eurostar, by plane or by boat across to Dover, they will be hoping to avoid detection. Before kick-off in Parc des Princes, the music from John Murphy’s song 'In A Heartbeat' struck up when Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea emerged from the tunnel. On the video screens Lionel Messi, Gareth Bale and David Luiz, among others, sent out their familiar message - Unite Against Racism - in the moments before Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir started the first leg. We love these Champions League nights, the return of prime European football between some of the great teams after a break during the winter. The game was decent enough, a 1-1 draw that satisfies both teams and tees up the second leg nicely at Stamford Bridge on March 17. So how do the Chelsea players feel, waking up to see the footage of their own supporters from their own football club racially abusing someone who was probably on their way home from work? There were six black players - Ramires, Willian, Kurt Zouma, Didier Drogba, Loic Remy and Juan Cuadrado - in Chelsea’s squad for the first leg in Paris. It feels awkward and wrong to even count them. The message from the club was strong and clear, a warning that Chelsea will support a criminal investigation to identify those involved on that Paris Metro. There should be one from the players too, conveying a powerful message from a united squad at Chelsea to make it clear that this behaviour from their fans is unacceptable. They are under no obligation to do so, but it feels like it would be a start - a polite reminder - that it is time for society to move on. Without it, we barely scratch beneath the surface.

"Outrage: A quarter of TSB customers could not use their cards after two of the company's seven servers failed . Lloyds Banking Group could face a huge compensation bill after hundreds of thousands of customers were left unable to use debit cards and 7,000 cashpoints yesterday as the result of a computer glitch. The largest retail bank in the UK, which has 22million customers, has apologised for the widespread disruption – the latest in a series of IT problems to hit UK banks in recent years. It said debit card transactions were affected between 3pm and 6pm yesterday, while Lloyds, TSB, Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers suffered ATM problems for four and a half hours. A spokesman told MailOnline today it would not 'leave customers out of pocket' and would consider compensation claims on a 'case-by-case basis'. The bank is also confident they were not hacked and it was a server error, although the exact problem is yet to be identified. TSB said a quarter of its customers’ debit card transactions were affected after it suffered problems with two out of seven computer servers. But despite this, there was no mention of problems on the bank’s website last night. It has 4.6million customers and more than 630 branches. Furious customers last night took to Twitter to vent their frustration, forcing the bank’s chief executive, Paul Pester, to post an apology. He said: ‘My apologies to TSB customers having problems with their cards. 'I’m working hard  with my team now to try to fix  the problems.’ In December, an estimated 750,000 Royal Bank of Scotland customers were unable to use their credit and debit cards for three hours following an IT glitch on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. In 2012, a major IT failure locked many RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers out of their accounts for several days. Twitter users blasted the banking group as their inability to pay for low-cost items left them embarrassed . TSB, which split from Lloyds last . year, issued a statement on Twitter saying: ‘We’re having issues with . ATMs and debit cards at present. ‘We’re . hoping to have this fixed shortly, apologies for inconvenience caused.’ Customers yesterday reported difficulties paying for goods in shops and . getting money out of ATMs. Leanne . Seaward, 29, from Verwood in Dorset, said she found she had problems . when she went to pay for her weekly supermarket shop. ‘It . was a little embarrassing,’ she said. ‘I put my card in and it kept . saying “transaction void”. 'I thought it was because I am in the process . of switching banks, so assumed they might have closed my account without . telling me. Luckily I had my husband with me so he was able to pay, but . if I was getting petrol and on my own it could have been a completely . different matter.’ Apology: Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB Bank, took to Twitter to apologise to angry account holders . On . Twitter one TSB customer, Nicky Kate, wrote: ‘Really embarrassed to get . my card declined while out shopping, never had any problems with Lloyds . then they changed my account.’ Another, . Hannah Smith, said: ‘I am a TSB customer with a Lloyds card still (like . everyone else). And I’ve been embarrassed three times today re: card . declined.’ TSB customer Essie Young wrote: ‘Could not buy my twins a birthday present today with TSB card.’ Mark Logan wrote: ‘Put petrol in then realised my Lloyds card was not working.

"Two Hollywood starlets have controversially claimed that press intrusion is comparable to war and rape - in the space of just two days. Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron likened press coverage to 'feeling raped', just days after Gwyneth Paltrow said online abuse was like the 'dehumanising' plight of soldiers going through war. Both sets of remarks prompted a backlash on social media, with one charity which campaigns for sexual violence victims claiming Theron had 'trivialised' rape. Scroll down for video . Awareness: Twitter user Cliff Murray said the timing of Charlize Theron's comments is 'shocking given the brutal rape and murders in India' 'Get a grip': Danielle Hayward described the actress as a 'complete moron' after hearing her comments . Controversial: The Hollywood actress Charlize Theron has compared press intrusion to rape in an interview . Meanwhile Cindy McCain - the wife of senator and . former US Presidential candidate, John, who was a POW during the Vietnam . war - labelled Paltrow a 'joke'. She said: 'Gwyneth Paltrow is a joke. Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a . joke! My 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her.' South African-born Theron, who is in the . UK to promote her new film A Million Ways To Die In The West, made the remarks after she was asked by Sky News if she ever . googled herself. During the interview, the 38-year-old said: 'I don’t do that, so . that’s my saving grace. When you start living in that world, and doing . that, you start I guess feeling raped.' Asked by the interviewer if she felt . that strongly about the issue, she said: 'Well, you know when it comes . to your son and your private life. Maybe that’s just me. 'Some . people might relish all that stuff but there are certain things in my . life that I think of as very sacred and I am very protective over them.' Backlash: One man reacted angrily to the actress's comments on Twitter . Days earlier, Paltrow had caused fury when she told a tech conference in Los Angeles: 'You come across [online comments] about yourself and about your friends, and it's a very dehumanising thing. 'It's . almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanizing . thing, and then something is defined out of it. My hope is, as we get . out of it, we'll reach the next level of conscience. 'I . see myself as a chalkboard or a whiteboard or a screen,' the star . mused, 'and someone is just putting up their own projection on it.' Since both sets of comments were made, social media sites have been awash with criticism for the two actresses. Twilight . star Kristen Stewart was forced to apologise when she made similar . remarks in 2010 during an interview with Elle magazine. Angry: Another user accused Theron of being a 'hypocrite' and 'disgusting' Criticism: Jay Sawdy said the comparison was 'ill-advised at best' Speaking about Theron's comments, one Twitter user said: 'She should try telling that to a real rape victim'. Another said:'How stupid to comment about press intrusion the same as being raped. Makes my blood boil!!' Mark Merryweather said: 'How dare Charlize Theron compare press intrusion to rape - try telling a victim of rape that.' Zenobia . Bharmal added: 'So Charlize Theron compared Press intrusion to rape . whilst giving an interview to a member of the press... she's a hypocrite . and disgusting.' Joint criticism: A Twitter uses condemns both Charlize Theron and Gwyneth Paltrow. Earlier this week the Paltrow said receiving abusive comments online was like going to war . Katie Russell from Rape Crisis England . and Wales told Mail Online: 'To us, it is always disappointing when . someone high profile uses that language and turns sexual violence into a . metaphor for something else. 'It is never appropriate and it trivialises the experience of sexual violence. 'The . experience is devastating, as we have come to learn working with women . who have been through it, and the impact can be life-long or very long . term. 'Press intrusion is a very difficult experience but it is not appropriate to compare it to sexual violence. 'It's particularly disappointing in this case because Charlize Theron has campaigned against sexual violence before. 'She doesn't really have an excuse and it will upset people who have survived attacks.' Marni Mulholland, a victim of sexual violence, told Mail Online: 'Flippant use of the word 'Rape' has somewhat devalued its devastating impact and so we must all be careful how we use it.' One user described the actress as a 'stupid woman' after comparing the 'complete opposites' Idiotic: Another user was shocked by the remarks made during the interview . 'Vain': A woman advises the actress to 'Get back into the real world' after hearing the comments . 'Stupid statement': Another user joins the backlash on social media by saying: 'I'm pretty certain that press intrusion is not at all like rape.' 'No idea': One woman's reaction to the controversial statement was straight to the point . Condemnation: Gary Spence says the actress's comments were 'tasteless and shallow' The author of Raw, a book about her . experiences, added: 'I am sure as an intelligent and insightful woman, . Charlize Theron understands what rape truly is. 'Unsolicited . press intrusion is one of the downsides of fame and Charlize Theron . regrettably used the wrong word to describe it.' Charlize, who is mother to two-year-old . son Jackson, recently opened up about her ‘unexpected’ romance with the . 53-year-old actor Sean Penn.

"Raymond Maxwell was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs when al-Qaeda-linked militants stormed a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya and killed four Americans . U.S. State Department officials conspired to prevent an internal Accountability Review Board from seeing damning documents after the 2012 Benghazi terror attack which made then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton look bad, according to a former senior diplomat. A picture has emerged of a weekend boiler-room operation in which employees were instructed to sift through boxes of documents and 'pull out' anything that might make Clinton or her close associates look bad in the wake of the terrorist murders of four Americans including the ambassador to Libya. Raymond Maxwell, a former deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, claims he was scapegoated after the raid by militants acting with Ansar al-Shariah, an Islamist terror faction linked with al-Qaeda. He told The Daily Signal, a news outlet operated by the conservative Heritage Foundation, that a room in the basement of the State Department was converted to a makeshift document review center on a weekend, supervised by Clinton confidants. 'I was not invited to that after-hours endeavor, but I heard about it and decided to check it out on a Sunday afternoon,' Maxwell said. Inside, says Maxwell, employees – including one who reported to him – were busily covering up information that suggested higher-ups were responsible for the lax security at the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi Libya. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Maxwell claims State Department higher-ups close to then-Secretary Hillary Clinton worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents of anything that might make her look bad, before giving them to investigators . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, shown Sunday at a political event in Iowa, was officially cleared of wrongdoing by an internal review board, even though it never interviewed her . The September 11 attack two years ago followed a separate bombing of the facility's outer wall four months earlier that left a giant hole. Days later, Ansar al-Shariah held two days of open-air rallies and parades including 30 fighting battalions in the city's main square. Speakers warned of 'assassinations' that would come. Clinton – the Democratic Party's front-runner in the 2016 presidential sweepstakes – and others at State have been criticized for denying repeated requests from Ambassador Chris Stevens for more security officers, including some that came after these events. . Maxwell was one of four officials officially saddled with responsibility. He was later cleared of wrongdoing. He was, however, placed on indefinite leave, with pay, while the State Department investigated. Struggling to clear his name, Maxwell met with an agency ombudsman who he says told him, 'You are taking this all too personally, Raymond. ... It’s not about you; it’s about Hillary and 2016.' Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, whose organization has dented the Obama administration's Benghazi armor with a series of Freedom Of Information Act lawsuits, told MailOnline that 'Maxwell’s disclosures are no surprise to those of us who know the Clintons' penchant for illicit secrecy.' 'The Benghazi cover-up was and is about protecting two presidential campaigns – Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and Hillary’s nascent 2016 campaign,' Fitton said. 'Our Ambassador and three other American personnel die in a terrorist attack and the number one concern at State is protecting Hillary Clinton! First we have the supposedly missing IRS emails and now we may have missing Benghazi documents?' In May 2013 The Daily Beast interviewed American Foreign Service Association president Susan Johnson, who said disciplinary action meted out to diplomats like Maxwell creates 'a feeling that foreign-service officers often end up as scapegoats when scandals rise to congressional or public attention.' Maxwell told The Daily Signal that the weekend cover-up was held in a basement room at State Department headquarters. He witnessed senior Clinton aides overseeing the process of employees poring over boxes and stacks of documents. One of the worker-bees was an office director, his subordinate, who was recruited to help without his knowledge. 'She told me, ""Ray, we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [Near Eastern Affairs] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light"",' she allegedly told Maxwell. Ansar al-Shariah, the terrorist group that laid waste to the US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, held two days of threatening parades and rallies a few months earlier and called for 'assassinations' -- leading to questions about why security at the compound was lacking . 'What difference, at this point, does it make?' Clinton famously snapped in a 2013 Senate hearing when confronted with the tall tale that an anti-Islam YouTube video, not a terror plot, sparked the death and destruction in Sept. 11, 2012 . Maxwell said that when he asked her to explain herself, she responded that 'those are our orders.' The seventh floor of the State Department is the showplace level that houses Clinton's office and those of her closest aides. The agency's official Accountability Review Board tasked with investigating the Benghazi attack never interviewed Hillary Clinton. A month after the deadly military-style assault, the panel's leaders demanded to see documents that could help explain what happened. Top leaders of the of the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs were instructed to gather anything and everything that could help. Those documents, Maxwell told The Daily Signal, were boxed up and put in the basement room where Clinton insiders would later screen out the most damaging information before giving the ARB the rest. He called the investigation 'at best a shoddily executed attempt at damage control, both in Foggy Bottom and on Capitol Hill.' State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach calls Maxwell's accusations 'totally without merit.' But Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who will serve on a special congressional committee empaneled to investigation the deadly Benghazi episode, told the news outlet that Maxwell's charges 'are as serious as it gets, and it’s something we have obviously followed up and pursued.' 'I'm 100 percent confident the Benghazi Select Committee is going to dive deep on that issue.'","An Accountability Review Board demanded documents related to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack but the most important details were kept from them .

"The NBC News cameraman who is infected with Ebola is the son of a renowned Tibetan monk responsible for bringing Buddhism to the West in the 1970s. His mother is an English aristocrat who was seduced at age 15 by the guru and married him at 16. When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam  Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama. Mr Mukpo later traveled to Tibet, where he was enthroned and honored as the ninth reincarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, 'the Mad Yogi of Kham.' A further twist in the cameraman's life: Trungpa, who is considered his father, is not his biological dad. His biological father is actually Mitchell Levy - a Jewish doctor from New York who was Trungpa's personal physician - whom his mother Lady Diana Mukpo was sleeping with at the time. Scroll down for video . Ashoka Mukpo, the NBC News cameraman infected with Ebola, was named the reincarnation of a Buddhist Lama. He is seen here in Tibet  at a ceremony where he was enthroned as the ninth incarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, the so-called 'Mad Yogi of Kham' Colorful family: Ashoka Mukpo,  an 33-year-old American freelance journalist working in Monrovia, Liberia, has tested positive for Ebola, his biological father has confirmed . Controversial: Mukpo's mother Diana and  his adoptive father Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, pictured shortly after their controversial marriage, when she was just a 16-year-old schoolgirl and he a 30-year-old monk . The 33-year-old Mr Mukpo remains a Buddhist. But, despite his wild family history and divine lineage, he has rejected the path of a monk. Instead, he chose a life working for nonprofits and has said his calling is to help alleviate suffering in the world. After his father Trungpa died in 1987, his mother married his biological father, Dr Levy and moved to quiet suburban Providence, Rhode Island. 'I don't think my role is to be a teacher and to be wearing the robes and to be up on a throne. And if that makes me failed tulku, then maybe that's just my karma,' he said in the 2009 documentary Tulku produced by his half-brother. 'I still think I can be of some kind of benefit to somebody. And that's what being a Buddhist, I think, is about.' Mr Mukpo, who earned a master's degree from the London School of Economics, has been in Liberia on and off since 2012, and had worked for an NGO helping Liberians gain legal rights to the land they lived on, according to an interview with Details magazine. He had recently taken a freelance job as a cameraman on an NBC News crew in Liberia, working with the network's chief medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman. It was while working for NBC that he got sick and was diagnosed with Ebola. Dr Snyderman and her team are returning to the U.S. today and will put themselves into a voluntary 21-day quarantine. Mr Mukpo is being cared for by Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia, Liberia and is expected to be flown back to a special Centers for Disease Control facility in Nebraska on Monday. Speaking out: Mr Mukpo's biological father Dr Mitchell Levy and his mother Lady Diana Judith Mukpo said their son's prognosis remains good, despite the horrifying diagnosis . The indulgent monk: Chögyam Trungpa, seen here in the early 1970s with Lady Diana, was known for smoking, drinking and taking drugs. He also slept with many of his students - even after getting married . Mr Mukpo's father was a hard-drinking, womanizing Buddhist luminary who founded the first Buddhist monastery in the West and taught the likes of Davie Bowie, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Joni Mitchell in the 1960s and 70s. Chögyam Trungpa was known for his wild, hedonistic Tantric parties that were fueled by drugs, booze and sex. He frequently seduced and slept with his students - claiming that it would help them on their path to enlightenment. He died at age 48 in 1987 from complications from extreme alcoholism after founding the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery in Galloway, Scotland, and the Shambhala Mountain Center outside Boulder, Colorado. His mother is Lady Diana Judith Mukpo, born Diana Pybus, the daughter of a wealthy London lawyer. She attended Benenden School, an all-girl's boarding school in Kent, England, where she is thought to have been a contemporary of Princess Anne and Baroness Manningham-Buller, former Director General of MI5. In December 1968, aged 15 and on her Christmas break from Benenden, Diana met 28-year-old Chögyam Mukpo, or Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche as he was known as a lama, at the Buddhist Society in London’s Eccleston Square. In the documentary Tulku, she recalled the first time she laid eyes on the monk, saying: 'I felt like I'd known him for lifetimes. Just immediate, instantaneous lifetime connection. and the rest is history.' She later sneaked out of her boarding school stole into his hotel room that night. She later recalled that she had been hoping that she would end up in bed with him when she introduced herself. Luminaries: Trungpa founded a monastery outside Boulder, Colorado, where he attracted poets, writers and musicians. He is seen here with Allen Ginsberg . Holy man: Mr Mukpo is a tulku, a child who is a reincarnation of a Buddhist master . Trungpa, who had been having sex since age 13, obliged. Trungpa had traveled to Britain in 1963 on a scholarship to study at Oxford University after fleeing the Chinese occupation of Tibet, and shortly before meeting Diana, he had been teaching David Bowie about Buddhism. In 1970, Diana, just 16 and the Tibetan guru, aged 30, ran away to Scotland to marry. The sensational story of the  lawyer's teenage daughter who ran away to marry a monk nearly twice her age became front page news. 'We must have been quite a sight,' Mrs Mukpo wrote in 2002. 'Thirty-year-old Rinpoche, a rather short Tibetan, crippled with a special caliper on his leg and a cumbersome walker to support him, and me, Diana Pybus, a tall, sixteen-year-old girl with long blond hair.’ The cameraman took to Facebook on a number of occasions while in West Africa, describing the desperation of the situation as it unfolded. On September 18, he posted a message describing how he has seen some 'bad things' and told his friends how 'unpredictable and fraught with danger life can be'. The message appeared on the page: 'Man oh man I have seen some bad things in the last two weeks of my life. 'How unpredictable and fraught with danger life can be. 'How in some parts of the world, basic levels of help and assistance that we take for granted completely don't exist for many people. 'The raw coldness of deprivation and the potential for true darkness that exists in the human experience. 'I hope that humanity can figure out how we can take care of each other and our world. 'Simple, soft aspiration for all my brothers and sisters on this earth who suffer the elements and the cold. may we all be free, loved, and tended to... ' Mukpo had been doing human rights work in West Africa for 'several years before returning to Liberia when the Ebola outbreak began, his biological father, Dr Mitchell Levy said in a statement. 'Having lived there for the last several years, Ashoka was well aware of the risks but felt strongly about trying to help provide honest perspective from the ground level.' Dr Levy confirmed his son had been diagnosed and said: 'Ashoka is being evacuated to the USA where he will receive the best possible treatment. The doctors are optimistic about his prognosis.' Religious reincarnation: As a tulku child, Ashoka travelled to Tibet with his family at a young age and was ‘enthroned’ as the reincarnation of a highly regarded monk named Khamyon Rinpoche . Mukpo, from Providence, Rhode Island, recently posted on Facebook that he had seen some 'bad things' and told his friends how 'unpredictable and fraught with danger life can be' Inspired: Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche taught David Bowie mediation at a centre in Scotland in the late 1960s . 'We are doing everything we can to get him the best care possible. He will be flown back to the United States for treatment at a medical center that is equipped to handle Ebola patients,' said NBC News President Deborah Turness said in a note to staff concerning the sick journalist. 'The rest of the crew, including Dr. Nancy, are being closely monitored and show no symptoms or warning signs,' she added.

"Why can't God and science exist concurrently? And why shouldn't we remain relgious while embracing the ways technology is altering our life pattern? These are some of the fundamentals behind the Terasem Faith, a new-age religion that has been developed to allow people to continue following their traditional denomination while endorsing the advancement of science and technology. According to a TIME magazine feature, Terasem’s followers are dedicated to studying and raising awareness about what they call 'personal cyberconciousness' or the creation of mindfiles. However skeptics have been quick to call it 'the rapture of the nerds'. The Rothblatt family that created and run the Terasem Faith keep a robot named BINA48 - named after mother and wife Bina Rothblatt - to see how precisely a robot in 2014 can function using the mindfiles system . Terasem subscribers believe that by ritualistically recording your thoughts and feelings, you can ultimately assemble a digital copy of yourself that would be available for future use. It starts with writing down or recording a video of a thought, memory or feeling and uploading it to a website, with more than 32,000 people so far creating free mindfile accounts. The mindfiles are stored on servers located in the two Terasem headquarters in Vermont and Florida, and by using Terasem’s services you accept their promise that they will protect those files for the long-term future, making it possible for some not-yet-invented software to organize those files and upload them into an artificial body 500 years from now. 'A lot of people have problems digesting the idea,' says Gabriel Rothblatt, a pastor at Terasim and son of the creators, Bina and Martine Rothblatt. 'Instead of saying ''mindfiling'', I say ‘'digital scrapbooking''.' Terasem comes from the Greek word for 'Earthseed' and is organized around four core tenets— life is purposeful, death is optional, God is technological and love is essential. A new religion has set out to store memories for centuries and deliver its believers into a world where our souls can outlive their human carriers. It is considered a 'transreligion', meaning followers do not have to give up being Christian, Jewish or Muslim, for example, to join. 'Einstein said science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind,' Martine Rothblatt told TIME. 'Bina and I were inspired to find a way for people to believe in God consistent with science and technology so people would have faith in the future.' While Terasem is not short of skeptics, religious pundits say the ideology is befitting of today's world. More and more Americans are admitting to no longer being 'reglious', however maintaining they are 'spiritual'. Additionally, companies like Google and PayPal are investing millions of dollars into technology that could potentially alter the end of life. Gabriel Rothblatt, a pastor at Terasem and son of creators Bina and Martine Rothblatt, was working as the manager of a pizza restaurant until 2011 and is now running for Congress . Lori Rhodes, who helps run Terasem Movement Inc., said its easy to write it off as a cult, but insists it is just a religion finding its start. 'Most people say, '‘Oh, it looks like a cult'',’ Rhodes says. 'My older sister did. When she first looked at it, she told me, ''Don’t work for that organization. It looks like a cult and you’ll be blacklisted in the legal community''.' 'But any religion starts with just a few members. 'And I guess organized religion is cultish. 'Some people call it the rapture of the nerds.'","The Terasem Faith is a new-age religion designed to allow God and technology co-exist .

"Residents of Illinois and Connecticut are so unhappy with their states that half of residents say they would move if they could, a new poll has revealed. One in three Americans wish they could pull up their roots and move to another state, according to a new Gallup poll. More people are looking for greener pastures in states with dense population - specifically Illinois (home of Chicago) and the Northeast corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. Residents said they're hoping to find better jobs, be closer to family, have a higher quality of life and pay lower taxes elsewhere. Illinois had the highest portion of respondents saying they wanted to leave - 50percent, followed by Connecticut, Maryland, Nevada, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Restless: Residents of Illinois and Connecticut had the highest desire to move. People in Montana and Hawaii reporting having the lowest . It's no surprise that residents of Hawaii, who reside in a tropical paradise, aren't interested in leaving. But Montana's citizens are the happiest where they are - just 23 percent say they'd like to move. Maine, Oregon and New Hampshire residents follow close behind. Less than a quarter say they have any interest in leaving. A second poll question asked residents how likely they were to actually move to another state in the next year. Fully one in five of the Nevada residents who said they wanted to leave were said they planned to follow through. The state, which was especially hard-hit by both the recession and the housing bust, is still struggling. Its 8.5percent unemployment rate is the second highest in the nation. The percentage of foreclosures and homeowners underwater on their mortgages are among the top, as well. Illinois, which follows close behind Nevada for the highest percentage of residents planning to leave, also has higher unemployment and higher foreclosure rates than most of the country.

"A transgender woman who works as an engineer at Twitter has been charged with raping her wife after they had filed for divorce. Dana McCallum works as a senior Twitter engineer and is now facing five felony charges stemming from an incident that occurred the night after she served her wife of six years with divorce papers. McCallum, whose legal name on the charging documents is Dana Contreras, was arrested on January 26 and charged with three counts of spousal rape, one count of false imprisonment and one count of domestic violence. Accused: Dana McCallum has been charged with three counts of felony spousal rape by her wife after an alleged incident that occurred the night after McCallum served her with divorce papers . McCallum has been listed as one of the top ten most important LGBT people in tech and she has spoken at length about her transition after being born biologically male. She and her wife, who has not been named due to the nature of the crime, had been married for more than six years. The San Francisco Examiner reports that the 32-year-old engineer and her wife were separated but were still having sexual relations by the time of the alleged crime. McCallum had served her wife with divorce papers on January 25 but they met up at some point that evening. At 2am on January 26, police responded to a sex assault call at a residence in the Mission district of San Francisco. McCallum's wife accused her of rape, but McCallum has denied any wrongdoing. Outspoken: McCallum, pictured, has openly written about how she was born a biological man and has transitioned to living as a woman . According to the San Francisco police, the state of California classifies rape as penial on vaginal assault. They were not able to reveal any of the specific details about the suspect or the victim, but said that in order for a rape to have occurred, it would have to meet the aforementioned criteria. Denial: McCallum's lawyer said that there was no rape and that the case has only become an issue since McCallum is due to make a windfall when Twitter goes public . McCallum has written extensively about her lengthy transition to living as a woman, and while she has alluded to having procedures in the past but never specified if she had female genitalia surgically created. 'It takes forever. You don’t just go to . the doctor and get a “sex change operation” (that’s not even a real . thing) and then three days later you walk outside and have a brand new . life. No. My transition took nearly a year. And there’s a long period . during that time where you’re sort of in-between, not clearly male or . female,' she wrote in a personal essay shared on her website. Other common procedures can include breast augmentation, laser hair removal and Adam's apple and facial feminization as well as hormone therapy. McCallum's lawyer said 'this whole thing . is about money' because McCallum 'is about to come into a large amount . of money' because she is a senior engineer at the social media company . which went public in November. Lawyer John Funfola, told The Examiner that there were four teenagers in the house at the time of the alleged assault but they did not claim to have heard any struggle. 'No one heard ‘rape’ or fighting or anything,' Runfola said. 'I’m just disgusted that, you know, this is going on.' Famous face: McCallum, whose legal last name is Contreras, has been ranked one of the top ten most important LGBT individuals in the tech industry and works as a senior engineer at Twitter . McCallum posted a message on her widely-followed Twitter account on Friday afternoon, saying: ‘Can’t comment until the case is wrapped up. Bye for now <3’ She is known to be an outspoken advocate for equal rights and has published an essay version of the talk she gave last year to an LGBTQ (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Questioning) group at her old high school in Indiana. In the moving and detailed talk, she discussed the emotional and physical process of transitioning. 'My transition took nearly a year. And there’s a long period during that time where you’re sort of in-between, not clearly male or female,' she wrote.","Dana McCallum, a senior engineer at Twitter, is charged with raping her wife the night after having served her with divorce papers .

"A Nigerian pop singer and peace ambassador has sent shock waves across social media by offering her virginity to Islamic militants in exchange for the return of hundreds of kidknapped schoolgirls. Adokiye, 23, made the proposal to Boko Haram members to help free the 276 Nigerian girls which they snatched in April from the largely Christian north-eastern town of Chibok. The singer and actress from the country's Imo State told Nigerian newspaper Vanguard: 'This is 11pm in the night and do you know what I am thinking about? Those little girls, where they are and what could be happening to them. Scroll down for video . Nigeria singer and actress Adokiye, seen here making a kissing face to the camera in a picture she posted to her Instagram account, offer to the Boko Haram has been called both brave and a publicity stunt . Adokiye, pictured here looking natural in a selfie she posted on her Instagram account, said the kidnapped girls were too young and should be returned to their families . 'It is just unfair. They are too young. I wish I could offer myself in exchange.' The UN Ambassador of Peace also added: 'They are between 12 and 15 year old girls for Christ sake. I am older and more experienced. Even if 10 to 12 men have to take me every night, I don’t care. Just release these girls and let them go back to their parents.' The kidnapping, by the Abubakar Shekau led group, has already sparked a worldwide campaign #BringBackOurGirls. It has been backed by celebrities and high-profile leaders like David Cameron and Michelle Obama but Twitter uses weren't so sure about the merits of Adokiye's offer. The Nigerian schoolgirls were kidnapped by terrorist group, Boko Haram, which is led by Abubakar Shekau seen here in a video released soon after the abductions . The schoolgirls are seen at an unknown location in this still taken from a video released by the terrorists . A video from a news report shows one of the 276 kidnapped girls standing in front of the other victims . Twitter user Singhatul2014 said the offer was 'very touching' and that Adokiye should be given a Nobel Peace Prize, while user Kunleadefioye asked: 'And what can one make of this Adokiye offer - genuine, gallery play, tacky postering or...' Meanwhile, Islamists fighting for Boko Haram are leaving their forest hiding places after a number of senior militants died as a result of relentless attacks by snakes and bees, it has been claimed. Two suspected Boko Haram gunmen arrested in Maiduguri in north eastern Nigeria claimed that members of the group have now fled the Sambisa Forest, close to the border with Cameroon, following 'incessant snake bites' and bee stings. Nigeria's army have been trying to flush the militants out the area for months, but it appears they are now leaving voluntarily in the belief the attacks are the spirits of their victims haunting them.","Adokiye says she wishes she could be exchanged for the schoolgirls .

"These extraordinary photographs show the extreme differences between everyday life in North and South Korea. The two countries were culturally identical before they were split into the communist North and capitalist South - but now they are almost unidentifiable. German photographer Dieter Leistner travelled around both countries, capturing images which demonstrate the huge gulf between them. Scroll down for video . Morose: The metro in Pyongyang, where commuters look glum and the train is showing its age . Playful: Young people enjoying themselves on the modern subway in South Korea's capital Seoul . Austere: Three women in drab clothing crossing the road in North Korea . Extravagant: The women in Seoul are more colourfully dressed while the street presents a lively scene . South Korea's capital Seoul appears modern, prosperous and busy, while Pyongyang in North Korea is desolate and underdeveloped. Mr Leistner was given official permission to travel to Pyongyang in 2006, and returned to the peninsula six years later to take complementary photographs of Seoul. He sought out comparable locations in order to capture a set of photos which would highlight the similarities and differences between the two nations. In Seoul people can be seen chatting on the subway, whereas those on the metro in North Korea seem to be more subdued. Old-fashioned: The Okryu restaurant in North Korea, with distinctly archaic decor . Relaxed: South Korean customers chatting in the Cafe Sunset overlooking the Dongjak Bridge . Ranks of students: A language course at the 'Grand People's Study House' in Pyongyang . Sophisticated: Students using computers and Powerpoint presentations at Daelim University in South Korea . Drab: Two women stand outside a concrete building in North Korea, next to a pile of building materials . Slick: Workers take a cigarette break in South Korea, in front of a backdrop of skyscrapers . The photos of North Korea showcase bronze statues of Communist heroes and wide avenues with very few cars and people. The bustling streets of Seoul could not be more different, choked with cars and people and late-night shopping. Mr Leistner's book, Korea-Korea, reflects on the parallels with the situation in his own home country, which was for decades split between West and East Germany. His images are supported by excerpts from two diaries. The first was written by Philipp Sturm, who grew up in East Germany and accompanied Mr Leistner to Pyongyang. Undeveloped: Fields in one of the counties outside North Korea's capital city Pyongyang . Infrastructure: A road leading out of the Seoul suburbs presents a stark contrast . Waiting: Commuters in Pyongyang wait for the bus to arrive . Hi-tech: The bus stop outside a school in Seoul is shaped to look like a giant television . Empty: A policewoman directs traffic on the deserted streets of North Korea . Commerce: A woman selling hats in the bustling centre of Seoul . The second was written by Ahn Hehn-Chu, who was born in Germany to Korean parents, and has regularly visited Seoul since she was a child. In her diary entry, she described how dynamic Seoul is. She wrote: 'I've been to the former night market in Dongdae-mun at 4am to go shopping before but this is the first time I've gone to a hair salon that's open 24 hours.' Mr Sturm's account of North Korea, by contrast, highlights the strict regulations imposed on visitors, and what they are allowed to photograph and record. After landing in Pyongyang, he wrote: 'Once inside, border guards stamp our passports and ask us to hand in our mobile phones for the duration of our visit - for security reasons, they say.' Secrecy: This photograph of the Geumsusan Palace symbolises the closed culture of North Korea . Boulevard: A statue of admiral Yi Sun-sin on one of Seoul's main thoroughfares . Desolate: North Koreans walk past a building with peeling paint . Divergence: The two countries used to be indistinguishable, but this image shows how South Korea has experienced economic growth to give it a Western feel . Glory? A statue of Kim Il Sung, founding leader of North Korea, next to a Soviet-style monument . History: South Korea's monument to King Sejong with a group of visitors posing for a photograph . He also recounted visiting the Mangyongdae Children's Palace, where school children can part in extracurricular activities in line with their talents. 'Countless children appear, as if ordered and perform for us and our escorts on command,' Mr Sturm wrote. Mr Leistner studied photo engineering and visual communication in Cologne, Essen, and Wuppertal. In 1999, he became a professor of photography in the design department at the Würzburg-Schweinfurt University of Applied Sciences.

"Kim Jong-Un has been 're-elected' as leader of North Korea having executed his politically-powerful uncle last year and successfully disposed of 11 high-ranking government officials over the weekend. After a pre-determined vote, in which no-one else was allowed to stand, Kim was reaffirmed as First Chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission (NDC) by the country's new rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly. The state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) described the election as 'the great jubilee in the nation's history' and told how parliament cheered as the result was announced. Kim Jong-Un casts his ballot during last month's North Korean 'elections'. He has now been reaffirmed as First Chairman of the National Defence Commission, the country's most powerful body . 'All the deputies and participants in the session broke into stormy cheers of ""hurrah!"", extending the highest glory and warmest congratulations to him,' KCNA said. Last month North Koreans cast ballots in a pre-determined election where all of the candidates stood unopposed. Kim had his uncle and former political mentor Jang Song-thaek executed last year . The rubber-stamp assembly is the first under the leadership of Kim who took over from his father in December 2011. In the shadowy world of North Korean politics the NDC is widely seen as the nation’s highest decision-making body. Kim's uncle and political mentor Jang Song-thaek, who was executed as a traitor in December last year before reportedly being fed to a pack of hungry dogs, had previously served as vice chairman. Kim is now expected to appoint several elderly military leaders, including defence minister Jang Jong-Nam and chief of the military's general staff Ri Yong-Gil,  to the commission. Yesterday it was reported that one of Jang's closes associates, O Sang-hon was executed with a flamethrower after being branded an 'enemy of the state'. Mr O is thought to be the latest of 11 senior Workers Party figures to have been executed this year over their links to Mr Jang, with South Korean media reporting that Kim Jong-un has plans to execute or imprison hundreds more of his supporters and extended family members. Mr O had been Mr Jang's deputy at North Korea's ministry of public security. The ministry has since been closed, with all 11 of the most senior officials said to have been either executed or sent to one of Kim Jong-un's concentration camps.","Kim reaffirmed as Chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission .

"Oldest case in Egypt: The 2,250-year-old Ptolemaic mummy, which revealed tell-tale signs of prostate cancer under high-powered digital imaging . Scientists believe they have discovered the oldest case of prostate cancer in Egypt after scans on a 2,250-year-old mummy showed the man died a slow and painful death from the disease. The unnamed Ptolemaic mummy, which is kept at the National Archaeology Museum of Lisbon, had a pattern of round and dense tumours between its pelvis and lumbar spine - giveaway signs of man's modern-day killer. The mummy was that of a 5ft 5ins adult male‭ who lived between 285 and 230 BC and was between 51 and 60 years old when he died, researchers said. 'The bone lesions were considered very suggestive of metastatic prostate cancer,‭' ‬wrote the researchers in the International Journal of Paleopathology. They subjected the mummy, known as M1, to powerful Multi Detector Computerized Tomography‭ (‬MDCT‭) ‬scans, which produced‭ 'really unusual high quality images', ‬Carlos Prates,‭ ‬a radiologist at Imagens Médicas Integradas in Lisbon, told Discovery News. Digital X-rays showed that M1‭ ‬had been buried with crossed arms‭ - a common pose in Ptolemaic mummies,‭ ‬although in the New Kingdom it was often associated with royals‭. He was adorned with a cartonnage mask and bib,‭ ‬and boasted an elaborately painted shroud. The images showed he suffered from lumbosacral osteoarthritis,‭ ‬which was probably related to a lower lumbar scoliosis and there were several‭ post-mortem fractures,‭ ‬possibly produced when the mummy was transported to Europe. But they also found a variety of tumors,‭ ‬measuring between‭ ‬0.03ins‭ ‬and‭ ‬0.59‭inches,‭ ‬interspersed‭ along ‬M1‭’‬s pelvis and lumbar spine.‭ . Prostatic carcinoma begins in the . walnut-sized prostate gland and typically spreads to the pelvic region,‭ . ‬the lumbar spine,‭ ‬the upper arm and leg bones, and the ribs,‭ . ‬ultimately reaching most of the skeleton.‭ . Agonising end: The mummy, known as M1, was a 5ft 5ins adult male who died a painful death at the hands of the disease aged between 51 and 60 . Dr Prates and colleagues‭ ‬considered other diseases as alternatives.‭ ‬But‭ ‬M1‭'‬s sex,‭ ‬age,‭ ‬the‭ ‬distribution pattern of the lesions,‭ ‬their shape and density,‭ ‬strongly argued for prostate cancer. 'It is the oldest known case of prostate cancer in ancient Egypt and the‭ ‬second‭ ‬oldest case in history,‭' Dr ‬Prates said. The earliest diagnosis of‭ ‬metastasising prostate carcinoma came in‭ ‬2007 ‬when researchers investigated the skeleton of a‭ ‬2,700-year-old Scythian king who died,‭ ‬aged‭ ‬40 to 50,‭ ‬in the steppe of Southern Siberia,‭ ‬Russia.‭ . 'This study shows that cancer did exist in antiquity,‭ ‬for sure in ancient Egypt.‭ ‬The main reason for the scarcity of examples found today might be the lower prevalence of carcinogens and the shorter life expectancy,‭' ‬Paula Veiga,‭ ‬a researcher in Egyptology,‭ ‬told Discovery News. Moreover,‭ ‬high-resolution CT scanners,‭ ‬able to detect tiny‭ ‬tumors‭ only ‬became available only in‭ ‬2005., which suggests earlier researchers may have missed them.","Scans reveal tumours between pelvis and spine .

"The war on drugs has a new enemy, Greek yogurt. The US Air Force has banned blueberry-flavored Chobani yogurt because it contains hemp seeds – which themselves contain THC, the active ingredient in marijuana – which could lead to positive results during drug testing. Blueberry is the only Chobani flavour containing hemp seed, which a company spokesperson told the Air Force Times has about 10 grams worth. Banned: This yogurt has been banned by the US Air Force for containing hemp seeds . ‘The Air Force has not restricted military members from consuming Chobani Greek yogurt,’ Captain Adam Koudelka told the Times, adding that ‘only Chobani yogurt that contains hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited, just as any product which contains or is derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited. The Air Force banned hemp-derived products in 1999. Hemp and hemp seed oil products have been banned because they can lead to violations of the military branch’s drug testing program, according to regulations. ‘Studies have shown that products made with hemp seed and hemp seed oil may contain varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an active ingredient of marijuana which is detectable under the Air Force Drug Testing Program,’ states a regulation quoted by the Times. ‘The ingestion of products containing or products derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited.’ The yogurt comp[any spokesperson defended their product, telling the Times that ‘the THC level of the hemp seeds is less than 10 parts per million per 100 grams of hemp seeds, so the maximum amount of THC in the yogurt would be 1 part per million.’ With the Air Force threshold for a failing test coming in at 50 part of THC per billion per 100 grams, according to the Times, the yogurt should be safe. ‘Based upon the research we have conducted from the published literature available, the findings suggest that hemp food consumption is not likely to meet this threshold if THC levels in hemp oil and hulled seeds are maintained below 5 and 2 parts per million respectively.’ Based on those numbers, it is unlikely the yogurt would cause a failed test.","The Air Force has banned all hemp-based products since 1999 .

"Nearly a decade before Amanda Berry was found alive in the home of her alleged abductor, the young woman's mother went on The Montel Williams Show and was told in no uncertain terms by a celebrity psychic that he daughter was dead. Self-described medium and spiritual teacher Sylvia Browne told Berry's mother, Louwanna Miller, on a 2004 episode that Amanda, who went missing the year before, was no longer among the living, causing the desperate mother to break down in tears. 'She's not alive, honey,' Browne told Miller on the show, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.' Supernatural help: Talk show host Montel Williams *(right) invited Louwanna Miller to talk to psychic Sylvia Browne (left) about her missing daughter in 2004 . Hope lost: Browne (left) told Miller (right) that her daughter was 'not alive' that that she would see her in heaven, leaving the mother '98 per cent' sure that the medium was right . Browne added that she would only see her daughter 'in heaven, on the other side.' Amanda Berry, now 26, escaped from the basement of a Cleveland home on Monday night with Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who all disappeared from the same block ten years ago. They were found with a six-year-old girl, who relatives confirmed Amanda gave birth to while held against her will at the home for a decade. Amanda went missing on April 21, 2003, on the eve of her 17th birthday shortly after she called her sister to say that she was getting a ride home from her job at Burger King. On Monday night, Amanda had a smile on her face as she hugged her weeping sister Beth as the pair were reunited for the first time in a decade following her decade in captivity in the home of Ariel Castro. Tragic end: Louwanna Miller, pictured with Amanda Berry, died from a heart failure in 2006 . The kidnapping victim also introduced her sister to her daughter, who was born during the 10-year ordeal. After 19 months of refusing to accept that her daughter was dead, Miller was finally forced to face what she believed at the time to be the awful truth. The grieving mother gave away her daughter's computer and took down her pictures. 'I'm not even buying my baby a Christmas present this year,' she told the paper. Miller was devastated by what she heard on the nationally syndicated talk show, but said that she believed '98 per cent' in Browne. The mother said after her on-screen conversation with Sylvia Browne that while she wanted to hold on to hope that Amanda was still alive, after a year-and-a-half without any breaks in the investigation, she had little to go on. 'It seems like the God-honest truth. My daughter would always call home,' Miller said. The FBI and police working on the missing person case were skeptical of the psychic's verdict, saying they will consider Amanda Berry was alive until her body and evidence proving that she was dead is found. Reunited: Amanda Berry (centre) at the Cleveland Hospital alongside her emotional sister (left) and the daughter that she gave birth to during the 10 years she was held against her will . Before the kidnapping: Amanda Berry, pictured . before her disappearance, was last seen leaving her job at Burger King a . day before her 17th birthday and told her sister that she was getting a . ride home . House of horrors: Amanda Berry was freed along with two other women from this home in Cleveland, Ohio, where the three had been held captive for 10 years . Louwanna Miller died at age 44 from a heart failure and a host of other ailments a little more than a year after her 2004 encounter with Sylvia Browne. Miller had spent three years searching for her daughter, during which time those who knew her said the woman’s health had deteriorated. On Monday, Amanda Berry was discovered alive after she managed to escape from the Cleveland home of a man she said had kept her in captivity for the past 10 years along with two other young women. Those who knew Mrs Miller, among them Councilwoman Dona Brady, said that the devastated mother died of a broken heart. Neither Browne not representatives from The Montel Williams Show have publicly commented on Amanda Berry's case. On Tuesday, the 76-year-old psychic faced sharp criticism for falsely predicting the death of the missing teen. In hot water: Browne, 76, has been lambasted for wrongly predicting Amanda's death, with online commenters calling her names and accusing her of being a fraud . Long career: Browne has been a regular on talk shows like The Montel Williams Show and the Tonight Show with Jay Leno (pictured) Furious Twitter and Facebook users heaped insults on Browne, calling her a 'grief vampire' and a' hunch-backed harpy,' among other things. 'I remember you on Montel Williams telling the family of Amanda Berry she was dead,"" wrote Facebook commenter Lisa Lupas on Browne's Facebook page. 'What do you have to say for yourself? You are a fraud! What a horrible horrible thing to say to a family holding on to nothing but hope and faith. Shame on you!' Another commenter Michael Martin wrote: 'Hey Sylvia, Amanda Berry is alive. Think of the torment you put her mother through when you told the poor woman her daughter was dead. 'Then the mother herself died before she could learn the truth. You are evil, evil, evil and ought to be ashamed of yourself.' KIRO Radio host Dori Monson chided both the medium and Williams for taking hope away from Miller in her hour of grief and doubt, according to MyNorthWest.com. Past failure: Browne was under fire in 2007 for incorrectly telling the parents of missing 11-year-old Shawn Hornebeck (left) that he was dead. The teen was found alive four years later (right) 'The fact that he [Williams] got so far deep into the sewer that he brings this grieving mom on to have some phony psychic tell her that her daughter's dead...it's despicable,' said Monson. This is not the first time that Browne, who also has helped the FBI in the past, faced public scrutiny over her predictions. In 2003, the TV psychic incorrectly told the parents of missing 11-year-old boy Shawn Hornebeck that their son was dead, and that his body could be found near 'two jagged boulders,' ABC News reported. Nearly four years later, Shawn was found living with his kidnapper Michael Devlin 60 miles from his home in Missouri. A website was created in 2006 called Stop Sylvia Browne dedicated to documenting the psychic's purported failures.","Medium Sylvia Browne appeared in 2004 on the talk show and told Louwanna Miller: 'She's not alive, honey'

"A brave 12-year-old boy who was seriously injured while cheering on his runner mother in the Boston Marathon woke up between surgeries to ask if she completed the race despite the deadly blasts. Aaron Hern is one of at least 11 children wounded in the senseless attacks at the finish line of Monday's event and today doctors at Boston Medical Center revealed that a five-year-old boy is among those still fighting for life. No other details have been released about the youngster, who was presumably watching runners cross the finish line with his family. It's not known if they too are injured. Young victims: Martin Richard, left, died in the bombings, while Aaron Hern, right, was seriously wounded and will undergo his second surgery on Wednesday . The terrorist attack already cut short the life of eight-year-old Martin Richard of Dorchester, Massachusetts, and left kids as young as two with life-changing wounds. Young Aaron Hern, who was struck in the leg by shrapnel is scheduled to undergo surgery again today. Aaron was waiting to watch his mom, Katherine, cross the finish line when the explosions went off and now remains in serious condition at the intensive care unit of Boston Children's Hospital. He goes in and out of consciousness, but the first question the brave sixth-grader asked when he woke up after surgery was 'Did mom finish.'? 'We have to tell him over and over again that everyone is OK, that Mom finished, that he was the only one seriously hurt,' a family friend Sandra Hall told the Mercurynews.com. Boston Children's Hospital had a wave of young patients carted into its halls on stretchers after the bombings. Injured: Martin Richard's little sister Jane, pictured front, lost a leg in the attacks which also injured children as young as two . Fighter: Aaron, pictured with his mother who was running the race, goes in and out of consciousness at Boston's Children's Hospital . Nine kids were admitted in total including a two-year-old boy who suffered a bleeding head wound and a 9-year-old girl who had leg trauma so serious she spent hours in the operating room. Young Martin Richard was killed after the second bomb went off. His little sister, Jane, 6, lost a leg, and her father, Bill, told officials that she wouldn't have survived at all if it weren't for heroic first responders. Other children wounded when the pressure cooker device filled with nails and ball-bearings blew include a 14-year-old boy with a head injury and a 10-year-old girl with a leg fracture. A 12-year-old girl suffered a broken femur when the explosion went off at around 2:50 p.m. and a 7-year-old boy also suffered a leg injury. An additional three kids were treated in the ER for minor injuries. Doctors at Boston Medical Center revealed the number of patients still in critical condition had dropped from 11 to just two by Wednesday. Dr Peter Burke, chief of trauma surgery at BMC, said 19 of a total 23 patients the hospital received after the tragedy remain hospitalized. Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line . Kids in the crossfire: Boston Children's Hospital had a wave of young patients carted into its halls on stretchers after the bombings . 'This particular event was very much focused on the lower extremities, it seems,' Burke said, describing the types of injuries suffered. Only one or two people sustained head injuries and those injuries were not severe he said. According to Boston.com, eight patients will be operated on again today, many for the second or third time. On a happier note, Burke also said that one or two patients may be released from hospital today. 'I will not be happy until they are home,' Burke said. 'I will not be satisfied.' In addition to his scheduled surgery today, doctors will try to determine if young Aaron will need skin grafts to help heal his upper thigh where he was burned, Hall added. His distraught mother updated friends and family on Aaron's condition with a message on her Facebook page late on Monday. 'I'll keep this short because I need to get back to Aaron and try to get some sleep,' she wrote. 'First, thank you all so much for your thoughts and prayers. Aaron is in the ICU but stable. Has many lacerations but mostly superficial except one. One on his upper left thigh needs more surgery and just not sure yet the extent of the damage. Will be here about 7-10 days with follow up surgeries.'","Aaron Hern, 12, who is undergoing second surgery today, was watching mom, Katherine, when blasts went off .

"When best friends Ugonna Obuzor, Chiadika Biringa, Lloyd Toku, and Tekena Elkanah left their Nigerian university campus for a nearby village to collect a debt, none could have known they were walking towards a death of unutterable brutality. They were chased through the streets by stick and stone-wielding vigilantes, stripped naked and beaten until they were almost unconscious. They were dragged through mud, had concrete slabs dropped on their heads and car tyres filled with petrol wrapped around their necks. Then somebody lit a match. Scroll down for the video. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Classmates: Chiadika Biringa (left), 20, studied theatre arts while Tekena Elkanah (right), 20 was a technical student. The four traveled to Aluu to collect a debt .

This horrific orgy of violence and torture was also be filmed on a mobile phone and later uploaded to YouTube for the world to see. It is known as 'necklacing', the appalling method of killing which involves putting a petrol-filled tyre around a victim's neck and setting it ablaze, and this latest incident has sent shockwaves throughout Nigeria and the wider world. It is a horrifying example of what can happen when respect for the law drains away and communities turn to mob justice to summarily execute suspected criminals. Campaigners say police are largely to blame and are feared more than organised criminals in parts of Nigeria where faith in the judicial system has all but evaporated. Unspeakable: The orgy of horrific violence and torture was filmed on a mobile phone and later uploaded to YouTube for the world to see . Fear: They were dragged through mud, had concrete slabs dropped on their heads and tyres filled with petrol wrapped around their necks. Then somebody lit a match . And experts say so-called 'jungle justice' is increasing in many of Nigeria's poorer, more isolated communities where the Nigerian authorities have failed to crack down on a culture of impunity for crimes. Obuzor, Biringa, Toku, and Elkanah were roommates at the University of Port Harcourt, in Chuba, Nigeria. According to Biringa's mother, Chinewe, Obuzor had asked his friends to accompany him to the nearby village of Aluu because somebody there owed him money. What exactly happened when they arrived is unclear, but it has been claimed that Obuzor's debtor spread the word that the men were there to steal laptops and mobile phones and they were soon set upon. 'I want the world to know how our security failed us. I want the world to know that my son and his three friends are innocent of what they said they did,' Mrs Biringa told CNN. 'He was a very kindhearted boy and we (were) so close,' she said. 'If my son sees you 100 times he will greet you 110 times.' Best friends: According to Biringa's mother, Chinewe, the four friends dreamed of launching a music career and had already recorded a song together called, Aint No Love in the City . A family's pain: Chiadika Biringa's parents and Chinewe and Steven say they watched the video because they wouldn't have believed it if they hadn't seen their son's killing with their own eyes . According to reports the village had been shaken by a series of recent armed robberies and villagers were on high alert. But Mrs Biringa said . the three friends were entirely innocent and dreamed of launching a . music career. They had already recorded a song together called, Aint No . Love in the City. Mrs Biringa and her husband, Steven, an oil executive at Nigerian National . Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), says that he watched the video because he . wouldn't have believed it if he hadn't seen his son's killing with his . own eyes. Suspects: Thirteen villagers from Aluu are paraded by police in Port Harcourt. Among them was the village chieftain . Oil country: The four young men were studying at the University of Port Harcourt. Aluu is nearby . 'I want them to know from beginning to end the barbaric nature with which they chose hunt them down,' he said. 'Even your worse enemy should not be treated in such form in the 21st century that people are still behaving and killing human beings as if they were rats.' In the wake of the killing students at University of Port Harcourt (Uniport) rioted, burning cars, shops and houses. 'Necklacing' is the practice of forcing a tyre filled with petrol over victim's head and shoulders and setting it alight. It can often take a victim more than 20 minutes to die in excruciating agony. In the violent 1980s and 1990s, . necklacing was a common sentence imposed by 'people's courts' on . collaborators with the apartheid regime and criminals in South Africa. It is still used in certain, more lawless, parts of Africa, where corrupt police are no longer trusted, to punish thieves and rapists. Incidents have been reported more recently in Haiti, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and India. Brazilian drug lords are also known to have 'necklaced' their enemies, most notoriously the journalist Tim Lopes in 2002. He was kidnapped by local drug dealers while investigating crime in Rio's favelas. His hands, arms, and legs were severed with a sword while still alive, and then had his body placed within tires, covered in gasoline and set on fire. Anti riot police were called in and the campus was shut down indefinitely. Spurred into action by the uproar surrounding the incident, Nigerian police have since arrested at least 19 people from the village of Aluu, including its chieftain Alhaji Hassan Welewa. A police spokesman said: 'The police immediately launched an investigation leading to the arrest of Alhaji Hassan Welewa, the traditional ruler of Omukiri Community, Aluu, where the heinous incident took place and eighteen others, some of who are members of the vigilante group of the community.' Police said officers on the scene were unable to prevent the sickening lynching because they were pelted with stones by villagers until they fled on foot. In the violent 1980s and 1990s, necklacing was a common sentence imposed by 'people's courts' on collaborators with the apartheid regime and criminals. It was frequently carried out in the name of the now-ruling African National Congress. Now necklacing is being used across parts of Africa where law is seen to have failed. Incidents have been reported in South Africa against Zimbabweans and Mozambicans who have fled violence and poverty in their own countries. In horrific attacks, mainly around Johannesburg, women have been raped and men beaten to death. Shops and homes have been looted and dozens of shacks burned to the ground. Thousands of refugees have fled to the comparative safety of police stations.","Ugonna Obuzor, Chiadika Biringa, Lloyd Toku, and Tekena Elkanah were were accused of stealing then stripped naked .

"Many cats are mesmerised by televisions and their moving pictures. Alphie the kitten was more fascinated by the six-inch aerial  on his owner’s TV – and ended up swallowing it. The tabby needed emergency surgery when the metal antenna became lodged in his throat and stomach. Owner Vanessa Waite, 36, of Sheffield, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw the X-ray. 'The aerial looked huge in his tiny body. It’s amazing he’s gone on to make a full recovery. He’s still a real handful. Survivor: Senior Vet Liz Airey had to perform a life-saving operation on Alphie the kitten when he swallowed a six-inch television aerial . Lodged: This dramatic x-ray shows how the aerial became stuck in Alphie's oesophagus and stomach after he swallowed it . Lucky: Vets at PDSA's Sheffield PetAid hospital were stunned when x-rays revealed the six-inch antenna . 'He’ll try to stick anything in his mouth. He still loves the TV too but I don’t leave him alone with it anymore.’ The spike became lodged in Alphie's oesophagus . and stomach, forcing vets at animal charity The People's Dispensary for . Sick Animals (PDSA) to perform emergency surgery to save the kitten's . life. Shortly after owner Vanessa Waite brought Alphie home she noticed that her new pet was something of a telly addict. He . would sit mesmerised by the moving pictures on the television screen, . but Ms Waite said she had no idea that her kitten had also developed an . unhealthy obsession with the aerial. She said that she had taken Alphie to see the vets near her home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, after he had been sick, and noticed that her aerial was missing. 'One night I heard a loud bang and . went upstairs to investigate but I assumed Alphie had fallen off the . window sill,' said the 36-year-old. 'He seemed okay and was just hiding under the bed. 'However, . during the night he was being sick so the next morning I took him to . the PDSA. 'It wasn't until later that I realised that one of the aerial . antennas was missing from my TV.' Ms Waite rushed her pet to the nearby PDSA Sheffield PetAid hospital where she was told that the aerial would prove to be fatal if left inside Alphie for much longer. Surgeons had to carefully remove the metal rod through Alphie's minute stomach. Senior vetinary surgeon Liz Airey said that Alphie's case was one of the most unusual she had ever come across. 'It's very rare,' she said. 'We did have a case a few years ago when a dog ate a tent peg but it's very unusual for such a solid object to be swallowed in this way. 'It seems as though the kitten had been playing with the antenna and inadvertently swallowed it which is a very unusual accident. 'It's fortunate that he didn't swallow it the other way round as the sharp broken end could have punctured his stomach and caused damage to his intestines which could have been fatal.' Fortunately Alphie has now a full . recovery following his ordeal, however Ms Waite said that he had not . learned from his near-death experience. She said: 'I'm so grateful to PDSA for saving his life, and it's amazing that he's gone on to make a full recovery. Ordeal: Alphie managed to swallow the metal aerial despite the fact it is nearly as long as him . 'When he came home it was like nothing had happened - it definitely hasn't taught him any lessons.' The PDSA said that vets have seen . many cases of pets that have swallowed strange items, including rubber . ducks, golf balls, socks and babies dummies . The charity advises all pet owners to consult their vet immediately if they suspect their animal has swallowed something unusual. Recovery: Owner Vanessa Waite, right, said that Alphie had fully recovered from his ordeal and although he was still a fan of the television she no longer leaves him alone with it .","Metal rod became lodged in tabby Alphie's stomach and oesophagus .

"The glacier named after Danish explorer Knud Rasmussen in Greenland . A stash of 80-year-old photo plates in a Danish basement has proved that Greenland's ice was melting even faster then that it is now. In the thirties, Greenland's ice was melting rapidly, then there was a cooling period in the middle part of the twentieth century, and now it is melting again, accelerating in the 2000s. Images of ice shelves from the pre-satellite era are extremely rare, so it's often difficult to assess the scale and speed of Arctic ice melting today. Researchers at the National Survey and Cadastre of Denmark had been storing the glass plates since explorer Knud Rasmussen's expedition to the southeast coast of Greenland in the early 1930s. In this week's online edition of Nature Geoscience, Ohio State University researchers and colleagues in Denmark describe how they analyzed ice loss in the region by comparing the images on the plates to aerial photographs and satellite images taken from World War II to today. Taken together, the imagery shows that glaciers in the region were melting even faster in the 1930s than they are today, said Jason Box, associate professor of geography and researcher at the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State. A brief cooling period starting in the mid-20th century allowed new ice to form, and then the melting began to accelerate again in the 2000s. ‘Because of this study, we now have a detailed historical analogue for more recent glacier loss,’ Box said. ‘And we've confirmed that glaciers are very sensitive indicators of climate.’ Pre-satellite observations of Greenland glaciers are rare - but some are available. Images recorded in 1933 (left) and 2010 from a glacier northeast of Tasiilaq: During the 77 year period the glacier has retreated 1.7km . Anders Anker Bjørk, doctoral fellow at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and lead author of the study, is trying to compile all such imagery. He found a clue in the archives of The Arctic Institute in Copenhagen in 2011. ‘We found flight journals for some old planes, and in them was a reference to National Survey and Cadastre of Denmark,’ Bjørk said. A stash of 80-year-old photo plates in a Danish basement has proved that Greenland's ice was melting even faster then that it is now . Knud Rasmussen, the Danish polar explorer whose photo archive contained the shock news about Arctic ice melt . As it happens, researchers at the National Survey had already contacted Bjørk about a find of their own. ‘They were cleaning up in the basement and had found some old glass plates with glaciers on them. The reason the plates were forgotten was that they were recorded for mapping, and once the map was produced they didn't have much value.’ Those plates turned out to be documentation of Rasmussen's 7th Thule Expedition to Greenland. They contained aerial photographs of land, sea and glaciers in the southeast region of the country, along with travel photos of Rasmussen's team. The researchers digitized all the old images and used software to look for differences in the shape of the southeast Greenland coastline where the ice meets the Atlantic Ocean. Then they calculated the distance the ice front moved in each time period. The Heinkel hydroplane after returning from a surveying mission during Knud Rasmussen¿s . expedition to Greenland in the 1930s . Over the 80 years, two events stand out: glacial retreats from 1933-1934 and 2000-2010. In the 1930s, fewer glaciers were melting than are today, and most of those that were melting were land-terminating glaciers, meaning that they did not contact the sea. Those that were melting retreated an average of 20 meters per year - the fastest retreating at 374 meters per year. Fifty-five percent of the glaciers in the study had similar or higher retreat rates during the 1930s than they do today. Still, more glaciers in southeast Greenland are retreating today, and the average ice loss is 50 meters per year. That's because a few glaciers with very fast melting rates - including one retreating at 887 meters per year - boost the overall average. But to Box, the most interesting part of the study is what happened between the two melting events. From 1943-1972, southeast Greenland cooled - probably due to sulfur pollution, which reflects sunlight away from the earth. Sulfur dioxide is a poisonous gas produced by volcanoes and industrial processes. It has been tied to serious health problems and death, and is also the main ingredient in acid rain. Its presence in the atmosphere peaked just after the Clean Air Act was established in 1963. As it was removed from the atmosphere, the earlier warming resumed. The important point is not that deadly pollution caused the climate to cool, but rather that the brief cooling allowed researchers to see how Greenland ice responded to the changing climate. The glaciers responded to the cooling more rapidly than researchers had seen in earlier studies. Sixty percent of the glaciers advanced during that time, while 12 percent were stationary. And now that the warming has resumed, the glacial retreat is dominated by marine-terminating outlet glaciers, the melting of which contributes to sea level rise. ‘From these images, we see that the mid-century cooling stabilized the glaciers,’ Box said. ‘That suggests that if we want to stabilize today's accelerating ice loss, we need to see a little cooling of our own.’ Southeast Greenland is a good place to study the effects of climate change, he explained, because the region is closely tied to air and water circulation patterns in the North Atlantic. ‘By far, more storms pass through this region - transporting heat into the Arctic - than anywhere else in the Northern Hemisphere. Climate change brings changes in snowfall and air temperature that compete for influence on a glacier's net behavior,’ he said.","80-year-old photo plates from Danish polar explorer .

"The woman at the center of the firestorm surrounding Clippers owner Donald Sterling has broken her silence in her first television interview. V. Stiviano sat down with Barbara Walters tonight on ABC's 20/20 to give her take on the racism controversy the broke when audio recordings of Stiviano and Sterling were made public. Incredibly, the 31-year-old, who described herself as Sterling's 'silly rabbit,' said she does not believe Donald Sterling is a racist. Most-talked about woman: V. Stiviano finally broke her silence over the Donald Sterling racism controversy . 'I don't believe it in my heart,' she said, adding that although she's heard him make racist comments, she doesn't think he truly believes them. 'I think the things he says are not the things he feels,' she said. 'Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment.' When Stiviano sat down to speak with Walters, she had reportedly just been in the company of Donald Sterling. She described his mindset as, 'Confused. I think he feels very alone. Not truly supported by those around him. Tormented. Emotionally traumatized.' Stiviano said she was urging Sterling to 'come to his own rescue.' Sterling has been stung by his treatment by his peers, the media, from his employees and acquaintances, Stiviano said. On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5 million and urged league owners to force him to sell the team. A three-quarters vote by the NBA owners is required to force him to sell. Stiviano told Walters that she 'absolutely' thinks Sterling should apologize for his comments, but that 'only God knows' if he will. She also said she believes Sterling's outrageous comments were, in part, a generational issue. 'I think Mr Sterling's from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe these things,' she said, before accidentally tipping Walters off that despite being a Jew, Sterling has anti-Semitic views also. 'But through his actions, he's shown that he's not a racist. Through his actions, he's shown himself to be a very generous and kind man,' she said. The racist diatribe which Sterling can be heard making on audio recorded by Stiviano herself, was prompted by people saying bad things about Sterling's relationship with Stiviano. Mom: V Stiviano, pictured, the woman at the center of Donald Sterling's race scandal, has adopted two African American boys, it emerged Tuesday . Saving face: Stiviano is seen emerging from her home before the interview wearing her now-customary face visor . All white: V. Stiviano stepped out in a crisp white suit hours after leaving the house in head-to-toe black . In abstract and sometimes rambling . terms, Stiviano appeared to paint herself as Sterling's savior during . his time of need - despite the fact that it is alleged she released the . recordings responsible for his downfall herself. 'I . think Mr Sterling is being tested right now, by a higher power or . being. And I'm forced to come to his rescue because he can't rescue . himself.' When pressed to . explain the relationship between herself and Sterling, Stiviano said, . 'I'm Mr Sterling's personal assistant. Like I said, I'm his right hand. I'm his wingman. What isn't there to understand?' Walters asked whether Stiviano, then, is Sterling's employee. 'He . first started paying me as an employee and then he started paying me . off the books,' she responded, no doubt referring to the million-dollar . home, four luxury cars and $240,000 'living expenses' she has reportedly . received. 'I became part of . Mr Sterling's team. I became someone who protected him, someone who . took care of him, someone who watched everything he said and did, and . people did not like that.' 'So you helped him become a better person?' asked Walters. 'In every way. In every way,' responded Stiviano. 'Silly rabbit': V. Stiviano described herself to Barbara Walters as Donald Sterling's 'everything' Visor: Stiviano, seen Thursday, has been seen around town in the wake of the controversy, but Sterling has kept a low profile . She wouldn't allow Sterling to take meetings with certain people, Stiviano told Walters, which angered his business peers. She . said that executives and board members of the Clippers who were jealous . of the free reign she had when it came to the team would call Sterling . and tell him that Stiviano had brought people 'who look a certain way' to Clippers games when she wasn't there. But . not just black people, Stiviano claimed, but people 'that didn't give . me a good look,' like 'gangsters,' 'thugs,' 'bad women.' Walters asked, 'Are you in love with Donald Sterling?' 'I love him,' Stiviano responded, smiling widely, adding that she's not in love but rather loves him 'like a father figure.' Denying she's Sterling's 'mistress' or 'whore,' she said that she's more like his friend and right hand. 'I’m Mr. Sterling’s everything. I’m his confidante, his best friend, his silly rabbit,' she said, bizarrely. Stiviano . said the pair met while she was working for Sterling's non-profit . organization, the Donald T Sterling Foundation and evolved 'to so much . more.' Throughout the day prior to Stiviano's interview, Sterling had been in talks with both Barbara Walters and Anderson Cooper about appearing on camera, but pulled out at the last minute, putting Stiviano in the hot seat with Walters and leaving Cooper without an interview, reports TMZ. After the lengthy talk with Walters, Stiviano put her now-customary visor back over her face to face the waiting paparazzi. She told Walters it is a protective measure. 'I'm hurting, I'm in pain. It hurts to see someone you  care about hurting. It hurts to see people speculate, assume, say, throw darts at you when they don't know you ... It's easier to mask the pain.'","V. Stiviano gave an interview to Barbara Walters on ABC's 20/20 .

"A woman believed to be a British medical student who left the UK in order to join ISIS  has posted an image on social media of herself holding a severed head. The woman, who goes by the Twitter name of Mujahidah Bint Usama, claims to be a doctor for the terror group based in Raqqa, Syria. In the image, which was used as her profile picture but has since been removed, she can be seen wearing a full burka and white lab coat while holding the head of a man. Scroll down for video . A British medical student calling herself Mujahidah Bint Usama, 21, posted this image online of her holding a severed head while two children look on (censored by MailOnline) To the left of the image, two children can be seen standing beside her. Her name reflects her jihadi convictions, with Mujahidah appearing to be the female version of mujahadid - meaning soldier of God. Bint translates as 'child of', while Usama likely references Osama Bin Laden. The gruesome image appears alongside the message 'Dream job, a terrorist doc,' followed by images of smiley faces and love hearts. According to The Sunday Telegraph, she is a 21-year-old British medical student. Bint Usama, who has more than 800 followers on the social media site, has previously tweeted images of dead soldiers and the 9/11 terror attacks, alongside information on how to treat an injured knee and insomnia. GCHQ and MI5 are known to be monitoring the accounts of around 60 female British jihadis who are believed to be in Raqqa in order to put together a picture of their activities. The Government has previously stated that those who take part in atrocities such as beheadings and massacres will be prosecuted for war crimes and terror offences if they return to the UK. In other online messages Bint Usama praised Anwar al-Awlaki, an extremist Yemeni preacher who became an Al-Quaeda spokesman and is believed to have inspired hundreds of Western jihadis. She also praises women to push their husbands into fighting for Islam, and shared images of the execution of U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff, who was beheaded by ISIS earlier this month. Sixty female British jihadis are now thought to be with ISIS, including Aqsa Mahmood, 20 (left), who is believed to be leading the al-Khanssaa brigade in Raqqa, and Zahra Halane, 16, who fled the UK with her twin sister . Bint Usama has been linked through her Twitter account to the al-Khanssaa brigade, an all-female group of jihadists who are charged with punishing 'un-Islamic' behaviour by women in Raqqa. The name likely derives from Al-Khansa, a famous 7th-century female poet and contemporary of the Prophet Muhammad who converted to Islam and wrote elegies for his brothers, father and children after they were killed in battle. This week members of the brigade, which is thought to be led by British extremists, were reported to be acting as madams running brothels filled with captured Yazidi women, according to the Mirror. As many as 3,000 women and girls have been taken captive from the Yazidi tribe in Iraq as Isis militants continue their reign of terror across the region. The think tank MEMRI (the Middle East Media Research Institution) released a report saying that IS had taken many Yazidi women to be sold and used as sex slaves. The al-Khanssaa brigade is a female-only militia set up by the Islamic State in Raqqa, Syria, with a key figure believed to be Aqsa Mahmood, 20, of Glasgow, who fled to the country last year. Academics at King's College London have identified three other British females as members of the group - and say there are about 60 UK women who have gone to Syria on jihad. Most of these women - including privately-educated Mahmood - are aged between 18 and 24, with al-Khanssaa said to be seeking out people engaging in Western culture in Raqqa. It is believed that US hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff were both beheaded in the desert near Raqqa - and therefore the British women in al-Khanssaa could know who killed them. All of the women are thought to be based in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria (pictured), where the female al-Khanssaa brigade has been established to punish un-Islamic behaviour among women .","Woman calling herself Mujahidah Bint Usama posted image on Twitter .

"A U.S. doctor is has warned people against taking health supplements, saying they could pose a risk to health. Dr Paul Offit, who has written a book called 'Do You Believe In Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine', said that very few alternative health supplements are of any benefit and could in fact carry health risks. He added that people often believe that supplements are harmless but that this simply isn't true - particularly in the case of super-strength supplements which are becoming increasingly popular. Scroll down for video . Eat it, don't pop it: Dr Offit said there is probably a good reason that we don't find super high levels of certain nutrients in nature, and that taking a concentrated supplement is dangerous . 'When you take large quantities of vitamins - 5-fold, 10-fold - greater than the [recommended daily allowance], I think the data is clear - it increases your chances of heart disease, cancer and can shorten your life,' said the doctor in an interview with CBS This Morning. The doctor, who is based at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, went on to explain that he had recently seen a television advertisement that told viewers you would need to drink two gallons of orange juice to get as much Vitamin C as was in the supplement being promoted. He said that there's probably a good reason why nature doesn't provide that much Vitamin C ni one hit. The UK market for vitamins and supplements was estimated to be worth £385million last year, up 2.7 per cent on the previous year. Dr Offit said that certain supplements such as folic acid can be very useful however . Dr Offit went on to explain that he didn't think that multivitamins would do any harm however, although it is not really known whether or not they actually do any good. When asked if he thought it was worth taking any nutritional pills, he said that there were four cases. He recommended pregnant mothers to take folic acid to prevent babies developing spina bifida, a condition that causes the spine to become deformed. He said that Vitamin D was important for babies, particularly in those who are exclusively breastfed and do not get much exposure to sunlight. Elderly women should take calsium and Vitamin D and calcium to help prevent bones thinning and he concluded that omega-3 fatty acid oils might be beneficial to heart health, but that current  studies are inconclusive. Dr Offit also blasted the term 'alternative medicine and said: 'There's no such thing as alternative medicine - if it works it, is medicine. If it doesn't work it's not an alternative' When asked what his views on alternative therapies such as acupuncture were, he said that it could be helpful but not because the needles were inserted into the skin. he added that the 'ancient Chinese didn't know anything about the human anatomy'. Finally he said that Apple found Steve Jobs might be alive today if he has sought expert medical help sooner. He explained that the type of pancreatic cancer Jobs had - a neuroendocrine tumour - is cured in 95 per cent of patients by undergoing surgery, but that his choice of esoteric therapies including bowel cleanses and acupuncture ultimately cost him his life.","Dr Paul Offit, who has written a book about 'alternative medicine', says that the trend for super-strength supplements are dangerous .

"A cocaine cartel at the centre of a £750,000 drugs plot which dragged in Championship footballer Michael Chopra has been jailed for 34 years. The Blackpool striker gave evidence in court for the gang claiming a £50,000 bundle found in the footwell of a car was money being used to pay off his gambling debts. The debts were at the centre of the drugs trial, where at an earlier hearing the footballer told Newcastle Crown Court . his family came under threat while he struggled to pay back cash he had . blown through his £2million gambling addiction. Blackpool's Michael Chopra, seen here in a match against Doncaster Rovers on Saturday, was dragged into a trial involving a drugs gang . The striker gave evidence in court claiming a £50,000 bundle found in the footwell of a car was money being used to pay off his gambling debts . The . former Newcastle United footballer described how he blew the money after getting hooked on gambling as a teenager on the Newcastle United . team bus. But the cash was linked to a 'cocaine factory' which had been set up in a Sunderland flat. At an earlier hearing Chopra described how he was unable to loan money from the bank and borrowed money from shadowy figures in Glasgow. John Somerville (left) and Daniel Chisholm were sentenced to 12 years for their part in the supply of drugs . Joseph Lewins (left) was sentenced to nine years while Ronald Moon pleaded guilty to money laundering and was sentenced to 15 months . John Somerville, who knew Chopra’s father, agreed to help the footballer get the money to the men in Glasgow, it was heard. But prosecutors claimed the cash was a part-payment for a two kilogram batch of cocaine seized when police swooped on the flat in 2010. The court heard Somerville and Daniel Chisholm - who both had previous convictions for drug dealing - were 'central and key players' in the conspiracy. Jailing them for 12 years he said: 'You were close to the original source, although neither of you were absolutely the top of the tree.' Former Newcastle United footballer Chopra told a court how he blew £2million on gambling after getting hooked as a teenager. Right, pictured leaving Newcastle Crown Court last November . Sentencing Joseph Lewins to nine years, he added: 'You described yourself at some point as a 'mug' and so you are, but I'm afraid that cannot save you from a significant sentence.' Ronald Moon, 48, who was driving the car containing the money, pleaded guilty to possessing criminal property and was sentenced to 15 months behind bars. The judge told the Liverpudlian: 'Those who choose to allow themselves to be used in that way take all the risk and that, I am afraid, is a risk of going into custody.' Lewins, 55, of Washington, Sunderland, Chisholm, 51, of Millfield, Sunderland, and Somerville, 53, of Kenton, Newcastle, were all found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class-A drugs. Police discovered the 'cocaine factory' when they spotted Somerville throw a £12,500 block of cocaine out of the window of his Range Rover in Gateshead in April 2010. They linked him to the other gang member and seven months later raided Lewins' flat and found it had been turned into a drugs factory. They recovered cocaine worth up to £750,000.","Former Newcastle United player was embroiled in case over his gambling .

"An unwitting British soldier who posed for a photograph with a rogue Afghan policeman was shot dead by him seconds later. Corporal Brent McCarthy, 25, is pictured with a member of the Afghan Uniformed Police just moments before the shooting. After the snap was taken the gunman and another accomplice turned their weapons on the RAF policeman. Corporal Brent McCarthy of McCarthy with a rogue Afghan policemen suspected of shooting dead him and L/Cpl Lee Davies (in the background), 1st Battalion Welsh Guards . His comrade Lance Corporal Lee Davies, 27, of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, who can be seen sitting grinning in the background of the photo, was also shot dead. The pair were unlawfully killed while on active service, a coroner has ruled. LCpl Davies, from Barry, South Wales, had remarked that the Afghan pictured had 'wet himself' - which may have indicated what was about to happen . A military inquest heard the pair both died of 'unsurvivable injuries' after being shot by close range gunshots. Both soldiers were part of an eight-man team who had gone to the Afghan police base in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province on May 12. The patrol had gone there so British officers could meet local police officials with RAF policeman Cpl McCarthy acting as a specialist adviser. Oxfordshire Coroners Court was told the men had been engaging in 'banter and general chit chat' with what they thought were two Afghan Uniformed Police officers. LCpl Davies, from Barry, South Wales, had remarked that the Afghan pictured had 'wet himself' and this may have been a sign as to what was about to happen, the inquest heard. The Afghan national pictured was shot dead by a British guardsman as he tried to flee the scene. Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney said despite efforts to resuscitate the pair 'there was nothing colleagues, combat medics or medical staff could have done.' Benjamin Bardsley, the men’s commander at the time, told the inquest at Oxfordshire Coroners Court it was his belief the two Afghans, dressed in police uniforms, had staged an 'opportunistic' attack on his men. He described both Cpl McCarthy, an RAF policeman, and L/Cpl Davies, of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, as 'phenomenal soldiers' fully capable of doing the job. Seconds after the snap was taken the gunman and another accomplice turned their weapons on RAF man Cpl Brent McCarthy . The two rogue Afghan policemen suspected of shooting dead British soldiers. The Army unit was in the area acting as a police advisory team helping train the Afghan police . Guardsman Foley (pictured) said he recalled when he left L/Cpl Davies and Cpl McCarthy to take up position in the guard tower their weapons were lying 'on the concrete slab next to them' but within arm's reach . 'I don’t know why they were attacked - it may have been the Afghans had been turned by the Taliban in the previous weeks,' he added. 'I am sure it was nothing the corporals did. I think it was just wrong time, wrong place with these two Afghans set on what they did.' He added at the time, the risk in the Helmand theatre of an insider attack - known in the British Army as a green on blue incident, was 'one out of ten'. The Army unit was in the area acting as a police advisory team helping train the Afghan police, but had specifically visited the base that day to ask the local commander about a tip-off that one of his colleagues was working with the Taliban. Corporal Brent McCarthy was part of an eight-man team who had gone to the Afghan police base in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province on May 12 . Mr Bardsley said there had been confusion on the day, as his patrol arrived in the police compound, as to which of his men was acting as the guardian angel, where one soldier remains armed and wearing full battledress and helmet keeping a watchful eye on the Afghans. Yesterday, the inquest heard from the soldiers’ comrades Guardsman Joshua Foley, of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, and Cpl Jo Price who had believed the duty was done on a simple rotation system, with Guardsman Foley stating at one point he had been acting in the role. But their sergeant, Robert Heath told the Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter he had specifically tasked L/Cpl Davies with the job. Mr Bardsley had previously said in a written statement to Army investigators he thought Cpl McCarthy was acting guardian, however when asked about the discrepancy with Sgt Heath’s account he replied: 'I’ve got it wrong, clearly.' He added the role was never one he would have allocated to any soldier lower than lance corporal rank. Later, asked by Robert Gregory, counsel for the Davies family, about whether L/Cpl Davies or Cpl McCarthy had been acting in the guardian role on that day Mr Bardsley said he would have expected one or the other to have been armed, and wearing their helmet. Yesterday, Guardsman Foley said he recalled when he left L/Cpl Davies and Cpl McCarthy to take up position in the guard tower their weapons were lying 'on the concrete slab next to them' but within arm’s reach. The inquest was also shown photographs taken on Cpl McCarthy’s camera of the two suspected Afghan killers posing for pictures with the troops - which showed both the soldiers had got their helmets off. In another image Cpl McCarthy was pictured side by side with one of the Afghans, each holding the other’s weapons. Guardsman Foley recounted how the British had tried to strike up 'banter' with the pair although they did not seem to understand what the troops were saying. Later L/Cpl Davies had pointed out one of the two Afghans had 'a wet patch' between his legs, said the guardsman. 'He (L/Cpl Davies) said ""look, he’s p***** himself, he’s scared of you"",' added Guardsman Foley. Major Greg Sangster, who was responsible for co-ordinating the training Cpl McCarthy received to make him ready for his job advising the Afghan police, said he had been trained to a high standard and put him 'in the top third' of more than 100 specialist Armed Forces police who had been on his course. Recording his verdicts, Darren Salter, coroner for Oxfordshire, said both men had, in the words of their former commander, performed 'phenomenally' on operations.","Corporal Brent McCarthy pictured with member of Afghan Uniformed Police .

"It doesn't look as though on-again off-again couple Hilary Duff and Mike Comrie will be on again any time soon after his drunken night at a famous LA eatery. And Mike wasn't out for just a night of boozing. He was looking to hook up.  And he was willing to pay for it. Actress and singer Duff, 27, and former ice hockey pro Comrie, 34, announced they had split a year ago after four years of marriage, despite remaining incredibly close and committed to their son, Luca, who turns three next month. And last September the singer did a Gwyneth Paltrow and insisted: 'We're uncoupled for now...If there wasn't a chance of getting back [together], we would have filed for divorce...' But eyewitnesses at the famous steakhouse Mastro's in Beverly Hills, tell Daily Mail Online exclusively that the retired hockey player spent most of the evening of January 30th, drinking, alienating his friends and propositioning bar patrons and staff for sex. Scroll down for video . Reconciliation?  Singer Hilary Duff and Mike Comrie separated last year after four years of marriage. She told a radio audience last fall that a reunion may be on the cards but Comrie was acting very single on January 30 . Buzzed: Eyewitnesses at Mastro's in Beverly Hills, tell Daily Mail Online exclusively that the retired hockey player spent most of the evening of January 30th, drinking, alienating his friends and attempting to have sex with bar patrons and staff . Tossed: Security were able to put Mike in a taxi and ordered the taxi to take him home and not to another bar . 'Mike and a buddy arrived around 9.00pm and were ushered to their private reserved table in the cocktail lounge of Mastros on the second floor,' a worker at the bistro tells Daily Mail Online. 'Mike was clearly already tipsy when he arrived. He was already slurring his speech a bit and walking funny, and it was only 9 pm.' The hockey player was drinking throughout the evening, say observers. He was drinking cocktails along with shots of '1942,' a high end Cuervo tequila at about $33 per shot. Canadian-born Comrie's family sold their furniture company in 2012 for $700 million. 'I work there and I have to say he's a really nice guy, actually. He tips well and is super polite and kind. He was just drunk. But then things got worse.' 'I watched him as he blatantly and repeatedly hit on his waitress. I'm sure she was extremely embarrassed because other customers and staff saw this. She handled it well, remaining kind and professional. 'Mike just wouldn't let up with the flirting. It became a bit creepy. Even his buddy tried to dial him back a bit.' But Mike was on a mission. Several eyewitnesses claim that Mike kept telling his server how much he liked her and how beautiful she was. 'Mike wanted to wait for her until her shift was over and take her out,' one eyewitness reveals.  'She told him nicely that she was not available, that she was in a relationship, but that didn't phase him. He kept insisting, sometimes loudly, that he wanted to wait until she got off work. 'She was in a tough spot. Then Mike wanted to settle his tab. That would be all well and good, but the tab had been paid for an hour prior and he owed no more money. He kept trying to pay her, for some reason. She couldn't get through to him.' 'She actually started to feel bad for him. He's very handsome and so sweet, but he was very intoxicated and seemed deeply lonely if he were going to all of these extremes to pursue someone who was on staff and was in a relationship. Still close: The All About You singer said  that she remains incredibly close to Mike and they are devoted to their son Luca. Mike took over parental duties on Wednesday as Hilary went off to catch a showing of 50 Shades of Grey . 'He was also not wearing his wedding ring. I can't imagine how upset Hilary would feel if she knew Mike was acting like this in public.' Eyewitnesses say that after his server left the table to close up for the night, Mike, now alone, approached the bar where where a couple were sitting. 'Mike's pal had left an hour or so before. So he'd been just drinking alone for a while and then as the restaurant was closing for the night, Mike approaches this woman at the bar. She is clearly sitting with her boyfriend or husband. Mike ignores the guy completely and starts talking to the woman.' 'I heard him say to her, ""I saw you making eyes at me. Do you like what you see?"" 'The woman assured Mike that he was mistaken, and even her date chimed in, trying to reassure Mike that no one was making eyes at him.' 'I'm watching all of this go down and it's clear that Mike was confused and very drunk now. The couple suggested, in almost a caring tone for the guy, that he should return to his table. This was not his finest hour and boy, I couldn't stop thinking about Hilary and the her little boy.' That's when the couple, and restaurant staff, were horrified at what happened next. 'Mike would not go to his table. Instead, he reaches into his wallet and pulls out hundreds of dollars' 'He asked the nice woman at the bar, 'Ok. How much? How much do you want? I have as much as you need. How much for sex? Name your price. How much do you want to have sex with me?' When the woman's date objected, suggesting that Mike had overstepped his bounds and should back away, Mike became 'aggressive,' witnesses say. 'Mike got in the guy's face and said, ""Come on. You and me. Let's step outside."" 'I alerted restaurant security because it looked to me like Mike was picking a fight with the man and wanted to possibly fight him outside. Why else would he want the woman's date to follow him out?' House security stepped in and stopped the 'situation from escalating,' the server said. 'When security confronted Mike, he claimed to be sober and insisted he was sober and hanging with friends. In fact, he said not only was he totally sober but that he was the designated driver that night for his pals. 'When Mike gestured at the table of friends, and the table was of course empty, Mike was promptly escorted to the valet parking station outside.' Security were able to put Mike in a taxi and ordered the taxi to take him home and not to another bar. Party hearty: The couple dressed to the nines for a Halloween party before they split . 'I have to say, as the server who saw all of this, I feel  bad for Hilary. I know that she and Mike are separated but I'd heard that they've been trying to reconcile for the sake of their little boy. 'I hope what Mike did the other night was an isolated scenario. He was drunk and sad and alone and asking strangers for sex at this five-star restaurant. Celebrities, politicians and dignitaries all dine here on a regular basis. So to have this sort of scene happen is rare.' The pair announced their 'amicable' separation in January after almost four years of marriage since whenever they have been spotted together, they appear incredibly close. On Wednesday Comrie took over parental duties as Hilary caught a matinee of 50 Shades of Grey. Opening up about the split last September, Hilary - in Australia promoting her latest single All About You - told the Kyle and Jackie O KIIS 1065 show the pair still 'really care a lot' for one another. And revealing intimate details about their relationship, she went on: 'When we were trying for a baby we weren't, ""We have to have a baby right now"". 'We were laid back...Whatever happens, happens. Once we're tired of doing this, we'll make a choice. 'We just don't really care what anyone thinks. We're being totally honest about it. My life is so up for grabs everyone knows everything.' And when probed by radio presenters Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O about who looks after the pair's two-year-old son, Luca, Hilary revealed her mother and Mike share the responsibility when she's away working. She said: 'My mom takes care of Luca a lot now. His dad and my mom are working hard to take good care of him.' The pair announced their 'amicable' separation in January after almost four years of marriage since whenever they have been spotted together, they appear incredibly close.

"Blunders: The NHS can pay out £20,000 if the wrong testicle has been removed . More than £1million in damages have been paid out by the NHS to men who have had the wrong testicle removed by surgeons. In the last four years there have been 56 successful claims made by men who have been affected by medical blunders, according to the National Health Service Litigation Authority. In most cases the men didn't need surgery at all and in others surgeons also had to remove the second testicle. The NHS normally pays out around £20,000 if the wrong testicle has been removed. Roger Goss, co-director of Patient Concern, told The Sun: 'It is amazing that surgeons don't always take enough care to guarantee that they are removing the correct testicle. 'Despite the huge total compensation bill, individual payments sound modest for wrecking men's lives.' According to the figures £1.3million has been paid out since 2009. Men who have been left infertile can be rewarded up to £70,000. But the most common reason for payouts is when doctors misdiagnose testicular torsion — where the tubes inside the body get twisted, cutting off the blood supply. Other claims result from hernia operations where the blood supply to the testicle is accidentally cut off. Testicular cancer affects one man in 450 before the age of 50 and is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 45. The number of cases in the UK has doubled in the past 40 years and around 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year. There are various different types of testicular cancer, 90 per cent of which affect men under the age of 55. Recovering: Chat-show host Jeremy Kyle was diagnosed with the disease just before Christmas and after receiving chemotherapy and having the problem testicle removed, he was given the all clear . The survival rate has risen every year since the 1970s and is now around 97 per cent, provided it is treated early. Snooker player Jimmy White, UKIP leader Nigel Farage and drug-cheat champion cyclist Lance Armstrong have all overcome the disease. Chat-show host Jeremy Kyle was diagnosed with the disease just before Christmas and after receiving chemotherapy and having the problem testicle removed, he was given the all clear. Doctors told him he could have died within 18 months had the lump remained unchecked. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Quite simply, never events should never happen. 'There are simple ways to prevent them occurring, like the Surgical Safety Checklist, and everyone working in the NHS should ensure that the checklist is being followed . 'The NHS treats a million people every 36 hours, and we know that the vast majority of these patients have excellent care. 'But the NHS needs to do more to really tackle these events. The NHS Commissioning Board is now setting up a taskforce to eradicate these never events from NHS surgery.'","Fifty-six claims made by men affected by medical blunders in four years .

"As America's longest married couple prepare to celebrate their 81st wedding anniversary, 102-year-old husband John Betar has revealed the secret behind their incredible relationship  - 'always agree with your wife!' John and Ann Betar eloped on November 25, 1932, fleeing their close-knit Syrian neighborhood in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They got into John's Ford Roadster and drove as fast as they could to Harrison, New York, to avoid Ann's father's plans to marry her off to a man 20 years older.

Now, as they prepare to celebrate . their anniversary on Monday, the couple, named on Valentine's Day by . Worldwide Marriage Encounter as 2013's 'longest married couple' in . America, can only laugh as they look back on the commotion they caused. 'Everyone . was hopping mad, and my wife's aunt consoled my father-in-law by . telling him not to worry, the marriage won't last,' chuckled John Betar, . now 102 and still driving 'though not quite as fast as the day we got . married.' Ann Betar, 98, . said she 'had no choice but to elope because my father was set on me . marrying a much older man, and I was 17. John was not the boy next door, . but the boy across the street who I loved,' she said. 'He was 21 and used to drive me to high school in his Ford Roadster,' she added. 'That's . why she married me, she loved that car,' joked John Betar, as he sat on . a couch holding his wife's hand in the waterfront house they have . shared since 1964. Always and forever: Mrs Betar, then 17, eloped with the 20-year-old Mr Betar on November 15, 1932, marrying in the small town of Harrison in New York . The day . the couple tied the knot, the Great Depression was in full swing, 'King . Kong' had yet to shake up the silver screen, and future U.S. President . John F.

"A bipartisan group of Congressman has introduced a bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from using taxpayer money to fly first class. The 'If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress Act' would place the same restrictions on the legislative branch that are already on employees of the executive branch, a press release announcing the bill states. It is sponsored by Democratic Reps. John Barrow and Raul Ruiz and Republican Reps. Walter Jones and Paul Gosar. 'As representatives of the American people, we in Congress have a . responsibility to wisely use the people’s money,' Jones said in a . statement. 'Members of the House and Senate should never secure their . own . luxury travel at taxpayer expense, but they especially should not do so . when our nation is buried $17 trillion deep in debt.' Scroll down for video . The 'If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress Act' would only allow members and their staff to fly first class on the taxpayer's dime if they have a disability or a major medical issue . Should taxpayers pay for Congress to fly first class? Should taxpayers pay for Congress to fly first class? Now share your opinion . Members . of Congress are given a Member Representational Allowance at the start . of each year that includes money for staff salaries, travel, office . space, office supplies, mail and other general office expenses. Each Representative receives between $1,183,717 to $1,356,445 each year for these expenses. The amount each office receives varies depending on how close or far away the district it serves is from the District of Columbia. The average MRA is $1,243,560.14, the Congressional Research Service estimates. The base allowance for travel to and from their districts plus the cost of renting an office in their districts is $256,574 for members of the House. However, members can use as much or as little of their MRA for travel as they like. Senators receive between $2,960,743 to $4,685,316, and an average allowance of $3,209,992.27. They face some restrictions on use of the money as well, but like members of the House, it is up to them to determine how much of their allowance money they spend on travel. The 'If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress' would not place any additional restrictions on travel other than disallowing members to fly first class. 'It's a very simple bill. All it does is prohibit members of Congress . from using taxpayer funds to purchase first-class airfare,' Gosar said in a statement. 'If members of our military can't fly first class using taxpayer funds, neither should members of Congress.' The legislation makes an exception for members and their staff who have disabilities or major medical needs. Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth introduced legislation similar to the group's bipartisan bill earlier this month. In . addition to the exemptions included in the bipartisan bill, Duckworth's . legislation would allow members to travel first class if the flight is . five or more hours or if no coach class seats are available. Ruiz said he was sponsoring the bipartisan bill because members of Congress 'should not receive special privileges at the expense of hard working taxpayers.' 'It’s wrong that members of Congress can purchase luxury airfare with . taxpayer money when many families in my district and across the county . are struggling to make ends meet,' he said in a statement. Of the special airport privileges members of Congress would still have access to if the bill passes are their dedicated parking spaces at Reagan National Airport. The spaces, which cost nearly a quarter million dollars a year, are paid for by the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, not taxpayers.","The legislation is sponsored by Democratic Reps.

"The chilling photographs show how teenagers in Nazi Germany were brainwashed into supporting the fascist cause at Hitler Youth indoctrination camps. The rare images capture the boys marching, standing guard and having their heads shaved in accordance with military rules. They were compiled by a 15-year-old while he carried out his training over the course of eight months in the year before the outbreak of the Second World War. Gathering: A picture of a Hitler Youth 'Landjahr' training camp taken in 1938 by a 15-year-old boy who was taking part . Owner: The photographs were taken by Friedhelm Huhn, whose identity document is shown, when he was attending the camp in 1938 . The photo albums, which were looted by an Allied soldier at the end of the war, are now going up for auction in California. They originated from the 'Landjahr', the rural training camp for boys aged between 15 and 18 who had joined the Hitler Youth. During the war, members were drafted into the German fire service before becoming part of the military reserve and then acted as the last line of the defence of Berlin. Some of the photos show the 'soldiers of tomorrow' in uniform, complete with a Swastika armband and long shorts. They are depicted marching in regimented order with a drill sergeant-type figure walking alongside them. Activities: These photographs show teenagers examining diagrams promoting physical fitness, and having their heads shaved . Discipline: The boys - many of whom would later fight in the Second World War - used to practice marching in military fashion . Memento: Friedhelm apparently kept the photos and his uniform patches, but they were looted by an Allied soldier . Another photo is a group shot of dozens of members stood in a canteen with a giant Swastika flag above their heads. There is a picture of two boys aged about 14 getting their hair shaved short in military fashion, while others show boys studying diagrams about how to improve their physical fitness. The two albums were compiled by Friedhelm Huhn, who carried out his training as a teenager between April and December 1938. It is not known what happened to him during the war, but it is believed the albums were taken as a souvenir by an Allied serviceman at the end of the conflict. The albums - along with Friedhelm Huhn's ID cards and Landjahr uniform patches - are now being sold by auctioneer Nate D. Sanders, which is based in Los Angeles. Playful: But while the pictures may seem charming, the Swastika armbands worn by the teenagers hint at the dark truth . Gathering: One image shows all the participants in the Landjahr standing under a huge swastika flag . Terry Charman, a historian at the Imperial War Museum, said: 'Although it was never compulsory to join the Hitler Youth, in practice it more or less was. 'Parents really had to send their sons along for training. The Nazis represented it as a German version of the Boy Scouts - which it certainly was not. 'The boys were soldiers of tomorrow and the training had a strong military element to it and involved firearms. 'A lot of the Hitler Youth were drafted in the the anti-aircraft batteries but those who had a reputation for being fairly awesome fighters joined the Waffen SS. Outing: Other images appear to show the Hitler Youth outside the setting of the camp on a visit to a city . Collection: These photo albums are going up for auction in California and are set to fetch £750 . 'In the last days of the war the Hitler Youth was mobilised in the German version of the Home Guard and fought on both eastern and western fronts. A lot of them were sacrificed in Berlin, some as young as 12 or 13. 'The last Nazi newsreel film out of Germany in the war showed Hitler handing out gallantry medals such as the Iron Cross to members of the Hitler Youth for distinguishing themselves in battle.' The albums, which measure 10in by 7.5in, have a pre-sale estimate of £750 and are being sold on February 27. Sinister: A Hitler Youth rally in Berlin in May 1933, soon after Hitler came to power . The Hitler Youth ('Hitlerjugend' in German) were central to the Nazis' plan to create a nation of Aryan 'supermen' by indocrinating children into their twisted racist worldview from the age of 10. The organisation was founded as early as 1922, but it was not until Hitler came to power in 1933 that the group took a prominent position in German society, as it became more or less obligatory for all teenagers to join. Members would be educated in Nazi ideology, and had the genius of Hitler relentlessly drilled into them. Activities such as the Landjahr, where teenagers would spend months working on a farm and practicing military discipline, helped members bond and shored up their belief in the Nazi cause. After the start of the Second World War, the Hitler Youth was transformed into an auxiliary military force, initially attached to unites such as the fire brigade and postal service. Later in the war, with Germany suffering increasingly devastating losses, teenagers began fighting on the front line as part of their own SS division. Hundreds of boys as young as 12 helped form the last line of defence when Berlin was besieged by the Allied forces, and most were killed by the Soviet troops who entered the city. Perhaps the best-known member of the Hitler Youth is Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, who was forced to join the movement but refused to attend meetings due to his family's anti-Nazi views.","Chilling photographs of Nazi group were taken by 15-year-old Friedhelm Huhn during 'Landjahr' in 1938 .

Nathan, a photographer from San Francisco, has made more than 400 jumps in his lifetime but this was the first time he had taken his canine companion along . The little dog was kitted out with his very own pair of doggles for the jump and strapped to his owner's chest. Nathan said: 'It was by far the most enjoyable skydive I've ever done and Riley seemed to love it too - I'll definitely be taking him again. 'My favourite part of the experience was the canopy ride - petting him and watching him look out intently at the horizon was something else. 'Then we landed and everybody was on the ground giving each other high fives and petting Riley - it really made everyone's day.

"Former police chief Mark Kessler who was suspended for ranting against the government is to star in his own reality TV show . A former police chief who was suspended for ranting against the government is to star in his own reality TV show which could feature a militia-style group he started last month. Speaking at a news conference in his attorney's office, former Gilberton Chief Mark Kessler said the group called 3 Percent Boots on the Ground already has a 'few thousand' members around the country. The group will train monthly and require members, who are vetted by Kessler, to supply their own fatigues, combat boots and body armour. Mr Kessler, 42,from Pennsylvania, said: 'Basically it's just a group of people who believe in the country, the Constitution, and what our founding fathers enacted.' Despite Kessler gaining Internet fame for his rants against the government and gun control, he said the group does not advocate insurrection. 'My group is not affiliated with that in any way,' he said. 'It has nothing to do with overthrowing the government, as some people would like to believe.' Gilberton officials suspended Kessler last year and tried to fire him after he posted videos of himself shooting borough-owned automatic weapons and ranting about liberals.

"Mr Justice Tugendhat told her 'unwelcome publicity' received after affair with Mr Huhne was 'situation entirely of her own making' MP Chris Huhne's partner Carina Trimingham has lost her privacy and harassment claim against Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail. Her affair with the former secretary of state for energy and climate change became public in June 2010, with Mr Huhne leaving his wife of 26 years. The 44-year-old PR adviser sued for compensation and an injunction over 65 'highly unpleasant and hurtful' articles which have appeared since then. She claimed she was subject to 'crude and demeaning stereotypes' about her being bisexual. Dismissed: Carina Trimingham gives a statement today outside the High Court after today's hearing . But despite Ms Trimingham's lawyers claiming the stories constituted a 'cataclysmic interference' with her private life, a High Court judge today rejected her claim on the grounds that her involvement with the former energy secretary was 'a situation of her own making'. The High Court judge also said he had not found Ms Trimingham to be a good or reliable witness in a number of respects. Associated Newspapers described the ruling by Mr Justice Tugendhat as 'an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech'. Associated Newspapers had contested Ms Trimingham's case on the basis that there was an important public interest. Ms Trimingham's counsel, Matthew Ryder QC, said the Daily Mail had a right to freedom of expression but not to abuse her repeatedly under the guise of exercising that freedom. Ms Trimingham was in court today but showed no emotion as her claim was dismissed by the judge. Relationship: Chris Huhne and Carine Trimingham, pictured last September, had an affair which became public in June 2010 . He said: 'Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited. 'This is mainly by reason of her involvement with Mr Huhne, both professionally, as his press agent, and personally as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh about how much he valued his family. 'But it is also by reason of what she herself has disclosed in the past. 'Further, she was, as the defendant knew, a journalist who had herself disclosed information about other people for publication in the newspapers and so was a person who ought not reasonably to be expected to be distressed when such information was published about herself.' 'Ms Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.'The difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making. Ms Trimingham, speaking today on the steps of the High Court, was not found to be a good or reliable witness during her claim by Mr Justice Tugendhat . 'One reason why it is objectionable for a sexual relationship to arise between people who are already in a professional or work relationship is that there is then a greatly increased risk of conflicts arising between professional duty and personal interest.' It was this crossing of boundaries which led an editorial executive on the newspaper to consider that Ms Trimingham's role in the story of Mr Huhne was so significant, he added. 'Professionally, it was her job to ensure that Mr Huhne received the best possible publicity, but it was the sexual affair on which she embarked, and which she continued to conduct, with Mr Huhne that gave rise to the scandal. He added that although Associated referred to Ms Trimingham's sexuality in 65 articles over 15 months, it only did so when writing about matters of public interest - mainly developments in Mr Huhne's personal life which were relevant to his public life - and when Ms Trimingham, her conduct and other information about her were within the range of what an editor could in good faith regard as relevant to the story. 'The distress that she has undoubtedly suffered since June 19, 2010 is the result of the publication by the defendant of the defamatory and true information concerning her, about which she has not made a claim in defamation, and the actions of journalists and publishers for whom the defendant is not responsible. 'To the extent that the words complained of include insults and other offensive matter, insulting and offensive speech is protected by the right of freedom of expression. 'In this case what Ms Trimingham complains of is not so unreasonable that it is necessary or proportionate to sanction or prohibit such publications in order to protect the rights of Ms Trimingham. 'So the defendant has not harassed her within the meaning of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is not the case that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to have known that these articles, separately, or cumulatively, amount to harassment of Ms Trimingham.' He added that Ms Trimingham had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to various items of information, including cropped versions of photos taken at her civil partnership ceremony, which revealed no more information about her than the public already knew. Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited.' Outside court, Ms Trimingham said she intended to appeal. Ms Trimingham, who is insured, was ordered to pay £250,000 towards Associated’s costs. A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: 'This was an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest. A High Court judge told Ms Trimingham, pictured left today and right at the Lib Dem Annual Conference last September, that she was in a situation 'of her own making' 'We are pleased that the Court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of Miss Trimingham’s complaints. 'The references to Miss Trimingham’s sexuality in our coverage were never pejorative, private or in any way homophobic. 'Miss Trimingham chose to level some very serious charges against our journalists in this case. This judgement vindicates both our journalists and their journalism. Media law specialist Mark Stephens said Mr Justice Tugendhat, in his judgment, had drawn a distinction between private and public figures by importing the American notion of a public figure. 'It is redolent of the approach taken to Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,' he said. 'Mr Clinton, as president, had a restricted zone of privacy, and Ms Lewinsky's zone of privacy was reduced by virtue of her relationship with him. 'It appears that that ratio was very similar in this case.'

"Josef Stalin never told the Russian people the truth about his son Yakov . A Soviet archive has yielded up one of the last secrets of World War Two that dictator Josef Stalin took to his grave - the fact his son Yakov gave himself up to Nazi forces during the 1941 invasion of his country. The party line in Stalin’s Russia was always that Yakov Dzhugashvili, the eldest son of the murderous Communist tyrant, was captured. Now a file of the Defence Ministry suggests that he gave himself up because of his disillusionment with the conduct of the war which saw 1.3 million Red Army men captured, killed or disabled in the first weeks of the Nazi invasion in June 1941. Spiegel Magazine has accessed the files and prints the story of Stalin’s son, known as Yasha, in its latest edition. Stalin disowned him in 1928 following a dispute about a girl and the defence ministry archive in Podolsk reveals Stalin writing to his mother in April 1928: 'Tell Yasha that I think he behaved like a thug and an extortionist, someone with whom I no longer have anything in common and with whom I no longer want a relationship. Let him live where and with whom he wants. J. Stalin.' Yakov volunteered for the army in 1937, became a lieutenant in 1940 and was a commander in the 14th Howitzer Regiment of the 14th Tank Division at the time Hitler unleashed three million men in Operation Barbarossa on June 22 1941. By July 9 Soviet forces were in retreat from Vietbsk in what is now Belarus and Yakov’s battery was ordered to give covering fire. He was recommended for a medal by his commanding officer for bravery, but he vanished - presumed captured. The division sent a unit to the area where he went missing, the papers say, and the men came across Red Army soldier Popuride, 'who had managed to escape with Yakov. He said they buried their papers together and put on civilian clothing. When they reached the lakeside, Comrade Dzhugashvili told Popuride to keep going, but that he wanted to stay and rest.' Doting father: Josef Stalin, pictured with his daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva, disowned his son Yakov in 1928 . Stalin's son Yakov deserted the army and had described it as being 'poorly organised' and ill prepared for war . 'The episode suggests that Yakov had allowed himself to be taken prisoner,' said Spiegel, and Stalin seemingly concurred, which explains why the archive was also sealed for so long. Stalin never told the Russian people - 27 million of whom were to die fighting the Nazis - that his son was captured. In his eyes this was treason, and hundreds of thousands of Russians who returned from Nazi captivity marched straight into the Siberian prison gulag for 25 year stretches for their 'crime.' Also hidden in the archive were Yakov’s equally treasonous statements that were found in Berlin after the war in which he poured scorn on the Red Army his own father commanded. Of the leadership he stated: 'When they were surrounded, they went into such a panic that everyone scattered in different directions… We had no maps at all. In our unit, everything was slovenly and poorly organized…The division wasn’t prepared for the war at all…' Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who would go on to capture Berlin in 1945, recalled in his memoirs a conversation he had with ‘the chief’ during the war in which Stalin said: 'Yakov will not escape captivity. The fascists will shoot him.' This proved to be true: in April 1943 he was shot while trying to escape from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp north of Berlin.","Stalin disowned his son Yakov in 1928 as a 'thug and an extortionist'

"The killer of Grand Ole Opry and 'Hee Haw' comic David 'Stringbean' Akeman and his wife Estelle was granted parole Wednesday after 40 years in prison. John A. Brown, 64, was originally sentenced to 198 years, and the board has denied several previous parole requests. His latest request came in April. Brown told the board then that he was truly sorry for what he had done. The killer of Grand Ole Opry and 'Hee Haw' comic David 'Stringbean' Akeman and his wife Estelle was granted parole Wednesday after 40 years in prison . Tried many times: John A. Brown, 64, (pictured he're while petitioning for parole) was originally sentenced to 198 years, and the board has denied several previous parole requests. 'I can't undo anything to change my past. I've committed the last 40 years to changing my life,' he said. On the evening of Nov. 11, 1973, Brown and his cousin, Doug Marvin Brown, ransacked the Akemans' cabin on their farm near Nashville, looking for the cash Akeman was rumored to keep there. Police said the cousins were surprised by the Akemans as they returned home from the Opry. John Brown shot Stringbean Akeman as he walked into the cabin, then ran after his wife in the yard before shooting her in the back of the head. The bodies were found the next day by fellow Opry performer Grandpa Jones, a close friend who lived nearby and had planned to go hunting with Akeman that morning. Although police said the motive for the slayings was robbery, the Browns took only a chain saw and some guns. Not until 1996 did police find the cash the Browns were seeking, concealed in the walls of the Akeman home. Robbery gone wrong: Brown and his cousin went to the home near Nashville in November 1973 in hopes of stealing cash Stringbean was rumored to have hidden there . Slain: Police said the cousins were surprised by the Akemans as they returned home from the Opry. John Brown shot Stringbean Akeman as he walked into the cabin, then ran after his wife in the yard before shooting her in the back of the head . The cousins were each given two life sentences. Doug Brown died in prison in 2003. Akeman, a Kentucky native, played banjo with Bill Monroe's band before going solo in the 1950s. He was best known for a folksy comedy-music act he performed on the Grand Ole Opry and the 'Hee Haw' television show. After John Brown's April hearing, the parole board asked for a psychological evaluation on his propensity for violence. Their Wednesday decision to grant parole came after the board had reviewed that evaluation. Five of seven parole board members were present for the hearing. They heard testimony from Brown and his supporters via videoconference from the Lois Deberry Special Needs Facility, in Nashville, where Brown is currently incarcerated, according to an email from parole board spokeswoman Melissa McDonald. Board members voted 4-1 in favor of parole. Those speaking against his parole included Grand Ole Opry member Jan Howard, who was a close friend of the Akemans. McDonald said it could still be several weeks before Brown is released from prison because of paperwork.

"Muslim clerics in the UK who inflame terrorism by denouncing free speech, equality and democracy will be opposed in a 'muscular' new defence of 'British values', David Cameron has pledged . Muslim clerics in the UK who inflame terrorism by denouncing free speech, equality and democracy will be opposed in a ‘muscular’ new defence of ‘British values’, David Cameron has pledged. In a powerful intervention clearly aimed mainly at ‘preachers of hate’, the Prime Minister says the failure to stand up to such firebrands has ‘allowed extremism – both the violent and non-violent kind – to flourish’. He plans to use the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta – 12 months from today – to reassert British values in a ‘Magna Carta for Modern Britain.’ It is time to stop being ‘squeamish about Britishness’ and tell everyone who lives here that refusing to accept British laws and the British way of life is ‘not an option’, Mr Cameron argues. The Prime Minister will emphasise the commitment by insisting that Magna Carta becomes part of the school curriculum. Downing Street stressed the Prime Minister’s comments, which come in an article in today’s Mail on Sunday, are aimed at all sections of the community, not just Muslims. However, they appear to signal a key change in the stance of successive recent governments, Tory  and Labour, on this sensitive issue. They have faced claims that some unrepresentative ethnic minority leaders have been given free rein to promote extremist views – and trample on UK laws and rights  on democracy, women’s equality, religious freedom and tolerance. Mr Cameron’s initiative is a direct response to the ‘Trojan Horse’ scandal of Islamist extremists who infiltrated state schools. School inspectors said that at some Muslim-dominated schools in Birmingham, pupils were taught that white women were ‘prostitutes’, boys and girls were segregated, Christmas events were scrapped, tombolas were banned as ‘non-Islamic’ and children in biology lessons were told that  evolution was untrue. The dispute convinced Mr Cameron that it was time to lead a fightback on behalf of British values. In addition, there are growing fears that radical preachers are encouraging young British Muslims to join terrorists fighting to bring down the democratically elected government of Iraq. And it is alleged radical clerics have tried to establish ‘Sharia  Law Zones’ in some British cities with bans on gambling, music and alcohol. David Cameron said it is time to stop being 'squeamish about Britishness' and argued that refusing to accept British laws and the British way of life is 'not an option' Education Secretary Michael Gove has announced plans to teach British values in schools, but Mr Cameron wants to go further. ‘It isn’t enough simply to respect these values in schools,’ he says. ‘They’re not optional; they’re the core of what it is to live in Britain. ‘In recent years we have been in danger of sending out a worrying message: that if you don’t want to believe in democracy, that’s fine; that if equality isn’t your bag, don’t worry about it; that if you’re completely intolerant of others, we will still tolerate you,’ he writes. ‘This has not just led to division, it has also allowed extremism – of both the violent and non-violent kind – to flourish. We need to be  far more muscular in promoting British values and the institutions that uphold them. 'We need to be  far more muscular in promoting British values and the institutions that uphold them.' - David Cameron . ‘A genuinely liberal country believes in certain values, actively promotes them and says to its citizens: this is what defines us as a society.’ Mr Cameron says Britain’s ‘belief in freedom, tolerance of others, accepting personal and social responsibility, respecting and upholding the rule of law’ are vital and ‘as British as the Union Flag, football and fish and chips.’ Such freedoms did not ‘come from thin air’ – and will not be surrendered, he declares. ‘Our values and respect for the history that helped deliver them and the institutions that uphold them form the bedrock of Britishness. We should not be squeamish about our achievements, or bashful about our Britishness. Education Secretary Michael Gove (above) has announced plans to teach British values in schools, but Mr Cameron wants to go further. They're not optional; they're the core of what it is to live in Britain,' he said . ‘We should be proud of what Britain has done to defend freedom and develop these institutions – Parliamentary democracy, a free press, the rule of law – that are  so essential all over the world.’ He added that it was essential for economic and social reasons, and that the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta was an ideal time to restate British freedoms – and make it clear everyone had to respect them. Mr Cameron will also be holding a ‘one year to go’ Magna Carta reception at Downing Street tomorrow.","He plans to use 800th anniversary of Magna Carta to reassert British values .

"Where there’s 'Smoke' there’s OJ. The 66-year-old disgraced gridiron great has hired himself a fellow felon - Willie Hartwell, aka Smoke - to protect him in prison. OJ has been worried about attacks from aggressive inmates at the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, where he has been incarcerated since 2008. He fears there are prisoners who want to make a name for themselves by hurting 'The Juice,' especially on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the brutal murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman. 'He found the biggest guy who is in great shape and willing to fend off the bullies to help OJ out -- but, of course, it comes at a price,' a close friend revealed. My Bodyguard: Willie Hartwell, aka Smoke, will be watching OJ's back. 'He found the biggest guy who is in great shape and willing to fend off the bullies to help OJ out -- but, of course, it comes at a price,' a  friend revealed . Smoke is only 44-years-old, he's 6' tall, weighs 180 pounds and his physical build is described as 'large' on the Nevada Criminal Identification Demographics records. And he's prepared to watch OJ's back for a few favors. 'Obviously, OJ can't give Smoke any cash money but since he still gets bucks from his books every month through his family and from his female fans, Smoke tells  OJ what he wants from the commissary -- extra food, toiletries, stamps to send out letters, magazines - and OJ will get it for him! 'And OJ has also promised if he is paroled in 2017 and Smoke is still there he will continue to put money on his books until he is paroled and help him when he gets out, like if he needs a place to crash for a while.' 'OJ even told Smoke he may hire him as a bodyguard when they are both free because the world is just as dangerous as prison life is for him! But he joked he will pay him in it cash instead of cookies, an extra blanket or cup-a-soup noodles!' Willie 'Smoke' Hartwell was jailed in in 2002 for armed robbery with a deadly weapon and kidnapping. This was not his first time in the slammer. The kidnapping charges were dropped in a plea deal and he was sentenced to 10-25 in the medium security prison in Lovelock, Nevada, where he later met OJ in 2008. OJ who was also convicted for armed robbery and kidnapping. Flabby: OJ is not the football powerhouse he once was, not by a long shot. He has high blood pressure, diabetes and his knees are so banged up from playing football he can barely walk . As reported exclusively by MailOnline last week, Fred Goldman, the father of Nicole's friend  who was murdered with her on that hot June night, revealed OJ had been attacked several times. Goldman says that he had heard a couple of rumors about Simpson, so he called the District Attorney's office in Nevada to find out if they were true or not. The first was that OJ was beaten up in prison.  He found out the former NFL star was hit hard in his chest by another inmate but it was nothing serious. The second rumor was that 'someone in the prison found OJ attractive.' The DA told him the prison officials reported back 'We know nothing about THAT!' -- but their tone was very tongue-and-cheek. When Fred pressured the DA and asked 'what does that mean?' the DA responded; 'it means exactly what you think it means.' Goldman said the DA gave him the impression that OJ had, indeed, been sexually attacked. 'When OJ first arrived at Lovelock he was treated like royalty by the prisoners because they watched this guy play football for years so they were big fans.  But after all the fanfare wore off and OJ was treated just like everybody else by the guards he became a target,' the family friend added. Fairytale turns horror story: Oj and Nicole were divorced when stabbed to death. Her neck was cut from ear-to-ear with her head almost severed from her body. She was 35, the mother of Sydney and Justin Simpson . 'Over the past couple of years OJ started having some problems because of all of the scuttlebutt between the prisoners about his appeal and possible parole so they feel his days are numbered and they wanted to get some stuff from him or make a name for themselves before he left for good. 'Some of the inmates started harassing OJ, forcing him to get them some things from the commissary and attacking him when the guards were not looking.' OJ is not the football powerhouse he once was, not by a long shot. He has high blood pressure, diabetes and his knees are so banged up from playing football he can barely walk. His excessive weight gain adds to all of these problems. 'So a younger guy could take OJ down with very little effort and some of them want to be the one to literally bring OJ to his knees before he can get out of there in a few year,' the friend continued. 'But OJ has something the other inmates don't and that's a lot of money on his books every month so he 'hired' Smoke to literally play defense for him inside the prison.' And he picked the right guy. No escape:  The Lovelock Correctional facility is out in the middle of the Nevada desert and backed up against sky scraping  mountains . 'Now we are in the summer months and it gets really hot in the Nevada desert so OJ feels free to hang outside in the prison yard and coach one of the prison baseball teams while eating ice cream on the bench because Smoke is right there making sure nobody bothers OJ.' OJ has a sweet tooth that he has a hard time controlling so when he's not wrapping his mouth around an ice cream sandwich, one of his favorites, he's may be 'lifting' a few extra cookies from the chow hall! As previously reported last year, OJ filled up his shirt with oatmeal cookies but he was busted by a prison guard on the way back to his cell after lunch. Initially the guard thought OJ was trying to smuggle in a cell phone or some other sort of contraband so he was flabbergasted to find 'the juice' had packed his shirt with cookies! The guard yelled out; 'Simpson! Hold it right there!'  Once the guard opened up his shirt and started throwing the cookies onto the floor the other prisoners began to hoot, howl and fall over with laughter!   OJ stood there there with a goofy grin on his face, totally embarrassed. A father's grief: Fred Goldman (right), father of Ron. a friend of Nicole's who just happened to drop by her confo to return her mother's glasses, keeps tabs on OJ and says he was attacked twice. One was a rape. But this is what his life has become -- OJ's new normal -- and it will be that way for at least another three years when he will be up for parole in 2017. Lovelock Correctional Center is located about 5 miles from the tiny town of Lovelock, Nevada, about 93 miles from Reno.  The correctional facility is out in the middle of the desert and backed up against sky scraping  mountains on one side and facing a the Interstate highway on the other, which is 2 miles away, so it is literally impossible to escape without being quickly detected. Lovelock houses mostly medium custody general population inmates, but there are some close custody protective segregation inmates as well as separate unit housing a small number of minimum custody inmates.  The total capacity for Lovelock is approximately 1,680 inmates.","OJ Simpson, 66, incarcerated at medium security Lovelock Correctional Center, is afraid prisoners out to make a name for themselves are gunning for him .

"A couple and their son accused of the quadruple honour killings of half of their family took the decision to commit murder in order to cut off 'the diseased limb on their family tree'. Jurors in Ontario, Canada, were told how Afghan-born Mohammad Shafia, 58, his . wife Tooba Yahya, 42, and their son Hamed, 21, were responsible for . planning and carrying out the murders of four family members. In closing statements to the court in . Ontario prosecutor Laurie Lacelle urged the jury to find all three . guilty of killing Shafia and Yahya's three teenage daughters and his . 'other' wife from a polygamous relationship. Killed by their family: Prosecutors said, from left, Geeti, Zainab and Sahar Shafia were murdered in an honour killing because they would not comply with the family's strict disciplinary rules . The accused are alleged to have killed . the girls - Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13 - because they . dishonoured the family by defying its disciplinarian rules on dress, . dating, socialising and going online. The fourth victim was Shafia's first wife, who was infertile, and was living with the family in Montreal. The polygamous relationship, if revealed, could have resulted in their deportation. 'Killed by her husband': Rona Amir Mohammad was called 'auntie' by her husband's children, she was presented to immigration lawyer Sabine Venturelli as a cousin helping raise the children. Prosecutor Laurie Lacelle told the court: 'Shafia, Tooba and Hamed had decided that there was a diseased . limb on their family tree. Their decision was to trim the diseased limb . and prune the tree back to the good wood.' The mounting evidence against the trio was 'irrefutable', she added. The trio deny the killings, claiming that evidence points to the deaths being an accident. Police made a grisly discovery in the . summer of 2009 in canal locks east of Toronto when they found the bodies . of the three sisters and 52-year-old Rona Amir Mohammad in a submerged . Nissan car. The prosecution alleges it was a premeditated murder, staged to look like an accident after it was carried out. But defence lawyers told the jury in closing arguments that the evidence fits with the deaths being an accident. The court has heard evidence that it . appears the four made no attempt to escape the car through an open . window, and the bodies were found eerily suspended inside. Defence lawyer Peter Kemp suggested that was plausible in an accident scenario. He has told the jury that there are . too many unknowns to be able to convict the accused, saying the jury . doesn't know where or how the alleged murders happened. Miss Lacelle presented wire taps and . cell phone records from the Shafia family in court. In one phone . conversation, the father says his daughters . Fazil Javad, Shafia's brother-in-law, said Shafia tried to enlist him in a plan to drown the eldest daughter. Guilty: Mohammad Shafia, foreground, Tooba Yahya, right, and their son, Hamed Mohammed Shafia, left, being brought into the Frontenac County courthouse in Kingston, Ontario, Canada . Grisly discovery: The bodies of the three sisters and 52-year-old Rona Amir Mohammad were found in this car submerged in a Toronto canal . Judge Robert Maranger will give the jury . final instructions later today. Closing arguments lasted well into the . evening yesterday after a bomb threat delayed proceedings. Police . Constable Steve Koopman couldn't say if the security threat was related . to the Shafia trial. The family had left Afghanistan in 1992 and lived in Pakistan, Australia and Dubai before settling in Canada in 2007. Shafia, a wealthy businessman, married Yahya because his first wife could not have children. The months leading up to the deaths were not happy ones in the Shafia household, the court has heard. Laced with fear: This tender email from Zainab Shafia to her boyfriend. In it she says 'one day if sum thing (sic) happens to use like dead I wnt die without my dream being fulfilled' Fear-filled: Zainab explains in an email to her boyfriend that she cannot be seen to talk to him and that he must pretend to be a stranger if her brother was around . Zainab, the oldest at 19, was forbidden to attend school for a year because she had a young Pakistani-Canadian boyfriend, and she fled to a shelter, terrified of her father, the court was told. During the trial the court was played recordings in which Shafia talks about his daughters and the . fact that they were dating while ranting about the family's honour. Zainab had married her boyfriend - a Pakistani man - angering Shafia and causing family turmoil. After . Yahya said that she knew Zainab was 'already done' but wished 'the two . others' weren't, he responded saying 'No Tooba, they were treacherous'. Speaking about pictures of his . daughter he said he was consoled adding, 'No Tooba, they were . treacherous. When I tell you to be patient, you tell me that it is hard. 'It isn't harder than watching them every hour with (boyfriends).  For this reason whenever I see those pictures, I am consoled. I say to myself, ""You did well. Would they come back to life a hundred times, for you to do the same again"".' Jurors were also shown email exchanges between Zainab and her boyfriend. One explicitly warning of the potential danger her brother posed. And arranging to make calls from a public call box but only if her brother was not within earshot.",Lawyers make closing statements to Ontario court .

"Mexican authorities have issued an alert for local officials to be on the lookout for an amount of radioactive material stolen by a group of armed thieves on Sunday night. The Interior Department says a pickup truck carrying the iridium was stolen and later found. But the pen-point-sized radioactive material has not been recovered. It is enclosed in a casing about the size of a pen, used in an industrial inspection device. A device containing radioactive substances was stolen from a government research facility and authorities are working to track it down, Mexico's No. 2 official, Government Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong (pictured), said on Friday . 'We have the report regarding the theft of this material and the alerts . and protocol we follow in these cases have already been implemented,' Government Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters after . speaking at a conference of state law enforcement chiefs and attorneys . general. The operations chief for the National Nuclear Security Commission says the device, if opened, could cause harm. Mardonio Jimenez said the Iridium-192 has a relatively short half-life. It is the third theft of radioactive material in Mexico since December. The December theft of cobalt-60 used in radiation therapy was considered more serious. Armed robbers stole a truck transporting cobalt-60 from a hospital in the northwestern border city of Tijuana to a radioactive waste storage center. Mexican authorities located the truck and the radioactive material days later and arrested six people in connection with the heist. None the suspects suffered any effects of radiation exposure and officials found no trace of contamination at the site where the truck was recovered. Nuclear expert Mark Hibbs of the Carnegie Endowment think-tank said Iridium-192, a common medical and industrial isotope with many applications, 'in theory' could be used as a radiological weapon. But, 'the perpetrators would have to accumulate enough material to disperse it effectively which may be difficult since in many cases small amounts of Ir-192 are used in sources,' he told Reuters in an e-mail. 'Unlike cobalt-60, which remains a dangerous source of radiation for many years, Ir-192’s shorter half-life implies that perpetrators would have far less time to fashion it into a dispersion device,' Hibbs added.","Stolen from a government research facility in Mexico City .

"A schoolgirl was in hospital last night after being shot while watching TV on the sofa with her mother. Davina Adarkwa, 11, was caught in a hail of bullets when gunmen opened fire from as little as three metres away through the window of her home. The promising student and her mother, Abena Adofo, 48, were both injured as up to 10 rounds were blasted into their living room. A mother and daughter were injured in a shooting in Chelsea Crescent, Cricklewood . Detectives said it was a miracle no-one . was killed as the window was obscured with blinds and the hooded gunmen . could not see who was inside. They are trying to uncover who was the intended target of the shooting in Cricklewood, North London. One witness, who helped carry Mrs Adofo to safety, said he thought the . bangs were fireworks before spotting the gunman aiming a weapon. He said: ‘I looked out the window and saw the guy pointing into the . house as he fired the last shots. I think there were about seven shots. ‘Nobody just comes and starts shooting through a window. I was searching . through my cupboard for something and heard a pop, pop, pop. ‘I looked out of my front window and saw the guy just aim into the window and shoot. It didn't register at the time. ‘When I came out it smelt like there was gunpowder in the air. I helped . carry the mum out and laid her on the snow. She was lying on the snow . injured in front of her son.’ The shocking attack took place in a tightly-packed road of 12 houses shortly before 10pm on Sunday evening. The schoolgirl, who recently appeared on a ‘roll of honour’ at her . Camden primary school, was hit in the foot. Her mother was hit in the . chest and leg. Both were taken to a North London hospital where they underwent surgery . to remove bullet fragments. Four other adults in the house were . uninjured.

Three black men were seen running away after the shooting, which police believe may have been a gang-related attack. Neighbours said the family have lived in the close-knit community for . more than a decade and Mrs Adofo’s husband died two years ago. Last night forensics officers were using metal detectors in their search for bullet casings in drifts of snow outside the home. They erected a powerful floodlight in front of the house as seven . officers put on kneepads and carried out an inch-by-inch fingertip . search. Five bullet holes were visible in the windowpane where the wooden Venetian blinds were still lowered. Det Insp Glenn Butler, who is leading the inquiry, said it was ‘lucky no-one was killed’ when the men fired up to 10 shots . blindly through the window. The officer, of Scotland Yard’s Trident gun . crime unit, added: ‘It is safe to say that the two people injured are . innocent people that have been caught up in whatever has happened . here.‘We still do not know how many shots have been fired. It could be . as many as 10.

"The Taliban cut off the fingers of 11 people as punishment for voting in Afghanistan’s presidential election. The barbaric attacks were in the western Herat province after Saturday’s vote, according to police.In violence marring the poll, another 47 people died in a series of rocket barrages and scattered attacks. Interior minister Mohammad Umar Daudzai said the victims included 20 civilians and an election worker. He added that 60 militants were killed. Scroll down for video . The Taliban warned people in Afghanistan to boycott the country's presidential election or face punishment, in Herat, these men had their index finger's amputated for ignoring the terror threat . The Taliban had ordered voters not to participate in the contest between former ministers Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. Both plan to improve ties with the West and keep nearly 10,000 US troops in the country for two more years. Officials said more than seven million out of 12million eligible Afghans voted. The first round on April 5 saw a similar turnout and the final result is due on July 22. Afghans . braved threats of violence and searing heat Saturday to vote in the . presidential runoff, which likely will mark the country's first peaceful . transfer of authority, an important step toward democracy as foreign . combat troops leave. Abdullah, . who emerged as the front-runner with 45 percent of the vote in the . first round, faced Ahmadzai, an ex-World Bank official. Neither garnered . the majority needed to win outright, but previous candidates and their . supporters have since offered endorsements to each, making the final . outcome unpredictable. Voters had their fingers inked after casting their ballot to ensure that they voted only once, however this allowed the Taliban to find exactly who defied the demands . The United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan condemned the mutilations in Herat. 'Like . millions of their countrymen and women, these ordinary Afghans were . exercising their fundamental right to determine the future path of their . country through voting and not through violence and intimidation. By . their vote, they already defeated those who promote terror and . violence,' said Jan Kubis, the U.N. special representative. Afghanistan was relatively quiet the day after the second round of voting as the process of counting the votes began. Official preliminary results were to be announced on July 2, with final results released on July 22. The commission plans to release partial results in the coming weeks. The voting was relatively peaceful despite a series of rocket barrages and other scattered attacks that Interior Minister Mohammad Umar Daudzai said killed 47 people, including 20 civilians and an election commission worker. He said 60 militants were killed. Later on Saturday a minibus hit an improvised explosive device in the northern Samangan province, with the blast killing six women, one child and four men in the provincial capital Aybak, said Sediq Azizi, spokesman for the provincial governor. Azizi said four of the victims were employees of the election commission, which organized Saturday's vote. It was not immediately clear if they were the target of the explosion. In the southern Kandahar province police said they raided a building on Sunday that had been occupied by the Taliban the day before, setting off clashes in which police shot dead two would-be suicide bombers but were unable to prevent another two from blowing themselves up, killing three policemen and wounding another two. Gen. Abdul Razeq Achakzai, Kandahar's provincial police chief, said his forces had surrounded the building on Saturday but waited to move in until after the voting ended.","Voters were mutilated by the Taliban in Herat after casting their ballots .

"The Texas Senate has given its initial approval for sweeping abortion restrictions late on Friday, sending them to Republican Governor Rick Perry to sign into law after weeks of protests and rallies that drew thousands of people to the Capitol and made the state the focus of the national abortion debate. Republicans used their large majority in the Texas Legislature to pass the Bill nearly three weeks after a filibuster by Democratic Senator Wendy Davis and an outburst by abortion-rights activists in the Senate gallery disrupted a deadline vote on June 25. As protesters came to the Capitol building in Austin on Friday, bottles of urine and feces, and even tampons were confiscated by state troopers as they tried to prevent anything from disrupting the debate. Protest: Woman who chained themselves to a railing in protest at the abortion law changes are removed . Full house: Abortion rights advocates fill the State Capitol building as the Senate meets for a vote . Democrats, who have called the proposal unnecessary and unconstitutional, sought to enter into the legislative record material that could help in a court battle. According to NBC News, Governor Perry lauded lawmakers who 'tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable Texans and future Texans', and said the legislation showed the state's commitment to protect women's health. The Senate's debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators, with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Those attending the debate were searched, and any item that could potentially be thrown from the gallery, including tampons, were confiscated, according to the Washington Post. A senator later stopped security officials confiscating tampons, calling the move 'bone headed'. However, Texas Department of Public Safety officers were reported to have found one jar suspected to contain urine, 18 jars suspected of holding feces and three jars suspected to contain paint. Four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery were also arrested and a ten-minute break had to be called when another woman managed to chain herself to the railing. The Senate's leader, Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst told officers to remove a group of protesters who started chanting 'Give choice a chance' as the debate resumed. Rally: Abortion rights supporters gather in the State Capitol, in Austin, Texas . Support: Anti-abortion groups support the Bill, which would reduce time frame for having a termination . Debate: Protesters from both sides, wearing blue for anti-abortion supporters and orange for abortion rights groups, in the gallery . Outside the chamber, the crowd grew so loud that troopers were being issued earplugs, as protesters shouted 'Shame! Shame! Shame!' as senators gave their closing statements. The Senate's approval would send the bill to Republican Governor Rick Perry, who has said he will sign it. The circus-like atmosphere in the Texas Capitol marked the culmination of weeks of protests, the most dramatic of which came on June 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session, when a Democratic filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the Bill from becoming law. House Bill 2 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, allow abortions only in surgical centers, limit where and when women may take abortion-inducing pills, and ban abortions after 20 weeks. Only five out of 42 existing abortion clinics meet the requirements to be a surgical center, and clinic owners have said that they cannot afford to upgrade or relocate. Senator Glenn Hegar, the Bill's Republican author, argued that all abortions, including those induced with medications, should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications. Disruption: An abortion rights activist chains herself to the rails and yells as senators debate the Bill . Strict: Protesters were warned they would be removed if they tried to disrupt the debate . Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home. They introduced amendments to add . exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to remove some of the more . restrictive clauses, but Republicans dismissed all of the proposed . changes. Doctors would need to have admitting privileges at . nearby hospitals . Abortions would be allowed only in surgical centers . Women would be limited to where and when they could take abortion-inducing pills . Abortions would be banned after the 20th week of pregnancy . 72,000 abortions were carried out in Texas in 2011, according to state figures . Fewer than 400 took place after the 20th week of pregnancy . Earlier, Senator Royce West, a Dallas . Democrat, asked why Mr Hegar was pushing restrictions that federal . courts in other states had suspended as possibly unconstitutional. 'There will be a lawsuit. I promise you,' Mr West said, raising his right hand as if taking an oath. The Bill mirrors restrictions passed in Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas, Wisconsin and Arizona. In North Carolina, lawmakers are considering a measure that would allow state health officials to apply standards for ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics. Passing the law in Texas would be a major victory for anti-abortion activists in the nation's second most-populous state. Mr Hegar acknowledged working with anti-abortion groups to draft the legislation. A lawsuit originating in Texas would also likely win a sympathetic hearing at the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On the floor: Democrats Kirk Watson and Wendy Davis discuss progress on the Bill on Friday . Reaction: The nature of the confiscated items were quickly picked up on Twitter . Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat, said it was clear the Bill was part of national conservative agenda attempting to ban abortion and infringe on women's rights one state at a time. He pressed Mr Hegar on why the Texas Medical Association, Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology opposed the Bill. 'There are differences in the medical profession,' Mr Hegar said, 'I don't believe this legislation will majorly impede the doctor-patient relationship.' Senator Bob Deuell, a Greenville Republican and doctor, defended the Bill, saying abortion clinics 'had not maintained the proper standard of care'. Mr Dewhurst was determined to keep the vote on track. The Texas Constitution gives him the authority to jail anyone who breaks the chamber's rules of decorum, which stipulate that there can be no demonstrations or attempts to disrupt the Senate's work. In addition to the jars of suspected urine and feces, officers took paint, glitter, confetti and feminine hygiene products from people wanting to sit in the gallery, according to the Department of Public Safety. The debate has been simmering for months in Texas. Democrats successfully blocked the Bill in the regular legislative session. Then, during the first special session, the Senate did not take up the bill until the final day. Display: Abortion rights supporters gather on the floor of the State Capitol on Friday . That allowed Fort Worth Senator Wendy Davis to use a filibuster to delay a vote. When Republicans rushed to try to pass the Bill in the session's final 15 minutes, angry protesters began shouting and screaming from the gallery. Mr Dewhurst could only watch with frustration as a half-dozen state troopers tried to remove more than 450 people. Democrats see in the protests an opportunity that could help them break a 20-year statewide losing streak. They believe Republicans have overreached in trying to appease their base and alienated suburban women, a constituency that helped President Obama win re-election. 'In the long run, all they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women's healthcare away,' Planned Parenthood president, Cecile Richards, told The Associated Press.","Bill will restrict access and time frame for abortions .

"Robert L. Henry, 55, was pronounced dead at 6:16 p.m. on Thursday after the chemical injection at the Florida State Prison . A Florida man who killed two female co-workers by beating them with a hammer and setting them on fire during a robbery at a fabric store where they worked in 1987 was executed on Thursday. One witness to the lethal injection blurted out ‘Die!’ as the inmate read his last statement. Robert L. Henry, 55, was pronounced dead at 6:16 p.m. on Thursday after the chemical injection at the Florida State Prison. He was convicted of first-degree . murder in the November 1987 deaths of Phyllis Harris, 53, and Janet . Thermidor, 35, at the Deerfield Beach store. Authorities say about . $1,200 was taken in the robbery. Before . the execution, Henry read a three-minute statement in which he . apologized for his crimes and said he hoped his death would comfort the . families of the victims. But he also criticized the death penalty, saying thieves don't get their hands amputated as punishment. ‘Why would we continue to be murderers to those who have murdered?’ he said. Then, as he continued, an . unidentified victim family member who was witnessing the execution said . in a loud voice: ‘Die!’ The comment wasn't audible through the thick . glass partition separating witnesses from the chamber. After the execution, Thermidor's sister, Deborah Knights, read a family statement. Miriam Wiley Elliott, right, comforts Seth Penalver, prior to the execution of Robert L. Henry, by the prison near Starke, Fla., on Thursday . ‘We will always cherish the memory of her life that was taken too soon by a demon from hell,’ she said. ‘Today should be closure, but how can you forget the brutal way in which two lives were taken without remorse?’ In the 1987 attack, Thermidor was still alive when authorities found her beaten and burned. She identified Henry as the attacker in a recorded statement before she died hours later. Court records show Henry initially claimed the robbery was committed by three masked intruders who also abducted him, but later he confessed to acting alone. That confession was recorded. ‘You talk about atrocious, heinous, cruel, vile or wicked,’ Broward County prosecutor Michael Satz told the jury that convicted Henry in 1988. ‘This is a case that nightmares are made of.’ Jeffrey McClellan, Asst. Warden at the Florida State Prison, reads a statement to the media at the prison near Starke, Fla., just hours before the execution of Robert L. Henry . In addition to two counts of first-degree murder, Henry was convicted of armed robbery and arson. According to trial testimony and Henry's own statements to police, Henry first approached Harris after the store had closed on Nov. 2, 1987, telling her unknown robbers had ordered him to tie her up and blindfold her. Henry led Harris to a restroom, bound her there, then went to the store's office where he hit Thermidor repeatedly on the head with hammer, doused her with a flammable liquid and set her on fire. Henry then went back to the restroom and attacked Harris with the hammer, setting her ablaze, according to trial testimony. Authorities responding to the fire found Harris dead but Thermidor still alive. Following her statement to investigators, Henry was arrested the next day.","Robert Henry was convicted of first-degree .

"At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Jackie Kennedy begged her husband not to send her to safety in the event of a nuclear attack, previously unreleased interviews have revealed. The same interviews also highlighted her criticisms of Indira Gandhi, sister-in-law Eunice Shriver and 'egomaniac' Charles de Gaulle as well as captured her calling late brother-in-law Joe Jr 'unimaginative' compared to her husband. When the First Lady discovered that the Soviets were installing missiles in Cuba targeting U.S. cities in October 1962, Mrs Kennedy pleaded with her husband to remain by his side. Dedicated: JFK and his wife Jackie hold hands as they meet with delegates in 1962. Previously unreleased interviews have revealed she begged her husband not to send her to safety during the Cuban Missile Crisis that year . In interviews recorded 47 years ago, the . newly-widowed former first lady describes how she would lie down next . to JFK when he took a nap and go for walks with him as America stared . down the barrel of a nuclear war. She said she told him: 'If anything happens, we're all going to stay right here with you. 'I just want to be with you, and I want to die with you, and the children do, too - than live without you.' The interviews, titled Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with John F. Kennedy and due to be released on Wednesday to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy-era administration, were made with historian and former White House aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr in her 18th century Washington home in 1964. In them, she makes virtually no mention of her husband's assassination on November 22, 1963. JFK's health problems and extra-marital affairs were also still years from public knowledge. On the brink of war: JFK walks with military leaders in front of missile batteries during the crisis in 1962 . Crunch time: The president meets with advisers, including his brother Robert, in the White House at the height of the missile crisis. Most other politicians had sent their families away from Washington . Mrs Kennedy reveals she enjoyed having her husband 'proud of her', saw no reason to have a policy opinion that wasn't the same as his and laughed at the thought of 'violently liberal women' who preferred the more effect Adlai Stevenson to her husband. She said: 'Jack so obviously demanded from a woman - a relationship between a man and a woman where a man would be the leader and a woman be his wife and look up to him as a man. 'With Adlai you could have another relationship where - you know, he'd sort of be sweet and you could talk, but you wouldn't ever... I always thought women who were scared of sex loved Adlai.' The interviews also touch on the legacy left by the Kennedy family in U.S. politics and the effect it had within the family itself. She dismissed the idea that the eldest Kennedy son, Joseph Jr, would have been president if he had not been killed in World War Two. 'He would have been so unimaginative, compared to Jack,' she said. 'Warm': JFK and his son John Jr in 1960. Jackie described him as lying around on the floor to play with his children, despite descriptions of him being 'unemotional' Fooling around: The President chases after his son in the Oval Office in the White House . And she commented on the ambition with the Kennedy clan, contrasting the integrity of Robert F. Kennedy - the president's brother and attorney general - with the designs of her sister-in-law Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Robert Kennedy had begged JFK not to appoint him, fearing charges of nepotism. Eunice Kennedy, however, was anxious to see her husband Sargent Shriver, named head of the department of Health, Education and Welfare. Jackie told Mr Schlesinger: 'Eunice was pestering Jack to death to make Sargent head of HEW because she wanted to be a cabinet wife. Jackie had unkind words for Indira Gandhi, calling her a 'prune - bitter, kind of pushy, horrible woman' and Charles de Gaulle, whom she called 'spiteful' and an 'egomaniac' Jackie also said her late brother-in-law Joe Kennedy Jr would not have been very imaginative as president when compared to husband Jack . 'You know, it shows you some people are ambitious for themselves and Bobby wasn't.' Mrs Kennedy also had harsh words for overseas diplomats. She referred to French president Charles de Gaulle, whom she famously charmed on a visit to Paris, as 'that egomaniac' and 'that spiteful man'. While she thought Indira Gandhi, the future prime minister of India, was a 'prune - bitter, kind of pushy, horrible woman.' The interviews also reveal Mrs Kennedy's . loathing for black civil rights leader Martin Luther King, who she . described as a 'terrible man' and a 'phoney'.

Cortege: The coffin of President Kennedy is led to its final resting place in Arlington National Cemetery, near Washington . And they cover JFK's fears over his vice-president Lyndon Johnson succeeding him in office. Jackie said sister-in-law Eunice Shriver, Maria's mom, wanted her husband made head of HEW so she could be a cabinet wife . She said her husband would say to her: 'Oh, God, can you ever imagine what would happen to the country if Lyndon were president? 'And Bobby told me that he'd had some discussions with him... do something to name someone else in 1968.' Mrs Kennedy preferred others in her . husband's administration, calling Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg . 'brilliant'. But she added: 'He talks more about himself than any man . I've ever met in my life.' Meanwhile White House speechwriter Theodore Sorensen . had a 'big inferiority complex' and was 'the last person you would . invite at night.' In June, an extract of one of the interviews had Mrs Kennedy saying her husband felt his legacy would be secured if he was assassinated after his Cuban missile crisis success of 1962. 'If anyone's going to kill me, it should happen now,' he supposedly said. Professor Robert Dallek, a Kennedy era historian, has said JFK’s remark may have been inspired by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.

"One of bin Laden's relatives said he often wore a cowboy hat to avoid detection by U.S. drones. Pictured - how the terror leader might have looked in a stetson . A secret Pakistani report leaked online on Monday provides a series of stunning revelations about the life and death of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, the long-time Al-Qaeda leader responsible for the 9/11 attacks against the United States in 2001. The report, placed online by the Al Jazeera news network, recounts the testimony of more than 200 witnesses including bin Laden's family members. On one occasion during 2002 or 2003, bin Laden was almost caught while headed to a market with his security guard Ibrahim al-Kuwaiti and the guard's wife Maryam. The car he was riding in - it's unclear who was driving - was pulled over for speeding, but bin Laden 'quickly settled the matter,' according to Maryam's testimony, and the al-Qaeda leader was once again off and running. One of bin Laden's relatives said 'The Shaikh,' as he was known, often 'wore a cowboy hat to avoid detection from above' by overhead U.S. drones, and that 'a complete collapse of local governance' allowed him to hide inside the country for six years before U.S. President Barack Obama gave the order to have him killed in a Navy SEAL raid. That 'kill mission,' Pakistan's official inquiry . declared, was 'a criminal act of murder which was condemned by a number . of international lawyers and human rights organizations.' 'Due . process was deliberately denied the victims,' the commissioners wrote - . referring to bin Laden as a victim - 'and their killing was explicitly . ordered by the President of the US.' The . US Navy SEALs raid that killed the al Qaida founder in the town of . Abbottabad outraged Pakistani officials because they were not told about . it beforehand. US officials have said they kept Pakistan in the dark because they were worried that bin Laden would be tipped off. May 2, 2011 marked the end of bin Laden's reign of terror as the leader of al-Qaeda. President Barack Obama announced that the United States had killed the most-wanted terrorist in an operation led by Navy SEALS . The fact that the compound where bin Laden was hiding was located only about half a mile from Pakistan's equivalent of West Point led many in the US to suspect Pakistani officials of aiding him, although Washington never found evidence to back that up. The report said it also found no evidence that current or former Pakistani officials helped bin Laden hide, although it could not rule it out completely. It said very little is known about the network of support that bin Laden enjoyed in Pakistan, other than the group of family and backers that lived with him in Abbottabad. The report attacked all levels of government, including the powerful army and intelligence services, for failing to detect the terror leader as he lived in six different places in Pakistan over nine years. 'To summarise, negligence and incompetence to a greater or lesser degree at almost all levels of government are clear,' said the report, which was based on testimony from more than 200 witnesses, official documents and site visits. The criticism of the army and intelligence services was noteworthy in a country where officials often steer clear of taking these powerful organisations to task. The commission recommended the . government make the report public for fear it would be ignored or . suppressed, but that never happened, even though it was completed months . ago. The report said it was shocking that . nobody in the Pakistani government discovered bin Laden while he was . living in Abbottabad for six years. He was in a compound described as . 'hardly normal,' because it was isolated from homes around it, had very . high walls and was protected by barbed wire. Did he get the idea from Barack? Bin Laden was in the habit of wearing a cowboy hat in his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound because he believed it would shield his identiiy from U.S drones . Thunderclaps or Chinook helicopters? Bin Laden and his youngest wife reportedly thought at first that the Nave SEAL raid's noises were due to a rainstorm . 'The extent of incompetence, to put it mildly, was astounding, if not unbelievable,' the report said. Among the dozen of new details in the report is the revelation that bin . Laden and his supporters waited to build an unauthorized third story on . the compound until after a devastating earthquake hit Pakistan in 2005. According . to an account given to the Abbottabad Commission by his wives, with . whom he was able to father four children while he was on the run, he . often liked to have an apple and a piece of chocolate when he was . feeling weak. The Guardian reports that the terror leader actively encouraged his grandchildren to compete over who could grow the best vegetables. It also said the children of one of his Pakistani couriers knew him as 'poor uncle'. The child had reportedly asked why he never went out shopping, and was told he was too poor to buy anything. Of the raid itself, the commission wrote that bin Laden and his youngest wife Amal were together in the bedroom when the U.S. helicopters first arrived. 'After the evening meal and prayer,' the account reads, 'Amal and the Shaikh retired for the night. Shortly past midnight, they were awakened by the noise of what at first sounded like a storm.' It wasn't a cloudburst. Minutes later, bin Laden lay dead on the floor. Scene of the 'murder'? Pakistan's commission decided that killing 'the victim' bin Laden in his compound, pictured, was a criminal act since he was executed without due process in a court of law . In this now-famous photo, White House national security officials and cabinet members watched the SEAL Team Six raid in real-time as then stalked, found and killed Osama bin Laden . The report also explores the case of Dr. Shakeel Afridi, a Pakistani physician who used his position as a public health vaccination volunteer to attempt to be admitted into bin Laden's compound. Pakistani doctor Shakeel Afridi helped the U. S. track down Osama bin Laden. He was sentenced to 33 years in prison for 'conspiring against the state' Although he failed to get in, Afridi got . a good enough look at the complex system of locks on the front door to . help the Navy SEALs design a specialized package of explosives designed . to blow the door off. He also provided his CIA handlers with crucial information about the voices of the people inside the compound. Aftridi 'met with the CIA operatives [assigned to him] on more than 25 occasions,' the report concludes, 'and received approximately Rs. [Rupees] 10 million from them. 10 million Pakistani Rupees is equal to about $100,000. The Pakistani government arrested Afridi and he remains in prison, sentenced to more than three decades behind bars. Despite the doctor's key role in the mission's success, the United States has done little to secure his release. '[T]he fact is that he was arrested 3 weeks after the raid during which time the CIA could have ferreted him out of the country.' Al Jazeera's release of the commission's report came on the same day the United States government was exposed for going to great lengths to hide its own collection of information related to the 2011 raid. The Associated Press gained access to information from the Department of Defense under the Freedom Of Information Act, but only after the Pentagon acknowledged shifting documents to the CIA and purging them from their original files, so it would no longer possess anything it would have to turn over to the news agency.","The terror chief was almost caught shortly after the 9/11 attack, said the wife of one of his guards, when their car was stopped for speeding .
Bin Laden was in the habit of wearing a cowboy hat in his Abbottabad compound because he thought it would shield him from U.S. drones .
He spent his last night with his youngest wife, and the two initially thought the noise from approaching Chinook helicopters was just a rainstorm .
A Pakistani government commission decided that killing bin Laden was an act of 'murder' - and that he was a 'victim'
Bin Laden was so secretive about his compound that he and his followers waited until after an earthquake to add a third story to the house .

"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's bizarre baby name instantly became the subject of jokes around the globe after it was revealed on Thursday. And it seems even the reality TV star, 32, found the name North West rather humorous when it was first raised in public during an interview with Jay Leno back in March. Scroll down for video . Not going for North: Kim Kardashian firmly turned down the idea that her child would be named North West in a March interview with Jay Leno . It's official: A birth certificate obtained by MailOnline reveals that the little girl will be called North West, with no middle name . Three months before giving birth, Kim laughed at Leno when he brought up rumours Kanye wanted to name the baby North - 'so he [or she] would be North West.' Without batting an eyelash, a giggling Kim immediately dismissed the idea and the audience guffawed along with her. 'That is not one of the names on our list,' she insisted, before adding: 'But that I do like Easton West.' 'It kind of goes with North. I think that's cute,' she said with a smile. Despite her chuckles, North West turned out to be no joke - MailOnline obtained a copy of the . birth certificate on Friday, confirming that the couple have settled on the moniker - and no middle name. There was widespread speculation that Kim would follow her family's 'K' tradition but even back in March she admitted that her baby name list was varied. 'Some of them are K names and some of them are not,' she said. Another direction: The 32-year-old instead offered the name Easton West, which she thought was 'cute' Mixing things up: Kim also said that she's fond of the trend to give girls names traditionally used for boys . News . of the baby's name comes five days after Kim was rushed to a hospital . in Los Angeles on June 15, giving birth to her daughter after going into . labour five weeks before her due date. One week later, the pair checked out of the hospital following the premature birth. And a source told UsWeekly that the couple have already given their daughter a nickname - she will be 'Nori for short'. Proud parents: Kim and partner Kanye West welcomed their first child on 15 June . While North was to prove her final . choice, Kim was said to be very keen on Kaidence, to match her family's . fondness of the letter 'K'. The reality star was reported to like the idea of calling the baby Kai for short. And further report claimed the middle name would be Donda, in honour of Kanye's . late mother, who died in 2007 due to complications from cosmetic . surgery. Nothing official: Despite the birth certificate leak, Kim has yet to make a statement on the baby's name . Meanwhile Kim's close friend Larsa Pippen recently revealed that she had been to visit the baby in the hospital and a decision was nearly made. But she said Kim didn't welcome her suggestions. 'We kind of went back and forth and the name that I wanted, [Kim] didn't love,' she said. First for everything: The name of the baby was predicted to start with K, just like the names of the couple and of Kim's siblings . Kim gave birth to her first child Saturday 15 June. Mail Online exclusively revealed that the reality star had been admitted to hospital in Beverly Hills the night before. Kim had taken out a birthing suite at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a hospital of choice among many celebrities including Britney Spears, Victoria Beckham and Jessica Simpson. Something for Kim? Kim's stepfather Bruce Jenner was seen stopping by a flower shop in Tarzana on Friday . Hours later - around 1:30 a.m. - she gave birth to her baby girl, now believed to be named North. Her partner, rapper Kanye, and mother Kris Jenner were reportedly at her side. Kim's due date was reportedly July 12, just one day after Kate Middleton. The date would also have been Kanye's mother Donda West's 64th birthday. 'Kim & Kanye almost named the baby South West, until they heard the infant would then be required to make 3 daily flights to Phoenix.' @joelmchale . 'Sending poor North West my attorney's number.

"The Fire Department of New York says three retired firefighters who worked at ground zero have died on the same day from 9/11-related illnesses. Lt. Howard Bischoff and firefighters Robert Leaver and Daniel Heglund died Monday. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro says their deaths are 'a painful reminder that 13 years later we continue to pay a terrible price for the department's heroic efforts.' Victims: Lt Howard Bischoff (left) and firefighter Robert Leaver (right) were two of three retired FDNY firefighters who died Monday from 9/11-related illnesses. Lt Bischoff and firefighter Leaver grew up together in Brooklyn and were childhood friends. Firefighter Heglund (center) served 20 years with the FDNY and died the day before his 59th birthday . Fighters: A picture posted to Facebook earlier this month, shows Heglund (left) as he battled cancer. The names of the three men will be added to a memorial of 9/11 firefighter first responders . The three worked at ground zero after the World Trade Center attacks, and stayed with the department for around two decades. One had leukemia, one had esophageal cancer and a third had colon cancer. Firefighter Heglund died one day before his 59th birthday. Lt Bischoff and firefighter Leaver grew up together in Brooklyn and were childhood friends.

'The New York City Fire Department was the only agency that had health data on firefighters pre-9/11,' fire union president Stephen Cassidy told CBS New York. 'The study that they did in the first year after 9/11 showed that firefighters lost 12 years lung capacity in the blink of an eye.' A group of lawmakers are currently working to pass a bill that would extend medical benefits to 9/11 first responders. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation reauthorization Act would extend benefits offered by the original Zadroga bill which are set to expire in two years. The new bill would extend those benefits for another 24 years. The names of the three firefighters will be added to a special memorial for 9/11 firefighter first responders.

"'All I know is we just don’t want them running around half-naked on our streets. That’s the bottom line,' said Mayor Phil Cagle . Standards - and pants - have been slipping in the Tennessee city of Pikeville, where the mayor has decided things have gotten as low as they can go. Mayor Phil Cagle is the author of an ordinance that will soon see anyone wearing their pants 'more than three inches below the top of the hips' fined for public indecency. Pikeville is just the latest place in the U.S. to take issue with where young men position their trousers. Scroll down for video . 'Injurious to health': Pikeville's ordinance bans saggy pants on the basis of indecency - and that it could harm wearers by causing them to adopt an 'improper gait' Two in Louisiana, Jefferson Davis and Terrebonne Parish have passed ordinances in recent months banning the public wearing of saggy pants with hefty fines for those who choose not to belt up, and others have followed suit in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi. So why all the palaver over pants? 'All I know is we just don’t want them running around half-naked on our streets,'  Cagle told the Times Free Press. 'That’s the bottom line.' The City Council of Pikesville unanimously approved the ordinance, which will require anyone guilty letting their pants hang 'more than three inches below the top of the hips (crest of the ilium)' to pay a fine of $25 for the first offense, and $50 for each offense thereafter. Unanimous: The ordinance was approved by all relevant Pikeville officials and states that anyone wearing their pants too low will incur a fine, says Mayor Phil Cagle . 'Myself and the City Council, we wanted an ordinance passed in black and white that our officers know what to tolerate and what not to tolerate,' Cagle told the Times Free Press. 'Now they know what we expect, and they know how to handle it.' Pikeville's ordinance purports to be for the health of its citizens. It states that 'there is evidence that indicates that wearing sagging pants is injurious to the health of the wearer as it causes improper gait.' The trend for wearing the pants very low on the hips may have originated in the U.S. prison system, where inmates are not allowed to wear belts. 'Unconstitutional': Civil liberties groups argue that banning people from wearing their pants low on their hips is a violation of their rights . The look was adopted by hip hop culture and by the 1990s, young men around the country were wearing their pants perilously low with underpants-clad buttocks on prominent display. Even the President addressed the trend in 2008: ‘Brothers should pull up their pants,' Obama said. ‘You are walking by your mother, your grandmother, your underwear is showing. What’s wrong with that? Come on. Some people might not want to see your underwear. I’m one of them.’ Civil Liberties groups have in the past argued that such bans are ‘unconstitutional’ under the 14th Amendment, which says no citizen should be deprived of ‘life, liberty or property’ and no person should be denied equal protection of the law.","Officials in Pikeville, Tennessee have voted unanimously for an ordinance banning saggy pants .

"From Mrs Patmore to Lady Sybil, these barking mad illustrations show the animal side of Downton Abbey's most-loved characters. The art works entitled 'Houndton Tabby', were designed by illustrator and artist Kim Parkhurst, 39, after she combined her love of drawing and Downton Abbey. 'I've been painting portraits of animals in historical costume for some time,' explains the New Yorker. Very paw-sh: Downton Abbey's Lady Mary Crawley, played by Michelle Dockery, trades places with this Borzoi . Doppelganger: Jim Carter as Mr Carson in ITV's Downton Abbey (left) and (right) Kim Pankhurst's animal recreation of him using a clumber spaniel . 'I've taken some familiar and beloved characters whose demeanour, personality, and appearance seemed to translate to certain breeds of dog or cat. 'I got to thinking about Mr Bates' character and storyline, and Brendan Coyle's facial structure, and how he could look hard but also had the warmest, kindest eyes. 'In all those ways, the character reminded me very much of the much-maligned, often misunderstood pit bull dogs that fill animal shelters. 'So, I wondered if I could paint a portrait of a character, but with a realistic dog, and make it recognisable.

Downton Abbey actor Brendan Coyle as Bates (left) and a dog (right) 'I was pleased with the result, so I tried my hand at more characters. As I worked on one, ideas for others would come.

The artist said: 'People seem to find them delightful if they're fans of the show. My best moment was when I was speaking with a woman at an art festival.

"A Californian billionaire says he feels guilty for getting rich at the ‘expense of labour’ and calls for tax reforms to make the top 1 per cent of earners pay more tax. Financier William Gross, 69, who owns Pacific Investment Management Company, PIMCO, posted a blog on his website labelling fellow tycoons who complain about taxes as Scrooge McDucks, referring to the Disney character. Gross, who ranked 641 in the Forbes list of billionaires, according to Sky News, said: ‘Having gotten rich at the expense of labour, the guilt sets in and I begin to feel sorry for the less well-off, writing very public Investment Outlooks that ""dis"" the success that provided me the soapbox in the first place.’ Billionaire: William Gross, 69, founder of Pacific Investment Management (PIMCO), says the top 1 per cent of earners should pay more tax . 'Privileged': The financier's investment company is one of the largest in the world, which oversees billions of dollars. Gross was ranked 641 in the Forbes list of billionaires . He says the Scrooge McDucks of the . world should think twice about criticising ‘what they consider to be . counterproductive, even crippling taxation of the wealthy in the midst . of historically high corporate profits and personal income’. He suggests rich people think of themselves as ‘privileged’ to have been able to make so much of the national income. PIMCO is one of the largest active global fixed income investment managers in the world and has $2 trillion in assets under management. It is the world’s largest bond investor. Gross' 7,100 square-foot home estate in California, which lies by Pebble Beach Golf Course and overlooks Stillwater Bay, cost $20 million. ‘In . the United States, the share of total pre-tax income accruing to the . top 1 per cent has more than doubled from 10 per cent in the 1970s to 20 . per cent today.’ Gross . tells his fellow billionaires to admit that they grew up in a ‘gilded . age of credit, where those who borrowed money or charged fees on . expanding financial assets had a much better chance of making it to the . big tent than those who used their hands for a living’. ‘Congratulations. Smoke that cigar, . enjoy that Chateau Lafite 1989.

"Chelsea Manning, the U.S. soldier serving a 35-year sentence for leaking a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks, has spoken out from his military prison cell in Kansas to warn Americans that they are being lied to about Iraq once more. In a remarkable New York Times Op-Ed piece written from behind bars, Manning said she believes the 'limits on press freedom and excessive government secrecy make it impossible for Americans to grasp fully what is happening in the wars we finance.' Manning, who changed her name from Bradley after beginning sex-reassignment treatments, also defended her leak of 700,000 secret documents - the largest leak of U.S. intelligence in history. 'I understand that my actions violated the law. However, the concerns that motivated me have not been resolved,' she wrote. Convicted: Manning is serving a 35-year prison sentence on espionage charges and other offenses for passing along 700,000 secret documents to WikiLeaks . 'As Iraq erupts in civil war and America again contemplates intervention, that unfinished business should give new urgency to the question of how the United States military controlled the media coverage of its long involvement there and in Afghanistan.' President Barack Obama said this week he was 'looking at all the options' to halt the offensive that has brought militants within 50 miles of Baghdad's city limits, but ruled out any return of U.S. combat troops. Obama has been under mounting fire from Republican critics over the swift collapse of Iraq's security forces, which Washington spent billions of dollars training and equipping before pulling out its own troops in 2011. While the US military was upbeat in its public outlook on the 2010 Iraqi parliamentary elections, suggesting it had helped bring stability and democracy to the country, 'those of us stationed there were acutely aware of a more complicated reality,' Manning wrote. 'Military and diplomatic reports coming across my desk detailed a brutal crackdown against political dissidents by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior and federal police, on behalf of Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki. Detainees were often tortured, or even killed.' Critical: Manning's piece has claimed that the US is lying to Americans about Iraq . Manning, a former US Army intelligence analyst, said she was 'shocked by our military's complicity in the corruption of that election. Yet these deeply troubling details flew under the American media's radar.' She claimed she and other U.S. soldiers were ordered to help the government of President al-Maliki root out dissenters, including intellectuals who simply criticized the government's policies. The U.S. military referred to such dissenters as  'anti-Iraqi.' Criticizing the military's practice of embedding journalists, Manning charged that 'the current limits on press freedom and excessive government secrecy make it impossible for Americans to grasp fully what is happening in the wars we finance.' Manning pointed at that at any given time, there were no more than 12 journalists embedded with U.S. forces in Iraq - a nation of 31million people. 'In contrast to the solid, nuanced briefings we created on the ground, the news available to the public was flooded with foggy speculation and simplifications,' she wrote. She also added that contractors were hired to vet journalists for embed based on how likely they were to produce favorable coverage. Furthermore, the military uses the threat of pulling a journalist's embed at any time to help quash negative reports and convince journalists to self-censor, she claims. Manning is serving out the prison sentence at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and had requested a name change after court-martial proceedings revealed the soldier's emotional turmoil over sexual identity. A US Army general denied clemency to Manning in April, upholding the 35-year sentence.","Detained US soldier Chelsea Manning warned Americans they were being lied to about Iraq once more in a recent op-ed .

"At first glance these images could easily be mistaken for photographs but they are in fact real life drawings created using nothing but coloured pencils. From extremely intrusive close-up images to more creative sketches, these extraordinary works were made by American illustrator Morgan Davidson, 21, after she fell in love with drawing at an early age. 'There are two sides to my work,' said Miss Davidson. Real life: These incredible drawings have been created by Morgan Davidson who uses colouring pencils . 'On the one side I have a series of drawings that zoom in on the face, breaking the ""personal space"" bubble we always put up around us. 'On the other side, I have drawings inspired by the seasons, all vibrant and unique to the seasons they represent. 'My drawing kind of evolved as a coming-of-age comfort in early high school, when I was drawing everything made sense and nothing else mattered.' All hand-drawn, Miss Davidson's life-size work can take her anything from 15 to 25 hours to complete. Detailed: Morgan Davidson, 21, says she fell in love with sketching from a young age . Intricate: At first glance these images could be mistaken for photos but they are in fact pencil drawings . She said: 'My absolute favourite medium of all time is coloured pencil, I've always understood and preferred it since the first time I used it when I was 18. 'The first thing that people ask when they see my work is ""is that coloured pencil?"", then I always seem to get an amplified reaction when they realise it's hand drawn. Morgan Davidson said people are always amazed when she tells them she has used colouring pencils . Traditionalist: Morgan's work can take up to between 15 and 25 hours to complete . 'It feels nice in a modern age that people still support and admire traditional artists when digital art is becoming the norm, especially amongst younger artists.

"It is a rare - and brutal - example of nature at work. A powerful golden eagle swoops on an unsuspecting Sika deer, digs in its claws in and tries to drag its prey away. These images, captured by zoologists in a nature reserve the remote Lazovsky region of southeast Russia, show a particularly audacious attack which sees the eagle fell an animal several times its own size. Swoop: This golden eagle soars in and sinks its claws into a Sika deer . Dig in: The powerful bird starts to lift the panicked animal from the ground . Lift-off: The eagle spreads its wings before lifting the deer from the ground . Although the golden eagle is notorious . for its bold hunts, and have been caught attacking coyote and even a . young bear, experts believe this is the first documented attack on a . deer. The three frame show just two seconds of action, and were taken accidentally by scientists researching the endangered Siberian tiger in 2011. The pictures, and a description of the event, were published in this month's Journal of Raptor Research. Linda Kerley, of the Zoological Society of London, found the shots during a routine equipment check. After discovering the astonishing photograph, Ms Kerley and her colleagues found a carcass which they believed to be that of the unfortunate deer just yards away. She said: 'It's the first time I've seen anything like it. It's rare for golden eagles to snatch up deer. 'I . saw the deer carcass first as I approached the trap on a routine check . to switch out memory cards and change batteries, but something felt . wrong about it. 'There were no large carnivore tracks in the snow, and it looked like the deer had been running and then just stopped and died. Impact: In this shot the eagle makes contact with the deer . Drag: The bird can then be seen digging its claws in and starting to drag its prey away . Endgame: The eagle then drags the deer out of shot to make its meal . 'It was only after we got back to . camp that I checked the images from the camera and pieced everything . together. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I've been assessing deer causes of death in Russia for 18 years, this is the first time I've seen anything like this.' Dr . Jonathan Slaght, from the Wildlife Conservation Society - which works . with the Zoological Soceity - said: 'The scientific literature is full . of references to golden eagle attacks on different animals from around . the world, from things as small as rabbits. 'Their regular prey - to coyote and deer, and even one record in 2004 of an eagle taking a brown bear cub.' 'In this case I think Linda just got really lucky and was able to document a very rare, opportunistic predation event.' Golden eagles are one of the most widespread birds of prey in the world, and live in areas of Europe, Asia and North America.

"Down the years and across the universe, the heroes of science-fiction classics from Dan Dare to Star Wars and The Matrix have fought intergalactic battles with weapons that wipe out enemy electronics at the touch of a button. Now scientists have turned fantasy into reality by developing a missile that targets buildings with microwaves that disable computers but don’t harm people. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing successfully tested the weapon on a one-hour flight during which  it knocked out the computers of an entire military compound in the Utah desert. Scroll down for video . Pre-programmed filghtpath: Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has successfully tested a missile which knocked out an entire military compound in the Utah desert . It is thought the missile could  penetrate the bunkers and caves believed to be hiding Iran’s suspected nuclear facilities. But experts have warned that, in the wrong hands, the technology could be used to bring Western cities such as London to their knees. During Boeing’s experiment, the missile flew low over the Utah Test and Training Range, discharging  electromagnetic pulses on to seven targets, permanently shutting down their electronics. Boeing said that the test was so successful even the camera recording it was disabled. Codenamed the Counter-Electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project (CHAMP), it is the first time a missile with electromagnetic pulse capability has been tested. For security reasons, Boeing declined to . release film of the test, but instead issued an artist’s impression of . it on video. In the clip, a stealth aircraft deploys a missile that . emits radio waves from its undercarriage which knock out the computer . systems inside the buildings below. Stealth mission: The missile is launched from a stealth bomber and is thought to be able to penetrate the bunkers and caves believe to be hiding Iran's suspected nuclear facilities . The company did release real film . showing a row of computers that can be seen shutting down when the . electromagnetic pulse is switched on. Although . the project is shrouded in secrecy, experts believe the missile is . equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon. This uses a . super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy . which causes voltage surges in electronic equipment, rendering them . useless before surge protectors have the chance to react. Keith . Coleman, CHAMP programme manager for Boeing’s  prototype arm Phantom . Works, said the technology marked ‘a new era in modern warfare’. He . added: ‘In the near future, this technology may be used to render an . enemy’s electronic and data  systems useless even before the first . troops or aircraft arrive. ‘We . hit every target we wanted and made science fiction into science fact. When the computers went out, it actually took out the cameras as well. It was fantastic.’ The project has cost £24 million and has been developed on behalf of the US Air Force Research Laboratory following a request from the Pentagon four years ago. Lead test engineer Peter Finlay said: ‘We’re not quite at the place where the Star Trek and Star Wars movies are but this is definitely  an advancement in technology  able to give us an opportunity to  do things we could not do before.’ James Dodd, vice-president of Advanced Boeing Military Aircraft, said there was a real need for  a weapon that could knock out a  target but not cause harm to people and structures. He said: ‘We know this has capabilities and impact. We’re trying to see if we can get it implemented sooner rather than later.’ However, . experts fear that  the project could create an arms race, with . countries scrambling to build their own electromagnetic pulse weapons. Wiped out: Boeing's film shows computers before (left) and after (right) the attack by the drone but experts have warned that, in the wrong hands, the technology could be used to bring Western cities such as London to their knees . Professor Trevor Taylor, Professorial Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said the Western world would be much more vulnerable to such an attack because of our increased reliance on electronics. He added: ‘This is a challenging area in political and military terms. Ideally there would have been an arms-control agreement to cover this field, because once technology is actually developed, control becomes harder. ‘The historical record shows  that important technologies developed in one country are developed elsewhere within a relatively short period – look what happened with regard to the USSR and  nuclear weapons. ‘Should the US be known to have developed such a technology to the production stage, it would drive  others to try to act similarly. ‘Western countries are more dependent on electronics-based IT than others and would be vulnerable to extensive disruption.’","Aircraft manufacturer Boeing have created a weapon that can knock out computers .

"Chelsea Clinton had a $600,000 annual contract with NBC but has recently switched over to a month-to-month arrangement in case her mother runs for president. The news network would cut ties with the former first daughter if her mother formally announces that she will be seeking the presidency, and the month-to-month contract would be an easier way to do that. It is not clear how much she earns in the monthly deal, but Politico reported that her contract was up for renewal or non-renewal this year. Peacock pay up: Chelsea Clinton started working for NBC in 2011 and making segments for the now-defunct Rock Center with Brian Williams (pictured) but her most recent contribution aired in January . She joined the network as a special correspondent with a three-month trial period starting in November 2011 before she was signed on full time. The segments that she worked on showed up largely on the now-defunct Rock Center with Brian Williams, and her most recent coverage aired on Nightly News but her last contribution came in January. Neither NBC nor Clinton commented on the report of her salary, but the number prompted an outcry in the media world. While it is not uncommon for well-known anchors to earn multiple millions per year, but Clinton's reported annual salary is high for the frequency of her segments. Earning her keep: Chelsea switched from an annual to a month-to-month contract earlier this year (pictured with her mother watching over her at a function n New York City on Thursday) Luxury look: Chelsea wore leather pants, a Chanel necklace and Christian Louboutin heels to an event two Thursdays ago . By comparison, her salary is higher than both of the last two editors of the New York Times. The paycheck inevitably helped Chelsea, 34, and her husband when they bought a $10.5million apartment next to New York's Madison Square Park last spring. It is not clear how much fellow first daughter Jenna Bush Hager, who is a Today Show correspondent, makes as part of her contract. Paying the mortgage: Chelsea and her husband Marc bought this four bedroom apartment overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan for $10.5million last spring . The NBC paycheck is just part of her take-home pay, however, since she has been spending most of her time working for her family's eponymous foundation. Her mother's expected presidential run is not the only factor that could weigh into her contractural switch from year to month since she is expecting her first child this fall. She has not discussed what she plans to do when the baby is born and whether or not she will return to NBC as a mom. The Politico report about Clinton's salary comes just days after her mother's book was released, and during an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer she said that the family struggled financially after leaving the White House in 2001. 'We came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt. We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea’s education. You know, it was not easy,' she said.","Chelsea Clinton joined NBC in 2011 but her last segment aired in January .

"Not our fault? Tim Yeo, chair of the Commons energy and climate change committee, says the temperature rise may be a natural process . Global warming may not be caused by mankind, the MP who scrutinises government policy on climate change said last night. Tim Yeo, who chairs the Commons energy and climate change committee, accepted that the earth’s temperature is rising. But he said it was possible that the increase could be down to ‘natural phases’ in the earth’s climate, and that human action is merely a ‘possible cause’. Mr Yeo, who was an environment minister under John Major, has previously spoken with great certainty about the impact of mankind on climate change and he is one of the Conservative Party’s strongest advocates of cutting carbon emissions. But on Tuesday night he downplayed the impact of climate change, saying it posed ‘no threat’ to the survival of the planet and that the causes are ‘not absolutely clear’. Asked whether it was better to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change than to prevent it, he said: ‘The first thing to say is it does not represent any threat to the survival of the planet. None at all. ‘The planet has survived much bigger changes than any climate change that is happening now. ‘Although I think the evidence that the climate is changing is now overwhelming, the causes are not absolutely clear. There could be natural causes, natural phases that are taking place.’ But he said governments should continue to cut carbon emissions, because there was still ‘a risk’ that global warming is caused by mankind. ‘There is at least a risk that the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a possible cause,’ he said, adding that it was ‘prudent’ to be ‘efficient in the use of energy’. Uncertainty: Mr Yeo says the causes of climate change are 'not clear' Mr Yeo’s scepticism puts him at odds with the scientific community. A recent survey of 12,000 academic papers on climate change found 97 per cent agree that human activities are causing the planet to warm. The MP’s comments are particularly surprising in light of some of his previous comments on the issue. He said in 2009: ‘A significant number of core Conservative voters, mostly among older people, are reluctant to accept the evidence. 'I don’t think they will be a significant influence in the next parliament and will gradually diminish in the population … In five years’ time, no one will argue about a man-made contribution to climate change.’ A recent survey of 12,000 academic papers on climate change found 97 per cent agree that human activities are causing the planet to warm . 'The dying gasps of the deniers will be put to bed. In five years’ time, no one will argue about a man-made contribution to climate change.”’ Mr Yeo, who was speaking to an audience of energy industry representatives and diplomats at the Westminster Russia Forum, renewed his call for the Government to build a third runway at Heathrow. He said waiting for Sir Howard Davies’ report on aviation capacity which is due after the next election was a ‘ludicrous response to a clear national need’. He said without better air links to east Asia, Europe risks becoming a ‘sort of third world backwater quite quickly’. Asked about the comments on climate change yesterday, Mr Yeo told the Telegraph: ‘It is possible there are natural causes as well, but my view has always been that - for twenty years - I have thought the scientific evidence has been very convincing. ‘The strong probability is that it is man-made causes contributing to greenhouse gas concentrations.’","Tim Yeo says humanity may not be behind climate change .

"This is the moment a car worth more than the average UK house price was pulled over by police before being towed away. The driver of the £270,000 Lamborghini Aventador was asked to stop in London's Knightsbridge last night by officers wanting to see his papers. After the man was unable to produce documents that satisfied them the supercar was properly insured, he then had to watch as it was loaded onto a tow truck and taken away. Scroll down for video .

'No arrests have been made and the vehicle currently remains at a police car pound.' The car was seized as part of the Met Police's Operation Cubo crackdown on uninsured vehicles.  So far more than 10,000 cars have been towed under Cubo, many of them old bangers. But a police spokesman said: 'We've had a few Porsches, BMW X5s and a Ferrari - that one got crushed, and in fact the majority of them are.'

"Warner Bros has come underfire for 'fat shaming' with its latest installment of the . hit cartoon series Scooby-Doo. In its new direct-to-video release, Frankencreepy, the female lead Daphne Blake gets 'cursed' during an adventure in Pennsylvania and is horrified to see her body morph from a size 2 to a size 8. Many viewers have criticized Warner Bros for the plot line, loosely based on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, stating that it sends the wrong message about body image to children, especially when the average dress size among American women is reported to be a 14. Some have also suggested that Daphne's new shape looks far bigger than a size 8. Scroll down for video . Controversial: In Scooby-Doo! Frankencreepy the female lead, Daphne Blake gets 'cursed' during an adventure in Pennsylvania and is horrified to see her body morph from a size 2 to a size 8 . Look of terror: Many viewers have criticized Warner Bros for the plot line, stating that it sends the wrong message about body image to children . Indeed, Tom Burns writes on his The Good Men Project blog: 'That’s right. Daphne gets cursed and (horror of horrors) she finds that’s she’s gone from a “size two to a size eight,” even though she’s been drawn by animators who apparently have NEVER seen a size-eight woman in real life before. '""Fat Daphne"" is drawn like she's Violet Beauregarde from Willy Wonka, like she's puffed up like a balloon.' He continues: 'It's sad to think that my daughter can’t even watch a cartoon about a dog solving mysteries without negative body stereotypes being thrown in her face.' '""Fat Daphne"" is drawn like she's Violet Beauregarde from Willy Wonka, like she's puffed up like a balloon' Agreeing with Mr Burns' comments, Leslie Burns ‏ from San Diego, California, notes on Twitter: 'SHAME! #ScoobyDoo fat-shames Daphne, saying she’s a size 8 (like that’s bad?!) and depicting it more like a size 28.' And an equally outraged Morgan . Meneses-Sheets from Baltimore, Maryland, adds: 'Guess we won't be seeing . the new #ScoobyDoo movie. Not paying to mess w/my daughters' #bodyimage.' However, a . number of viewers argue the film, which was released on DVD and Blu-Ray . on August 19, spreads a positive message about physical appearance. Before the magic curse: Daphne Blake's usual physique in Scooby-Doo . D. Davidson, who gives the film a five-star rating on Amazon, writes: 'I actually have to defend the writers here because Daphne realized she was being superficial . . . [and] most importantly: Fred didn't notice/care and said that she ""always looked good to him.""' 'I would say it was more about acceptance and not being superficial than anything.' In a statement to the Huffington Post, Warner Bros claims that it is always sensitive 'to obesity and self image, especially when it comes to programming made for children and a family audience.' It goes on: 'The . plot of the movie involves the Scooby gang becoming cursed and losing . what means the most to each of them. Fred loses the Mystery Machine, . Shaggy and Scooby lose their appetites, etc. Daphne loses her good looks . (mainly her figure and her hair).' The entertainment giant also points out, like Mr Davidson, that Daphne's longtime love, Fred Jones, does not notice her new physique. It concludes: 'The loss of Daphne's regular appearance is proven to be a superficial thing, and not what actually matters the most to her.' In 2011, the UK Department of Health deemed Scooby-Doo the healthiest of all children's television programs because of the amount of action it shows, with Scooby and his gang constantly on the run from mean characters and monsters.","In Scooby-Doo!

Madrid were also dealt a blow on Wednesday when defender Sergio Ramos (right) seemed to pull a hamstring . The Spain international (centre) had to walk off the pitch injured on nine minutes and was replaced by Nacho . 'After the tests carried out on James Rodriguez by the Real Madrid medical services at the Sanitas La Moraleja Hospital', the statement reads, 'he has been diagnosed with a fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his right foot. The player will undergo surgery in the coming hours.' Along with Ramos, who overstretched his hamstring going in for a challenge, and Marcelo, whose yellow card on Wednesday night leaves him suspended for one of Real's biggest games of the season, Ancelotti will have to turn to some fringe players to fill his first team. Pepe is also a major doubt with injury, while Fabio Coentrao looks certain to be sidelined for the crunch clash.

"Tests on 8,800 people over 50 have showed cigarettes can damage memory . Smoking is known to be highly damaging to physical health, being a major factor in cancer and heart disease. Now, however, its alarming effects on the mental well-being of millions of smokers have been outlined by British scientists. Lighting up regularly has been associated with a sharp decline in the performance of the brain, according to their study. They found that middle-aged smokers performed less well on tests compared with those without the tobacco habit. The project examined memory, planning . and overall mental ability after four and eight years. The tests . included asking people to learn new words or name as many  animals as . they could in a minute. Researchers concluded that smoking ‘consistently’ reduced all three performance measures after four years. They also found that high blood pressure and being overweight took their toll of brainpower – but not as much as smoking. The team warned that people need to be aware of the impact on their health of lifestyle choices, like smoking. Risk factor data was examined for more . than 8,800 people aged 50 and over taking part in the English . Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The researchers at King’s College . London were investigating links between the likelihood of a heart attack . or stroke and the state of the brain. Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and a high BMI all worsen the risk of dementia . High blood pressure and high risk of . stroke were also associated with lower scores for memory and overall . mental ability after eight years. Being overweight was linked to poor . memory, according to the findings published in the journal Age and . Ageing. Lead scientist Dr Alex Dregan said ‘Cognitive decline becomes . more common with ageing and, for an increasing number of people, . interferes with daily  functioning and well-being. ‘We have identified a number of risk . factors which could be associated with accelerated cognitive decline, . all of which could be modifiable. This offers valuable  knowledge for . prevention and treatment interventions.’ The researchers said their results indicate that high blood pressure has a gradual effect on the brain over a long period. This could explain why short-term . trials of blood pressure drugs being used to treat mental decline failed . to show a clear benefit. Recent laboratory research suggested a . compound in tobacco called NNK provokes white blood cells in the . central nervous system to attack healthy cells, leading to severe . neurological damage. There are almost 10 million  smokers in the UK. The . habit is still by far the biggest single cause of preventable illness . and  premature death. It is a major contributory factor in causing heart disease and 39,000 lung cancer cases each year. Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s . Research UK, said: ‘Research has repeatedly linked smoking and high . blood pressure to a greater risk of cognitive decline and dementia. This . study adds weight to that. ‘Cognitive decline as we age can . develop into dementia, and unravelling the factors linked to this . decline could be crucial for finding ways to prevent the condition.’ Jessica Smith, of the Alzheimer’s . Society, said: ‘We all know smoking, a high blood pressure, high . cholesterol and a high Body Mass Index is bad for our heart. ‘This adds to the huge amount of evidence that also suggests they can be bad for our head too.’ One in three of the over-65s will develop dementia, she added.","Test on nearly 9,000 people over 50 have shown  lifestyles could damage the mind as well as the body .

Embarrassing emergency: Father Tom Donovan was found in handcuffs and a gag at the rectory of St. Aloysius in Springfield . ‘I’m going to need help getting out before this becomes a medical emergency,’ Father Tom Donovan can be heard telling an incredulous sounding dispatcher during the Nov. 28 call. ‘You’re stuck in a pair of handcuffs?’ the dispatcher asks. ‘(I was) playing with them and I need help getting out,’ Donovan responds. It’s not clear exactly how he ended up in handcuffs or why he feared a medical emergency. Father Donovan was alone in the front room of the rectory. A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Springfield, Kathie Sass, told the Illinois Times that Donovan’s  request for a leave of absence was accepted by Bishop Thomas Paprocki not long after the incident. However she refused to disclose if Donovan was staying at a church-affiliated location or to offer up an explanation for how Father Donovan came to find himself incapacitated in such an unusual manner.

"Early discoverers: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may have known as early as August 2007 that the setting of global benchmark interest rates was flawed . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may have known as early as August 2007 that the setting of global benchmark interest rates was flawed. Following an inquiry with British banking group Barclays Plc in the spring of 2008, it shared proposals for reform of the system with British authorities. The role of the Fed is likely to raise questions about whether it and other authorities took enough action to address concerns they had about the way Libor rates were set, or whether their struggle to keep the banking system afloat through the financial crisis meant the issue took a backseat. A New York Fed spokesperson said in a . statement that 'in the context of our market monitoring following the . onset of the financial crisis in late 2007, involving thousands of calls . and emails with market participants over a period of many months, we . received occasional anecdotal reports from Barclays of problems with . Libor.' 'In the spring of . 2008, following the failure of Bear Stearns and shortly before the first . media report on the subject, we made further inquiry of Barclays as to . how Libor submissions were being conducted. We subsequently shared our . analysis and suggestions for reform of Libor with the relevant . authorities in the UK.' The . Fed statement did not provide the precise timing of the communication . with the British authorities. Bear Stearns collapsed in early March 2008 . and was then acquired by JPMorgan. Meanwhile, . legislators on Capitol Hill have signaled they are interested in . learning more about what Fed officials knew with regards to allegations . of Libor manipulation. On July 9, Represenative Randy Neugebauer, chairman of a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee, sent a letter to the New York Fed asking for transcripts of any 'communications with Barclays regarding the setting of interbank offered rates from August 2007 to November 2008.' In the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, the Texas Republican asked New York Fed President William Dudley to provide the transcripts by Friday. Tim Johnson, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said on Tuesday he was concerned by the allegations of the potential 'widespread manipulation' of Libor and had directed his staff to schedule briefings on the issue. Dependent: The rates set by Libor are an integral part of the world financial system, including the New York Stock Exchange (pictured), and are used to price some $550trillion in loans, securities and derivatives . Johnson also said the committee planned to ask Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about the allegations at hearings later this month. Barclays last month agreed to pay $453million to British and U.S. authorities to settle allegations that it manipulated Libor, a series of rates set daily by a group of international banks in London across various currencies. The rates are an integral part of the world financial system and have an impact on borrowing costs for many people and companies as they are used to price some $550trillion in loans, securities and derivatives. By manipulating Libor, banks could have made profits or avoided losses by wagering on the direction of interest rates. During the enormous liquidity problems in the financial crisis they could, by reporting lower than actual borrowing costs, have signaled that they were in better financial health than they really were. Powerful player: Timothy Geithner served as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve before he was promoted to his current position as the Secretary of the Treasury . So far, the scandal has been more of a British affair, prompting the resignation of Barclays top three executives, condemnation from the British government amid a public outcry, and questions about the lack of oversight from British regulators. The Bank of England's Deputy Governor Paul Tucker on Monday even had to deny suggestions that government ministers had pressured him to encourage banks to manipulate Libor. But the deepening investigation by . regulators in Britain, the United States, and other countries is . expected to uncover problems well beyond Barclays and British banks. More . than a dozen banks are being investigated for their roles in setting . Libor, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank, HSBC . Holdings Plc, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland.. Regulators, . including the New York Fed, had a responsibility 'to force greater . integrity and cooperation,' and it had clearly reviewed the situation . and had the resources to investigate, said Andrew Verstein, an associate . research scholar at Yale University, who has written about Libor. 'Obviously they considered this to be within their orbit.' Many of the requests for improper Libor submissions came from traders in New York. As . one of the world's most powerful regulators, the New York Fed has the . power to 'jawbone' banks to force them to make tough decisions, said . Oliver Ireland, former associate general counsel at the Federal Reserve . in Washington and now a lawyer at Washington law firm Morrison & . Foerster. Still, he said by the autumn of 2008, the New York Fed's focus was locked on the impact of the meltdown of Lehman Brothers and AIG as it sought to prevent a global economic disaster. Barclays said in documents released last Tuesday that it first contacted Fed officials to discuss Libor on August 28, 2007, at a time when credit problems arising from the U.S. housing bust were beginning to mount. It communicated with the Fed twice that day. Between then and October 2008, it communicated another 10 times with the U.S. central bank about Libor submissions, including Libor-related problems during the financial crisis, according to the documents. In its document listing those meetings as well as ones with British authorities, Barclays said: 'We believe that this chronology shows clearly that our people repeatedly raised with regulators concerns arising from the impact of the credit crisis on LIBOR setting over an extended period.' As a bank doing business in the United States, Barclays U.S. operations would have come under the Fed's purview. This would have been even more the case after it acquired the investment banking and trading operations of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Under fire: Barclays has had billions wiped off its shares since it was rocked by the Libor-fixing allegations . Officials with the New York Fed talked to authorities in Britain about problems with the calculation of Libor and also heard from market participants about whether an alternative could be found for Libor, people familiar with the situation said. In early 2008, questions about whether Libor reflected banks' true borrowing costs became more public. The Bank for International Settlements published a paper raising the issue in March of that year, and an April 16 story in the Wall Street Journal cast doubts on whether banks were reporting accurate rates. Barclays said it met with Fed officials twice in March-April 2008 to discuss Libor. According to the calendar of then New York Fed President, Timothy Geithner, who is now U.S. Treasury Secretary, it even held a 'Fixing LIBOR' meeting between 2.30-3.00pm on April 28, 2008. At least eight senior Fed staffers were invited. It is unclear precisely what was discussed at this meeting or who attended. Among those invited, along with Geithner, was William Dudley, who was then head of the Markets Group at the New York Fed and who succeeded Geithner as its president in January 2009. Also invited was James McAndrews, a Fed economist who published a report three months later that questioned whether Libor was manipulated. Investigation: Now the inquiry is coming stateside as authorities are looking to see what the timeline of warnings was regarding the Federal Reserve's suspicions about Libor problems . 'A problem of focusing on the Libor is . that the banks in the Libor panel are suspected to under-report the . borrowing costs during the period of recent credit crunch,' said that . report in July 2008 that examined whether a government liquidity . facility was helping ease pressure in the interbank lending market. When . asked for comment, McAndrews directed questions to a New York Fed . spokeswoman. Dudley could not be immediately reached for comment. To . be sure, the Fed's reports have sometimes been inconclusive. One from . last month - only shortly before the Barclays settlement was announced - . found that 'while misreporting by Libor-panel banks would cause Libor . to deviate from other funding measures, our results do not indicate . whether or not such misreporting may have occurred.' Questioning: The former head of Barclays Bob Diamond has been summoned to Parliament over his knowledge of his bank's role in fixing the rates . However, a 2010 draft of a related paper had said that banks appeared to be paying higher rates to borrow from other banks during the financial crisis compared with the levels they reported. One step the New York Fed could have taken in 2008 when questions initially were raised was to find a way to get its staff embedded in the Libor calculation process, Yale's Verstein said. There, they could use the Fedwire Funds Service - an electronic system through which banks settle interbank loans between one another - as a backstop to measure whether banks were accurately reporting borrowing costs. Then after the financial crisis had passed, regulators could have helped 'urge on a newer and better system,' he said. The New York Fed was not part of the Barclays settlement, which was the first major resolution in the Libor probe. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Financial Services Authority in Britain, settled with Barclays. The scandal has thrown into sharp relief a potential regulatory gap: No single regulator appears to have had ultimate responsibility for making sure rates banks submitted were honest. On Monday, the Bank of England's Tucker called the issue of banks improperly submitting rates a 'cesspit.' In documents released with the Barclays settlement, the CFTC said Barclays traders on a New York derivatives desk asked another Barclays desk in London to manipulate Libor to benefit trading positions. 'For Monday we are very long 3m (three-month) cash here in NY and would like the setting to be set as low as possible,' a New York trader emailed in 2006 to a person responsible for setting Barclays rates. Darrell Duffie, a Stanford University finance professor who has followed the Libor issue for several years, said that he believed regulators were 'on the case reasonably quickly' after questions were raised in 2008. 'It appears that some regulators, at least at the New York Fed, indeed knew there was a problem at that time. New York Fed staff have subsequently presented some very good research on the likely level of distortions in Libor reporting,' Duffie said. 'I am surprised, however, that the various regulators in the U.S. and UK took this long to identify and act on the misbehavior.'","Questions over whether Fed did enough over Libor concerns .

"A British security guard was murdered in cold blood just minutes into the siege at the Algerian gas plant, an IT worker caught up in  the hostage crisis has told The Mail on Sunday. The Algerian employee, who managed to escape, has given the most detailed account so far of how Islamist terrorists rounded up foreign workers during the four-day stand-off and placed explosives round their necks. Following his escape, the IT worker contacted a friend who remained in the camp and witnessed yesterday’s final onslaught by Algerian troops. Ordeal: Hostages are seen sitting against the wall of a building outside the gas plant during the terrifying crisis . Terror chief: Mokhtar Belmokhtar, identified by the  Algerian interior ministry as the leader of a militant Islamic group . Speaking under condition of anonymity after the Algerian army told him not to talk, he said: ‘The terrorists arrived at 5.10am on Wednesday in three vehicles and began firing at a bus. A guard was shot and then another guard got out of a car and was instantly shot dead. I believe he was the first Briton to die.’ The IT worker recalled how the Islamists systematically targeted Western employees. ‘The terrorists went to the alarm station, switched off the alarms, and forced the deputy manager to show them where the expats were. They rounded up the expats, making them all wear explosives around their necks while standing in a circle. ‘The attackers were carrying Kalashnikovs and bombs and went throughout the complex, seeking out expats hiding, and forcing them into the circle.’ He said more than 20 British workers – whom the terrorists called ‘kuffar’, meaning non-Muslims – were rounded up. He added: ‘Us Algerians were rounded up separately and were treated with kindness. We were told that because we were Muslim we would not be killed, and it was only the Christians they were after. ‘The terrorists allowed the Algerians to send texts and make phone calls, but to stop the expats communicating, they forced an Algerian telecommunications man to cut network connections for mobile, internet and power. But a back-up system kicked in, which allowed some Brits to send text messages. ‘One, David Murray, was sending text messages while hiding under his desk. I have been told he survived.’ An image broadcast today appears to show hostages surrendering to Islamist gunmen who overtook a gas facility . The Algerian witness said more than 20 British workers ¿ whom the terrorists called ¿kuffar¿, meaning non-Muslims ¿ were rounded up . The IT worker said a lot of planning had gone into the siege. ‘The attackers knew the layout of the complex extremely well. They knew the names of the people responsible, the number of cars and who had keys.’ He added: ‘Of the terrorists, one was an Egyptian, another was Libyan and one was Syrian. Most of them were Algerian but some of them had white skin and I think they were Canadian. Two were speaking fluent English. They claimed to be working for Mokhtar Belmokhtar.’ Belmokhtar is the one-eyed jihadist believed to be behind the attack. The IT worker continued: ‘The Algerian hostages were then allowed to leave. I was allowed to go but before I did, I saw many Brits killed. One Westerner trying to give first aid was blown up by the terrorists. ‘When the army arrived, they were firing at everyone – terrorists and hostages – indiscriminately. The Algerian army on Saturday carried out a final assault on Al Qaeda-linked gunmen holed up in a desert gas plant . An ambulance enters an hospital near the gas plant. An eyewitness said one Westerner who was trying to give first aid was blown up . ‘One person in the military told me the aim was to erase the place at any cost and attack “Russian style”, with no attempt at negotiation. ‘We escaped during the army’s attack by running to a disused entry point, where some of my colleagues cut through the fence using knives.’ He had contact with a friend who was still inside the plant yesterday. The IT worker said: ‘The army had secured most of the complex, but there were still some terrorists holed up with hostages, trying to negotiate. My friend said the army were scared to take it over completely because the terrorists had laid bombs. ‘When the army stormed in, my friend heard two explosions and then there was a lot of confusion. ‘I’m still traumatised. Hopefully, the killings are now over.’","Algerian employee says Westerner was 'blown up' for trying to give first aid .

"From the Suffragettes and Marilyn Monroe to Rita Ora and Rihanna, red lipstick has been used by women for decades as a means of attracting attention. And now it has been revealed that wearing rouge really does makes women feel more confident. In psychological terms, red is associated with warmth, positive energy, and motivation, with studies finding that red is the colour which excites our emotions, as well as triggering feelings strength and ambition. Red hot: It has been proven that red lipstick does make women feel more confident and sexy so it comes as no surprise that Rihanna designed her own version for MAC and Rita Ora wears it every single day . Not only is it a huge confidence booster, but studies confirm that red lipstick is officially the sexiest colour. Scientists at the University of Manchester found that red lipstick draws attention to the mouth, most notably from the opposite sex. In their study, they tracked the eye movements of 50 men who were viewing different images of women and found that men spent longer fixating on the women wearing red lipstick. They found that they spent 7.3 seconds staring at red lips, 6.7 seconds on those with pink lips, and 2.2 seconds on those who wore no lipstick. Attractive: A study even found that men stare for longer at women with red lips and tipped waitresses wearing the colour more . A French study found that waitresses who wore red lipstick on the job received tips 50 per cent of the time from male customers, while those wearing brown, pink or no lipstick were tipped 30 per cent of the time. The study asked men why they tipped those specific waitresses more and they acknowledged that it was because they found them more attractive. Anna DeVere, formerly of Elizabeth Arden, now at Colour Me Beautiful, told the Huffington Post: 'During World War II, Elizabeth Arden created a red lipstick for American women serving in the US armed forces to help them feel confident and powerful.' Standing the test of time: Suffragette Christabel Pankhurst wore red to empower herself, whilst Marilyn Monroe was rarely seen without a slick of rouge to get attention . And it seems that modern-day celebrities have been quick to notice the positive effects of a spot of rouge. Speaking in this month's edition of Glamour, Rita Ora said:  Wearing red lipstick, in my opinion, is the simplest way to make an impact, . 'As soon as I slick it on, I feel instantly pulled together, more powerful, more womanly. I wear it almost every day.' Gwyneth Paltrow famously said in an interview: 'Beauty, to me, is about being comfortable in your own skin. That, or a kick-ass red lipstick!' Celebrity make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury loves a red lip, she said: 'As the incredible Elizabeth Taylor said, “Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.”  A slick of red lipstick instantly makes you feel sexier, empowered and like you can take on the world.’ Rihanna also loves a red lip and has even designed her own limited edition version for MAC cosmetics, Ruby Woo, which sold out in three hours of going on sale.

"Peaches Geldof said she ate McDonald's, pizza and chips every day until doctors warned that her junk food diet was putting her health at risk, it emerged today. The 25-year-old admitted before her death she had cholesterol problems in 2011 and 'the heart of a 90-year-old gangster' so decided to lose weight. She was found dead at her Kent country home on Monday in ‘unexplained’ circumstances and a post-mortem examination yesterday was 'inconclusive' about the cause. Advice: Peaches Geldof was warned by doctors in 2011, left, about her junk food diet, so she gave up eating McDonald's, pizza and chips every day and lost weight, pictured right just before her death . Happier times: Peaches is pictured with her husband, Thomas Cohen, and sons Astala (right) and Phaedra. A post mortem examination into her death was held yesterday and proved 'inconclusive' Investigation: Police continue to scour Peaches Geldof's home in Wrotham, Kent, where she was found dead . Friends had said she looked thin before she died, leading to speculation her weight loss may have put pressure on her heart. She had said her juice diet helped her lose 11lb in a month. 'I had cholesterol and the doctors said stop eating s***. So I did. If you stop eating pizza and chips you then don't look like you used to,' she told The Sun at a film premiere in 2011. 'Do I really look that thin? Let's be honest. How did I do it? I just stopped eating McDonald's and f****** s*** every day. 'I used to eat s*** every single day. I used to wake up with my boyfriend and eat crap. I had the heart of a 90-year-old gangster.' Today it was revealed Peaches Geldof's body has been released to her family so they can plan her funeral. A post-mortem . examination carried out at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford yesterday proved . inconclusive, prompting further investigations to try to establish her . cause of death. It . is understood that police found no suicide note and no signs of injury . or evidence of drugs. Any inquest is not expected to be opened and adjourned by the coroner until after the results of the toxicology tests are known. Her funeral is expected to be held at the Kent church where she married in 2012 and . where her mother Paula Yates' memorial service took place in 2000. Her . father Sir Bob Geldof has also been spending time with her sons Astala, . 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months, at the family home of his son-in-law . Tom Cohen in south-east London. Close: Sir Bob has been spending time with his daughter's children as the family continue to grieve her death this week . Poignant: Peaches will have her funeral at the church of St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence in Davington, Kent, where she was married and her mother Paula's funeral was also held . The initial post-mortem findings came as fears grew that Miss Geldof may have suffered from an eating disorder like her mother Paula Yates, who died from a heroin overdose in 2000. The BBC came under fire yesterday for its ‘excessive’ coverage of Peaches Geldof’s death. Former anchorman Peter Sissons criticised the corporation for their report, which led Monday’s Ten O’Clock News. The veteran broadcaster, 71, who presented the BBC’s evening news programme for ten years until 2003, said: ‘It’s the latest example of news values being infiltrated by the values of the entertainment industry.’ Television doctor Chris Steele said bulimic vomiting can create toxic levels of potassium in the body, which can cause heart irregularities or cardiac arrest. The GP said pictures of Miss Geldof’s hands show damage which he believes could have been caused by her making herself sick. He said: ‘Without any evidence but just to my eye, Peaches’ knuckles are darker than the rest of the finger and they are enlarged. ‘It is highly likely that it is from bulimia. That’s not bulimia of a couple of weeks’ duration, it is a long-term problem. I don’t know any other condition that causes that in the knuckles.’ Police were called to Miss Geldof’s £1million home in Wrotham, Kent after receiving a call raising concerns about her welfare. The young mother, whose two sons are due to celebrate their first and second birthdays in a few days, was pronounced dead at the scene. 'Inconclusive': A post mortem has been held at Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, but a cause of death was not established . Peaches had a house in the country, worth nearly £1million, pictured, where forensic officers were searching for evidence . Evidence: A post-mortem is expected to be carried out at hospital tomorrow to establish the cause of death . Protective gear: Peaches' body was taken away on Monday night to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford . Looking for clues: Forensic teams were spotted walking in and out of her home with trained sniffer dogs - but sources have said there was no signs of injury, drugs or a suicide note . Search: Wearing white overalls and masks, they could be seen carrying plastic bags away from the house . Just weeks before her death, Miss . Geldof was named as a new columnist for Mother and Baby magazine. In her . last piece, she wrote of how she was ‘happier than ever’ because of her . ‘perfect’ life as the wife of musician Tom Cohen, and as the mother to . Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months. Peaches was the second daughter of former Boomtown Rats singer Bob, 62, and Paula Yates. She was just 11 when her mother died . after struggling with depression. Poignantly, the last message Miss . Geldof posted online on Sunday evening was a picture of her as a toddler . with her mother.

"Rich Russians stuffed wads of cash into the pockets of Costa Concordia crew members to bribe them for coveted places on the lifeboats, it has been claimed. Italian investigators are looking into eyewitness accounts that 'expensively dressed Eastern Europeans' paid off staff as 'the disabled were left to fend for themselves'. Giglio resident Franca Anichini also said the first residents to reach dry land on lifeboats were not 'wounded women and children' - instead, she saw 'healthy men and elegant women in evening gowns who were speaking Russian' being the first to be saved, RadarOnline.com reported. The claims came as dramatic pictures emerged showing accounts describing the disaster's aftermath as like a scene from the Titanic were not far wrong. Scroll down for video and list of missing and dead... Disaster: Lifeboats can be seen fleeing the doomed Costa Concordia moments after it hit rocks off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13 . Fleeing: The boats can be seen in the waters near the island of Giglio while passengers wait to board others still on board. At the prow of the ship, holidaymakers can be seen attempting to make their way to safety . The bodies of three German passengers were identified this morning. Sixteen deaths have been confirmed so far and 22 people are still missing. Divers are keeping up the search for bodies, but officials acknowledged it would take 'a miracle' to find any more survivors. Salvage experts also continued work today to begin pumping tons of fuel off the ship. In the pictures, that emerged last night, lifeboats can be seen spilling from the sides of the boat into the gloomy waters off the island of Giglio as the cruise liner sinks into the sea.Passengers at the rear on . the starboard side wait to climb aboard those lifeboats which haven't . already been deployed. And holidaymakers, . who moments earlier had been enjoying dinner on the luxury vessel, make their way around the heavily-banking prow of the . ship. Escape: A boat is seen near the front of the ship being lowered into the water, containing holidaymakers who minutes earlier had been enjoying dinner . Dramatic: The listing ship moments after she ran aground, with the lights giving the gloomy waters an eerie glow . Passengers at the rear on the starboard side wait to climb aboard those lifeboats which haven't already been deployed . The whole . dramatic scene is lit up like a Hollywood movie by the many lights on . the Concordia, which would soon plunge into darkness as it sank into the . water, claiming at least 16 lives. Today, search efforts aboard the doomed liner continued, but an official overseeing the operation acknowledged for the first time that it would take a miracle to find any more survivors. Franco Gabrielli, head of Italy's national civil protection agency, said rescuers would keep searching the ship, which is half-submerged in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the island, until every reachable area is inspected. 'Finding someone alive today belongs in the realm of miracles,' Gabrielli said. 'But since none of us, at least inside, wants to give up on that possibility, we will continue.' Operations today saw search teams set off more explosions on the submerged third floor deck to allow easier access for divers. Clean up: An oil recovery platform is seen next to the ship this evening, allowing ease of access for rescuers to the liner and assuring no fuel can escape . Checks: A firefighting team perform operations around the ship today. The officers were assessing anti-oil spill booms, seen in the foreground . Seventeen people are still . unaccounted for, but the last person to be found alive was on January 15 . when a senior crew member was discovered less than 36 hours after the . grounding. A hairdresser was the last person to leave the stricken Costa Concordia, it has emerged. Giovanni Di Mauro, 35, shamed the ship's Captain Coward by reportedly staying on board for seven hours to help hundreds of passengers to safety. His heroic efforts came as disgraced Francisco Schettino, 52, was ferried to shore just two hours after the vessel hit the rocks. He claims he fell into a lifeboat. Giovanni defied danger to organise the ferrying of survivors in rescue boats as the ship listed at a crazy angle off Italian isle Giglio, investigators have been told. He has shrugged off praise by telling Rome's Il Messaggero newspaper: 'At some point I thought I might die but I was there to help.' The Concordia ran aground after . Captain Francesco Schettino veered from his approved course and gashed . the ship's hull on a reef, forcing the panicked evacuation of the 4,200 . passengers and crew. On . Wednesday, the chief executive of Costa Crociere SpA, Pier Luigi Foschi, . insisted that Schettino didn't have approval to change the ship's . routing and was going far too fast to be so close to shore. But . he defended the practice of so-called 'tourist navigation,' whereby . enormous cruise ships steer close to shore to give passengers a look at . the sites. He said it was part of the 'cruise product' that passengers . demand and that cruise lines are forced to offer to stay competitive. 'It's . something that enriches the cruise product,' Foschi told a . parliamentary committee. 'There are many components of the cruise . product, and we have to do them like everyone else because we are in a . global competition.' Foschi stressed that such deviations . from charted routes are supposed to follow strict protocols that ensure . safety: ports are informed, the company is informed, and certainly no . ship of the Concordia's size would be charging 200-300 yards off shore . at 16 knots. 'For anyone who knows that zone, that ship with those characteristics shouldn't have been there,' he said. Schettino . is under house arrest, facing accusations of manslaughter, causing a . shipwreck and abandoning a ship before all passengers were evacuated. His . lawyer filed a motion challenging the house arrest, saying Schettino . wasn't a flight risk and asserting that there was no risk that he would . repeat the crime since no cruise line would hire him, the ANSA news . agency reported. Operations: A coast guard team pulls up alongside the ship earlier today. Divers have today used explosives to help access to decks . Preparations: Members of an Italian firefighting department share notes ahead of the beginning of their operation, while a colleague, right, gets ready for another diving mission close to the ship .

"A gang of elite British Army soldiers who smuggled drugs and guns into the UK have been jailed for a combined total of almost 50 years today. Trooper Lemar Loveless, 26, masterminded the operation to bring a cache of guns, ammunition and £70,000 worth of cocaine through the Channel Tunnel loaded into the back of BMWs. He had discharged himself from the Queen's Royal Hussars, the most senior light cavalry regiment of the British Army, just days before his arrest.

Immigration officials discovered three boxed pistols with ammunition in the back of the BMWs . Loveless was caught out by immigration officials in Folkestone along with regimental colleague Trave Dyce, 22. The pair had five guns, including two Walther PPKs favoured by fictional spy James Bond, along with three silencers, ammunition, and half a kilo of cocaine, Woolwich Crown Court heard today. The court heard the operation was well-planned and included wrapping the illegal stash in curry powder lined tape to try to evade detection by sniffer dogs. Romone Marshalleck was waiting to sell the guns on to the criminal underworld . Evidence from the seized phones of Loveless and Dyce showed fellow soldiers Duran Wright, 28, and Lance Laurent, 26, were also involved. Laurent, also from the Queen's Royal Hussars, had supplied Dyce with the car to carry the illicit stash, while Wright, from the Royal Logistic Corps, was instrumental in planning the operation. Laurent and Dyce, both serving soldiers based in Germany, were arrested in March last year and charged on June 7 after flying back to the UK. Prior to his arrest, Loveless had turned in his papers and resigned from the regiment, which is based in Sennelager, Germany, and operates Challenger tanks. Dyce was still a serving soldier when taken into custody. The court heard they had links to an Italian arms dealer in Germany who sold them the army-issue guns - two German Walther PPKs and three Italian converted pistols - and cocaine. A fifth defendant, Romone Marshelleck, 24, was waiting to receive the guns in London to sell on to members of the criminal underworld. Police raided his home in south London, and found pictures of him on an iPad posing with guns and ammunition. They also found a picture of guns and bullets arranged to spell the words 'f*** love'. The gang smuggled in five guns including two Walther PPKs . The gang were jailed for a combined total of 50 years for conspiracy to import firearms and drugs . The court heard the gang had links to an Italian arms dealer who sold them the drugs and guns . Dyce, of Smethwick, West Midlands, Laurent, of Battersea, south London, Wright, of New Cross, south east London, and Loveless, of Islington, north London, were all convicted of conspiracy to import firearms and conspiracy to import cocaine. Dyce admitted the drugs charge prior to the trial and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Loveless and Laurent pleaded guilty to the firearm offences at the start of the trial, which concluded earlier this week. Loveless, marked out as the ringleader, was jailed for 14 years, and Laurent was sentenced to ten years behind bars. Wright was jailed for ten years. Marshalleck, of Wimbledon, London, was convicted of conspiracy to import firearms. He received a six-and-a-half year prison sentence.","Lemar Loveless and Trave Dyce caught bringing haul of five guns, ammunition and £70,000 worth of cocaine through Channel Tunnel .

"The BBC faces a new sex scandal over claims two senior Doctor Who staff abused their positions to exploit fans. A book alleges the show’s longest-serving producer, John Nathan-Turner, and his partner, production manager Gary Downie, preyed on young male fans in the 1980s. Many of the men, the book says, were under 21 – at the time the homosexual age of consent. Accusations: John Nathan-Turner on the set of Doctor Who. He was the show's longest running producer . Former Blue Peter editor Richard Marson makes the claims in his biography of Mr Nathan-Turner, who died in 2002. In JN-T: the Life and Scandalous . Times of John Nathan-Turner, Mr Marson says he was propositioned in . 1984, aged 17, after visiting the studio for a Doctor Who Magazine . article. He told online sci-fi magazine Starburst: ‘It happened after the first time I was invited to up to go and see a recording of the show, and he [Nathan-Turner] got a bit frisky, shall we say. ‘I was a bit taken aback; I was only 17 and . . . he said to me, “You’re so f****** provincial”. And of course I was f******* provincial, I came from Bishop's Stortford, I didn't know about anything.' 'I just thought I was in this kind of wonderland that was Television Centre, thinking it was an amazing place, and so I wasn't really prepared for anything really sophisticated.' Propositioned: Former Blue Peter editor Richard Marson, left, makes the claims about Nathan-Turner and his partner Gary Downie, right, in a new book . The next year, on the promise of . Doctor Who photographs, Mr Marson visited the studio again. He says he . was then assaulted by Mr Downie, who died in 2006. The encounter took place in a BBC lift, he says, and ended with him fleeing and trying to hide beneath a desk. In another incident, Mr Marson says a . wealthy fan supplied Mr Nathan-Turner with male escorts in exchange for . visits to the studio and souvenirs. He adds both men were on the look-out . for teenage fans who would have sex with them because of Doctor Who – . dubbing the fans ‘doable barkers’. He claims Mr Nathan-Turner, producer . from 1980-89, once engaged in a sexual act in his BBC office while on . the phone to Blue Peter editor Biddy Baxter. Claims: Producer John Nathan-Turner and . production manager Gary Downie allegedly groomed young men - many of . whom were under below 21, the then-homosexual age of consent - who . visited the studios . The accusations come in the wake of . the Jimmy Savile scandal, with fears the BBC DJ and Jim’ll Fix It host . sexually abused up to 450 adults and children. The BBC was accused of a cover-up after dropping a Newsnight investigation into Savile after his death in 2011. The broadcaster has since established a review to hear victims’ evidence and to examine the culture of the institution. It has also launched a fresh probe into the latest allegations. Mr Marson says some people felt the . men’s behaviour was ‘inappropriate’, but were not willing to tell . police. He writes: ‘It would not be true to say I’ve found anyone . willing to testify to coercion or abuse.' He added to Starburst: ‘I think what you had was a promiscuous gay bloke in a position where his social life was very actively busy, and he had the opportunity to meet a lot of young people, and did like getting off with young guys. 'I don’t think he was predatory particularly, I don’t think he forced himself on the unwilling, I haven’t found any evidence of that. But, Mr Marson went on: 'I found I was much more cautious about his partner Gary, than I was about John. 'I think John was just a go-with-the-flow, life-is-a-party, you know, “I’ll try it on and if somebody says yes, then that’s up to them.” I have less of a benevolent view of Gary.' Working on the show for 20 years, Nathan-Turner was Doctor Who's longest-running producer. Claims: Producer John Nathan-Turner and . production manager Gary Downie allegedly groomed young men - many of . whom were under below 21, the then-homosexual age of consent - who . visited the studios . A BBC spokesman said: ‘We cannot . comment on individual cases but clearly allegations of this nature are . extremely serious. 'We have set up the Dame Janet Smith Review to help us . understand how alleged incidents of this nature could have been . committed and how we can avoid them happening again.’ █ Police dismissed reports of a . suspected paedophile ring at BBC soap EastEnders. The Sun newspaper . yesterday claimed a unit was set up over allegations adults groomed . children on set in the 1980s and 90s. Police said no such unit exists and no abuse was reported.","Producer John Nathan-Turner 'groomed young men who visited studios'

"Fast-food chain Chipotle has asked its customers not to bring firearms into its stores after it says gun rights advocates brought assault rifles into one of its restaurants in Texas. The Denver-based organisation has said it traditionally complied with local laws regarding open and concealed firearms. But in a statement yesterday, the company said 'the display of firearms in our . restaurants has now created an environment that is potentially . intimidating or uncomfortable for many of our customers.' Gun control group Everytown tweeted a picture yesterday of two men carrying guns in a Chipotle restaurant as part of the #BurritosNotBullets campaign . Fast-food chain Chipotle has asked its customers to leave their firearms at home (file picture) The announcement came following a petition by Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense In America in reaction to open-carry gun activists appearing at a Dallas-area Chipotle restaurant over the weekend. Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for the . group, which has called on other companies to ban firearms in their stores as well, said she thought the move by Chipotle was a 'bold statement,' especially considering its previous stance of complying with local laws. Many states allow people to carry licensed guns in some way, but some businesses exercise their right to ban firearms. A Chipotle spokesman did not immediately respond when asked if the company's request was an outright ban, or how it would respond if people continued to bring firearms into its restaurants. Gun control group Everytown tweeted a picture yesterday of two men carrying guns in a Chipotle restaurant.

Last year, Starbucks Corp. also told customers that guns were no longer welcome in its cafes after it had to temporarily close a store in Newtown, Connecticut, to avoid a demonstration by gun rights advocates. The company said it shut down the store out of respect for the community, where 20 school children and six educators had been slain. The Seattle-based coffee chain stopped short of a ban, however, saying it didn't want to put its workers in the position of having to ask people carrying guns to leave its stores. Its carefully worded decision also underscored how major companies need to walk a fine line on highly divisive political issues. Likewise, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. noted in its statement that 'there are strong arguments on both sides of this issue.' It said it hoped that customers who oppose carrying guns in public agree that 'it is the role of elected officials and the legislative process to set policy in this area.'","Chipotle has asked its customers not to bring firearms into its stores .

"An original manuscript containing Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion is being made publicly available online, along with other historic works by the great scientist. Cambridge University today published more than 4,000 pages of Newton's most important works on a new digital library website. They include the scientist's own annotated copy of Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica - and handwritten notes where some of his most famous theories first came to life. Groundbreaking: This annotated sketch of work on optics by Sir Isaac Newton is among 4,000 pages of his historic documents which have been put online by Cambridge University . First published in July 1687, 'Principia' not only contains the laws of motion, but also Newton's law of universal gravitation. It is widely regarded as one of the most significant works in the history of science. Over the next few months the university library will upload thousands more pages, making almost the whole of its Newton collection available for anyone to view and download. Work on the Cambridge Digital Library (http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk) began in 2010 with the Newton collection being photographed during last summer. Up to 200 pages were captured each day, although major conservation work had to be carried out on several manuscripts and notebooks before they could be digitised. The programme also aims to upload works by other famous scientists from Darwin to Ernest Rutherford. Prized: Sir Isaac Newton's first edition copy of his Principia, widely regarded as one of the most significant works in the history of science . The college notebook - used by Newton between 1664 and 1665 - contains notes from his reading on mathematics and geometry, showing particularly the influence of John Wallis and René Descartes . Later the Digital Library will incorporate other collections including the archive of the Board of Longitude and the papers of Charles Darwin. University librarian Anne Jarvis said: 'Over the course of six centuries Cambridge University Library's collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one of the world's great libraries, with an extraordinary accumulation of books, maps, manuscripts and journals. The college notebook also shows evidence of Newton's own mathematical thinking including his study of infinite series and development of binomial theorem and the evolution of the differential calculus . 'These cover every conceivable aspect of human endeavour, spanning most of the world's cultural traditions.' Digitisation of the Newton papers was . made possible by a £1.5million gift from the Polonsky Foundation, . which supports education and the arts. Grant . Young, digitisation manager at the Cambridge University Library, said: . 'We are launching our collections to the world with perhaps some of the . most important papers and documents in the history of science. Genius: But not all of Newton's peers would have wanted his work being made public as some critics felt they weren't even worth being printed . 'In addition to his Principia and notebooks, we've included his 'Waste Book' - a very large notebook Newton inherited from his stepfather and filled with notes and calculations when he was forced to leave his studies in Cambridge during the Great Plague. 'With plenty of time and paper to hand, Newton was able to make significant breakthroughs, particularly in his understanding of calculus. 'Anyone, wherever they are, can see at the click of a mouse how Newton worked and how he went about developing his theories and experiments. 'Newton's copy of his Principia shows how methodically he worked through his text; marking alterations, crossing out and annotating his work in preparation for the second edition. 'Before today, anyone who wanted to see these things had to come to Cambridge. Now we're bringing Cambridge University Library to the world.' Newton's English is recognisably different from our own, but his maths - building on work done by Rene Descartes - is exactly the same as what mathematicians use today. Here, he describes the curve of a mathematical function . Newton's 'Waste Book' contains much of the mathematician's work on calculus - which he began in 1664 while away from Cambridge due to the plague . Not all of Newton's peers would have approved of the work being shared so openly. Several manuscripts contain the words 'not fit to be printed' hand-written by Royal Society Fellow Thomas Pellet, who was asked to go through Newton's papers after his death and decide which ones should be published.","More than 4,000 pages of scientist's works uploaded .

"Anthony Weiner lost his cool today on the campaign trail, engaging in a blazing shouting match with a constituent who insulted him and his wife. New York's infamous mayoral candidate was out and about in the Borough Hall area of Brooklyn ahead of celebrations on Thursday for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. The politician was picking up some traditional baked goods in the strongly Orthodox Jewish community, when a man in a yarmulke came up to Weiner, called him a 'scumbag' and added: 'You’re married to an Arab' making a reference to the disgraced congressman's wife Huma Abedin. Weiner shot back at the man calling him a 'jackass', while chewing a large mouthful of cake. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Showdown: In a Brooklyn bakery, Anthony Weiner got into a tit-for-tat argument with a constituent today after the man said the mayoral candidate was a 'deviant' Weiner replied: 'Charming. Takes one to know one, jackass.' The heated exchange was caught on video by Weiner's campaign. Weiner then said: 'You wait until I walk out to say anything. That's courage. Go ahead.' He then returned to the store before a tit-for-tat shouting match ensues. The man told Weiner: 'You have a nerve to even walk around in public. You are disgusting.' To which Weiner responded: 'Oh yeah, and you're a perfect person?' Charming man: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner called a constituent a 'jackass' today after he insulted his wife at a store in Brooklyn, New York . Spat with a voter: Customers at the Brooklyn bakery looked on in disbelief at the heated exchange . Displeased: Weiner's patience with constituents' opinions following his sexting scandal appears to be wearing thin . The man returned: 'I'm not perfect, but I didn't do what you did.' Weiner would not let the issue go, raising his voice and pointing his finger at the man, while customers in the bakery looked on in disbelief. The disgraced politician said: 'You're my judge? You're my judge? What rabbi taught you that? What rabbi taught you that you're my judge?' The man said: 'You're fine. You talk to God and work out your problems, but stay out of the public eye. That's the difference.' Public opinion: The man confronted Weiner in the Brooklyn bakery . Weiner continued: 'That's up to you to judge, my friend. I don't take my judgments to you and I don't judge you.' The voter said: 'You're a bad example for the people.' Weiner fired back: 'That's your judgment?' The man then reasoned: 'No, that's obvious. Your behavior is deviant.' The voter then asks how Weiner could betray the person closest to him, referring to the politician's long-suffering wife Huma Abedin, as the politician continues to shout over him. As Weiner became more and more hysterical, the man calmly answers that he is not judging the politician but says he should stay out of the public, go home and get a job. Weiner then adds: 'By the way, I have fought very hard for this community and delivered more than you will ever in your entire life.' Losing his cool: Weiner shouts back at the man after he told the politician to take himself out of public life because his behavior was not normal . The man calmly says: 'You never delivered anything to me or for any of these people.' The mayoral then calls the constituent 'ignorant' before turning away with the remark: 'Take care buddy, nice talking to you.' Outside the shop, Weiner attempted to brush off the incident, saying: 'I don't back down' before adding that the man had every right to his opinion because 'this is America'. The shouting match came as it was announced earlier this week that support had collapsed for ex-congressman Weiner, a former front-runner amid a new sexting scandal with student-turned-porn-star Sydney Leathers. Weiner is now in a distant fourth, with only 7 per cent of the vote. Weiner also embarrassed himself on Monday by putting on a fake and bizarre Caribbean accent as he shouted to crowds from a float at the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn.","Candidate was on walkabout in Brooklyn ahead of Rosh Hashanah .

"The grease American's love to cook their french fries and chicken wings in, is now being used to power flights across the Atlantic. The oil for the flight on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines comes from Louisiana and consists of waste oil left over from frying up spicey Cajun food. The fuel is then brought to New . York's JFK Airport to drive the engines of the Boeing 777 aircraft for . flights from the Big Apple to Amsterdam. Let's fry away! KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is using biofuel to run it's Boeing 777 from New York's JFK to Amsterdam Schiphol using leftover Louisiana cooking oil . Leftover oil from crawfish and catfish is refined at a plant near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A similar system is in place at the other end in Holland where oil from restaurants and food plants is used. KLM Executive, Camiel Eurlings told the New York Post: 'I was with the guy fueling the plane this morning, and he said it smelled like fries.' Fry up then fly up: CEO KLM Camiel Eurlings (L) and Schiphol airport CEO Jos Nijhuis (R) ride the fuel truck at JFK airport in New York. He says the fuel smelled like French fries . The eco-friendly jumbo jet is fueled by a blend of 25 percent cooking oil and 75 percent jet fuel. The flights will depart every week for the next six months. The pilots say the cooking oil works like regular jet fuel and does not require any special treatment by airline flight and maintenance crews. Jos Nijhuis, president of the Schiphol Group, a Dutch firm investing in the KLM flight series said it was just like any other regular flight: 'We came here on used cooking fat. The first question when we landed was, ‘Was it smelly?’ No, it wasn’t smelly,' he laughed. Fill her up! The Boeing 777s are fueled by a blend of 25 percent cooking oil and 75 percent jet fuel. It is the first time a biofuel will be used on a regular schedule on trans-Atlantic flights, although KLM has been using cooking-oil-based fuel on passenger flights in Europe since September 2011. Although the fuel maybe greener, reducing carbon emissions by up to 80 percent, it's also more expensive - costing around three times the price of regular aviation fuel at $10 per gallon. Fatty flier: It's the first time biofuels will be used on this wide-bodied Boeing 777 on a regular trans-Atlantic schedule . It might be some time before the fuel is used to run more planes on long-haul routes such as this. Although New York restaurants turn over 50 million gallons of waste cooking oil a year, most of it goes towards powering diesel vehicles or used in home heating oil.","25 per cent of the fuel on board 777 aircraft is made from old cooking oil from Louisiana .

"Jihadists from the Islamic State have agreed a ceasefire with Syrian rebels in a suburb of the capital Damascus, it has been revealed. The deal was agreed between Isis and moderate and Islamist rebels in Hajar al-Aswad, south of the city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It comes as it was revealed that Isis had seen revenues from black-market oil sales plummet - after key engineers fled from oil fields captured by the terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video . Jihadists from the Islamic State have agreed a ceasefire with Syrian rebels in a suburb of the capital Damascus, it has been revealed. A Syrian soldier is pictured firing a heavy machine gun in a village near the city . The deal was agreed between Isis and moderate and Islamist rebels in Hajar al-Aswad, south of Damascus. In this picture, residents of nearby Douma clear debris following air strikes that activists say was carried out by President Bashar al-Assad . Under the deal, 'the two parties will respect a truce until a final solution is found and they promise not to attack each other because they consider the principal enemy to be the Nussayri regime.' Nussayri is a pejorative term for the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs, Agence France-Presse reports. Syria's armed opposition initially welcomed jihadists including Islamic State members in their fight against Assad. But the group's interpretation of Islam and quest for domination of captured territory sparked a backlash against it that began in January. A coalition of rebel groups pushed IS out of much of northern Syria, but it has recaptured much of that territory in recent months and has a strong presence in Hajar al-Aswad. Islamic State has seen revenues from black-market oil sells plummet - after a number of key engineers fled from oil fields captured by the terrorists in Iraq and Syria . Isis has captured oil fields at Sasan, Ajeel and Sadid in Iraq as well as Omar in Syria while large refineries have also been captured at Fallujah, Aksas and Tikrit . Meanwhile, there are claims that the terrorist group has seen revenues from its illegally-held oil fields halved after many workers abandoned the facilities. Some estimates suggest the terrorist group had been making up to $3million (£1.8million) a day in July from oil fields they have seized during the conflict. The Times reports that military setbacks in recent weeks may have prompted a dramatic reduction in revenue from the criminal enterprise. And there are reports that this could drop further amid plans by the United States and its partners to launch airstrikes on key Isis strongholds in the two countries. The newspaper quotes Michael Stephens from the Royal United Services Institute think-tank as saying: 'Revenues are down below $1.5million a day now. 'I can see Isis running out of oil down the line. They are not at that point yet - production in Syria is still pretty stable - but I think they're in trouble.' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (left) talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi during a meeting at the presidential palace in Cairo today . The terrorist organisation has gone about 'plundering' oil and gas facilities since its emergence in 2012, The Times reports, and has even appointed an 'oil minister' to run the illegal industry after its operatives stole 200 lorries in Iraq. It has captured oil fields at Sasan, Ajeel and Sadid in Iraq as well as Omar in Syria while large refineries have also been captured at Fallujah, Aksas and Tikrit, the newspaper reports, adding that many staff were persuaded to stay on with pay rises or 'at the barrel of a gun.' But many of the existing engineers have since fled with Isis running with 'skeleton staff' at some of the facilities including Omar, which has changed hands three times since the conflict started. It is understood that Isis was taking about 80,000 barrels a day from oil fields it was controlling in the two countries - but that has halved in the last two months. The newspaper says Isis makes up to $25 a barrel, using smuggling networks to transport their product across borders. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived at Cairo International Airport today ahead of a for a short visit of less than a day to discuss how Egypt can help in the fight against Islamic State. He has been on a regional trip to gather support for Barack Obama's plans to counter the militant group.","Islamic State agrees truce with moderate Syrian rebels in Damascus suburb .

"You've heard the song, you've seen the dance - now Gangnam Style, by South Korean pop star Psy, has become the inspiration for the country's tourist police. Psy's costume designer has created snappy uniforms for the new force, comprising bright blue jackets, dark trousers, grey shirts, sunglasses and black berets. And to add a twist to today's launch in Seoul, the hit song was played as the new recruits were unveiled - with a police drill unit performing Psy's signature horse-riding dance. Scroll down for video . Stylish: South Korea's new tourist police wearing uniforms made by Psy's costume designer . Influence: The new unit was inspired by the global success of Psy's pop-rap hit Gangnam Style . Up to 100 young men and women have been fitted out and when they stepped out on parade they issued a warning that anyone who tries to rip off tourists will have to answer to them. Each officer will be wearing a badge to denote the languages he speaks, which include English, Japanese and Mandarin. 'Tourists who think they were overcharged by taxi drivers or street food vendors can come and talk to us,' said English-speaking recruit Park Jae-Hyoung. 'We will help settle the problem,' he told AFP. Helpful: The police speak a variety of foreign languages and intended to benefit visitors to South Korea . Ceremony: The officers attended an event in Seoul which featured police dancing to Gangnam Style . Mr Lee Charm, president of the Korea Tourism Organisation wanted to make it clear to the recruits that they weren't formed because the country was unsafe. 'You are ambassadors who promote how safe this country is,' he said. 'From now on, you guys will be very busy having pictures taken with tourists.' While they will be chatty with tourists and will automatically smile whenever a camera is pointed at them, the tourist police have been told that because they will not be carrying weapons they must call in regular officers if they are confronted with a crime or a dangerous situation. South Korea has become an increasingly popular holiday destination and last year topped 10million visitors for the first time - partly thanks to interest sparked by the international Gangnam Style craze. The song, which was released last year, made Psy a global star and it is now the most popular video of all time on YouTube, with nearly 1.8billion views.","South Korean tourist police wear uniform made by Psy's costume designer .
