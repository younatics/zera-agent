'We love each other': Mr Clegg said he and his wife Miriam didn't get married because they were offered £3 a week . Nick Clegg prompted Conservative anger last night as he poured scorn on ‘odd’ proposals for tax breaks for married couples, saying a few pounds  a week would not encourage people  to get hitched. The Deputy Prime Minister confirmed he would not support Tory plans to recognise marriage in the tax system, insisting: ‘You don’t need the taxman to tell you whether you should get married or not.’ David Cameron is today expected to restate his ‘absolute commitment’ to introducing tax breaks for married couples, while indicating that they are not likely to be unveiled until next year’s Budget. But his Liberal Democrat deputy, who . will join Labour in opposing the measure, said yesterday: ‘If you say to . someone, “Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to be given some help to get . married?”, they’d go, “Oh, that’s a good idea”. ‘But if you think about it a bit more . it would be odd, wouldn’t it, to say people who chose not to get . married have to pay higher tax. ‘That’s why my party doesn’t support the idea of a transferable tax allowance for  married couples. ‘The more people will look at this, . the more they will think . . . why should you be giving, whatever it is, . £3 a week to married couples?’ Tory MPs expressed alarm that Mr Clegg was denouncing the idea in such terms, given his party’s commitment to abstain. Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, said: ‘This is just part of the sneering, liberal view of people that do the right thing. ‘We know Nick Clegg is not very good . at following the details of the coalition agreement but if he has such a . big problem with this issue, why didn’t they say they would vote . against?’ Witham MP Priti Patel added: ‘Only . someone from a privileged background like his could be as dismissive as . he is of £3 a week. He shows a complete disregard and lack of . understanding of regular families.’ David Cameron is being urged by some Tory MPs to use the promise to introduce a marriage tax allowance to buy off opponents of gay marriage plans . Nick Clegg used his weekly phone-in to argue against a marriage tax allowance . Tory MPs say the need to introduce . the marriage tax break is more urgent than ever, given that the . Government is preparing to unveil support for working women to help pay . for childcare. A minister admitted the plans could penalise stay-at-home . mothers. Lord Newby, a Treasury spokesman in the Lords, admitted there could be problems associated with a ‘tax relief-based scheme’. The Lord Bishop of Chester Peter . Forster asked Lord Newby whether it would be ‘unfair to introduce this . tax relief for working parents with children while denying effective tax . relief through transferable allowances to those parents who choose to . stay at home with young children and who are currently penalised through . the tax system’. Lord Newby replied: ‘Obviously one of . the problems with simply having a tax relief-based scheme is the one . that the right reverend prelate refers to. That is why we are looking at . a number of options, some of which are tax based and others of which . are not.’ Mr Clegg, conducting his weekly radio phone-in on LBC radio, conceded that marriage was ‘incredibly important’. ‘I mean, marriage is the best thing . that’s ever happened to me, but I tell you, Miriam and I didn’t get . married because we got offered £3 a week. We got married thankfully . because we love each other and that’s what most people’s views are about . marriage.’ Culture Secretary Maria Miller, left, has said recognising marriage in the tax system is 'important' while Tory MP for Portsmouth North Penny Mordaunt, right, has challenged ministers on the progress of the policy . Under Mr Cameron’s plans, it is . expected that one member of a married couple or those in civil . partnerships would be allowed to transfer £750 of their tax-free . personal allowance to their partner, reducing their partner’s tax bill. This would be worth £150 a year to basic-rate taxpayers. The coalition agreement struck . between the Tories and the Lib Dems committed the Government to . introducing the allowance, but gave the Lib Dems special permission to . abstain. That means that even with Labour voting against, it should . still pass into law. - MORE than a third of working . mothers want to quit their jobs to look after their children, a major . government-funded study found yesterday. The survey, conducted among 6,350 parents for the Department for . Education, also revealed that rising numbers of mothers are deciding to . stay at home, either by choice or because of spiralling childcare costs. The proportion of mothers with full-time or part-time jobs has fallen . from 63 per cent to 60 per cent in just a year. ANALYSIS: By James Slack and Daniel Martin . Another year; another Nick Clegg attack on proposals to support marriage through the tax system. The Lib Dem leader first derided the Tory idea in late 2010, saying it was equivalent to taking the ‘1950s model of suit-wearing, bread-winning dad and aproned, home-making mother, and trying to preserve it in aspic’. But far from being backward-looking, giving tax breaks to married couples would merely bring Britain in line with the rest of Europe – something one might think would appeal to Mr Clegg’s Europhile tendencies. Under our system, married couples are actually punished financially – with experts estimating that most married couples with children are losing £100 a week compared to single parents who live alone. Europe is divided into two groups on the issue. The first offers married couples either transferrable tax allowances that can be swapped between spouses, or tax credits that are shared between a married couple. The countries in this system include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain. The second group favours income-splitting, in which the income of the husband and wife is added together then divided into two for tax purposes. If the wife doesn’t work, or works part-time, this can bring a significant reduction in the husband’s tax liability. This system is used in Estonia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland. Here we look at how marriage is recognised in the tax system of  four EU countries: . FRANCE . Families are taxed as a unit, rather than individually as in the UK. The tax allowances – the amount they can earn without being taxed – refer to the whole family rather than each member. It means a mother who stays at home to look after her children will not lose out because the family’s tax allowance would be the same if she went to work. GERMANY . Couples can decide to be taxed either individually or jointly. If they decide to pay tax jointly, their tax allowances are doubled – whether or not they are both working. Child tax credits are doubled if the couple decide to be taxed jointly. It means that a mother who decides to stay at home to look after her children will not lose out. Married couples also get help with mortgages, cheaper health insurance and get tax relief if they make repairs to their home. And, to encourage young mothers to stay at home, they are paid a child-rearing allowance until the child is two. ITALY . Italy has a system of individual tax registration, meaning everyone gets the same allowances, regardless of their marital arrangements. However, marriage is recognised in the system because there are tax credits for spouses – meaning families get something back from the State if they are married or cohabit. It also means that when a mother stays at home to look after her children, the family will not lose out. SPAIN . The tax allowance for married couples filing jointly is higher than the allowance for unmarried or separated individuals with dependent children. This means there is a cash incentive for those who stay together and agree to be taxed together.","Deputy Prime Minister confirms he will not support Tory policy .

The Pew Hispanic Center released data which suggest that more than 30 per cent . of Americans are certain that more than half of all Latinos living in the U.S. are here illegally, although the actual figure stands at around 18 per cent. In addition, only 37 per cent of U.S. Hispanics are actually immigrants from . other countries. Misconception: More than 30 per cent of non-Hispanic Americans believe that a majority of Latinos are in the U.S. illegally . One of two non-Latinos think 'welfare recipient' describes more than half of . all Latinos very or somewhat well, as well as 'less educated' and 'refuse to . learn English,' NBC Latino reported. Results of a new poll released . by the National Hispanic Media Coalition and . Latino Decisions point an accusing finger at the media, which feature . negative portrayals of Latinos that help shape public opinion. 'The media is doing a disservice with coverage that is misleading the public . about Latinos who live in the U.S.,' said National Hispanic Media Coalition president . and CEO Alex Nogales. 'It is producing attitudes among non-Latinos that contribute to hate speech . and hate crimes. We must demand that the media do a better job with its . coverage.' Latino Decisions conducted an online interactive experiment with over . 3,000 non-Latino participants who were randomly shown either negative or . positive one-minute clips of Hispanics. According to the study, being exposed to just one negative clip made it more . likely that the viewer would associate Hispanics with crime, families that are . too large and illegal immigration. Bad rep: Seventy one per cent of those polled said they usually see Hispanics depicted as criminals or gang members . For example, 49 per cent of participants in the poll who heard a negative . radio clip thought Hispanics take jobs away from Americans, whereas 33 per cent . of those who heard a positive radio story shared that view. After seeing a positive news clip, 68 per cent of respondents thought . Hispanics were ‘honest,’ compared to 53 per cent who saw a negative clip, and . 61 per cent thought Hispanics were ‘neighborly and welcoming.’ Image problem: The study found less than half of non-Latinos describe Hispanics as patriotic, even after watching positive TV news coverage of the community . One of the most enduring misconceptions about Hispanic-Americans, however, . is their legal status in the U.S. Even after watching Latino actor Jimmy Smits . play a U.S. president on West Wing, 54 per cent of respondents still thought ‘illegal . immigrants’ applied to Latinos. The study also found less than half (47 per cent) of non-Latinos describe . Hispanics as patriotic, even after watching positive TV news coverage of . Latinos. And according to the study, what non-Hispanic Americans choose to watch and . listen to plays a major role in shaping their view of Latinos. For example, 41 per cent of conservative radio talk show listeners . think Latinos take jobs away from other Americans, over twice the rate of . National Public Radio listeners. As part of the study, 900 non-Hispanic participants were asked about their . views of Latinos and their portrayals in movies and on TV. Seventy one per cent of respondents said they usually see Hispanics depicted . as criminals or gang members. In contrast, only five per cent of the participants . said they see Latinos cast in roles of doctors, lawyers or judges. Stigma: Many Americans who are exposed to negative press coverage f Latinos associate them with families that are too large . However, there are also some positive trends that emerged from the survey. Over 75 per cent of those polled think Latinos are family-oriented, . hard-working, religious and honest. Another positive bit of news is that young people are more likely to develop relationships . with Latinos, which may help break down the old stereotypes.

Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick Paul Ryan in the end failed to help his running mate win the White House last night, and to add insult to injury, the rising star of the Republican Party was left embarrassed after losing his home state of Wisconsin. However, the congressman's night was not a complete loss as he easily won re-election to the U.S. House seat he has held since 1998 and received a ringing endorsement from his running mate. In his concession speech early Wednesday morning, Romney lavished praised on his would-be vice president for all he has done for their campaign over the past year. Scroll down for video . Winner and loser: Joe Biden, left, helped President Obama deliver a victory in Delaware, while Paul Ryan, right, failed to pull off a win in his home state of Wisconsin which Mitt Romney lost . Passing the baton: In his concession speech, Romney, center, praised Ryan and expressed hope that his 'commitment to principle will continue to contribute top the good of our nation''Besides my wife, Ann, Paul is the best choice I’ve ever made,' Romney gushed in his brief yet gracious remarks. 'And . I trust that his intellect and his hard work and his commitment to . principle will continue to contribute to the good of our nation.' Even before he was tapped as Romney's . No 2, Ryan was regarded as one of the GOP's 'young guns.' As chairman . of the powerful House Budget Committee, he gained prominence when he . drew up an austere budget blueprint that would reshape Medicare for many . people into a voucher-like program. He also attracted attention for wanting to keep tax breaks in place that were set to expire for the wealthy. If he had won both races, Ryan would have had to resign from Congress and a special election would have been held to fill the House seat. Right-hand man: Biden, left, has spent the past year crisscrossing the country to get President Obama, right, re-elected . Partners: Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan (left) gestures to supporters and campaign workers at a campaign office in Richmond Heights, Ohio November 6 . But that was not to in the stars. Romney ended up losing the election, as well as Ryan's home state, which Obama won with 52 per cent of the votes to Romney 47 per cent, walking away with 10 electoral votes. Unlike his GOP counterpart, Vice President Biden, who had spent the past year tirelessly campaigning for Obama, likely helped him score a victory in his state of Delaware, where the commander-in-chief walked away with 59 per cent of the vote. Despite Tuesday's major setback, Ryan's future appears to be nothing if not bright, and according to media reports, the Republican hot shot has been working on an exit strategy long before the election. In a story leaked to Phillip Elliot of the Associated Press, Ryan's aides said that he will be just fine even in defeat. 'Professor Ryan? Lobbyist Ryan? Maybe back to plain-old Rep. Ryan or future President Ryan?' said the AP story's lead, implying that defeat is a foregone conclusion for the Romney/Ryan ticket. Some political pundits have suggested that the 42-year-old congressman may be back on the campaign trail as early as 2016, this time as a presidential candidate. One more round? the 69-year-old Biden, left, half-jokingly said that he might run for the White House again . History hasn't been kind to losing vice presidential candidates. Only two have gone on to become presidents themselves. The last two failed running mates were Sarah Palin and John Edwards - one went on to a reality television show, the other's personal life turned out to be fit for a soap opera. But no one expects the GOP’s darling to have a similar fate, and he returns to Congress as a larger figure. His re-entry into daily politics in Washington comes as Congress enters a furious period of negotiations over averting a ‘fiscal cliff’ - a series of expiring tax cuts and pending spending cuts that could push the United States back into recession if Congress cannot reach a deal by January 1. Now, Ryan's status as House Budget committee chairman will be joined with a new political celebrity, giving the author of the Republicans' fiscal plans an even greater hand in directing the debate. At the time of his selection by Romney, Ryan was a familiar figure to only 35 per cent of people, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Today, he is a household name. High praise: In his victory speech, President Obama called Joe Biden 'the best vice president anyone could ever hope for' Ryan's supporters say the campaign . enhanced Ryan's stature. Speaking days before the election, . Representative Sean Duffy recalled a warm reception from Democrats when . Ryan returned to the chamber's floor this fall. They say that the campaign reinforced . a reputation for truth-telling and open-mindedness, pointing to his . speech on Medicare at a convention for the AARP, a lobbying group for . older Americans which has backed Obama administration proposals, as a . sign of his political courage. Romney's loss is bound to provoke . soul-searching among Republicans who lost a presidential election . despite Obama's vulnerability amid a weak economy. In theory, Ryan is . positioned like few other leaders to step into the void. ‘I've been referring to Paul Ryan as . the Paul Revere of the next generation,’ Kasich said, referring to the . American Revolutionary War hero who warned Colonial forces of impending . threats from the British. ‘I'll tell you he's just getting started,’ he added. If Ryan chooses to get into the fray . in four years, he is likely to go head-to-head with the charismatic and . outspoken New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on the Republican side. On the Democratic side, the Wisconsin congressman may even encounter his old rival Joe Biden, 69, who has not ruled a run for the White House. After voting Tuesday morning in Delaware, the 69-year-old playfully responded to a reporter's question about whether he thought this would be the last time he voted for himself in an election. ‘No, I don't think so,’ Biden said with a grin, according to USA Today. Dream team: President Obama, second left, highly praised Joe Bide, calling him the best vice president anyone could ever hope for . During an 11th-hour campaign stop in Cleveland later in the day, the vice president was asked by a voter whether he would make yet another run for the White House if Obama wins. ‘Oh, I'm going to go back home and run for county council or something,’ Biden responded. Biden's first unsuccessful attempt to capture the presidency came in 1988, when he was forced to end his campaign after being accused of plagiarizing parts of a speech. His brief 2008 run was most memorable for describing Obama as the 'first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.' But on Wednesday morning, all that was left in the past as Obama opened his victory speech y praising his right-hand man as 'the best vice president anyone could ever hope for.'","President Obama won Wisconsin with 52 per cent of the vote to Mitt Romney's 47 per cent .

"By . Simon Walters and Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 16:04 EST, 30 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:56 EST, 1 July 2012 . Referendum... just not yet: David Cameron has promised the UK a vote on whether to remain in Europe IF he is voted in again at the next election . David Cameron paved the way for a historic popular vote on Britain’s role in Europe as his Foreign Secretary said there was a 'powerful case' for letting the public decide. The Prime Minister yesterday indicated he is ‘opening the door’ to a referendum. And he was backed by William Hague, who this morning said a move by Europe towards a federal state to solve the eurozone crisis could trigger referendum. Asked about the EU's moves towards . closer union, Mr Hague told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show: 'If it changes in that way and once we know . whether we can get a better relationship with Europe then that is the . time to make the case for a referendum or if there is a clear division . between the parties to decide in a general election. 'That is the time, not now.' Voters could be asked if they want the UK to stay in or out of the European Union, or to sever many of its existing ties with Brussels. The Prime Minister is gearing up to resolve the matter once and for all – but not yet. He is considering turning the next Election, due in 2015, into a vote on Britain’s membership of the EU – or holding a referendum afterwards if he is still in No 10. Mr Cameron believes it is too early to decide the crucial question to be put to voters: whether it be a straight ‘in or out’ choice, or a proposal to grab back some of the powers lost to Brussels bureaucrats. And he believes it would be a mistake to hold such a vote before the dust settles over the euro crisis. A source close to the Prime Minister said: ‘It is time to open the door on this matter and consider a referendum. It could either be a standalone referendum or it could be part of the Conservative manifesto at the next Election.’ Explaining why Mr Cameron has not yet decided on the wording of the question to be put to the nation, the source added: ‘Now is the wrong time when Europe is in flux and the whole continent  is changing before our eyes. ‘We need to see where everything ends up before we consult the British people.’ Mr Cameron’s hand has also been forced by the financial crisis in the eurozone, which is forcing member countries to negotiate ever-closer ties. The accelerated integration is likely to lead to full-scale treaty renegotiations in the coming years. Breaking up is hard to do: The referendum would be the first time to question of Europe has been put to the public since 1975, when voters backed the Britain's continuing membership of the bloc . Although cynics will describe the . referendum as another Government U-turn following the Budget measures . such as the ‘pasty tax’ and the aborted 3p petrol duty, the pledge is . the  latest evidence that Mr Cameron is increasingly turning his . attention to political life after the Coalition. If . he does call an referendum, it is almost certain that arch-europhile . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg would be on opposite sides to Mr Cameron. Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was a 'very powerful' case for a referendum if Europe moved towards a federal state . Recent . polls show a majority of voters want a referendum, and a significant . number are ready to turn their backs on the EU completely. However, the . result would not be certain. In the run-up to the last referendum on Europe in 1975, surveys suggested a ‘No’ vote, but in the event, the public decided against going back on Britain’s decision two years earlier to join what was then known as the Common Market. Mr Hague reiterated Mr Cameron's desire to hold a referendum, but said he did not favour a straight 'in or out' vote in favour of a more nuanced question when it was clear what shape Europe would take following this current euro crisis. He told BBC1's the Andrew Marr Show this morning there would be a 'very, very powerful' case for a referendum if Europe moved towards a more federal system, as expected in response to the eurozone turmoil. But he said the Government wanted to see whether it could negotiate a better relationship between the UK and Brussels, with the return of powers, before putting the matter to the British people. 'What the Prime Minister is saying is that the time to decide on a referendum or a general election on our relationship with Europe is when we know how Europe is going to develop over the coming months and years to the eurozone crisis, and when we know whether we can get that better relationship.' Mr Cameron would be setting out his position on a referendum in more detail in the autumn, Mr Hague said. Mr Cameron’s pledge comes in the face of intense pressure from Tory backbenchers to give the public a vote. Last week, 100 Tory MPs – more than half of all backbench Conservatives – sent a letter  to the Prime Minister which argued that there was ‘a consistent majority in this country who believe that the EU meddles too much in our everyday lives, that the regulation on our businesses is too burdensome, and that the cost of membership is far too high’. Coalition tensions: If a referendum is called, arch-europhile Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg would be on opposite sides to Mr Cameron . They also pointed out that the EU is ‘very different’ from the Common Market that Britain originally signed up to – and that no one under the age of 55 has had a vote on the nation’s membership. The picture appeared confused on Friday when Mr Cameron emerged from a marathon Brussels summit on the euro crisis  to say: ‘I completely understand why some people want an in/out referendum – some people just want to say, “Stop the bus, I want to get off.” ‘I completely understand that, but I don’t share that view. I don’t think it’s the right thing to do. There are other things I would like us to get out of. That’s the trouble with the in/out – it only gives you two options.’ Newspapers interpreted the remarks as a sign that Mr  Cameron had ruled out a vote on the UK’s membership of the EU, while Peter Bone, one of the signatories to the backbenchers’ letter, said it showed that Mr Cameron was ‘on the wrong side of the argument’. Furthermore, Ministers were increasingly worried that Labour leader Ed Miliband might outflank Mr Cameron  by pledging a referendum if Labour won power. Mr Cameron has hardened his stance in an attempt to seize back the initiative. In addition, Mr Cameron faces a growing Election threat from the anti-EU UK Independence Party, which has overtaken the Liberal Democrats in some opinion polls. Worryingly for the PM, many eurosceptic Tory voters are switching to UKIP and its populist leader Nigel Farage. There are also persistent rumours that some Tory MPs could defect to Mr Farage’s party. More than 80 Tory MPs defied Whips to demand a referendum on Europe during a major Commons rebellion last year. Growing election threat: Ross Taylor burns his Conservative membership card at demonstration by  UKIP supporters including the UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured right, at College Green, London . Government insiders say the most likely outcome is a 2015 Tory manifesto pledge seeking approval to renegotiate the terms of British membership of the UK if Mr Cameron wins  the Election. This could see Brussels bureaucrats stripped of their power to decide legal, social and employment rights in this country. Alternatively, he could promise to hold a referendum along the same lines – or offer a straight in/out vote – if he is returned to power. By then, it is possible that  the EU landscape could have changed beyond recognition – and public opinion with it. Greece is already teetering on the edge of leaving the single currency bloc, and there is speculation that Spain, Italy and even France could follow it in the coming years.","Prime Minister undecided if vote should be straight 'in or out' or a question of what powers to grab back .

Hope is fading in the desperate search for two young boys who were torn from their mother’s arms as she tried to walk to safety during the height of Superstorm Sandy on Monday night. Connor and Brandon Moore, aged two and four, were swept away in the rushing storm surge after their mother, Glenda Moore, pulled them out of her SUV and tried to wade through the flood water in Staten Island, New York. Dozens of police divers and firefighters called off their search as darkness fell last night – 48 hours after the brothers disappeared into the storm. Police are searching for two young boys on Staten Island who were reported missing in the aftermath of Sandy, which hit the outer borough particularly hard with flooding . About 20 police officers from the NYPD Scuba Unit have fanned out across a Staten Island marsh on Father Capodanno Boulevard in search of the boys . The Staten Island Advance reports that the NYPD vowed to begin the hunt again at first light on Thursday. Ms . Moore told police her car stalled and she became stranded in the marsh . when the left her home in search of higher ground as the storm worsened.

The openly gay son of a Republican Congressman who refuses to change his stance against same-sex marriage is now speaking out after he had multiple interviews cancelled after he told the bookers that he would not bash his father. Congressman Matt Salmon from Arizona has the constant support of his son, whose name is also Matt Salmon, and now the junior Salmon is speaking out against media outlets who refused him after he told them of his peaceful relationship with his father. 'I had one interview with Lawrence O'Donnell and that one was actually cancelled because they told me they had intended to be critical of him and so since I was unwilling to do so they said that maybe they could find something for me to talk about later on down the road so they cancelled that one,' Salmon told a local news station. 'People want controversy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Venting: Matt Salmon, the gay son of the Republican congressman of the same name, said that certain TV news programs lost interest when he said that he got along well with his father . Denials: Sources at Piers Morgan Live (left) and Lawrence O'Donnell's show (right) have both said that they chose not to book the junior Matt Salmon for other reasons, not because he refused to criticize his dad . The producers at MSNBC, which airs Mr O'Donnell's show, were not the only ones to reportedly drop Mr Salmon after they realized he would not be painting a conflict-ridden relationship. He claimed that a similar situation occurred with the producers at CNN's Piers Morgan Live. 'They seemed very gung-ho about it and then when I was talking about how supportive I was of my father and how I was unwilling to be negative, they seemed to lose interest,' Salmon told KPNX. 'Then all the sudden their show got jammed and they couldn't fit me in.' Both MSNBC and CNN described a different situation when confronted about the sudden cancellation. An MSNBC spokeswoman told Buzzfeed that 'a producer had initial conversations with Matt, like we do with many potential guests every day, but he was never formally booked for the show.'

The relationship between Matt Salmon and his politician father came under scrutiny when the Congressman said that, in spite of a growing number of flips by Republican politicians in support of same-sex marriage, he remains against the equal opportunity move. Congressman Salmon said that even though his son is openly gay and has been for many years, he refuses to support same-sex marriage, saying that he's 'just not there'.

'My son is by far one of the most . important people in my life, I love him more than I could say,' he told . local station 3TV News. 'I don’t believe that this is a lifestyle that he chose. 'It doesn't mean that I don’t have . respect. It doesn't mean that I don’t sympathize with some of the . issues, it just means that I haven't evolved to that station. Rob . Portman apparently has.'

Here, as described in the indictments, organized crime insinuated itself into the waste disposal industry throughout a vast swath of counties in New York and New Jersey, and the tactics they used to exert and maintain their control come right out of the Mafia playbook -- extortion, intimidation, and threats of violence.' Charges against those arrested include racketeering, extortion, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy to transport stolen property.

Uncomfortable: David Cameron, pictured, was questioned on live radio by a cancer-sufferer who asked him to justify why so much money was going on foreign aid . A cancer sufferer yesterday launched a scathing attack on David Cameron for increasing Britain’s foreign aid bill while the NHS fails to fund cancer treatment she desperately needs. The 68-year-old grandmother took the Prime Minister to task over his decision to send £12billion abroad in foreign aid rather than spending it on helping people at home. The woman, who suffers from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, used the name Anna during a radio phone-in and refused to give her real name because some of her family do not know she is ill. She said her chemotherapy had beaten back the cancer, but she proved to be dangerously allergic to the rituximab antibody drug given to her to counter side effects of the treatment. Instead, she needs ofatumumab but said the NHS refuses to fund it. Buying a two-year course of the drug would cost £250,000, completely out of her reach, she said, so her doctors are currently applying to charities in a desperate bid to raise the funds. Anna had been a full-time carer for her retired engineer husband, but they are so ill he has been forced to go into a care home. She is living alone at her home in Finchley, north London, on only £68 per week. The mother of three tearfully challenged Mr Cameron to justify why so much money was going on foreign aid. ‘No foreign aid is being cut, and I’m a cancer victim or patient waiting for treatment that’s not on the National Health, and my local authority, health authority is begging charities for my treatment,’ she said. Scroll down to listen to the interview . ‘Now, I had my last chemotherapy in . May – and it’s a horrible feeling, waking every morning, waiting for . £250,000 when they’re giving billions away abroad. 'It’s not fair. I need . some funding now.’ The Government has pledged to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2013. But the decision to increase aid . spending by 34 per cent to £12billion over four years at a time of . austerity at home has proved massively controversial with both the . public and many Tory MPs. There are huge discrepancies in the quality of care that patients across the UK receive stemming simply from where they live. Among the reasons for this are a lack of funding for some NHS Trusts, lack of qualified medical staff or even certain drugs not made available in certain areas . For example, patients with suspected cancer in parts of England are 60 times more likely to be sent for scans than those living elsewhere, according to a study by the National Cancer Intelligence Network in July. Patients with diseases that are relatively simple to control such as diabetes, arthritis and eye conditions often miss out on the medication they need simply because there is a lack of local resources. Previous findings suggested a stark contrast in the rate of the prescribing anti-dementia drugs, with patients in some parts of the country prescribed 25 times as many treatments and tablets to help 'temporarily improve or stabilise symptoms' than in Kent. One possible reason for such disparities is a lack of awareness on the part of some some local GPs have in spotting Alzheimer's early. In December Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, told GPs that 'the degree of variation is considerable, and unexplained by simple differences in population'. India is still receiving nearly . £300million from British taxpayers in aid, for example, despite the . country being rich enough to launch its own space programme. Mr Cameron, appearing on LBC, said he . would look at her case. But he added: ‘We made a promise as a country to . meet pledges on aid and we’re keeping those promises, and I think . breaking your promises to the poorest people in the world would not be . the right thing to do. ‘The second thing: as I say, I think . we do have a moral obligation to help the poorest in the world... even . when there are difficult times for us. ‘We have not cut spending to the NHS we have increased it. 'We have the cancer drugs fund and we are looking to extend that.’ Later, Anna told the Mail she was . ‘consumed with grief’ because she could not care for her husband, while . her grandchildren were frightened of her wig. She said: ‘I understand what he is . saying, but I would say to him if your family is starving you wouldn’t . go and feed your neighbours. 'He should be looking after people here.’ She added: ‘The doctors have told me I’m a prime candidate for successful treatment.’ Health officials yesterday insisted . that the Cancer Drugs Fund should be able to cover the type of treatment . that Anna needs as the drug ofatumumab, also known as Arzerra, is on . the approved list for the London region. This means it should be approved if a cancer specialist applies on behalf of a patient. A spokesman for NHS North Central . London said last night that it was investigating the case. ‘Our initial . investigations have shown us that we have not had any contact from her,’ he said. Space programme: India's maiden lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 takes off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in 2008 . Last year it was announced Britain would give more than £1billion in aid to India over the next four years, even though it has almost three times as many billionaires as we do. Ministers claimed the decision to hand around £280million a year in taxpayers’ cash to one of the world’s biggest economies would re-energise the relationship with the former colony. However, India is a nuclear power, has its own space programme and is rich enough to donate money to poor African nations each year. India also: . While the Coalition axed aid to economic powerhouse economies such as Russia and China, Department for International Development sources claim India is ‘different’. Despite its immense poverty, India is home to some of the richest people on earth. The wealthiest Indian is Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries and the fourth richest man in the world. But perhaps the best known billionaire in India is Vijay Mallya, the eccentric 55-year-old owner of the United Breweries Group that produces Kingfisher beer and is behind Kingfisher Airlines. He also owns a Formula One team, and one of the world’s biggest private yachts - the 312ft Indian Empress. Sceptics believe much of Britain’s aid is as much about strengthening British trade ties as helping the poor. In a visit last year, David Cameron lobbied hard on behalf of British business. The trip led to a £686million aircraft deal for defence contractor BAE Systems and engine makers Rolls-Royce.

One in every 20 hospital beds are taken up by someone with a smoking-related illness, figures revealed yesterday. Every day 1,260 adults aged 35 and over are admitted to hospital due to smoking, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. It says that between 2010 and 2011 there were 460,000 hospital admissions in England attributable to smoking. Of these, 126,200 had a respiratory disease, representing one in four of all patients with such a condition. Some 160,300 hospital patients had a smoking-related cancer such as lung cancer – more than one in 10 of all cancer admissions. A further 135,400 patients were diagnosed with circulatory diseases such as heart disease. More people tried to kick the habit last year, says the HSCIC. Between 2011 and 2012, 816,000 people set a quit date with the help of NHS Stop Smoking Services, up four per cent on the previous year. Around half were reported as  successful four weeks later, a  similar figure to previous years. Campaigners said the toll of smoking would increase pressure on ministers to follow the lead set by Australia and ban branded packaging of cigarettes. The Government has just concluded its consultation on a proposal for mandatory plain packaging. Almost nine out of 10 cancer patients rate their NHS care as very good or excellent. But almost one in five said they were not being treated with respect when told they had cancer – a rate that is unchanged since the survey was first carried out in 2010. Almost 72,000 people took part last year in the latest National Cancer Patient Experience Survey, which published its results today. Around 94 per cent of patients said they always have enough privacy when being examined or treated, up from 93 per cent, while 83 per cent said they were seen by a hospital doctor quickly compared with 81 per cent. While 88 per cent rated their care as very good or excellent, no comparison can be made with the previous poll as the quality of care was not rated in the same way in 2010. Just 83 per cent said they were ‘sensitively’ told they had cancer. Nine out of 10 said they were given clear answers from health staff, but barely two-thirds felt their families had been given enough information. Some 98 of 158 NHS trusts in England improved their overall scores. More than 150,000 youngsters aged 11 to 15 start smoking each year in the UK. HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: ‘These figures present in stark terms the impact smoking has on people’s health and NHS services.’ Amanda Sandford, research manager at charity Action on Smoking and Health, said ‘Taken together, the statistics on hospital admissions due to smoking and those seeking help to quit show just how much smokers want to quit, yet how hard it is to do so. Smoking is still by far the biggest single cause of preventable illness and premature death. ‘Helping adults to quit should remain a priority of the NHS but we also need to have measures in place such as a ban on the promotional features on cigarette packs if we are to stop the next generation from being hooked.’ Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘By introducing plain tobacco packaging and getting rid of glitzy design and branding, we can reduce the appeal of this deadly product to young people.’ However, Simon Clark, director of the smokers’ group Forest, said almost a quarter of a million people had signed its petition against plain packaging, including those with  concerns about counterfeiting and the sale of illicit tobacco. He said: ‘We support all reasonable attempts to discourage children from smoking, but there is no  evidence to support the claim that plain packaging will prevent children from taking up smoking. ‘Putting cigarettes in standardised packs is tantamount to state- sponsored bullying. ‘It is yet another attempt to  denormalise a legal product and stigmatise those who consume it.'","There were 460,000 hospital admissions in England for illnesses attributed to smoking .

The 21-year-old was on his way to a family birthday party at a pub in his home town of Stroud, Gloucestershire on Friday night when he walked through a subway beneath the road. Two teenagers came up to him, and one said, 'Excuse me blood, you've got something for me,' then demanded his phone. Before and after: Shaun Chapman, 21, was left with horrific injuries after being beaten up for his mobile phone .

It was a rock so oddly shaped that it prompted Nasa to name it after a much loved employee who recently passed away. Now the pyramid shaped 'Jake Matijevic' rock has been the first test of Curiosity's most advanced analysis instruments. The rover used its Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS)for the first time in a bid to find out what the rock was made of. Scroll down for Video . The robotic arm of the Mars rover Curiosity get up close with a pyramid shaped rock on the red planet with its Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer instrument. Nasa named the rock after the late . engineer Jacob Matijevic, who was the surface operations systems chief . engineer for Mars Science Laboratory and the project's Curiosity rover. He passed away on August 20th, at age 64 and was a leading engineer for all of the previous NASA Mars rovers: Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity. After a short drive the preceding day . to get within arm’s reach of the football-size rock, Curiosity put its . Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) instrument in contact with the . rock during the rover’s 46th Martian day, or sol. The APXS is on a . turret at the end of the rover’s 7-foot (2.1-meter) arm. The Mars Hand . Lens Imager (MAHLI), on the same turret, was used for close-up . inspection of the rock (below). The rock has been named 'Jake Matijevic' after a Nasa employee who recently passed away. The space agency has previously renamed the rover's landing site as 'Bradbury Landing' after the late sci-fi author Ray Bradbury. Both instruments were also used on Jake . Matijevic on Sol 47 (Sept. 23). The Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument, which shoots laser pulses at a target from the top of . Curiosity’s mast, also assessed what chemical elements are in the rock. Using both APXS and ChemCam on this rock provides a . cross calibration of the two instruments. With a final ChemCam laser testing of . the rock on Sol 48 (Sept. 24), Curiosity finished its work on Jake . Matijevic. Engineers revealed that the target rock has a relatively smooth, gray surface with some glinty facets reflecting sunlight and reddish dust collecting in recesses in the rock. Jake Matijevic is a dark, apparently uniform rock that was selected as a desirable target because it allowed the science team to compare results of the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) instrument and the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument, both of which provide information about the chemical elements in a target. APXS, like MAHLI, is on the turret at the end of Curiosity's robotic arm. It is placed in contact with a rock to take a reading. ChemCam shoots laser pulses at a target from the top of the rover's mast. Jake Matijevic was also the first rock target for MAHLI, which was deployed to document the APXS and ChemCam analysis areas. The rover departed the same sol, with a drive of about 138 . feet (42 meters), its longest yet. Curiosity landed on Mars seven weeks . ago to begin a two-year mission using 10 instruments to assess whether a . carefully chosen study area inside Gale Crater has ever offered . environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.

Evidence of youngsters including babies being targeted includes pictures of them covered in horrific wounds. Surgeons believe they were caused by nerve gases including one called Agent XV which has been unleashed by the Syrian Army. The civil war in Syria shows now signs of abating, and there are now claims chemical weapons are being used in the conflict . Paris Match, the French weekly magazine, today publishes disturbing pictures of some of the victims, including a boy identified only by his first name of Omar. The 13-year-old saw all his family wiped out in an attack on their home in the city of Homs two months ago, saying that they were hit by ‘A bomb like no other’ which caused ‘yellow smoke’. Omar escaped, but has since suffered all the symptoms of a nerve gas attack, including soars, paralysed limbs, burns and blisters.  He has since been evacuated to Libya, where he is undergoing specialist treatment. Other pictures include one of the hideously deformed hands of Salim, a boy of 11 who was admitted to a Homs hospital in November 2011 suffering from horrific burns. It is claimed that nerve gas has been unleashed by the Syrian Army in the city of Homs . The French media, including Paris Match, today suggested that evidence of the gas attack means a ‘red line had been crossed’, and that western countries were duty bound to intervene in the civil war. It follows William Hague, Britain’s Foreign Secretary, hinting that Britain could start arming rebel fighters in Syria within months. Mr Hague warned this week warned that the conflict was becoming a ‘catastrophic’ humanitarian crisis. He said that millions of pounds worth of armoured vehicles and body armour would be sent to Syrian rebels fighting to depose dictator Bashar al-Assad. And he said Britain was ‘ready to move further’ if the fighting, which has already claimed 70,000 lives, continues to intensify. As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria topped one million, Mr Hague said Britain believed Assad could use chemical weapons against his own people. Exodus: A refugee camp in Turkey, near the Syrian border. The UN says more than a million people have fled the bloody civil war and Syria is now heading for disaster .

Holly Hill believed so strongly that humans are not built to be faithful that she appeared on television and wrote books advocating open relationships. The Australian author claimed that the only healthy way to have a modern relationship was to allow your partner to have sex with other people, and do the same yourself. But after insisting that allowing her boyfriend to cheat three nights a week kept them strong, she now admits it destroyed them. So what changed? Ms Hill became an 'anti monogamist' after an ill-fated fling with a married man in 2006. John* never intended to leave his wife, she revealed, but wanted to sleep with somebody else. After a painful break-up, Ms Hill was determined to use her psychology degree from the University of Southern Queensland to find out why. She came to the conclusion that men were hardwired to need sex from more than one person, and that humans were not made to have exclusive relationships. Ms Hill shared that view with anyone who would listen, and shocked and angered many commentators as she expounded her theories on CNN and Larry King. She wrote a novel, Sugarbabe, about her year-long adventures with older men, and another called Toyboy. But now her dogmatic opinion has completely changed, she told Grazia magazine in an interview. Ms Hill and her ex-boyfriend, Phil*, drew up a contract to determine how they would operate. They vetoed anything they felt would make them jealous - in Ms Hill's case, her partner taking other women on romantic weekends away or buying them gifts. She told CNN in 2010: 'One of the main things that I have learned is that a woman that negotiates infidelity with her partner is far more powerful than a woman who is sitting home wondering why he's late from the office Christmas party. 'It's better to walk the dog on a leash than let it escape through an unseen hole in the back fence.' Miserable: The author admitted she became paranoid about other women, while her boyfriend felt emasculated watching her meet men (posed by models) New romantic: Now Ms Hill says she is looking for love with just one man . But rather than eliminating jealousy, Ms Hill became completely paranoid, shedding two stone in weight and obsessively comparing herself to the other women Phil was seeing. She said: 'I was staggered by the effect our infidelity was having on me. I'd committed myself to the belief that monogamy was outdated and to have to even consider I was wrong was incredibly tough.' Her boyfriend, who had previously enjoyed watching her flirt with other men at parties, now said he felt emasculated by the situation - and last summer they split. 'I was devastated,' said Ms Hill. 'When it was just the two of us our relationship was incredible. But we'd ruined it by being ""unfaithful"" - ironically, the one thing I thought would save our relationship.' The two are still friends abd Ohil is now seeing a woman who isists on monogamy - something Phil says has actually restored his confidence. Ms Hill, too, is dating somebody new, and is feeling optimistic about doing things very differently. 'Finally,' she says, 'I feel like I can see a happy relationship with one man.'","Holly Hill was convinced 'negotiated infidelity' was the only way forward .

Korea earlier made a threat to stage a nuclear attack on the United .

It comes following reports today that North Korea had issued an air raid warning. The warning was issued at . 0032 GMT and carried a message to military units to stand ready, but . the action appeared to be a drill under an air raid scenario, Yonhap . news agency said. An official at South Korea's Unification Ministry , . which handles ties with the North and monitors North Korea's news . broadcasts, confirmed the air raid warning on Thursday morning.

Military: The threat to US bases from North Korean will be a cause for concern in Washington. Here North Korean tank troops take part in military drills . Force: The north's sabre rattling will also lead to increasing anxiety in neighbouring South Korea - which is a close ally of the US . It is extremely rare for KCNA to specify . the day on which Kim attended a drill. It also said that a rocket . defense unit had successfully shot down a target that mimicked an .

Friends of Boris Berezovsky have claimed that the Russian oligarch was strangled to death despite a post-mortem examination suggesting there was no evidence of a struggle. The 67-year-old's body was discovered on the bathroom floor of a £20million Berkshire mansion on Saturday after a bodyguard became concerned and smashed the door open. That member of security staff said he left the house at 10am to run errands which took until 3pm and when he returned he noticed several missed calls on Mr Berezovsky's mobile phone. A pathologist said he died of injuries 'consistent with hanging', but sources suggest that he may have been murdered. British involvement: A senior political figure in Russia has claimed that MI5 or MI6 could have been involved in the death of Boris Berezovsky, pictured with his former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova . Last night, one family friend claimed . Mr Berezovsky’s body showed ‘traces of him being strangled around the . neck’. Nikolay Glushkov, 67, said the tycoon’s former wife noticed marks . on his neck minutes after he was found dead, adding: ‘A scarf was . there. There were traces of him being strangled around the neck.’ Family and friends raced to the . bathroom and saw him lying fully clothed with a scarf by his side. They . said there was no sign of blood. The results of the post-mortem examination came as the storm of controversy surrounding the death raged on. Experts in chemical, biological and . nuclear emergencies also spent hours combing the house amid fears that . Mr Berezovsky could have been poisoned by the Kremlin, but no radiation . was found. Scene: A police car and a police tent are positioned insode the grounds of of late Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky today . Guard: A police van blocks a country lane leading to the oligarch's home this morning as officers comb his home for clues . Secluded: According to those close to the investigation the oligarch left no suicide note at before he was found dead inside a locked bathroom in his home (pictured), with a scarf lying next to him . Another report claimed yesterday that detectives investigating the death did not find a suicide note. Some friends continue to insist Mr . Berezovsky was the victim of a professional hit for speaking out against . Vladimir Putin’s regime. Others believe he killed himself after . becoming depressed over the loss of his wealth and status. The mansion in Ascot where he was found is understood to be owned by his former wife Galina Besharova, 54. Last night her close friend told the . Mail: ‘Galina is very upset about Boris’s death, as are their children. She remained close to Boris after they split up and it was at her house . that he died. Claims: Berezovsky was said to have 'begged' Vladimir Putin to let him return to Russia after they fell out in 2000, and Kremlin insider Sergei Markov (right) has argued British spies may have killed him to protect secrets . ‘She really does not want to talk . about how he died. But there are many ways to induce what may appear to . be a natural death like a heart attack.’ As speculation raged on  yesterday, an . adviser to Putin even claimed Mr Berezovsky may have been killed by . British security services. Using the inflammatory rhetoric of the . Cold War era, Sergei Markov said the tycoon was assassinated because he . knew too much about Western plots to undermine Putin and planned to . trade this knowledge for a return to Russia. Mr Markov, a former Russian . politician, said: ‘I cannot say no to the version that it was a murder . committed by those who were scared Boris Berezovsky would go back to . Putin’s side. Broken: Boris Berezovsky sued former business partner Roman Abramovich for billions of pounds but lost, which those close to him claimed 'destroyed' him . ‘I do not exclude that the secret . services joined this work. I think they may have guessed that Berezovsky . would give away all information, and they decided to get rid of him. ‘In the stock of modern secret . services, there are many things . . . which can provoke a heart attack . and a stroke, and experts will not diagnose it.’  He added: ‘There is no . trust for the British secret services. ‘After their participation in the plot . aimed at occupying Iraq, their role in the plot targeting the leader of . Libya, then  the plot aimed at knocking down the government in Syria, . it is clear that their methods are highly dirty.’ Boris Berezovsky with his ex girlfriend Elena and two children Arina (eight) and Gleb (six). The exiled 67-year-old tycoon was found by his bodyguard at his estate in Ascot on Saturday . Police investigating the death of Mr Berezovsky (pictured here in 2003), one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest opponents, said there is so far no evidence to suggest any third party involvement in his death . Mansion: Police descend on oligarch's multi-million pound home after his body was found . Road block: A forensic investigation unit on a lane close to the scene . Officers specially trained in nuclear materials are searching the house where the oligarch was found dead . Mr Markov denied speculation that a . Russian hit squad could have been sent to kill Mr Berezovsky. ‘After . all, there are civilised politicians in the Kremlin,’ he added. ‘They do . not use the methods of political murders.’ A senior detective said yesterday that there was currently ‘no evidence of third party involvement’ in the death. Mr Berezovsky was thought to be on the . brink of financial ruin after losing a £3billion legal action against . his former business partner, Chelsea football club owner Roman . Abramovich. He had also been facing another court . battle brought by former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova, who had applied to . the High Court to freeze his reported £200million assets. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mr Berezovsky . was one of the most powerful men in Russia and helped choose Putin as . president. However, he emigrated to the UK in 2000 and became one of . Putin’s fiercest critics. He survived a number of assassination attempts, including a bomb in his car which decapitated his chauffeur. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear trained officers searched his multi-million pound home .

A pair of First World War field guns have been dug up after being abandoned 60 years ago in the middle of the 300 square mile army training ground. The 15 pound guns, which are over a hundred years old, were discovered by a group of amateur historians on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. It is thought they were used for target practice by Spitfires in the Second World War after they fell into disuse, and then abandoned. Remarkable discovery: Two First World War field guns were found on Salisbury Plain in the middle of a military training ground . The historians stumbled . upon the two partially buried guns while they were looking for the . wreckage of a Second World War German bomber. After reporting their findings to the Ministry of Defence, the history enthusiasts were given the go-ahead to dig up the guns. One of the guns was recovered and will be restored. The second was deemed unsafe to handle as there was an unexploded artillery shell nearby. The part of the gun which was recovered was the carriage, on which the barrel would have rested. When it was used during the First World War the gun would have been attached to two large wooden wheels so it could be pulled into position before being fired at the enemy. The guns needed crews of up to 12 men to work them and the shells weighed up to 900lb, making firing the field guns a laborious process. Partially buried: A group of amateur historians found the First World War guns while they were looking for the wreckage of a Second World War German bomber . Rare: As the two field guns would have looked in the First World War, resting on two large wooden wheels to manoeuvre them about . A metal maker's plate on one of the guns identified it as being produced in Woolwich in 1910. The recovered gun is now likely to go to a military museum for restoration. Mark Khan, one of the military historians leading the project, said: 'We were hoping to do a crashed aircraft recovery and found out about a possible Ju-188 German plane shot down by a night fighter group in the Second World War.' Piece of history: The field gun will be restored at the Museum of the Royal Artillery in Woolwich, or at the Honourable Artillery Company in London . 'We got a grid reference for the plane on Salisbury Plain but could only find what we think was the impact crater. 'We were a bit dejected and were heading back to our vehicles when we spotted one of the two guns. The second gun was located about 30 feet away, also partially buried. Mr Khan said: 'The second was less intact and more buried than the first one but it also had the maker's plate on, which is very rare.' Identity mark: This metal plate shows that one of the guns was made in Woolich, London over a hundred years ago . 'These guns were the critical link between single cannons and the modern artillery of today.' 'A lot of redundant military equipment was put out on military ranges so they were probably put out there to be used as targets.' The gun will now either go to Firepower, the Museum of the Royal Artillery in Woolwich, or to the Honourable Artillery Company in the City of London.","The 15 pound guns were uncovered in an army training ground in Wiltshire .

The Colombian escort at the center of the  Secret Service scandal has revealed more sordid details of the night President Obama’s men paid her for sex at a hotel. Speaking from Madrid, Spain where she was staying with family, Dania Suarez, 24, said the men were 'stupid brutes' and drinking vodka 'like it was water' in a local bar. A government report published last week told how the . Secret Service agents involved in the Colombian prostitution scandal . paid nine of the 12 women that they took home from the bar that evening to the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena. Scroll down for video . 'I can't help that I'm attractive': Dania Suarez said that the Secret Service agents - one of whom paid her for sex - were not fit to be part of President Obama's security detail . The agents had been in Colombia in preparation for President Obama's trip to the country. Miss Suarez, a single mother of a nine-year-old son, agreed to be interviewed for free to tell her side of the story. She described the men as 'stupid brutes' who chose to party with young women instead of making the President's safety their priority. Dressed in a peach mini-dress and bold necklace, Miss Suarez told Msnbc: 'They liked to show off their bodies, great bodies, well-defined abs... I was surprised that every time he danced with me, he lifted up his sweater so I could see.' The 24-year-old said there was one 'crazy guy' who would jump up on the bar. She also said that the way the men approached her and her friends gave the impression that they had done it before. When asked by the reporter if she . tempted the agents, Miss Suarez burst out laughing and said she could . not be faulted for being attractive but that it was the agents' fault for . 'leaving their duty behind'. Seedy: The U.S. Secret Service agent allegedly took Miss Suarez to his room in Cartagena's Hotel Caribe after agreeing to pay her $800 for sex . One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez. She explained that during the transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash', dinero' to get the point across. She said the pair had 'normal' sex and then the agent fell asleep, giving her ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted from his hotel room - which she did not do. They liked to show off their bodies... I was surprised that every time he . danced with me, he lifted up his sweater so I could see. Dania Suarez, Colombian prostitute . The 24-year-old said the next morning, although the man wanted her to stay, she asked for the money they had agreed upon the previous evening - which was when he became 'very angry'. The agent then gave her $50 and closed the door. Police became involved, setting off a . Secret Service investigation which involved 12 agents, another 12 . members of the military and which overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to . the Summit of the Americas. She described the men as 'completely stupid' and that she didn't know how they had come to be a part of Obama's security team. Bold: Miss Suarez said that the Americans were showing off their bodies to her and her friends and appeared to have past experience when it came to approaching young women . Miss Suarez turned sombre when she . explained that she was not proud of her actions. However, she reportedly . was considering a book deal offered by an American publisher as she has . more details to reveal. Last week, the Secret Service submitted a . detailed report about what exactly happened on the night that a dozen . agents were partying at a bar in Cartagena while in the country to . protect the President. Party: Dania Suarez has said she was swindled by the U.S. agent who agreed to pay her for sex . The report confirms that nine of the . women who went back to the Hotel Caribe with the agents were paid . thought their identities were not publicly revealed. The Washington Post says that the . 24-page report was submitted to the relevant congressional committees . who are investigating the scandal, and those officials will not release . the full extent of their findings. Investigators from the Secret Service . are continuing their hunt for more information about the evening, and so . far they have only spoken with those nine women. They are still looking . to talk to the remaining three women. So far, they have done background . checks on the first nine and have reported that none of them have . connections to terrorist organizations or drug cartels, which was a . major concern at the beginning of the scandal since they had access to . the Secret Service agent's hotel rooms. The women were aged between 20 and 39 years old. In an interview last week, Miss Suarez said she never would have complained about not being paid had she . known the agent was in the American Secret Service. She said she fled the country after . the scandal broke for fear of retribution, and spent time in Dubai with a . person she had met in Cartagena before going to Spain. Suarez said she considers herself an escort, because prostitutes ‘are lower class and live in brothels.’ Revelations: Miss Suarez spoke to a Colombian radio station about the scandal for the first time last week . Taking care of business: Suarez said that she is now willing to sell her story . 'We’re going to use this as a base to . operate from, but we’re also waiting for those statements from the . women,' Congressman Peter King told The Washington Post. Mr King, one of those in charge of the . congressional investigations, said that speaking to the remaining three . women 'will fill in a lot of the gaps'. The report also details the staff ranks of some of the dozen agents involved with the women in Cartagena, Colombia. Two were supervisory criminal investigators, three were snipers, three were part of a counter-assault team. Nine of the 12 agents submitted to polygraph exams, while three chose not to cooperate. One of the three that did not submit . to a test was the man who initially caused the whole fiasco by refusing . to pay his prostitute in full. That man, identified as Arthur Huntington, would not pay the $800 he initially agreed to pay prostitute Diana Suarez. Huntington's wife, Jolie, told . relatives she will ‘make the marriage work’ with Arthur Huntington, her . husband of nearly 20 years. Friends and family of the couple say that he would never have intentionally hurt her. Huntington has left the agency since . the incident earlier this month, but the circumstances of his departure . are unclear. The revelation came as the Secret . Service circulated 'enhanced standards of conduct' from director Mark . Sullivan in response to the prostitution scandal in Colombia. The document instructed employees to 'consider your conduct through the lens of the past several weeks.'

The best individual from the class is also invited to study further at the International Security Academy in Israel. Put through their paces: A trainer dunks the head of one of the would-be bodyguards in the sea . No let up: The woman is then doused in sea water as she comes up for air . In demand: The trainees carry a heavy log on their shoulders as they walk through the sea . With the booming economy in China and increasing wealth sparked by high demand for Chinese goods and materials, demand for bodyguard services had risen dramatically on the Chinese mainland. Graduates of bodyguard courses can look forward to a well-paid career if they are recruited by wealthy businessmen. That is especially the case for women, because they are less visible than their male counterparts and because they can assume roles such as secretary or nanny, they are in high demand. Glamorous: The women, many of them college graduates, line up before the start of the training session. Demand for female bodyguards has risen sharply in China as they booming economy as made wealthy business people look to their own security . Not quite Baywatch: Splashing through the surf, the trainees are driven hard by their instructors . No pain, no gain: This trainee walks over her colleagues' stomachs as they wince in pain . Female bodyguards are often paid far better than male counterparts - up to $100 a day - too because they can adopt different roles. The average annual wage in China is just $1,500. The boom in China has also seen a rise in the growth of wealthy women, who prefer female bodyguards because their presence does not raise questions of potential relationships.

As the news broke the mother-of-four simply wrote 'My mother was murdered. Murdered. This can't be real.' But the next day she tweeted 'My mom, Dawn Hochsprung, was taken tragically from me. But she went down in a blaze of glory that truly represents who she was.' Meanwhile Mrs  Hochsprung's husband has spoken about how his world was shattered in light of her death. Her husband George said that the . initial anger he felt after hearing that his wife confronted Lanzer  has . gone away since he heard from two of the teachers that she helped save.

Traumatic: One of the third grade students said that she recognized Mrs Hochsprung's voice over the intercom, and that she also heard what she believed to be the shooter say 'put your hands up' Dawn 'ran out, and actually tried to subdue the killer. I don't know where that comes from, Dawn was five-foot-two.' Though the specifics of the timeline of events inside the school are still being ironed out by investigators, it is thought that Mrs Hochsprung was the one who may have thought to turn the intercom system on so that the entire school would be immediately alerted to the impending danger.

Dawn's grandchildren and all these children could use the house on the lake and it would be wonderful,' Mr Hochsprung said. 'We built rooms downstairs for kids and it was going to be Dawn's house ultimately, with all the children. And now it's me- I don't think I can do that.'

Fuel prices have skyrocketed across the country, with a gallon of gas reaching past $5.00 in some parts of the country. The price of petrol has been continually climbing for the past 32 days, causing many Americans to spend as much as 10 percent of their income on gas. Experts are puzzled why prices keep ascending, as many drivers tend to shy away from long trips in the winter months due to slick road conditions. Scroll down for video . Sticker shock: Fuel prices are displayed at a gas station in New York today; prices have been on the rise for the past 32 days .

According to AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge report, the national average for a gallon of regular gas is $3.73, up two cents from yesterday. A year ago, the median price was $3.56 per gallon. The escalating cost of fuel comes as many Americans are facing an end to Bush-era tax cuts and are already coping with smaller paychecks and less disposable income. KTLA reports that regular fuel costs $5.09 a gallon, while premium can run up to an eye-watering $5.39 a gallon.

With most non-hybrid vehicles getting between 20-30 miles per gallon and most drivers averaging 29 miles a day, the price spike is worrisome, especially since fuel prices tend to rise during the spring and summer months. The cause of the price hikes is complex – CNN Money reports that it is a ‘confluence of factors, from rising crude oil prices, to production cuts and refinery closings.’ In addition, consumer reports show that the job and housing markets are slowly but surely creeping back to where they were before the recession, meaning the cost of oil has been rising with it.

After 11 fruitless visits to her doctor over three years, Danielle Eccles was beginning to think that her severe earache would never  be cured. Over that time, the 28-year-old, an NHS administration manager, was prone to temporarily losing all hearing in her blocked and swollen right ear, and bouts of 'unbearable' pain that caused her to take time off work. Then, one day, while putting in yet more eardrops as prescribed by the doctor, a ladybird's head fell out of her ear. Painful: After 11 fruitless visits to the doctor, Danielle Eccles, from Essex, eventually discovered that a Ladybird was responsible for the 'unbearable pain' and temporary deafness in her left ear . It was then that she remembered that around the time her symptoms first began with a tickling sensation in August 2009, she was convinced that something had crawled into her ear. Mrs Eccles, who lives with husband Neil, 32, a landscaper, said: 'A few nights earlier I'd felt sure a bug had crawled in my ear and was so relieved when my GP said he couldn't see any insect in there.' This time, however, she was finally referred to hospital, where an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist removed the rest of the perfectly preserved ladybird. Yesterday Mrs Eccles, who is making a formal complaint to the surgery, said: 'It sounds funny but I thought I was going mad. 'It's made my life a nightmare. I just can't believe no one saw it. After all, it must be the brightest, spottiest bug in the UK.' By May 2010 she had already gone back to the surgery six times. 'I kept on getting ear infections and deafness,' she said. Hard to spot: Mrs Eccles said doctors told her they could not see anything in her ear, however when she went to see an ear nose and throat specialist he noticed the insect and removed it . 'At restaurants I had to position myself at the table so my left ear was turned towards people speaking and walking along a road with someone I had to walk to their right so I could hear them properly. 'Neil got fed up having to say everything twice to me. 'Before this I was rarely ill. But I've had to have two lots of time off work because the pain was unbearable and the antibiotics I've had to take ruined my immune system leaving me prone to lots  of colds.' Last year and earlier this year,  she went back to the Elizabeth Courtauld surgery near her home in Halstead, Essex, a further  five times. By that point, doctors had issued Mrs Eccles with a total of 12 prescriptions of earspray, eardrops, antibiotics and painkillers, none  of which managed to solve  the problem. She said: 'One doctor did see something but diagnosed it as a ""glob of wax"". 'It was only in June this year when putting some eardrops in, that the head and jaws of a ladybird fell out of my hand that I recalled the night I believed the insect had crawled in.' Mrs Eccles took the beetle's head to show her GP, who finally referred her to an ENT consultant. Creepy crawly: Mrs Eccles remembered that her symptoms first began with a tickling sensation in August 2009, she was convinced that something had crawled into her ear . She said: 'Waiting six weeks for the appointment was difficult as by then the deafness and discomfort in that ear was getting worse.' However, within five minutes the consultant had removed the insect's body. Mrs Eccles said: 'We could clearly see from its spots it was a ladybird. I was instantly able to hear again and that was such a relief. 'But I feel angry. I was made to feel I was making a fuss about nothing and feel I should have been referred to a specialist much earlier.' Dr Azhar Shaida, a consultant ENT surgeon from The Harley St ENT Clinic, said: 'It would appear the ladybird was hiding behind some wax. 'A GP surgery does not possess the same level of equipment that an ENT specialist department has, so it appears when doctors looked into the ear, all they saw was wax. 'Because the insect body was encased in wax, it would have stopped the air getting to it so it wouldn't have degraded.'","Danielle Eccles visited doctor 11 times to try and cure unbearable ear pain .

A perverted ‘healer’ who told women their ‘sexual energy points’ were blocked then molested them was jailed for 16 years yesterday. Michael Ireland, 60, claimed to be skilled at a host of alternative therapies including Reiki, a Japanese form of hands-on treatment. Over a quarter of a century, the charismatic conman targeted a string of vulnerable women and girls, telling them he would help them with ‘special healing’ which could be carried out only when no one else was around. Predator: Michael Ireland, left, toured churches targeting women. Victim Joanne Mulholland, right, put her trust in the 'healer' Last night one of his victims waived her right to anonymity and told the Daily Mail of her terror as Ireland sexually assaulted her during therapy for a painful back. Divorcee Joanne Mulholland, 41, said: ‘I was devastated. I felt angry and terribly betrayed. I had trusted him as a professional and yet he took advantage of me in the worst possible way.’ Ireland, from Stockport, initially denied all allegations against him. But in January, as his trial was due to begin at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, he pleaded guilty to 25 offences including indecent assault and sexual activity with a child committed against eight victims over a 25-year period. Yesterday several were in court with their families. One woman left in tears as the catalogue of abuse was spelt out. The court heard that Ireland told one woman her problem was that her breasts and vagina were ‘dead’ and he could help by activating them. Another was instructed to touch him intimately to get her ‘energy flowing’ again. One ‘patient’ – a 15-year-old girl – took an overdose to gain ‘respite’ from his abuse.Ireland toured spiritualist churches offering therapies ranging from Reiki – in which he claimed to be a master – to chakra balancing and crystal healing at £15 a session. On his website, he also proclaimed himself a clairvoyant giving regular demonstrations of mediumship as well as an adept shamanic healer. Final admission: Ireland consistently denied wrongdoing until the day of his scheduled trial at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court when he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing eight women over 25 years . The site failed to mention his conviction for indecently assaulting a girl aged under 14 when he was a teenager. Mrs Mulholland, a mother of three and IT graduate, first saw Ireland in October 2009 after he offered to cure her back pain. ‘He said to reach my back he needed . to feel inside me,’ she said. ‘I felt my heart thumping because I knew . it wasn’t right. Yet, as I lay there on my own on the healing couch I . felt incredibly vulnerable. I couldn’t wait to leave.’ Ireland told Miss Mulholland, from Bolton, that the reason she was in so much pain was because of an ‘energy blockage’. ‘It sounds naive but when he said he . was freeing one blockage and his hands wandered inside my bra, I told . myself it was necessary,’ she said. ‘But when on the fourth visit he put . his hands inside my pants, I never went back.’ Ireland would tell women . ‘conventional Reiki will not work but I have a method a little bit . controversial’, prosecutor Darren Preston said. On another occasion he told a woman – . who had considered him a ‘mentor’ – that he needed to blow into her . mouth to ‘rid her demons’. Another victim, aged 39, met Ireland . at a spiritualist church where he ‘scanned’ her body before suggesting . he came to his flat for regular sessions. He told her that her chakra . points were broken but could be released through his touch. Ireland – who sometimes stripped . naked – also told her that he was impotent, took her hand and put it . inside his trousers, telling her it would ‘get the energy flowing’. Ireland, described by victims as a . ‘very strong powerful person’ who had a ‘presence’, was arrested last . July after victims eventually went to police. Jailing him, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar . said many of his victims had lost confidence and blamed themselves for . being ‘gullible and naïve’. Afterwards one of them said: ‘I’m . glad that he can’t do it to anybody else. It’s been a living nightmare . and I’ve not had any sort of life since it happened.’ Another said she had been unable to work since the abuse. ‘I don’t go out of the house, I have flashbacks and panic attacks.’","Michael Ireland, from Stockport, targeted women over a 25-year period .

For one family, this former mortuary chapel surrounded by crumbling headstones and eerie gargoyles is home 365 days of the year. Unperturbed by its spooky statues and proximity to ancient graves, Jayne Stead and her partner Mike Blatchford fell in love with the one-time cemetery keeper's lodge in Southampton, and set about turning it into a home for themselves and their three children. 'Spookiest house in the city': Mike Blatchford and Jayne Stead at home in the former cemetery keeper's lodge with their children (l-r) William, 13, Florence, 15, and Joe, 17 . Eerie: The former cemetery keeper's lodge and chapel in Southampton is home to Jayne, Mike and their three children . Designer Ms Stead admits the couple's decision to move into the former Jewish mortuary chapel - which dates back to the 1800s - raised some eyebrows among their more superstitious friends, but insisted the house has 'a nice feeling'. With the creepiest holiday in the calendar fast approaching, the family has invited local schoolchildren to trick-or-treat at the old chapel this Halloween. Ms Stead said she suspected youngsters have been too afraid to venture down the path leading to the spooky Grade II listed building in previous years. 'We've had plenty of Halloween parties because the house is the perfect venue, but nobody has ventured down here for trick-or-treating before,' she said. 'We are the spookiest house in the city after all.' Atmospheric: Ms Stead said trick-or-treaters have been too afraid to venture down the path to the historic chapel on previous Halloweens . Creepy: The family's living room once housed a mortuary . 'Homely': The couple fell in love with the former chapel and cemetery keeper's lodge and spent £100,000 transforming it into a family home . Modern: Victorian urinals and a tatty storage shed in the ramshackle building became a modern kitchen . While the 52-year-old said she had never seen a ghost in her time in the chapel - which is also home to the couple's children Joe, 17, . Florence, 15, and 13-year-old William - she admitted there have been . some strange occurrences in the living room - once the mortuary. 'The cemetery didn't put us off...we don't spook easily' Jayne Stead . 'I’ve been sitting on my own in the living room and I’ve felt like there was someone standing behind me a few times,' Ms Stead said. 'I’ve also found the dog barking at nothing in the corner of the room, but it’s not scary. 'Mike’s aunt is a medium and when she came to visit us for the first time she the place had a really nice feeling about it.' 'We don't spook easily': The house is the perfect venue for a Halloween party, its owners say . Jayne and self-employed builder Mike, 51, bought the property six years ago when it was put on the market by the council. 'I’ve always loved broken down cottages,' Ms Stead said. 'When we saw this it just seemed perfect. 'It was one of those opportunities where you have to make a snap decision to go for it or not go for it.'The cemetery didn’t put us off. We don’t spook easily, in fact I love watching scary films and television shows. 'When we first had a look around it was really run down, there were graves everywhere but it never really felt scary, there was very nice feeling about the place,' she said. Despite their affection for the old mortuary chapel, Ms Stead admits they rented out their old house rather than selling it to ensure the family had a back-up plan. 'That way if it all went horribly wrong we could move back home,' she said. 'Nobody really knows what it’s going to be like living in a graveyard.' Builder Mr Blatchford spent a year and £100,000 turning the ramshackle property into the family's dream home. The Victorian urinals and tatty storage shed were transformed in to a beautiful, modern kitchen, while the chapel, built in 1845, became the dining room. The old cemetery keeper’s lodge now houses bedrooms, bathrooms, and a playroom. Family home: The historic building has been given a new lease of life by the family, who say its location in a cemetery 'didn't put us off' Ghostly: The family can see headstones and statues when they peer out of the mullioned windows . The interior may have been transformed, but from the outside the building appears to have changed little since its days as a mortuary chapel and cemetery keeper's lodge, with original features including the mullioned windows and gargoyles retained. 'You get people peering in to the windows of the chapel and when they see us watching television they jump a million miles,' said Ms Stead. 'It may be covered in gargoyles and we may be surrounded by graves but on the inside it just looks like a normal house. 'A lot of visitors were wary at first and thought it was spooky but after a while, like us, they forget they’re in a cemetery. 'It's a very homely place.'","The former cemetery keeper's lodge in Southampton is surrounded by crumbling headstones and spooky statues .

It is unclear whether the attack will disrupt the group's operations there because of safety concerns. Peshawar is located on the border of the tribal region - the Taliban's main sanctuary in the country - and has been hit by scores of bombings in recent years. The Taliban has been waging a bloody insurgency against the government in an attempt to establish an Islamic state and end Pakistan's cooperation with the United States in fighting militancy. The militant group withdrew an offer of holding peace talks with the Pakistani government this week, saying officials did not seem serious about sitting down at the negotiation table despite comments to the contrary.

Once one of the richest and most powerful figures in Hollywood, Merv Adelson has been taken to court by his third wife over unpaid child support. Adelson, 83, was once worth $300 million after his TV production company Lorimar has a run of massive hits in the 1980s including The Waltons, Dallas and Knots Landing. At the height of his success he married Barbara Walters in 1986, but the marriage suffered from their careers being based on different coasts and they divorced in 1992. Former TV hotshot Merv Adelson, 83, is being sued for unpaid child maintenance by his third wife Thea who is more than 30 years his junior . Power couple: Entertainment executive Merv Adelson and TV journalist Barbara Walters pictured in 1989 during their six year marriage . Adelson had already started a relationship with his third wife Thea, more than 30 years his junior, while still married to Walters. They have two daughters together. By the late 90s he had moved from film and TV to investing in internet start-ups but lost most of his fortune when the internet bubble famously burst in 2000. Thea, a lawyer, asked for a divorce in 2003. She got the beach house in Malibu while Adelson now lives in a tiny 500 sq ft studio apartment in Santa Monica. Adelson, whose properties had once included a ranch in Aspen, recently told Vanity Fair that the thing he misses most about his former opulent lifestyle is his jet. Adelson appeared before an LA court on Monday over unpaid child support. He is asking for the court to reduce his monthly child support payments from $20,000 to $2,137. ‘Thea’s asking for bigger payments on . arrears,’ Adelson’s lawyer Robert L. Schibel told the New York Post. ‘She’s asking for 100 percent of what he has coming in.’ Adelson's TV production company Lorimar had a string of hits in the 1980s including the era-defining show Dallas . Walters and Adelson, pictured in 1987, met in 1985 after a mutual friend arranged a blind date . He claims to have a small income from consulting for Time Warner, which purchased his production company.

'Would things have worked out differently for Merv if we had stayed together? I don’t know. Probably not I have no regrets.' His next court date is scheduled for May 16.

When pretty Abigail Barragry plummeted 100ft from a balcony, doctors didn’t expect her to survive. Abigail, . 30, faced death after breaking virtually every bone in her body after . falling eight floors from the apartment in Malaysia. And medics warned . her devastated family that even if miraculously she pulled through, she . might never walk. Yet . today – following four months in hospital and 13 operations, Abigail, . from Sheffield, says the terrifying incident has changed her life for . the better. By day, psychology graduate Abigail Barragry worked as an arts therapist with children with special needs. By night she loved to indulge in the vibrant nightlife in Kualar Lumpar, Malaysia . She admits 'Before I had my fall, I was a perfectionist over my looks. I spent hours choosing exactly the right clothes, getting ready to go out and exercised five days a week in the gym.' Abigail fell from the top floor of this tower block in Kuala Lumpur . And incredibly, she credits the . accident – which she believes was a twist of fate – for meeting the love . of her life, surveyor James Coupe, 30. 'Before . I had my fall, I was a perfectionist over my looks,' says Abigail who . now manages to limp with a stick, 'I spent hours choosing exactly the . right clothes, getting ready to go out and exercised five days a week in . the gym. 'Now, . inside my body I have four plates, a screw and a foot long metal rod. I . have scars all over my body and will never be physically able as I used . to be. But having my fall has put my life in perspective and incredibly . I have never been happier in myself. 'I feel so lucky to be alive. If I . hadn’t had this freak accident, James and I never would have met.  We . never stop making one another smile and every day I feel lucky to be . alive.' Abigail’s life was . turned upside down on New Year’s Day 2011. The psychology graduate was . working as an arts therapist with children with special needs at a . centre in Kualar Lumpar, Malaysia. She . recalls: “It was 2am in the morning and I’d been partying, seeing in . the New Year with a few drinks with friends. I felt dizzy and ran out of . the apartment onto the balcony. 'All . I wanted was some fresh air but as I reached the balcony, I slipped in . my heels and the next thing I knew I found myself hanging over the . balcony, my hands gripping the rail. Even now I don’t know exactly how I . got there.' For a terrifying few seconds, she felt the world had stopped. Abigail slipped over the railing of her balcony at 2am on New Year's Day last year . She broke virtually every bone in her body and spent four months in hospital undergoing 13 operations . Miss Barragry has been left with four plates, a screw and a foot long metal rod in her body . 'Everything . seemed to happen in slow motion,' she says, 'I remember looking up at . my hands and feeling sheer fleeting panic as I realised they were . gripping the balcony but my body was hanging over the edge. 'Then I saw my hands slipping, It was as if they were not my hands and I realised I was going to fall.'I . later discovered I’d fallen through two canopies and a satellite dish . on the way down. The next thing I remember is waking up on the ground in . the grass. I was lying on my back and passers by were standing over me. 'I couldn’t seem to see their faces. But the last thing I recall is saying to them that my legs hurt before I . was engulfed with pain and passed out.' Abigail . came round as she was being wheeled into hospital. 'The pain was . overwhelming, just indescribable. A friend was at my side and I was . begging him not to leave me. I truly felt I was going to die.' In . fact, Abigail’s condition was so critical that it took surgeons ten . hours in the operating theatre to stabilise her condition. When pretty Abigail Barragry plummeted 100ft from a balcony, doctors didn?t expect her to survive . Because she didn¿t have health insurance, her dad Antony, 60, a business director, shelled out £40,000 savings to pay for treatment. 'My . beloved black satin evening dress was cut off me. I had so many life . threatening injuries that it’s a miracle my body didn’t just go into . shock,' she says, 'My pelvis was cracked in two places, my broken jaw . was wired, my right wrist was crushed and doctors believed they might . have to amputate my right leg. I was in the worse pain I imagined could . exist.' The next two weeks passed as a blur . as Abigail fought for her life in intensive care. Days and nights . rolled into one as she lapsed in an out of a coma. Because she didn’t . have health insurance, her dad . Antony, . 60, a business director, shelled out £40,000 savings to pay for . treatment. Meanwhile mum Pamela, 65, a secretary got on the first flight . available to be with her daughter. Miss Barragry fell through two canopies and a satellite dish during her 100ft fall . Says . Abigail whose parents are divorced but who both spent days and nights . by their daughter's bedside, 'It was the first time I’d seen my dad cry. I went from living and working my dream to fighting for my life. 'Lying in my hospital bed unable to even lift a glass or wipe my own face I wondered if I had actually died and this was hell.' Worse . was to come when doctors explained she could lose her right leg and she . would probably spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. 'Landing . on a grass area had saved my life,” she explains, “but the bone in my . right leg had shattered on impact and dirt had got into it causing a . nasty infection. It meant whole sections of the bone had to be removed . and my leg held together in a metal case to try to hold it together.' After . four months in the Malaysian hospital she was finally discharged in a . wheelchair but decided to come home to the UK with her mum. 'I . needed so much help.  I’d lost over over a stone in weight and was so . frail. At the same time, I needed further treatment and it seemed . easiest to get it in the UK.' Against all the odds Abigail’s leg was saved. But her legs were so badly damaged she could only get around in a wheelchair. 'It . was a terrible time,' she says, 'when I had my fall I’d been seeing . someone but although he was very supportive at the time, what happened . pushed us apart and we finished. I remember thinking that no-one would . want me – someone who is so scarred and in constant pain.' But despite this, she didn’t give up. 'I . was determined to get better. I told myself I still had all my limbs . and I would walk again. I read book after book on pain management and . underwent intense physiotherapy. Doctors said my wrist was so badly . injured I would never write again but I forced myself to use a . computer.' Her determination paid off and gradually Abigail was able to haul herself out of a wheelchair and walk using crutches. Abigail met surveyor James Coupe 11 months after her accident, after a mutual friend introduced them . And in November 2011 – after being persuaded to go to a local pub for a drink - she met James. 'A mutual friend introduced us and I thought he was gorgeous. We clicked straightway.' After talking online for a few days, she was thrilled when James asked her out for a drink. 'I felt incredibly nervous,” she admits, “but he never saw me as the ‘patient’ only as the positive person I still am.  I did wonder if he’d be put off by my terrible scars but he simply doesn’t seem to see them. 'We never stop making each other smile and laugh – he’s my soulmate.' Although she faces further surgery to her leg, she believes her near death experience has had a positive effect on her life. 'If you’d told me I’d be happy with all these scars I’d never have believed it,' she says, 'Of course what happened was terrible. But I’ve found joy in the smallest achievements and a new appreciation of how fantastic it is to be alive. 'I am thrilled I can now wash my own hair and make a cup of tea. I am so fortunate I still have my brain in tact and can use that to do anything I want. No I can’t have the life I once had but I can have a more fulfilling one with all that I have learned. 'I’ve been to hell and back but this has made me stronger because I know nothing can ever be as bad or bring me down.' Abigail now intends to go back to work and hopes one day to return to Malaysia. She says: “Before this ripped my life apart I was about to do more studying in counselling and psychology. What’s happened has fuelled my ambition to continue with this to help others. I want to create something really positive from this nightmare.' She hopes telling her story will make others aware of the dangers balconies abroad pose – often they are built much lower than regulations allow in the UK. Last year alone more than a dozen Brits fell from hotel balconies abroad. Meanwhile she is about to go on her first holiday with James to Spain.  “I never thought I’d ever be well enough to go anywhere let alone go somewhere without a wheelchair. But recently after 16 gruelling months I finally had my metal case taken of my leg and now I can’t wait to swim in a pool.”She is excited about the future. 'Even the best laid plans can’t stop freak accidents,' she says, 'I will never be the same again but I’m not going to let what happened stop me from doing anything. 'But it wasn’t my fate to die and it’s knowing that which has spurred me on to make the most of living.'","Abigail Barragry fell from the balcony of her apt in Kuala Lumpur while partying on New Year's eve .

To make a nomination, fill in the coupon below. Here, ALISON SMITH-SQUIRE tells one nominee's story. Cradling their longed-for twins should have been the most joyous moment for Julia and Tony Rees. But Oliver and Maisie were born just 23 weeks into Julia’s pregnancy — too premature to survive. They died five hours later in their parents’ arms. Dream come true: After multiple miscarriages, Julia and Tony Rees now have a daughter, Ruby . Just a year earlier, Julia had miscarried twin boys at 17 weeks. In fact, Oliver and Maisie were the seventh and eighth babies the couple had lost after ten cycles of IVF over eight years. ‘The emptiness we felt, the loss, was indescribably painful,’ recalls Julia, 38, from Caerphilly in Wales. ‘We’d given up almost any hope of ever having a baby.’ When Julia, a former customer services assistant, became pregnant again, their happiness was tempered with anxiety about whether their hopes would be dashed again. It was all so overwhelming that at an 11-week antenatal check, Julia broke down in tears. The doctor doing the scan was Dr Bryan Beattie, consultant in foetal medicine at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. ‘He looked at my medical history and said he would personally ensure this time we’d go home with a baby,’ recalls Julia. ‘There was something about the way he talked, the way he took control and spoke in such a positive way  that made me feel for the first time there was a chance things would be all right. ‘Unlike other doctors, who passed us to one of their huge teams, Bryan was always personally available. He even did my scans himself.’ Health hero: Dr Beattie gave the parents hope and support . Dr Beattie arranged for Julia to be one of the first women in the UK to have the cutting-edge foetal fibronectin test to warn of premature labour. The couple could text him ‘about even the smallest worry’. ‘How many patients can text their busy consultant day or night and know they will always get a text back?’ asks Julia. Julia and her husband Tony, 47, an engineer, have no doubt that if it hadn’t been for Dr Beattie, they would not be the thrilled parents of Ruby, now two. ‘When you desperately want a child and your hopes are raised, then so cruelly dashed, you just can’t describe what meeting a specialist like Bryan means,’ says Julia. Julia suffered the first of her miscarriages in 2002. The pregnancy was ectopic — where the foetus develops in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. The embryo and both Julia’s fallopian tubes had to be removed. After eight heartbreaking miscarriages, having spent close to £80,000 on IVF cycles, the couple decided to have one last attempt. ‘We simply couldn’t afford more emotionally or financially,’ says Julia. With Dr Beattie’s help, Ruby was born naturally at 37 weeks in December 2010. The labour lasted just an hour-and-a-half and she weighed a healthy 7lb 3oz. ‘The moment she was placed in my arms and looked up at me will stay with Tony and me for ever,’ says Julia. ‘Even now we pinch ourselves — we can hardly believe we have such a gorgeous little girl.’ Luan Pessall, 38, a clinical psychologist from Cardiff, was also referred to Dr Beattie after previously miscarrying twins. During her second pregnancy, again with twins, she went into labour at just 33 weeks. ‘Bryan was on holiday when I sent him a text at 6am,’ Luan says. ‘Despite being hundreds of miles away, he rang the hospital to make sure two intensive-care cots were available and that they knew it had to be an emergency caesarean.’ Luan is now expecting a third baby. ‘I would never have gone ahead with another pregnancy if I couldn’t count on Bryan’s care.’ Dr Beattie recently set up a charity running free events about fertility and antenatal care, and he’s campaigning for the foetal fibronectin test to be introduced into routine antenatal care from 22 weeks. ‘Premature birth accounts for  40 per cent of baby deaths. This test could not only save the lives of tiny babies but save millions of pounds, too,’ he says. Dr Beattie has also campaigned for a blood test for Down’s syndrome at ten weeks and screening for group B streptococcus, a common bacteria that can cause a baby’s death. ‘As a dad myself, I’ve always felt being able to have children is a gift. I am driven by the joy I know my patients realise when they have a healthy baby,’ says Dr Beattie, a father-of-three. ‘At the same time, obstetrics sometimes involves heartbreaking decisions for parents-to-be. I want to make sure that even when there has been a bad outcome, they know that somebody cares.’","Julia Rees thought she'd never be a mother after multiple miscarriages .

RSPCA inspector Lorna Campbell was . called to the property by a concerned member of the public and said she . thought she could see a chewed-up dog toy through the window - but soon . realised it was the remains of Nala. Potts was today sentenced to 18 weeks . in prison at Buxton Magistrates' Courts after admitting causing . unnecessary suffering to the two dogs under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 . at an earlier hearing.

Nala and Simba becoming dehydrated and emaciated, for more than four . weeks between February 29 and March 31, at an address in Furness Vale, . Derbyshire. Horrific: Shane Maurice Potts, 29, left the animals in appalling conditions at a property in Furness Vale, Derbyshire, pictured .

It's brought stories of some bizarre finds - from the reunion of a boy and his football washed up on a uninhabited island to the discovery of a Harley-Davidson. And more could be coming thick and fast in the coming months as scientists are now saying the wreckage washed into the sea from the Japanese tsunami will reach North American shores far sooner than previously thought. The latest computer models estimate that thousands of tonnes of the debris, which now stretches 4,000 nautical miles across the north Pacific, will start washing up this October and continue to do so into late 2013. On fast tides: The latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris, shown here in a graphic interpretation of a NASA satellite image, from the Japanese tsunami will hit North American shores far sooner than expected . Devastation: The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan in March last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris, including boats, cars and part of houses and factories into the Pacific . A new satellite image from NASA's Earth observatory shows the marauding mass sprawled across the ocean's surface. Around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses, factories, cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan in March last year. While heavy items sank, at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys, oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500-mile journey to North America. Projections made earlier this year by the International Pacific Research Centre (IPRC), in Honolulu, Hawaii, suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between March 2013 and March 2014. Bizarre find: This Harley-Davidson was found on a remote beach on the west coast of British Columbia last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year . Stunned: The owner of the Harley, Ikuo Yokoyama (left), said the discovery by Peter Mark (right) was a miracle . Must have been a wild ride: This motorbike was also found by Peter Mark on Graham Island, western Canada . Journey: The container holding the items travelled 5,000km from Miyagi prefecture in Japan where the Tsunami struck all the way to the coasts of B.C. But predictions from the Japanese . government and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . (NOAA) has now pushed that date forward to October this year, according . to a report in The Guardian. Indeed, many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last November. Last month, a Japanese teenager who lost his home in last year's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote Alaskan beach 3,500 miles from Japan. Misaki Murakami, 16, came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by American radar technician David Baxter on Middleton Island. Mr Baxter, who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing, now plans to travel with his wife Yumi across the Pacific to return the ball. Can I have my ball back, please?! Japanese teenager Misaki Murakami (left) told of his delight after his football was found by David Baxter (right) on an Alaskan beach. Mr Baxter's wife (pictured) also found a volleyball . Drift: The sports balls were found on Middleton Island, about 70 miles from mainland Alaska . And yesterday, the Japanese owner of a . Harley-Davidson motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the . West Coast of British Columbia last week was a miracle. The owner, Ikuo Yokoyama, a 29-year-old resident of the town of Yamamoto, in Miyagi Prefecture, was tracked down by a Harley-Davidson representative in Japan who saw the story, first reported by CBC News, the broadcaster reported today. Peter Mark, was combing the beach on Haida Gwaii islands when he made the discovery.

A man accused of shooting dead three people at a party near Auburn University turned himself in tonight following a manhunt. Desmonte Leonard, 22, handed himself over to authorities at a Montgomery courthouse at 7.50 pm after his family contacted attorney Susan James for help. The lawyer contacted U.S. Marshals before going to pick up Leonard. She would not reveal the exact location of the meeting but said it was around 50 miles outside of Montgomery, Alabama. She said: 'He was very calm, very tired and very ready to get this over with and very respectful.' Scroll down for video . All over: Desmonte Leonard, wanted for triple murder, handed himself in to a courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama . She said they had time to talk while . driving to Montgomery and added: 'When the full story is told, it may . sound different than the perception now.' Ms James said she had not been retained to represent the young man. Leonard, 22, is charged with three . counts of capital murder after a shooting at a party on Saturday night . following a fight over a woman. He is accused of wounding three . others. The dead included two former Auburn football players and a . current player was among the injured. Auburn football coach Gene Chizik said: 'I've . got a team of 120-some-odd players right now that are really just . trying to navigate what is a lot of questions that aren't answered. 'We're trying to do that as a coaching staff and I think the entire Auburn community is trying to do the same thing.' Response: Police and firemen were stationed outside the house in anticipation of Leonard's arrest - although hours later it was discovered he had already fled . Police surrounded a house in Montgomery on Monday afternoon thinking that Leonard was inside after they received two solid tips. They swarmed a home with tear gas, spy gear and assault rifles but after a tense, nine-hour search, they discovered Leonard had fled by the time they arrived. At one point, they believed they heard movement and coughing in the attic but the search turned up nothing. Believing Leonard was hiding in the attic, officers fired tear gas into the rafters and poked through insulation. But after midnight, they acknowledged they hadn't heard those noises for several hours. Officials said officers found nothing in the attic - not even an animal that might have fooled detection devices. Victims: Former Auburn football players Ed . Christian, left, and LaDarius Phillips, right,  were killed in the . shooting in a tragedy that has shocked the university . Shots fired: The shooting took place at University Heights, an off-campus housing complex for Auburn University . After police left, at least two holes . were visible in the ceiling and the floor was littered with pieces of . drywall and insulation. Leonard had a connection . to the house through someone other than the owner, said the city's . public safety director, Chris Murphy. He declined to elaborate. The . woman is not accused of any wrongdoing. Earlier on Monday police said they had arrested two men accused of hampering the search. Jeremy S. Thomas, 18, of . Montgomery was charged with hindering prosecution after he fled the . scene of the shooting with Leonard. Records show Thomas was free on bond . at the time of the Auburn shootings while awaiting a manslaughter trial . set to begin June 18 in last year's shooting death of a teenager. Gabriel . Thomas, 41, was also charged with hindering prosecution after having . contact with Leonard after the shooting and providing false information . to officers. The dead included former Auburn players Edward Christian, who had to quit the team because of a lingering back injury, and Ladarious Phillips, who was transferring from Auburn to Jacksonville State University to play football. The other person killed was Demario Pitts, 20. Of the three people who were wounded, current Auburn football player Eric Mack and Xavier Moss were both treated and released from a hospital. The third, John Robertson, remained in critical condition after being shot in the head. A witness who identified himself as a friend of Mr Pitts said he didn't know the man who pulled out a gun and began firing into the crowd following a dispute over a woman. 'I ain't never seen him a day of my life,' said Turquorius Vines, 23, who wasn't injured. Police and detectives gather outside the property where three people are believed to have been killed and two seriously injured . Residents have been prevented from leaving or entering the complex until police have made further investigations . Police have arrested Leonard on two previous charges involving guns. Court records show Montgomery police arrested Leonard in 2008 on a charge of carrying a pistol without a license, after stopping a suspected stolen vehicle and finding him inside. Documents available online didn't show whether the case was ever resolved, but Leonard was freed on bond within days. Leonard was charged in 2009 with assault after a man was shot in the groin, but prosecutors dropped the case after the victim told authorities Leonard wasn't the shooter. A Montgomery woman filed a paternity suit against Leonard on Friday that identified him as the father of a girl who turned one last month. Another woman sued him in 2009 seeking unpaid child support for a girl who is now four. A court ordered monthly payments of $305 by Leonard, who records show was working at a Walmart store at the time. Auburn police said the shootings did not appear to have anything to do with some of the victims being former or current players on the football team, which won the national championship in 2010.","Desmonte Leonard, 22, handed himself over to police after his family contacted an attorney .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:03 EST, 6 October 2011 . American militants like Anwar al-Awlaki are placed on a kill or capture list by a secretive panel of senior government aides, Reuters revealed today. Once the panel adds a terror suspect to its list it then informs the president, White House officials told Reuters. There is no public record of the operations or decisions of the panel, which is a subset of the White House's National Security Council. Neither is there any law establishing its existence or setting out the rules by which it is supposed to operate. Targeted: Anwar al-Awlaki is believed to be the first American-born person to be placed on the super-secret kill list, though there is no firm way to confirm because so much of the panel is shrouded in secrecy . The panel was behind the decision to add . Awlaki, a U.S.-born militant preacher with alleged al Qaeda . connections, to the target list. He was killed by a CIA drone strike in . Yemen late last month. The role of the president in ordering or ratifying a decision to target a citizen is fuzzy. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor declined to discuss anything about the process. Current and former officials said that to the best of their knowledge, Awlaki, who the White House said was a key figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, had been the only American put on a government list targeting people for capture or death due to their alleged involvement with militants. The White House is portraying the killing of Awlaki as a demonstration of President Barack Obama's toughness toward militants who threaten the United States. But the process that led to Awlaki's killing has drawn fierce criticism from both the political left and right. In an ironic turn, Obama, who ran for president denouncing predecessor George W. Bush's expansive use of executive power in his 'war on terrorism,' is being attacked in some quarters for using similar tactics. They include secret legal justifications and undisclosed intelligence assessments. Liberals criticized the drone attack on an American citizen as extra-judicial murder. Conservatives criticized Obama for refusing to release a Justice Department legal opinion that reportedly justified killing Awlaki. They accuse Obama of hypocrisy, noting his administration insisted on publishing Bush-era administration legal memos justifying the use of interrogation techniques many equate with torture, but refused to make public its rationale for killing a citizen without due process. Some details about how the administration went about targeting Awlaki emerged on Tuesday when the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, was asked by reporters about the killing. The process involves 'going through the National Security Council, then it eventually goes to the president, but the National Security Council does the investigation, they have lawyers, they review, they look at the situation, you have input from the military, and also, we make sure that we follow international law,' Ruppersberger said. Other officials said the role of the president in the process was murkier than what Ruppersberger described. They said targeting recommendations are drawn up by a committee of mid-level National Security Council and agency officials. Their recommendations are then sent to the panel of NSC 'principals,' meaning Cabinet secretaries and intelligence unit chiefs, for approval. The panel of principals could have different memberships when considering different operational issues, they said. The officials insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive information. They confirmed that lawyers, including those in the Justice Department, were consulted before Awlaki's name was added to the target list. Making it public: President Obama announced the death of al-Awlaki at the retirement ceremony for Admiral Mike Mullen in Arlington, Virginia . Two principal legal theories were advanced, an official said: first, that the actions were permitted by Congress when it authorized the use of military forces against militants in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001; and they are permitted under international law if a country is defending itself. Several officials said that when Awlaki became the first American put on the target list, Obama was not required personally to approve the targeting of a person. But one official said Obama would be notified of the principals' decision. If he objected, the decision would be nullified, the official said. A former official said one of the reasons for making senior officials principally responsible for nominating Americans for the target list was to 'protect' the president. Officials confirmed that a second American, Samir Khan, was killed in the drone attack that killed Awlaki. Khan had served as editor of Inspire, a glossy English-language magazine used by AQAP as a propaganda and recruitment vehicle. But rather than being specifically targeted by drone operators, Khan was in the wrong place at the wrong time, officials said. Ruppersberger appeared to confirm that, saying Khan's death was 'collateral,' meaning he was not an intentional target of the drone strike. When the name of a foreign, rather than American, militant is added to targeting lists, the decision is made within the intelligence community and normally does not require approval by high-level NSC officials. Officials said Awlaki, whose fierce sermons were widely circulated on English-language militant websites, was targeted because Washington accumulated information his role in AQAP had gone 'from inspirational to operational.' That meant that instead of just propagandising in favour of al Qaeda objectives, Awlaki allegedly began to participate directly in plots against American targets. 'Let me underscore, Awlaki is no mere messenger but someone integrally involved in lethal terrorist activities,' Daniel Benjamin, top counterterrorism official at the State Department, warned last spring. Terrorist: al-Awlaki was a very senior official in al Qeada and was based in Yemen . The Obama administration has not made public an accounting of the classified evidence that Awlaki was operationally involved in planning terrorist attacks. But officials acknowledged that some of the intelligence purporting to show Awlaki's hands-on role in plotting attacks was patchy. For instance, one plot in which authorities have said Awlaki was involved Nigerian-born Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, accused of trying to blow up a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009 with a bomb hidden in his underpants. There is no doubt Abdulmutallab was an admirer or follower of Awlaki, since he admitted that to U.S. investigators. When he appeared in a Detroit courtroom earlier this week for the start of his trial on bomb-plot charges, he proclaimed, 'Anwar is alive.' But at the time the White House was considering putting Awlaki on the U.S. target list, intelligence connecting Awlaki specifically to Abdulmutallab and his alleged bomb plot was partial. Officials said at the time the United States had voice intercepts involving a phone known to have been used by Awlaki and someone who they believed, but were not positive, was Abdulmutallab. Awlaki was also implicated in a case in which a British Airways employee was imprisoned for plotting to blow up a U.S.-bound plane. E-mails retrieved by authorities from the employee's computer showed what an investigator described as ' operational contact' between Britain and Yemen. Authorities believe the contacts were mainly between the U.K.-based suspect and his brother. But there was a strong suspicion Awlaki was at the brother's side when the messages were dispatched. British media reported that in one message, the person on the Yemeni end supposedly said, 'Our highest priority is the US ... With the people you have, is it possible to get a package or a person with a package on board a flight heading to the US?' U.S. officials contrast intelligence suggesting Awlaki's involvement in specific plots with the activities of Adam Gadahn, an American citizen who became a principal English-language propagandist for the core al Qaeda network formerly led by Osama bin Laden. While Gadahn appeared in angry videos calling for attacks on the United States, officials said he had not been specifically targeted for capture or killing by U.S. forces because he was regarded as a loudmouth not directly involved in plotting attacks.",Anway al-Awaki was the first American-born terrorist put on the list .

Jeri Wright, pictured in 2007, has been indicted on several money laundering charges, as well as lying to police . The daughter of President Barack Obama's controversial former pastor was indicted on Wednesday on charges of money laundering and lying to federal authorities, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. Jeri L. Wright, 47, the daughter of Jeremiah Wright, was accused of participating in a fraud scheme led by a former suburban police chief and the chief's husband that involved a $1.25 million state grant, according to the Attorney's office for the Central District of Illinois in Springfield. Wright, of the Chicago suburb of Hazel Crest, was charged with two counts of money laundering, two counts of making false statements to federal officers, and seven counts of giving false testimony to a grand jury. The state grant was for a not-for-profit work and education program called We Are Our Brother's Keeper, owned by Regina Evans, former police chief of Country Club Hills, and her husband, Ronald W. Evans, Jr. According to the indictment, Wright, a close friend of the couple, received three checks in 2009 worth about $28,000 that were supposed to be for work related to the grant.

Analysis of the diets and medical history of almost half a million men and women linked processed meat to deaths from cancer and heart disease. The Europe-wide research, including work by Oxbridge scientists, found that processed meat is to blame for about one in 30 deaths. The researchers suggested a limit of no more than 20g a day of processed meat – equal to one rasher of cheap bacon. Scroll down for video . It may look good, but a major Europe-wide research, including work by Oxbridge scientists, found that processed meat such as cheap bacon or ham is to blame for about one in 30 deaths . The warning comes in the wake of the horsemeat scandal which has caused many consumers to question the origins of their food. Processed . meat, made by combining the leftover parts of animals which cannot be . sold as good cuts such as steaks and joints, contains high . concentrations of fat, including artery-clogging cholesterol. The . researchers from ten European countries quizzed almost 450,000 people, . many of them Britons, and tracked their health for an average of 13 . years. They said: ‘Men . and women with a high consumption of processed meat are at increased . risk of early death, particularly due to cardiovascular diseases but . also cancer.’ Some . 26,344 of the participants died over the course of the study, with . those who ate the biggest amounts of processed meat being 44 per cent . more likely to have died than those who ate the lowest amounts. The . figures for heart disease were striking – those who ate the most . processed meat, more than 160g or three sausages a day, were 72 per cent . more likely to die of heart disease. Processed meat such as bacon and sausages could send you to an early grave, a large-scale study has found . A study last year found that eating 50g of processed meat a day – the equivalent of one sausage or three rashers of bacon – raises the likelihood of cancer by a fifth. But in the latest, much bigger study, . those who ate the most processed meat were almost 50 per cent more . likely to suffer an early death, with heart disease the overwhelming . cause. The study, published . in the journal BMC Medicine, concluded that a limit of 20g a day of . processed meat – equal to a rasher of bacon or one full English . breakfast a week – would prevent about 20,000 early deaths in the UK . each year. Tracy Parker, a . dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘With spring in the . air, many of us may be looking forward to sunny barbecues. But this . research suggests processed meat, such as sausages and burgers, may be . linked to an increased risk of early death. Diets laden with pies, sausages, and ready meals can lead to an early death, a major study has shown . ‘However, the people who ate the most processed meat in this study also made other unhealthy lifestyle choices. ‘They were found to eat less fruit and vegetables and were more likely to smoke, which may have had an impact on results.’ Professor Karol Sikora, one of Britain’s leading cancer specialists and an unpaid member of the industry-backed Meat Advisory Panel, said the key to good health is a balanced diet. He said: ‘Don’t worry about having a bacon sandwich. It is not going to kill you. But don’t have four bacon sandwiches every day for your whole life.’ The amount of white meat eaten, such as chicken, was not linked to death rates by the researchers, while small amounts of red meat appeared beneficial. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, London, said: 'This study is yet another little plank going into the edifice saying we've got to down on [processed] meat. 'This is what we're saying, let's lower the amount of animals we are producing. We need to reduce the cattle culture in this country. 'The key issue is we don't know what a good diet is, we've had dietary guidelines based on a very narrow based idea of what is nutrition. 'For me, this study is another reminder of the need to go for a more sustainable diet.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'It's important that everyone eats a balanced diet. Eating well and being active can help prevent serious illnesses such as cancer and heart disease later in life. 'Red meat can be part of a balanced diet. But people who eat a lot of red and processed meat should consider cutting down as regularly eating a lot could increase your risk of bowel cancer.

Gang rape: The alleged victim said Jack McCullough also allowed his friends to sexually assault her . Half a century after the alleged crime, a former police officer, now an elderly 72-year-old, is on trial, charged with raping his 14-year-old half sister. The 1962 assault left such a mark on the victim, now age 64, that she fought back tears as she testified about the day Jack McCullough offered her a ride in his red and white convertible and then took her to his apartment and raped her in the dark. The charges were filed after police began investigating McCullough for an even older crime -- the abduction and murder of Maria Ridulph, 7, who disappeared from Sycamore, Illinois, in 1957. The statute of limitations on rape in Illinois is 10 years. The crime must be reported within three years. Prosecutors can charge McCullough because he left the state shortly after the alleged attack. The victim, who is retired after a career as a university professor and a hospital chaplain, said after McCullough was finished raping her, he asked three of his friends if they wants to assault her, as well. Two of them also took advantage of the young teen. The woman said it was a warm day in 1962 when her half brother, home from a stint in the military, visited her family in Sycamore, Illinois. She said she wanted a ride in his convertible because she had never been in one before. As soon as the car pulled away from her house, the woman said, McCullough, who was 22 and known as John Tessier then, became silent and had a menacing intensity. 'I knew I had made a terrible mistake, I knew I was in danger,' she testified. Murdered: Maria Ridulph stoked national attention when she disappeared from Sycamore, Illinois in 1957 . He drove her to a part of town she didn't know and brought her to his apartment. There, he raped her on a dingy cot in a dark room. Then let his friends assault her, as well, the woman testified Tuesday. McCullough's lawyer has dismissed the allegations as uncorroborated testimony based on one woman's account of something that happened five decades ago. He said McCullough never had access to a red convertible. The defense also brought in a neighbor who said he never remembered McCullough bringing his sister to his apartment. However, prosecutors claim McCullough has a history of abusing teenage girls. They brought in a 45-year-old woman who said he raped her in 1982 when she was a 15-year-old runaway. McCullough, then a police officer in a small town in Washington, let the girl and her friend stay at his girlfriend's apartment. One night, she says, he raped her while she slept on the couch. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to illegal communication with the minor. McCullough is still awaiting trial on the charges that he murdered Maria Ridulph.

A teenager claims to have eavesdropped on a highly sensitive conversation between intelligence officers after ‘phone-bombing’ Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorism hotline. Yesterday the leader of an anarchist group known as Team Poison posted live excerpts on YouTube of what appeared to be a briefing of counter-terrorism officers in which they discuss a property historically linked to the IRA among other operations. A group known as Team Poison said they had ‘hacked’ Scotland Yard’s secure communication system by exploiting old technology dating back to the 1980s. Concerning: A teenager claims to have eavesdropped on a highly sensitive conversation between intelligence officers after 'phone-bombing' Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism hotline . They also claimed responsibility for jamming the hotline by making more than 700 prank calls, boasting that it was ‘easy’ to drop ‘a 24-hour phone bomb’ on elite security officers. But last night the Metropolitan Police insisted its systems had not been breached and said that any recording would have been made via the  receiving handset, raising the possibility that the group may have made the recording after an officer failed to replace the handset properly. Detectives have now vowed to take ‘appropriate action’ after a number of recordings were posted on YouTube by the group. Last night two teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were arrested at an address in the West Midlands on suspicion of offences under the Malicious Communications Act and the Computer Misuse Act. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the pair were in custody in the West Midlands. Denials: Ailsa Beaton, Director Of Information for the Metropolitan Police Service, dismissed claims that Scotland Yard systems had been breached . It had already been linked to alleged hacking attempts on Facebook and a personal email account connected to a former staff member of former prime minister Tony Blair. In one of the clips, a male identifying himself as ‘Trick’  is heard telling an officer: ‘Knowledge is power... We embarrass governments and f*** the police.’ ‘Trick’ is later heard laughing when a woman comes on the line to tell him the phone call was being passed on to the FBI. The group claimed the calls were made to MI6, but they were in fact picked up by the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism command. ‘Trick’, reportedly a 17-year-old who launched Team Poison in 2010, emailed the Press Association yesterday, claiming that the group bypassed outdated technology to  compromise a server from Malaysia to record conversations. He said: ‘The phone denial of service was done via a custom script for Asterisk which was installed on an overseas server. ‘The conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method, their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique.’ Twitter messages suggested a variety of motives for the attack on the Home Office, including government plans to boost digital surveillance  powers and Britain’s extradition treaty with the United States, which critics say is biased in Washington’s favour. The messages warned there would be further attacks on British government websites every Saturday. But . last night Ailsa Beaton, Director Of Information for the Metropolitan . Police Service, dismissed claims that Scotland Yard systems had been . breached. Investigation: Team Poison has already been linked to alleged hacking attempts on Facebook and a personal email account connected to a former staff member of former prime minister Tony Blair . Miss Beaton, who is also the Association of Chief Police Officers’ lead for information management, said: ‘We have throughout the day researched the allegation that the Anti-Terrorist Hotline had been “hacked” and “activists’” claims that they were able to listen unrestricted to confidential communications. ‘We are confident the MPS communication systems have not been breached and remain, as they always have been, secure. ‘We are satisfied that any recording would have been made via the receiving handset only and not from an attack on internal systems. ‘The public can remain confident in the ability to communicate in confidence and that the integrity of the Anti-Terrorist Hotline remains in place.’","A group known as Team Poison said they had ‘hacked’ Scotland Yard’s secure communication system by exploiting old technology dating back to the 1980s .

A pilot was forced to make an emergency mayday landing when a fire warning light came on in his cargo plane. But instead of a blaze on board, the alert seems to have been triggered by extra 'humidity' coming from some 390 cows being carried on the plane. The Korean Airways landing at Heathrow is one of 88 mayday calls reported to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) last year. A pilot was forced to make an emergency mayday landing when a fire warning light came on in his cargo plane. But the false alarm was triggered by cows on board . A mayday landing is the highest level of emergency and is rarely used except in the most urgent cases. Other reasons for using the international distress signal included low fuel levels, suspected terrorism and crew members being struck down with food poisoning and becoming unable to safely man the plane. A spokesman for the CAA, which has released details of the calls, said it was a pilot’s discretion to call a mayday based on an assessment of a given situation on board the aircraft. He said: 'It could be the result of some technical failure to the aircraft or a passenger being unwell. 'The pilot will declare the mayday to air traffic control and communicate the nature of the situation. 'The air traffic controller may then give the aircraft a priority landing and scramble airport fire and rescue service or medical assistance if required.' In this case the fire alert was triggered while flying over the Irish sea. According to the report a worried crew member was sent onto the main deck to investigate but saw no sign of smoke or fire. But following procedure they donned . oxygen masks and started 'a controlled cabin depressurisation and rapid . descent' - an emergency landing . After extensive checks on the . aircraft, the pilot said he believed that the presence of the cattle led . to higher levels of humidity on board. Cows are well known for producing high levels of methane gas - the second-most-significant heat-trapping emission. Other alerts saw an Airbus A319 send out a mayday call as it reached Heathrow after the crew were told bags which had been loaded were for passengers not on board, sparking a bomb fear . The alert seems to have been triggered by extra 'humidity' coming from some 390 flatulent cows being carried on the plane . It was a false alarm. Two more planes coming into Stansted thought they were running out of fuel, with the crew of one so concerned, they sent an alert to be given priority landing. The captain of a Boeing 737 was unable to continue flying after falling ill so the crew issued a mayday emergency call. The plane was landed safely at Newcastle by the co-pilot. Another 737 made and emergency landing shortly after take-off when the plane started to shake and there was a burning smell in the cabin. It was revealed to be a failed air conditioning unit. An emergency was declared on a Fokker F27 plane coming into London City airport after the co-pilot became sick with food poisoning. And a Boeing 747 jumbo jet had to dump its fuel and make an emergency landing back at Heathrow after one of its engines caught fire on take off.","Baffled crew had to don gas masks and make emergency landing after the alert was triggered over Irish sea .

From eating a sizzling balti in Birmingham, to enjoying a night on the 'toon' in Newcastle or looking at Banksy's image of a naked man hanging from a Bristol window ledge, there is no better way to celebrate the best of England, according to tourism bosses. These and other suggestions are included on VisitEngland's 'bucket list' of experiences to enjoy on these shores, before heading abroad for the summer. The full list of 101 Things To Do In England will be revealed on Tuesday in time for St George's Day. Unsurprisingly, Stonehenge, the Tower . of London and Buckingham Palace have made it onto the list, but so too . have a host of unusual suggestions for the more adventurous tourist. These include swinging through the Sherwood pines at Go Ape in . Nottinghamshire, and searching for bats in the caves at Cheddar Gorge in . Somerset. Bill Oddie, actor, bird-watcher . and former presenter of BBC’s Springwatch and Autumnwatch, selected The . Farne Islands in Northumberland for the list. He said: 'There are just a few places that I would . recommend to anyone and feel absolutely confident that they would have . an unforgettable experience. 'The Farne Islands in Northumberland is – or . are – one of them. 'I’d recommend April to early September, with June . and July for maximum bird activity. I have visited sea bird colonies all . round the world and believe me the Farnes are the best place to . literally walk amongst terns, shags, kittiwakes and the photogenic and . endlessly entertaining puffins.

Legendary: Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, the mythical home of King Arthur . Mouthwatering: Enjoy fresh oysters at Whitstable, Kent . Meanwhile presenter Sonali Shah opted for coasteering in Cornwall: 'I've chosen coasteering in Cornwall as my ultimate pick, because it sounds like a super-charged version of something many of us will have tried as kids on a seaside holiday. 'The variety of activity – the sport involves swimming, jumping, diving, climbing and scrambling – would make it a totally adrenaline-packed experience, but you can also push yourself only as far as you want to. 'It's a unique way of exploring one of England's most stunning coastlines.' Have a cuppa: Tea at Betty's in Harrogate, North Yorkshire is one of the must-do activities on the list . Aside from exploring England's diverse wildlife and nature, tourists can also experience the country's finest food and drink. Tourist bosses suggest eating fish and chips on the beach at Aldeburgh in Suffolk, tucking into a 'proper' Cornish pasty in Redruth, or for the quintessential experience, having a truly English cuppa at the country's only tea estate in Tregothnan, Cornwall. Michelin-starred chef Skye Gyngell, who selected oysters for the list, said: 'Eating oysters in Whitstable has to be a favourite of mine. I love oysters, they really are one of my favourite treats, and growing up I remember reading books that Whitstable featured in. So I think the combination of the two, a food I really love to eat and a town I read about thousands of miles away, makes this a special choice for me.' Dress to impress: Tourists can enjoy a day out at Royal Ascot, Berkshire.

A mother who ran away with her seven-year-old son to prevent him having life-saving radiotherapy last night claimed that a doctor told her the treatment would ‘fry his brains’. Sally Roberts, 37, has been giving her seriously ill son Neon alternative therapies as he recovers from surgery to remove a brain tumour. But doctors disagree with her decision to use only natural medicine and have started legal proceedings, arguing that Neon’s chances of surviving will be ‘dramatically reduced’ if he does not undergo radiotherapy soon. Fears: Sally Roberts, who ran away with her seven-year-old son to prevent him having life-saving radiotherapy, wants to rely on alternative therapies . Seriously ill: Neon Roberts, pictured, has been receiving alternative therapies as he recovers from surgery to remove a brain tumour . Police and social workers took Neon from his mother shortly after 1.30am yesterday in East Grinstead, West Sussex. He was temporarily placed into foster care and then given to his father, Ben, who is separated from Neon’s mother and lives in London. A High Court judge made the extremely rare ruling that Neon could be named in an attempt to find him after Mr Roberts, 34, became concerned at having not heard from his wife and son in four days. But Mrs Roberts said she was out of contact because she was in Sussex taking Neon for treatment in an oxygen chamber and does not carry a mobile phone in case it affects his health. Neon’s brain tumour was reportedly removed in full during surgery on October 25 – immediately after he was diagnosed with the aggressive medulloblastoma form of cancer. Doctors then wanted to carry out the standard procedure of treating him with radiation to remove any further cancer cells and reduce the chances of the disease recurring. However, Mrs Roberts, who lives near Tiverton, Devon, claims that when a doctor explained this, he referred to the procedure as ‘frying his brains’. ‘I lost all confidence in him,’ she said. ‘It was frightening and very unprofessional. I thought, they have got the whole tumour out so why are they frying his brain? ‘I fear they are going to fry my son’s brain when there are other ways we could proceed. I feel it is very unnecessary and I’m sure any mother who had researched like I have would feel the same. ‘This is my only son. He’s my world. I need to be able to tell him I did everything I could for him.’ Mrs Roberts, who is originally from New Zealand, added that she fears radiotherapy will permanently harm Neon’s brain, affecting his IQ and damaging his growth and future fertility. She wants to see if the tumour returns before resorting to radiation. She said: ‘If I truly believed he had cancer now in his body I would agree to go ahead. But they are going after one cell that might be there. I am convinced it is not there because of the scans and because his spinal fluid is clear. ‘I don’t want to fry his brain and have his quality of life ruined just on the off chance there is a floating cell that is going to multiply. A High Court judge made the extremely rare ruling that Neon could be named in an attempt to find him after Mr Roberts, 34, became concerned at having not heard from his wife and son in four days . Sally Roberts says that she fears radiotherapy will permanently harm Neon's brain, affecting his IQ . ‘All I’m doing is protecting my child. I’m doing what any mother would do.’ Neon has undergone a range of alternative therapies since his operation, including hours in an oxygen tank. Mrs Roberts will not allow mobile phones near Neon and his twin sister Electra  in case they cause damage  to the children’s health, and they are fed a diet of organic foods and juices. She is well-known in music circles and has performed as DJ Sally at venues ranging from Glastonbury Festival to Boujis Nightclub in London. Her parents, Don and Lilian Leese, who live in North Tawton, Devon, said they support their daughter’s decision. Doctors disagree with Mrs Roberts' decision to use only natural medicine and have started legal proceedings . Mrs Leese, 72, added: ‘Sally is the most caring, wonderful mother. She is totally dedicated to her children. Everything she is doing is what  she believes is in Neon’s  best interests. ‘She wants to work with [the doctors] but the medical profession want to do it all their way. One of the doctors scared the living daylights out of her, referring to it as “frying his brains”. That is something you don’t say to a mother whose child has just been diagnosed with a brain tumour.’ Mr Roberts, an IT consultant who lives with his daughter in Knightsbridge, west London, described his estranged wife as a ‘concerned mother’, but added: ‘I want to make sure [Neon] has everything available to him. I understand there are lots of things that can be done to minimise the effects of radiotherapy.’ In the Family Division of the High Court this week, Mrs Justice Hogg ruled reporting restrictions could be relaxed to name Neon to improve the chances of finding him.","Mother says she ran away with seven-year-old as she fears radiotherapy will permanently harm his brain, affect his IQ and damage her only son's growth .

Since then he has captured the figure in a range of weather conditions and at various locations around the historic city, famed for its Navy base and as being the birthplace of Charles Dickens. Andrew, 38, said: 'The project isn't about the Lego, it's about the character. 'I used to walk around all the time taking photographs of random things like sunsets, textures, locations, but they had no connection. 'To capture those moments is great, but they had no theme.

'Sometimes the weather can be really difficult. If there's the slightest wind I feel just as frustrated as the little guy would if he could feel falling over. 'I call him either ""the little guy"" or ""the legographer"". I think giving him a real name would be going a step too far.

Margaret Hodge has urged Parliament to extend its hours, saying it feels as if politicians 'are hardly working' A senior MP has urged Parliament to extend its hours, saying it feels as if politicians 'are hardly working'. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee, says MPs are spending too much time away from Westminster on recess and too little time scrutinising policy. She said the shrinking number of days politicians spent at Westminster meant the Government was risking being seen as 'lazy' or poor value for money. The Labour MP, who was a minister under both the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, also . warned of a growing 'democratic vacuum' – adding that parliamentary . sessions were so short, 'it feels as if we are hardly working'. She . said: 'We are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times. MPs have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in . recess. 'Members of the . public would be forgiven for thinking that it is MPs who are lazy and . that it is Parliament that is failing to provide good value for money. 'The . committee I chair spends a lot of time scrutinising public spending and . whether it is worthwhile, yet the very heart of government – Parliament . – seems to be the most sluggish part of our system. 'We are not spending enough time in Westminster, and this creates a democratic vacuum.' However, Downing Street said Parliament was sitting for more days in 2013 than previous years. David Cameron's official spokesman told reporters: 'The shape of the parliamentary calendar is a decision for the House as a whole. 'My understanding is that for the 2013 calendar year the House will be sitting for longer than any of the previous four years and possibly longer than that. 'Under this government there have been September sittings as well.' Her . comments to the Guardian newspaper come as Parliament begins to wind . down this year's session ahead of the State opening in May. The House of . Commons usually sits for about 150 days a year, but this figure appears . to be falling. Politicians leave Westminster for . half-terms, a six-week break in the summer, two fortnight breaks at . Easter and Christmas and three weeks off while MPs attend party . conferences. According to . figures from the Commons library, MPs sat for an average of 148 days a . year between May 2010 and May 2012. But from 2006 to 2008, the Commons . sat for an average of 152 days a year. The shrinking number of days politicians spent at Westminster meant the Government was risking being seen as 'lazy' or poor value for money, said Margaret Hodge . By comparison, this year the Commons is expected to sit for fewer than 140 days. Former Tory minister John Redwood agreed with Miss Hodge's criticisms and blamed Labour for introducing shorter working days and longer holidays in order to appear more family friendly. He said: 'Parliament does need to do more to scrutinise government and that was true under Labour and is now true under the Coalition. We need more time.' John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, added that his committee would benefit from longer sittings.

The millionaire founder of file-sharing website Megaupload was released on bail in New Zealand today after authorities seized funds to prevent him fleeing the country. Authorities in the U.S. allege founder Kim  Dotcom facilitated millions of illegal downloads through his company and he is subject to online piracy charges. Under one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever, the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to have Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, and three co-workers, extradited to face charges including conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit copyright infringement. Bailed: Kim Dotcom founder of file sharing company Megaupload makes his way pass a large media scrum as he is released on bail in New Zealand following charges in a US led copyright infringement investigation . He had been in custody since his arrest on January 20 after he was initially denied bail . A smiling Dotcom spoke to reporters briefly outside the court as he was ushered to a waiting truck. He said: 'I am relieved to go home to see my family, my three little kids and my pregnant wife . 'And I hope you understand that that is all I want to say right now.' He also confirmed he would be fighting U.S. extradition efforts. Scrum: Kim Dotcom is guided through media after being released on bail at North Shore District Court today . Asked how he had been treated by the police after his high-profile arrest, Dotcom added: 'Well, it felt a little bit like an audition to 'American Idol.' Dotcom was released without any monetary bail bond, which is standard for cases that come before New Zealand's district courts. He does have other conditions of release, but Ministry of Justice officials declined to release those details. Megaupload: German born Dotcom was bailed after a judge in an Auckland court ruled that he did not believe he would flee the country . U.S. authorities claim Megaupload cost movie makers and songwriters some half a billion dollars in lost copyright revenue. They are trying to extradite Dotcom, 38, and three of his colleagues on racketeering charges. New Zealand authorities have seized millions of dollars in investments and assets owned by Dotcom, including luxury cars and artworks. North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson found that the German-born Dotcom no longer posed a significant flight risk because, as far as the court was aware, he wasn't hiding any money or assets that could help him flee the country. New Zealand courts had earlier turned down Dotcom's bail application and a subsequent appeal, saying he did pose a flight risk, but Dawson said those decisions were made when details about Dotcom's assets remained unclear. 'Since that time, all known assets have been seized and are unavailable for Mr. Dotcom's use or disposal,' the judge found. 'No new assets or accounts of any significance have been revealed since his arrest. Mr. Dotcom's submission that he has not concealed any assets or bank accounts has largely been borne out.' Dawson also said he received an affidavit from Bonnie Lam, the Hong Kong chief financial officer of Megaupload, supporting Dotcom's contention that he has no resources available to him. Bail: Bram van der Kolk, left, and Finn Batato, the co-accused of Kim Dotcom were previously remanded on bail at the District Court . Dotcom was born Kim Schmitz but legally changed his name. He is a citizen of both Germany and Finland and was granted New Zealand residency in 2010. He has also lived in Hong Kong, where the Megaupload company is registered. Dawson disputed an earlier court finding that the U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Germany. The judge said there is a German law which prevents Germans being extradited to any country - but that a treaty between Germany and the U.S. would allow Dotcom to be prosecuted in Germany should he flee New Zealand and should German authorities deem prosecution appropriate. He said a similar situation applies to Finland. Dotcom's colleagues had earlier been granted bail by New Zealand courts.","Twenty stone Kim Dotcom granted bail in New Zealand and says he will fight U.S. extradition efforts .

MI5 should play far closer attention to these immigrants, some who have been admitted as asylum-seekers, and are seen as enemies of Vladimir Putin, said security specialist Igor Korotchenko . He claimed an FBI 'failure' to heed Russian secret services warnings about Tamerlan Tsarnaev  could be repeated in Britain where intelligence co-operation with Moscow has been curtailed due to the diplomatic dispute over the 2006 'murder' of Alexander Litvinenko in London. 'It was a professional failure by American counter-intelligence,' said Korotchenko, who is also editor in chief of The National Defence journal in Moscow, and an advisor to military chiefs. 'The question we should ask America is why are they not co-operating as much as the Russian secret services want them to on matters of terrorism.' The same threat applies to Britain, he said, 'which has been willingly accepting terrorists and extremists from the North Caucasus. 'This is despite the fact that four telecommunications workers from Britain were beheaded in 1998.' He singled out Britain’s 'mistake' in giving asylum to Akhmed Zakayev, 53 year old prime minister of the independent Chechen government in exile who is labelled a terrorist by Moscow, but stressed others had also received a safe haven in London. He has claimed Britain has created a 'ticking timebomb' for allowing radicalised muslims into this country. Britain's intelligence co-operation with Moscow has been curtailed due to the diplomatic dispute over the 2006 'murder' of Alexander Litvinenko in London . A friend of actress Vanessa Redgrave and the late Boris Borezovsky, courts in London have refused to extradite Zakayev to Russia claiming he would not receive a fair trial. 'Britain has created a ticking timebomb which could explode at any time by accepting these people,' he claimed. 'If MI5 believes that people who have terrorist experience in the North Caucasus will - coming to London - become decent members of society, they are wrong.' Britain had allowed in “people who tasted blood and explosions and have learned the skills of terror”, he said. 'It is very dangerous that a potential terrorist underground network is being created, more dangerous than the IRA.' At the same time, Britain - like the US - had failed to co-operate closely with Russian secret services in exchanging intelligence on potential terrorist threats linked to the North Caucasus. 'Russian intelligence in every question related terrorism are prepared to have the most open possible relations with any Western special services,' he said. But co-operation had become stymied by difficult 'political relations and unresolved questions' in relation to Britain, he said.","MI5 should play far closer attention to immigrants, said security specialist .

"He is Nick Bitel, chief executive of the London Marathon . By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 01:13 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:21 EST, 22 April 2013 . Overlooked: Lady Tanni Grey-Thompson has been turned down for a key role in delivering London 2012's legacy . Paralympic hero Tanni Grey-Thompson has been turned down for a key role in delivering London 2012's legacy amid claims of a Government 'stitch-up'. A political row is expected to spark today when ministers announce that the new head of Sport England will be Nick Bitel, chief executive of the London Marathon. It is claimed Baroness Grey-Thompson, who had the backing of Lord Coe and was Mr Bitel's main rival, was overlooked because she had been too critical of the Government. Although the 43-year-old who won 11 Paralympic gold medals sits in the Lords crossbench peer, she has lead criticism of disability benefit cuts. Hugh Robertson, the Sports Minister, will say today that Mr Bitel, who has been in charge of the London Marathon since 1995, was the best candidate for the job, The Times reported. Whitehall sources told the paper: 'In terms of national organisation, leadership, commercial experience, he's got it all.' It was Lady Grey-Thompson's lack of experience in the commercial sector that had hampered her candidacy for a job with a £300million annual budget, they said. 'Tanni Grey-Thompson is a great athlete, a great Paralympian, but in terms of the commercial experience she has never run anything.' Downing Street was made aware of the decision last week. Although it was taken within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Prime Minister could have overturned it. Sport England is charged with increasing grassroots participation in sport at all levels, creating more opportunities for young people to take part and improving facilities. However, Lady Grey-Thompson, was regarded by supporters as an ideal candidate and had the backing of Labour. Last year she expressed concerns that disability benefit cuts risked undermining the Games' aim of widening access to sport for disabled people. Lord Prescott, the former Deputy Prime Minister, posted a message on Twitter, to David Cameron reading: 'Please tell your peers to stop blocking [Tanni Grey-Thompson] becoming Sports England [sic] boss. Best candidate by far.' Right candidate? Nick Bitel will be revealed as the new head of Sport England . Yesterday, Emily Thornberry, the Shadow . Attorney-General, told The Times: 'She's eminently suitable for this . role. I just worry that there might be some sort of political . stitch-up.' A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said: 'The process of appointing the Sport England chair is completely fair. 'It is focused solely on recruiting the best person with the right attributes to serve grassroots sport and deliver a lasting sports legacy from London 2012.

The UK's first 60 eyed flatworm has been discovered on a nature reserve in Cambridge. Scientists believed it could be an entirely new species . The creature was found in grassland near Cambridge despite the area being described as the most 'documented place on the planet'. The 12mm worm was found by Brian Eversham, chief executive of the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. The peculiar invertebrate is thought to be of antipodean descent, but also a close relative of a species found in Northern Ireland called Kontikia Andersoni. Biologist Dr Hugh Jones, an expert in the field, believed it was a 'completely new, undescribed species'. Dr Jones, a scientific associate of the Natural History Museum, said he had only seen one other example of a similar worm, a single specimen discovered in the Netherlands in April. The 60 eyed flatworm is believed to be an entirely new species. The 12mm creature was found by Brian Eversham, chief executive of the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire .

Malloy signed into law Thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre. Alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed the bill hours after the General Assembly approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country. 'This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,' the governor said. 'We have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do.' Scroll down for video .

Waiting for action: Relatives of two of the children who were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting added to the poignancy of the signing of the gun control law on Thursday . In the hours after the shooting . December 14, as anxious family members gathered inside a firehouse and . waited for news, Malloy told them their loved ones were not coming home. He said later that he didn't think it was right for the families to . wait for the victims to be formally identified. Now, Connecticut joins states . including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts in having . the country's strongest gun control laws, said Brian Malte, director of . mobilization for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in . Washington. 'This would put Connecticut right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws,' Malte said. The legislation adds more than 100 . firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials . have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as . well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. Some parts of the bill . would take effect immediately after Malloy's signature, including . background checks for all firearms sales.

Advocate: Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control . Heartfelt: Malloy was the one to inform the waiting parents on December 14th that their children had been killed . Following a total of more than 13 . hours of respectful and at times somber debate, the House of . Representatives and the Senate voted in favor of the 139-page bill . crafted by leaders from both major parties in the Democratic-controlled . General Assembly. Both were bipartisan votes. 'I pray today's bill — the most . far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other . families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 Sandy Hook . families have felt,' said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz.

Some of the measures take effect . right away, including an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban, . background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or . purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Defining issue: President Barack Obama speaks about gun control at the Denver Police Academy in Colorado yesterday. He is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups . The massacre reignited a national . debate on gun control, and President Obama has made gun safety one of . the defining issues of his second term, which started a month after the . shooting. His proposed gun control measures . have largely stalled in Congress, however, and Obama has planned a trip . to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in . Washington. Legislative leaders, aware of the attention on them, struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model. Long debate: Rob Kane, a Republican senator serving towns in western Connecticut, left, questions Senate President Donald Williams, D-Brooklyn, during a discussion of a gun bill on the Senate floor last night . Tense: Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, left, and Senator Carlo Leone, D-Stamford and Darien, watch a vote for an amendment of the gun-control bill at the Capitol in Hartford . President Barack Obama has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term, which began just a month after the bloody Sandy Hook massacre. Connecticut is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on December 14, joining New York, Massachusetts, California and Colorado. But Obama's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in Congress, however, and the president has planned a trip to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in Washington . He visited Colorado yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in Congress than an assault weapons ban or limits on large-capacity ammunition magazines. Obama's visit was heavy with political symbolism because Colorado recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western, largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right. Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year. It has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines. Obama said Colorado's action shows 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls. Several county sheriffs in Colorado have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. Senate . President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat, said: 'The tragedy in . Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends . politics. 'It is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country.' The . bill passed 26-10 in the Senate and 105-44 in the House of . Representatives. Both were bipartisan votes. The legislation adds more than 100 . firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials . have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as . well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. But some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues. Representative Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Newtown, acknowledged the legislation 'is not perfect' and he hoped would be 'a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs.' Representative Douglas McCrory, D-Hartford, said he felt the bill 'doesn't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities.' He said families in his district who've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the Newtown families. But Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, whose district includes Newtown, said he felt he was representing the interests of the Sandy Hook victims as he cast his vote. 'I stand here as their voice, as their elected representative,' he said, reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school. Lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre. 'When . a child is sent to school, their parents expect them to be safe. The . Sandy Hook shooting rampage was a parent's, a school system's, a . community's and the nation's worst nightmare,' said Republican state . Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton.

'What they're proposing will not stop anything.' By the time the Senate voted around 6.30pm, many of the gun rights advocates had gone home, leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the Senate was read. The halls were mostly empty by the time the House voted at 2.26am this morning. Among the gun control advocates were Dan and Lauren Garrett, of Hamden, wearing green shirts in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. The Garretts traveled to Hartford with their 10-month-old son, Robert, to watch the bill's passage. They said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal. 'It's just the beginning of this bill.

The teen hiker who was rescued after spending five days lost in a Californian national park has revealed she began eating dirt and hallucinating a snake was eating her during her ordeal. Suffering from hunger and severe dehydration, Kyndall Jack, 18, told reporters yesterday that her mind began to play tricks on her while lost near Trabuco Canyon after she and her friend, Nicolas Cendoya became lost after setting off on a hike on March 31st. Believing that all hope of rescue had gone, Jack said that she had wild thought her parents had been sentenced to prison time, a python was eating her and that Cendoya, 19, told her he was having visions of a tiger. Scroll Down for Video . Kyndall Jack, one of the two hikers who became lost for nearly a week in the Cleveland National Forest last week, talks about her ordeal and thanks rescuers during a news conference outside UCI Medical Center on Monday . Released from UC Irvine Medical Center on Monday, Jack was rescued shoeless and clinging to a mountain ledge on Thursday having suffered frostbite and cuts and bruises on her legs that made walking difficult for her. 'I don't remember drinking anything,' said Jack to ABC News. 'I know I ate dirt. I tried to eat some dirt and rocks. I came to the hospital with a big mouthful of dirt and that's all I remember.' Describing her hallucinations, Jack said that the wilderness got to her, making her imagine that animals were trying to attack her and her companion. 'My parents were in jail half the time, in my mind, and I was searching for my little sister, so that's all I remember,' said Jack. Kyndall Jack, told reporters that starvation and dehydration led to her eating dirt and hallucinating that she was being attacked by a snake while stuck on a ledge for five days . Kyndall Jack is transported by wheelchair and flanked by hospital staff, security and her parents for a press conference outside UCI Medical Center in Orange, California on Monday . 'I was being eaten by a python. Like Nick saw a tiger, I was being eaten by a python half the time.' Jack and Cendoya began their fateful trek on Easter Sunday in Trabuco Canyon in Southern Californian on what was their first date. It was while at the top of a mountain that took them six hours that the inexperienced hikers realized they had exhausted the water supply. 'We wanted to touch the clouds,' said Jack. 'That's why we went up there. We wanted to be in the clouds at the top.' And in newly released 911 calls made as the panicked pair realized they were stranded, Cendoya sounds incoherent. 'We have fire I mean,' Cendoya told the 911 operator according to ABC News. 'I mean we have a lighter or something we can light something up. I don't know.' Hero: Kyndall Jack, 18, has called Nicolas Cendoya, 19, pictured, her hero after the dramatic rescue . Relief: Nicolas Cendoya, center, hugs his brother, left, and mother, right, after he was released from Mission Hospital today . The 911 operator can be heard to struggle with Cendoya as he tries to find out where the pair have got themselves lost. 'Stop for one second. What is the address?' Cendoya can be overheard saying to Jack. 'I don't know,' she replies. Jack told reporters that the battery on Cendoya's cellphone failed before the 911 operator could track the signal - and that is when they began to panick. 'I said just hold onto me. Let's go back down the canyon,' Cendoya said Sunday after being released from hospital. 'And I must've fallen. And I don't know if Kyndall took a fall and was unconscious.' Once separated, the two were unaware even if the other one had survived. On Wednesday, Cendoya was found barefoot, shirtless and disorientated and Jack was found the next morning handing from a rocky ledge the size of a yoga mat. Following confusion over their accounts of how they became lost and separated, Cendoya said he was worried Kyndall Jack, 18, would blame him for what happened. He said he had been told not to contact her and was concerned when she hadn't got in touch, but then she sent him a Facebook message insisting his words of encouragement when they got lost were 'what kept me going' and that she loved him and missed him. Drama in the wild: Kyndall Jack, 18, is airlifted to safety by Los Angeles County Search and Rescue after being missing for five days in rugged country near Rancho Santa Margarita, California . 'I heard a lot of really mean things that were being said about me... and when she was saved I hadn't heard from her and everyone was telling me not to call,' Cendoya told reporters outside Mission Viejo hospital. 'But then I get a (Facebook) post from Kyndall.' Then he read out the heartfelt message. Risky adventure: Kyndall Jack's father said his daughter called him Sunday to say that she is going on a hike, which was unusual for her . 'Hi Nick, all I think about is you. It's hard to make sense of it all and everything that has happened,' she wrote, before explaining how when she was rescued, she wasn't even aware that she had been hiking with him. 'Then I remember you telling me to calm down and that you were going to get me out of there and that's what kept me going,' she went on. 'Thank you so much and I love you and miss you more than words can describe. You are my hero Nicolas.' Cendoya also described how he spent much of the ordeal in a dream-like state and even thought the search helicopters flying above him were hallucinations. 'The last thing I could tell you was going into a lucid dream,' he said. 'I can't even tell you when I woke up. I was in lucid dreams and hallucinations for days.' He said that while he was wandering in the arid surrounds, he reflected on what he considered recent selfish behaviors, like focusing too much on himself and not enough on his family. 'So that's why when all this happened, I didn't cry, I didn't fear it. I just embraced everything. I said, ""This is what I deserve,""' Cendoya said. 'I just knew I would get through it. I knew this wasn't my time to die. I knew that I needed this, to become the person that I'm supposed to be.' Rescued: Miss Jack is being treated in hospital and her family have been notified that she is safe . The two teen hikers were just a couple of miles from a shopping mall, and were able to make out the Los Angeles skyline and hear the rumbles of downtown traffic from where they wandered off trail. And although the sprawling expanse of Southern California suburbia is clearly visible from the forest's ridgelines, in the canyon where they were trapped the brush was so thick they couldn't find a road that was just 500 feet away.","Kyndall Jack, 18, revealed that while she was lost for five days in the Californian wilderness she began to hallucinate .

If you tuck in to roast lamb with mint sauce for lunch today, you will be eating the same meal as our forebears enjoyed more than 850 years ago. Recently discovered recipes dating from the 12th Century show that our taste in food has hardly changed – with traditional combinations including beef and mustard as popular then as they are now. The recipes were found on a fragile parchment from Durham Cathedral Priory dating back to 1140. Traditional tastes: The 12th century recipes for the aristocracy . Their author is not known, but they were used by monks to entertain members of the aristocracy. The ‘cooking book’ is the oldest found in Britain and predates by 150 years the previous earliest known culinary guide – the Forme Of Cury, written by chefs to Richard II in 1390. Written in Latin, it lists the right way to make sauces to accompany mutton, chicken, duck, pork and beef. But there are hardly any instructions about quantities of ingredients or number of servings. One note suggests a sauce for mutton, which includes costmary, a member of the mint family. Cooks are also advised to serve pork or beef with mustard slaked with vinegar. Food historian Caroline Yeldham said: ‘Mustard as we know it didn’t exist then. But mustard seeds were common and would have been pounded and mixed with vinegar to form an early type of sauce.’ Discovery: The recipes were found on a fragile parchment from Durham Cathedral Priory dating back to 1140 . Historian Dr Giles Gasper added: ‘There’s even a chicken recipe charmingly called “hen in winter”. We believe this recipe is simply a seasonal variation, using ingredients available in the colder months and specifying ‘‘hen’’ rather than ‘‘chicken’’, meaning it was an older bird as it would be by that time of the year.’ Pepper is mentioned frequently but was then a rare luxury. Meanwhile spices such as ginger, clove and cinnamon from far-flung trading places were used only by the very rich. Mrs Yeldham is helping to make the recipes for two banquets to be held this week in Newcastle.","Recipes were found on fragile parchment from Durham Cathedral Priory .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 21:00 EST, 18 February 2012 . A notoriously anti-immigration aide to Mitt Romney has left the campaign in disgrace after he was accused of threatening to deport his ex-gay lover to Mexico. The man, only identified as ‘Jose,’ claimed Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu threatened him with deportation if he ever disclosed their three-year relationship, the Phoenix New Times stated in an explosive tell-all. Babeu denied the allegations at a press conference Saturday, saying that all of the accusations appearing in the alternative weekly newspaper are ‘absolutely false, except to the issues that refer to me as being gay.’ Revelations: Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, pictured, allegedly threatened a former lover identified as 'Jose' with deportation if he ever disclosed their three-year relationship. He has denied the claims . He said the accusations arose to mar his chances of running for congress. Babeu, 43, who served as the co-chair of Mitt Romney’s Arizona campaign, is seeking the GOP nomination for Arizona’s rural western 4th congressional seat. The sheriff denied claims he tried to threaten the man with deportation if their past relationship was made public. Jose’s allegations were first published Friday in The New Times. An attorney for Jose didn't immediately return messages from MailOnline. She told the Phoenix New Times that Jose felt he was ‘being intimidated, and he was in fear for his life.’ The paper revealed that Jose served as a volunteer on Babeu’s campaign, and is originally from Mexico. Serious accusations: Babeu, pictured with Sen . John McCain in 2010, did admit that he was gay, however . Assistance: Paul Babeu, left, helped Sen John McCain win re-election . CNN revealed that while the sheriff . is not halting his congressional campaign, he stepped down from his . volunteer position with Mr Romney’s campaign. ‘We support the decision,’ Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrew Saul said in a statement to CNN. Politico . speculates the forced outing may be harmful to Babeu’s campaign in part . because the claim filed by Jose alleges that a man famous for border . protection and deportation of illegal immigrants himself had a . relationship with an illegal immigrant. The news site said his supposed lifestyle choices may be alienating to conservative GOP voters. Despite the serious allegations, . Babeu said he will run for congress undeterred. ‘We’re not cutting and . running,’ he told reporters.’ Politico . notes that speculation about the sheriff’s sexual orientation has been . alight for weeks, but because of the recent allegation, the Phoenix New . Times had a much firmer platform with which to run their story. Denial: Babeu addressed the media after an alleged former Mexican male lover spoke to a Phoenix newspaper . Scandal: Babeu, 43, is seeking the GOP nomination for Arizona¿s rural western 4th congressional seat . Babeu said at the conference today his sexual orientation and his private life is out of the public eye. ‘What I do in my personal and private life is my personal and private life with those individuals,’ he said. While he admitted to having a relationship with Jose, he said at no point did he threaten deportation. Jose, meanwhile, revealed to the New . Times that Babeu had a profile on gay dating website adam4adam.com. The . alleged profile of the sheriff shows him shirtless and in what appear to . be boxers. The profile has since been blocked. The congressional district where Babeu . is seeking election runs from western Arizona through Prescott and south . to take in parts of Pinal County south of Phoenix. Its voters are . heavily Republican and generally very conservative. Racy profile: The Phoenix New Times says this is the dating profile of Babeu on gay site adam4adam.com . 'Undeterred': Babeu, who left his volunteer position in Romney's campaign, will continue to run for congress . Babeu issued a sweeping denial of any . wrongdoing in front of his headquarters. The press conference was . attended by about three dozen high-ranking uniformed deputies, local . elected officials and citizens. Babeu, who is not married, said he had been in a relationship with Jose that ended sometime before September. 'The real issue here is the poor . judgment of a government official, posting those kinds of photos on a . public website. I think that shows a lack of good . judgment.' -Sen. Ron Gould . Jose also ran his campaign website and Twitter account, and Babeu said he began posting derogatory items on the sites after their breakup. Babeu said he had his lawyer contact Jose and demand that he stop and turn over passwords allowing access to the sites. Babeu said the postings and actions amounted to identity theft but that he chose to deal with the matter privately through his lawyer. Babeu is taking on an incumbent tea party Republican who switched districts and state Sen. Ron Gould, a conservative from north-western, in Arizona in August's 4th District primary. Mr Gould said he believed Babeu's . posting of pictures on what the lawmaker called a 'homosexual hook-up . website' were a 'Congressman Weiner type of moment.' Tighter boarders: Sen. John McCain (right), Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever (centre) and Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu participate in a news conference on how to better control the border in Arizona, on April 19, 2010 . 'The . real issue here is the poor judgment of a government official, posting . those kinds of photos on a public website,' Mr Gould said. 'I think that . shows a lack of good judgment.' He also said he believes Babeu's sexual orientation would hurt him in the district. Mr Gould sponsored Arizona constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman, an amendment he said drew extremely strong support in the rural counties he and Babeu seek to represent. Babeu said he has never defined himself based on his ethnicity or sexual orientation, and he would continue to focus on unemployment and the federal deficit in his campaign. 'What I'm trying to do is (be) as forthright as possible, talking about deeply personal, private matters, and trying to be upfront,' Babeu said. 'The disclosure of that information is something that I feel no American should have to do.' Babeu acknowledged that he has sent and posted the photos, but said they were personal. When asked if posting such pictures on a public website showed poor judgment for a public official, he reiterated that he believed they were personal.","Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu says he is gay but denies allegations that he threatened deportation of man claiming to be ex-lover .

The Bank of England may cut interest rates to below its current record low of 0.5% in the coming months to try to revive Britain's depressed economy. Members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) opted to pump more emergency cash into the economy earlier this month, but not before discussing in more detail the possibility of a first cut in rates since March 2009, it was revealed today. Detailed minutes show while they ultimately opted to increase its quantitative easing (QE) programme to £375 billion, its members agreed to consider cutting interest rates below 0.5%. This would good news for millions of people with variable mortgages but a bitter blow for even more savers and pensioners. Struggling: The Bank of England will pump a further 50 billion pounds into the British economy to try to improve the nation's slumping economy but may also cut interest rates this year . IMF boss Christine Lagarde has already urged the . Bank to lower its base rate and use more quantitative easing to . help the UK weather the . eurozone debt crisis. The minutes of the MPC’s July meeting, released today, . said the impact of the recently unveiled funding for lending scheme . might 'alter' the committee’s assessment of such a rate reduction. The £80 billion funding for lending . scheme was launched last Friday by the Bank and the Treasury in a bid to . free up the logjam in credit hitting the economy, by offering banks . cheap finance on the condition they pass it on to borrowers. Under the scheme, British banks are . being offered funding at low interest rates over a four-year period - . but it will be directly linked to bank lending performance to encourage . lenders to increase loan availability and reduce rates. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 'Members . signalled that a rate cut was still possible further ahead, although . only after the effects of the funding for lending scheme become . apparent.' The minutes also show the Bank voted unanimously to hold . rates at 0.5% this month, while seven members backed the QE boost and . two - Spencer Dale and Ben Broadbent - voted to hold the stock at £325 . billion . The economy is in a double-dip recession after contracting by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2012 and declining 0.4% in the final three months of last year. Meanwhile, inflation has pulled back from 5.2% last September as the impact of the VAT hike fades and energy and commodity prices fall. The near-term picture for growth is “somewhat weaker” than the Bank’s assessment last May, the Bank’s minutes added, and the UK is now potentially facing a period of two years where there has been 'little or no economic growth'. Survey data continued to weaken in the month before the meeting, the MPC said, while there were increasing signs that the threat of the eurozone crisis was hitting UK growth. The minutes added: 'Information during the month suggested export prospects had weakened, which would further impede the UK economy’s rebalancing away from domestic demand towards net exports.# . The minutes said the committee had considered the case for a cut to interest rates at its previous meeting in June - but added that such a move had drawbacks that made it 'less attractive' than a QE boost. But the committee said it would 'review this option' when the impact of the funding for lending scheme was more apparent, although this was unlikely to be for several months.",July minutes from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee reveal members might alter interest rates .

A British grandmother facing execution for smuggling drugs into Bali has criticised the Government for failing to help her legal fight to escape the firing squad. Lindsay Sandiford, 56, was sentenced to death in January after being caught carrying 10.6lb of cocaine worth £1.6million into the holiday island from Bangkok in May last year. A Just Giving online fund set up by supporters has raised only a third of the £8,000 she needs to take her case to Indonesia’s Supreme Court after a lower court rejected her appeal. Knitting: Lindsay Sandiford, 56, was sentenced to death in January after being caught carrying 10.6lb of cocaine worth £1.6million into the holiday island from Bangkok in May last year . The Government has refused to fund her fight to avoid the firing squad and will today contest a second High Court bid by the anti-death penalty campaign group Reprieve to make it foot the legal bill. In an open letter written from her cell, Sandiford admits she has been ‘stupid’ and says she has ‘humiliated’ Britain and herself. She writes: ‘I have been told the Government’s position when it comes to British citizens in my position (is) that I or my supporters must raise the funds for my defence, and that the longer I am on death row the more time I have in which to do this.’ Sandiford says foreign minister Alistair Burt, who rejected her plea for financial help, is ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’. Desperate: Sandiford co-operated with police after she was held at Bali airport in a sting operation that led to the arrest of four other suspects . She adds: ‘My family has done all they possibly can to support me and nobody could ask anyone to do more. I myself am knitting a jumper that I will try to auction to raise money, but that’s not going to go far.’ While she accepts she was to blame for her plight, she says prisoners on trial in Britain at least have a legal aid system to help them. She says she had been ‘touched and humbled by the kindness of so many members of the British public, who have reached into their own pockets in difficult times to help me pay for a lawyer, when the British government wouldn’t help me’. However, Sandiford may not be able to lodge her appeal with the Supreme Court before Thursday’s deadline if she is unable to raise the £8,000 needed to pay her legal costs. She adds: ‘The last appeal cost about £2,600. This time, in the Supreme Court, it will be about £8,000. If I really were a rich drug dealer, it would be no big deal. But I’m not, and you might as well ask me to pay ten million dollars. ‘I know there are some people who think I should die here in this prison cell. If I should die – and I hope I don’t, but I fear I may – then I hope my execution will prompt the British Government to do more for others.’ Sandiford co-operated with police after she was held at Bali airport in a sting operation that led to the arrest of four other suspects, including Britons Julian Ponder, Paul Beales and Rachel Dougall. However, while Sandiford was sentenced to the death penalty, the other suspects – believed by police to be higher up in the drug smuggling syndicate – had charges of trafficking dropped and were given jail terms of between one and six years. The Foreign Office, while refusing to fund Sandiford’s appeal, gave a written submission to her appeal hearing arguing that the death penalty she received was excessive and unjust. Former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald said the discrepancy in sentencing was ‘bizarre and unfathomable’.","Lindsay Sandiford sentenced to death after being found with £1.6m cocaine .

While on the phone with 911, the young mother shot and killed one of the intruders with a 12-gauge shotgun after he passed the threshold. SCROLL DOWN FOR 911 TRANSCRIPT AND VIDEOS . Make my day: Sarah McKinley shot and killed an intruder on New Year's Eve to save her three-month-old son, as reenacted for Good Morning America . Mother on the edge: Sarah McKinley said it was either the intruder or her son, 'and it wasn't going to be my son' After her husband’s funeral the previous week, a man named Justin Martin stopped by Ms McKinley’s house, claiming he was a neighbour and only wanted to introduce himself. Ms McKinley, 18, was suspicious. She said he was calling late at night, when it was ‘pitch black outside.’ Martin returned on New Year’s Eve, this time in the middle of the day and armed with a hunting knife and an accomplice – a man identified as 29-year-old Dustin Stewart. The new mother told KOCO News that the men started knocking aggressively on her door, Martin in front and Stewart in the back. Tragic loss: She lost her husband (pictured) to lung cancer on Christmas . She described to the Oklahoma station what she did: ‘I walked over and got the 12-gauge, went in the bedroom and got the pistol, put the bottle in his mouth, and then I called 911.’ She also barricaded the front door with a sofa. 'I’ve got two guns in my hand... is it okay to shoot him if he comes in the door?' -Sarah McKinley to 911 Dispatcher . Ms McKinley asked the 911 dispatcher what to do should the two men break in. ‘I’ve got two guns in my hand – is it okay to shoot him if he comes in the door?’ she said. ‘I’m in here by myself with my infant baby, can I please get a dispatcher out here immediately?’ Once the 911 dispatcher confirmed with the young mother that her doors were indeed locked, Ms McKinley asked again if she could shoot the intruders. Smaller family: Sarah McKinley proved that she could still manager herself, her family, and her home . ‘I can’t tell you that you can do that but you do what you have to do to protect your baby,’ the dispatcher told her. Ms McKinley was on the phone with two dispatchers - which represented two neighbouring counties - for a total of 21 minutes. Around 2pm, Martin kicked in the door and Ms McKinley shot him once in the torso. Since police said the shooting was in self-defence, she will not be charged. Bloodied: Police found Justin Martin, 24, slumped over this couch. He was pronounced dead at the scene. McKinley said he was brandishing a hunting knife . Police found Martin, 24, slumped over a floral-print sofa with a single gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Castle Doctrine - colloquially called the Make My Day Law from the 1983 Clint Eastwood film Sudden Impact – are legislated by individual states. Not all states have the law, which allow people to defend themselves in their homes. Oklahoma law states that anyone unlawfully entering a person’s home can be defended against by using physical or deadly force. The law was recently expanded in Oklahoma to include businesses. His accomplice, Stewart, told police he fled after he heard the gunshot and later was later driven to the police station by his parents, Newson6.com reports. He’s being held in Grady County jail on felony murder charges and will be arraigned later today, NewsOK.com reports. Detective Dan Huff told KOCO-TV that under some circumstances, shooting a person is permissible. ‘You’re allowed to shoot an unauthorised person that is in your home,’ he said. 'The law provides you the remedy, and sanctions the use of deadly force. The Oklahoma Castle Doctrine, . otherwise known as the Make My Day law, states you can only shoot an . intruder if they have entered your home. Attorney Doug Frieson told Newson6.com that the law always protects someone in their home, no matter the circumstances. Guilty conscience: Martin's accomplice Dustin Stewart (pictured) turned himself in after Martin was shot . ‘The simple fact that you’re unauthorised in the home is enough that allows the homeowner to use deadly force.’ She said that though the shooting was justified, it was by no means an easy decision to make. ‘It . was either going to be him or my son. And it wasn’t going to be my . son,’ she said. She added: ‘There’s nothing more dangerous than a woman . with a child.’ 'It . was either going to be him or my son. And it wasn't going to be my . son.' -Sarah McKinley . Detectives will continue their investigation after they obtain a search warrant for Martin’s car. Grady County Sheriff Art Kell told MailOnline that a shooting case like this is rare. ‘Around the state, maybe two to three people get shot,’ he said. He said there are three deputies to cover the county’s 12,000 square miles, meaning a response could hardly be immediate. Mr Kell added: ‘When (our dispatcher) got the call, we need to get more information, what’s the reason for the guy outside.’ Since Ms McKinley was calling from a cell phone, her exact location was hard to pinpoint. But, he added, ‘the deputy was en route within seven minutes.’ A moment of calm: Grady County dispatcher Diane Graham kept McKinley calm throughout the ordeal . He said that Ms McKinley’s husband was in his 50s and the couple were married two years ago.Mr Kell said one of his dispatchers, Diane Graham, handled the call 911 call. ‘I knew she was scared because she was whispering,’ Ms Graham, a 911 dispatcher from the Grady County Sheriff’s Office told KFOR-TV. ‘Anything can be serious in a moment’s notice, so you need to believe what they say when they call and get the help to them as quick as you can,’ Ms Graham explained. She stayed on the phone with the scared mother before transferring her to the Blanchard Police. Ms McKinley was gracious to the dispatchers for helping her in the difficult situation. ‘The 911 dispatcher was awesome,’ she told KFOR-TV. ‘I was feeding off her and she was calm, so I could be calm.’ Kindness from strangers: Those wishing to help have given Ms McKinley bags of clothes for her son . Det. Huff told KFOR-TV that he and his fellow detectives believe the home invasion to have been ‘premeditated.’ The attack, as new reports reveal, . may have been premeditated. Ms McKinley’s mother told Newson6.com that . Martin stalked her daughter at a rodeo two years ago. The two have since bumped into each . other at a nearby convenience store. Ms McKinley said she didn’t know . who he was until after the shooting, when she pieced everything . together. In addition, two of her dogs were recently found dead. Since news has spread, members of the Blanchard community are eager to help the young widow, donating clothes and gifts, as well as starting long-term funds for her son. Ms McKinley is touched by the kindness. She told KFOR-TV: ‘You don’t realise how many good people there are until tragedy happens and then they step forward. 'Kinda lose faith in the human race, but when people help, it puts that back in.’ DISPATCHER: What's going on? SARAH MCKINLEY: There's a guy at my door. I’ve got some dogs that keep coming up missing. This guy’s up to no good. My husband just passed away. I’m here by myself with my infant baby. Can I please get a dispatch out here immediately? DISPATCHER: Hang with me a second. Are your doors locked? SARAH MCKINLEY: Yes, I’ve got two guns in my hands. Is it okay to shoot him if he comes in this door?

More than $50 billion (£42 billion) has been sliced off tech giant Apple's market value as its share price plummeted. The share price fell by 12 per cent, prompted by poor iPhone sales over Christmas and fears the huge success of the iPad mini is impacting on sales of the firm's range of full sized iPads and Mac computers. The computer giant’s latest figures reveal a 21.2 percent drop in Mac sales from the same time last year. Apple's quarterly revenue by product: Experts believe consumers may be buying iPads instead of more expensive Mac computers from Apple, leading to a 21.2 percent drop in Mac sales this quarter . It is believed consumers are so enamoured by the tablet they are buying it instead of a more expensive Mac computer. Some reports even claim the smaller, cheaper iPad Mini is having a similar effect on sales of the full sized iPad. Apple sold 22.9 million iPads up from 15.4 million the same quarter last year - and admits it has struggled to meet demand for the latest iPad mini. During the earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook noted a big chunk of the decrease was due to the iMac as consumers increasingly move to laptops and tablets - and sales for that product line alone shrank by some 700,000 units. However, the firm tried to put a positive spin on the move. ‘I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us,’ said Mr Cook. 'On the iPad we have the mother of all opportunities here — the Windows market is much, much larger than the Mac market.’ He also believes that buying iPads can lead to buying computers. ‘When someone buys their first Apple product,"" he said, 'they end up buying another one.' The figures mark the first time in several years the firms Mac computers have failed to out-grow the PC industry as a whole. Following the results, eighteen brokerages cut their price targets on the world's biggest technology company's stock, as its shares slumped to $451 in value at the opening of the Nasdaq. Fall: More than $50 billion (£42 billion) has been sliced off tech giant Apple's market value as its share price plummeted . Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks as the new iPad mini is unveiled. however, the new low cost tablet is so popular it is believed to be eating into the profits of full sized iPads and Mac computers . Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies, who have previously raised concerns about Apple cutting orders to suppliers, described the slowdown in iPhone sales as 'real and material'. He said: 'We think Apple is losing the screen-size wars.' The statement was a reference to a shift in demand from the iPhone's smaller screens to five-inch screens being sold by rivals. Jefferies & Co cut its share price target to $500, a cut of $300. Among those to share the skepticism was Deutsche Bank, who trimmed its price target to $575 from $800. Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with IDC, said the firm had to release a lower cost iPhone. 'Despite the excellent results last quarter, it is now clear that Apple will not be able to continue posting consistent remarkable iPhone results in the long term without a portfolio strategy change,' he said. 'It is now time for Apple to increase the number of devices and to address different market segments.' Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'There’s no doubt the iPhone and iPad have been revolutionary devices, but Apple’s growing reliance on iteration over innovation has shaken the faith of investors looking at the long term. 'The potential for increased volume by targeting that price-savvy shopper with an all-new iPhone – rather than having them settle for last year’s finest – could be the tactical strike that keeps Apple one step ahead. 'We should never underestimate Apple's ability to surprise.' Apple shares fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading Wednesday, following the announcement of their poor sales, despite record profits. The company shipped 47.8 million of the flagship product, less than the 50 million that Wall Street analysts had predicted for the period ending December 29, sending the stock down. Sales of the iPad came in at 22.9 million in the fiscal first quarter, about in line with forecasts. Apple said that its fiscal first quarter revenue rose to $54.5 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $54.73 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. This is the slowest growth rate for the company since at least 2009. Drop: Shares of Apple fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trades following the latest earnings report on Wednesday, after closing up 1.8 per cent during the regular session . Shares in Apple fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trades following the earnings report, after closing up 1.8 per cent at $514.01 during the regular session. For the fiscal first quarter, the company posted net income of $13.07 billion, or $13.81 a diluted share, compared to $13.06 billion, or $13.87 a share, a year earlier. Sources this month have pointed to production cutbacks at Apple's component suppliers as a sign that demand may be waning for the iPhone, which accounts for half of the company's sales, and the iPad. The disappointing numbers come after Apple undershot revenue targets in the previous two quarters. The results will prompt more questions on what Apple has in its product pipeline, and what it can do to attract new sales and maintain growth. Apple's share price fell by 12 per cent, prompted by poor iPhone sales over Christmas, as concerned investors speculated as to whether the company was losing its dominant position in the smartphone market . The technology giant's shares have dropped around 30 per cent since September, erasing about $190 billion in market value amid concerns that the world is falling out of love with iPhones and iPads. It comes after less than stellar sales of its iPhone 5, and as the company faces rising production costs, competition from rival Samsung, and slowing growth in smartphones. Wednesday's earnings report was expected to show that first-quarter net income slipped two per cent to $12.8 billion, or $13.48 a share, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The actual earnings, however, were better than expected. Such a drop would have been the first fall in earnings since 2003. Analysts projected sales would rise 18 per cent to $54.8 billion. But they fell short at just $54.5 billion - which equates to the slowest growth for the company since at least 2009. Some have attributed the decline to the market becoming saturated with other smartphones, meaning growth for Apple is slowing. Rival Samsung offers more than 80 touchscreen smartphones and many are opting for alternatives to the newest - and expensive -  iPhone 5, which starts at around $199 with a two-year contract. Problems are believed to have arisen when the iPhone 5 made its debut. Critics of the new, larger screened model, complained it was riddled with errors its predecessor did not have. One of its most useful features, Google maps, was replaced by an in-house version which contained glaring errors and missed entire areas. The long-awaited model also 'scratched too easily' according to diehard Apple fans, and many became disenchanted with the company's until now unrivaled magic. Former CEO Steve Jobs introduced the new iPhone in January 2007. Some have attributed the decline in sales to the underwhelming launch of the iPhone 5 and the rise in other smartphones .","The company shipped 47.8 million of the flagship iPhone product, less than the 50 million that Wall Street expected .

When it was released in 1995, ‘Toy Story’ was revolutionary for being the first feature-length computer animated film. Nearly two decades later, two amateur film makers have taken it upon themselves to reconstruct the movie in a more traditional medium, making a full-length live action tribute to the Pixar classic. Jonason Pauley, 19, and Jesse Perrotta, 21, spent the better part of two years meticulously recreating the iconic movie, and recently posted their finished film on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Larger than life: Two enterprising amateur film makers recreated 'Toy Story' by filming a live-action version over the past two years . Don't toy with me: A still from the 1995 Pixar version, showing evil neighbor Sid torturing Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks . Attack: The live-action version of Buzz attacking Woody after their first encounter in Andy's room . First: Pixar's version of Buzz using his laser on Woody (though he would later find out it's not as powerful as would be hoped) Speaking with MailOnline, Mr Pauley said that the two years he and Mr Perrotta spent on their project was a labor of love. ‘It was just something fun to do,’ he said, adding that the two worked on the movie in their free time. ‘We started by filming on the weekends, all day on Saturdays. Eventually it ended up being, we have to finish because we’re using this person’s time or space.’ ‘Toy Story,’ he added, was his favorite film as a child (and still is). Prior to the project, he had already watched the film ‘hundreds of times.’ The actors, Mr Pauley said, were mostly friends or acquaintances from church. ‘Andy and Sit are brothers to each other, friends of mine from my old church,’ he said. ‘They fit the part closely enough, and they were always anxious to be in one of my films.’ The full-length film was shot on a consumer camcorder, using an amalgamation of green screens, stop-motion animation, and good old-fashioned puppetry. Dynamic duo: Jonason Pauley, left, and Jesse Perrotta, right, worked two years on their film . Incredible journey: After their film's completion, the Arizona-based directors traveled to Pixar's studios outside of San Francisco . You've got a friend in me: Woody and Buzz made the journey too . Mr Pauley was usually behind the camera while Mr Perrotta operated the puppet’s strings, though the two would sometimes switch roles. Filming a live-action ‘Toy Story’ proved to be difficult in spots. The actors were all young volunteers (TJ Bright, Victor Bright, Carla Pauley, Abigale Peters, and Delani Kent) and some scenes required tricky camerawork and post-production. The most difficult scene, Mr Pauley said, was the finale, where some of the toys are chasing their owner Andy in the RV. He said it was difficult getting the exact shots with actual dogs, and from a moving vehicle. After countless hours of shooting and editing, the film was done. Fearless leader: The aliens responding to Buzz after he crawled into the 'spacecraft' at Pizza Planet . The claw: And again in the Pixar version, Buzz speaking with the now-iconic green toy aliens . Mr Pauley, who is currently studying film at Northern Arizona University, said he and his filming partner had always imagined traveling to the studios outside of San Francisco to celebrate. Upon their arrival to the Emeryville studios, the young men were allowed to stand out front and hand out DVDs of the finished movie. ‘A number of (the Pixar employees) were excited to watch it and hear about it,’ he said. The live-action ‘Toy Story’ uses the audio from the film, which stars the vocal talents of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as the unflappable Buzz Lightyear. Risky business: Mr Pauley said that the final rescue scene with Woody and Buzz was tricky to film, because it was a moving shot involving real animals and difficult angles . Reach: The original 'Toy Story' cost $30million to produce and was the first feature-length film to be computer animated . While the duo never got explicit permission to be able to use Pixar’s material, Mr Pauley said that he and Mr Perrotta had tweeted at top-Pixar executives several times before publishing their work to YouTube, and had never gotten an explicit ‘no.’ ‘They said just do it,’ he said. ‘If they’re okay with it, that’s cool.’ Mr Pauley said he loves the end product. ‘I’m glad we did it,’ but adds that it was a learning experience. As of Sunday evening, their film has garnered some 253,000 views to very positive acclaim. One viewer wrote: ‘This is so cool on so many levels! Fantastic!’ Pixar’s ‘Toy Story’ had an estimated $30million budget, and grossed more than $360million worldwide.

"By . Leah Hardy . PUBLISHED: . 17:09 EST, 22 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 24 December 2012 . I’ve noticed people peering at me oddly. But I haven’t taken offence. Because the stares have been followed up with the most compliments I have ever had about my skin in my entire life. And that’s not something you expect when you are a year shy of 50. The reason? For the past four months, I have regularly been subjected to a staggering 69,000 injections in my face, as one of the first people in the country to trial the latest, non-surgical facelift on the market. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Leah Hardy pictured left before undergoing Intracel - a skin-tightening and rejuvenating system costing £2,000 - and pictured right after the treatment . While celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston and Kim Kardashian rave about collagen-boosting Fraxel laser treatments, the cosmetic world has moved on, and the buzz now is about Intracel. This is a skin-tightening and rejuvenating system combining three of the most promising minimally invasive techniques: micro-needling, radiofrequency (a type of heat) skin tightening and lasers. Unlike lasers that burn the surface of the skin, Intracel injects radiofrequency heat energy into the deepest layers of the skin via needles as fine as a human hair. It works by creating thousands of microscopic wounds which stimulate tired old skin cells  to go into overdrive, producing new, fresh, young collagen. The makers of Intracel claim this will lead to tighter, firmer, brighter skin, with smaller pores. It is even said to lift sagging jawlines, soften crow’s feet, fill out acne scars, remove red veins and cure acne, because it kills the bacteria that cause spots and reduces the activity of oil glands in the skin. But don’t think this treatment is like a pampering facial. Remember those 69,000 needle pricks? Here come the needles: Leah Hardy, 49, receiving the anti-aging treatment from Dr Natalie Blakely . Before treatment, I was slathered in a powerful anaesthetic cream. At one point, I nervously licked my lips, and ended up with a numb tongue as well as face. Then it was time to face the Needles of Doom. Dr Blakely showed me the device and I could see that when a button was pressed, dozens of teeny needles would shoot out. And with that I lay on the couch. Dr Blakely started on my forehead. She switched to deeper needles on my cheek where there is more fat, and shallow ones over the nose where there isn’t. The overall sensation is of warmth, but when the needles hit bony areas, there is a sharp, brief pain. The needling took less than half an hour, and then I relaxed with a cooling mask for 15 minutes. But afterwards my face was scarlet and there were tiny droplets of bright red blood under the skin on my nose. I’m not allowed to wear make-up, so I put on big sunglasses and stop for a coffee , but nobody comments. As the redness fades, I develop stripes of tiny scabs on my cheeks and grid marks of more scabs on my forehead. I look as if I’ve been  savaged by a cat. My husband is  visibly shocked: ‘What on earth  have you done to yourself?’ he says. No pain, no gain, I say. The next day, I have teeny bruises under my eyes, and the stripes on my cheeks are still vivid. My husband anxiously asks: ‘Will you get better?’ And something else happens. I erupt into horrible spots. Dr Blakely warned that a brief attack of acne may be a side effect, but there are also tiny red drops of blood in every pore on my nose and three big scratches on my cheek. The needles of doom: Deeper needles are used on the cheeks where more fat is stored while shorter needles are on shallow parts of the face such as the nose . On day five, I use a chemical peel Dr Blakely gave me in an aftercare pack. The next day my skin looks smoother but the red blood spots in my pores and the scratches are still there. However, I start to notice the skin around my eyes looks fresher. It takes two weeks for my skin woes to completely disappear. When, six weeks later, I arrive for treatment number two – for best results they recommend this – I am nervous. Dr Blakely says my reaction was extreme and very unusual. And this time things are very different. The redness fades completely in a few hours and my skin looks just a little pink, with no scabs. My skin looks brighter and clearer and my jawline tighter already. I return for my third treatment, almost four months after the first, and it’s a breeze. Yes, the needles are a bit ouchy at times, but even though she uses a high level of energy, all I have to show for it is some transient redness, a few minute blood speckles, and a tiny sprinkling of almost invisible scabs on one cheek and above one eye, which disappear in a few days. I can see subtle changes. My brows are more arched, my cheeks look fuller and my jawline tighter, as if everything’s slightly lifted. My nose to mouth lines are softer and, on the right hand side of my face, have almost vanished. What doesn’t really show in photographs is that my skin glows and feels bouncier and my pores are smaller. Intracel is expensive, and the results may not be dramatic. But friends, mums at the school gate and even people I barely know notice a difference. I tell them they just need to find nearly £2,000 – and endure those 69,000 needles.","Leah Hardy underwent the new cosmetic anti-aging treatment Intracel .

Alexandra Traycoff has been a heart patient at Indiana’s Riley Hospital for Children and its outpatient center since she was just a few months old and says it’s through the generosity of others that she’s alive today. So when the 24-year-old saw an Indianapolis news story about Katelyn Newell, the 8-year-old Terre Haute girl waiting for a heart transplant, she says she could relate to her struggle. But she also noticed that Katelyn, like her, was a big Justin Bieber fan as well. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bieber surprise: Alexandra Traycoff, 24, poses for a photo with 8-year-old Katelynn Newell on Tuesday after surprising her in her hospital room with two tickets to see Justin Bieber . So Ms Traycoff, who had an extra set of tickets to the young singer’s July 10 concert at Banker's Life Fieldhouse, decided to give them to Katelyn, who has been in Riley's Heart Center for more than 10 weeks, in an emotional surprise. On late Tuesday morning, Ms Traycoff, her mom, Lori, and dad, Sergei, made a surprise visit to Katelyn in her hospital room to present her with the two tickets hidden inside a plastic Justin Bieber bag. Just about everyone else knew about the 'surprise,' including the WRTV 6 news crew doing a follow-up story. Ms Traycoff had contacted TV reporter Tanya Spencer soon after she saw the story about Katelyn. That paved the way for Tuesday. As the big moment approached, several Riley staff waited in the hall, eagerly awaiting Katelyn's reaction, and Katelyn's mom, Robin, had her iPhone ready to take video and pictures. Strangers; Katelyn didn't know Alexandria Traycoff before Tuesday morning when the 24-year-old came into her hospital room with the purple Justin Bieber bag, seen . Overwhelming: Alexandria smiles after Katelynn discovered the two tickets hidden inside a Justin Bieber gift bag, before becoming overwhelmed and hiding, keeping both tickets in hand . Once news crews and Ms Traycoff and her parents arrived in Katelyn's room, she presented Katelyn with the gift bag. Katelyn, who sat in a red Riley wagon — her back to the crowd — found a Bieber book and Bieber tattoos — but for a short period, the big gift was missing in action. Finally, she dug it out from beneath piles of tissue paper. 'Do you know what those are?' Katelyn’s mother Robin Newell asked her. 'Tickets,' said Katelyn. 'To?' her mom nudged. 'A concert,' Katelyn said. 'Who are you going to go see?' At that point, the 8-year-old became just a little overwhelmed by all the excitement. Thankful: Katelyn's mother Robin Newell, right, was overcome with emotion from so many people, total strangers, that have reached out to help her daughter in the smallest ways in their time of trouble . 'This is your surprise, Katelyn. You get to go see Justin, in concert,' her mother said. The crowd burst into applause. Katelyn had known for a while about a surprise — but she never imagined tickets to his concert. Ms Traycoff told the Tribune-Star that initially, her family had planned to sell the extra tickets after mistakenly buying two more than needed, but when she saw the story about Katelyn, she knew, 'That's where I wanted to give them.' Ms Traycoff, who was born with a congenital heart defect, feels a strong connection to Katelyn. 'That's the link to this story that makes it very, very sweet,' said Lori Traycoff, Alexandra's mom. Her daughter has had three surgeries at Riley Hospital and now goes to the Riley outpatient center. Lori Traycoff said the tickets are 'hope for the future — something for Katelyn to look forward to' as she awaits a heart transplant. But Ms Traycoff has other plans up her sleeve. Much in common: Katelynn playfully hides behind a Justin Bieber cardboard inside her hospital room beside Alexandra Traycoff, left, with both able to relate to not only a love of Justin Bieber but needing a heart transplant . She's working through social media and other means to try and arrange a meeting between Bieber and Katelyn. She's emailed Ellen DeGeneres, who is friends with Bieber, and she's also tweeting Bieber (but hasn't heard back). Before the Traycoffs left, Ms Traycoff spent time talking to Katelyn and she hopes to come back and visit. Lori Traycoff shared with Katelyn and Robin what had happened earlier in the day. The family had planned to bring a balloon bouquet, but then learned they could not take latex balloons into the hospital because of concerns about possible problems with allergies. So, they released the balloons into the sky. 'I made a wish,' Lori Traycoff said, 'that you get your phone call' — and a new heart. The Traycoffs will return, and Lori promised to stay in touch with Robin. 'Moms need support, too,' Lori Traycoff said.

A Russian-made passenger plane crashed into a steep cliff on a long-dormant Indonesian volcano during a demonstration flight to potential buyers and journalists. Its wreckage was spotted by helicopters today, but there was no sign of survivors among the 47 people on board. Search and rescue teams are now on their way to the crash site. Family members, many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke down in tears on hearing the news today. Others stared blankly ahead in disbelief. Scroll down for video . Remnants: A view of the wreckage of the Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft in Mount Salak, West Java province, as seen from an Indonesia Airforce Super Puma helicopter on May 10 . Tragic: A Russian Sukhio Superjet 100, like . this one pictured, has crashed along a cliff in Indonesia, but the conditions of the 48 people on board is still unknown . 'From the pictures we're seeing, it looks like it was a total loss,' said Daryatmo, chief of the national search and rescue agency, who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name, as the first images flashed across local TV. The Sukhoi Superjet-100, Russia's first new passenger jet since the fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago, was scattered on a steep near the top of Mount Salak, a volcano just 30 miles south west of the capital Jakarta. The company's blue-and-white logo peeked through the dense canopy of trees. The location will hamper efforts to evacuate victims, said Gagah Prakoso, a spokesman for the Search and Rescue National Agency, adding they would have to be pulled to a hovering helicopter by ropes and nets. Mission: Search and rescue teams were scouring . the slopes of a dormant volcano in western Indonesia early Thursday for . signs of the wreckage . Mobilizing: Indonesian soldiers cook food at Taman Nasional . Halimun Salak in Sukabumi, West Java, Indonesia on Thursday morning on a break during the search . The plane left Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta for a quick test flight aimed at impressing potential buyers. Twenty-one minutes after take-off, the crew asked for permission to descend from 10,000ft to 6,000ft, said Daryatmo. The plane went off the radar immediately afterwards. It was not clear why the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked to drop down, especially when it was so close to the 7,000ft mountain, or if the descent was approved. Tapes between the pilots and air traffic control were being reviewed, said Tatang Kurniadi, chief of the National Commission on Safety Transportation. More than 1,000 people, including soldiers and police, took part in the search and rescue efforts early today. Eventually,helicopters carrying out aerial surveys spotted the wreckage. Despair: Relatives of passengers on the missing Sukhoi Superjet 100 pictured crying at Jakarta Airport . Worry: Relatives of passengers look at the list of who was on board the missing flight . 'They have clear view,' said Mr Prakoso. 'There is no sign of any of the passengers .... We're trying to move in closer to the wreckage now but its reachable only by foot.' Russia's aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The Superjet - developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with the co-operation with Western partners - has been widely considered the country's chance to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. Its Welcome Asia! tour, which also included stops in Pakistan, Burma and Kazakhstan, was intended to drum up support. Sunaryo from PT Trimarga Rekatama, the company that helped organise yesterday's event, said 47 people were on board, many of them potential buyers and journalists. Among them were eight Russians, all from Sukhoi companies and 37 Indonesians. Mystery: The jet, like the one pictured here, had begun its descent towards Jakarta airport after its demonstration flight when it disappeared . An American consultant with Indonesia's PT Sriwijaya Airline and a Frenchman with aircraft engine-maker Snecma were also on board. The Superjet, a 75 to 95-seat plane, was being touted as a challenger to similar-sized jets from Canada's Bombardier. and Brazil's Embraer. It made its inaugural commercial flight last year. 'It is their big hope that they will somehow get into the jet aircraft passenger market in a bigger way than they have, because we all know that the Russians have had a dreadful record in the past with their aircraft, so this was vitally important to their industry,' said Tom Ballantyne, a Sydney-based aviation expert. With a relatively low price tag of around £27.7 million, the plane had garnered around 170 orders. Indonesia, a sprawling archipelagic nation of 240million people with a fast-growing middle class, was considered one of the biggest potential customers. Kartika Airlines and Sky Aviation - among dozens of airlines to have popped up in Indonesia in the last decade to meet the growing demand for cheap air travel - had already ordered at least 42. Despair: Indonesian relatives of passengers of the Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 cry at Halim Perdanakusuma airport in Jakarta today . Devastation: It is feared that all those aboard the doomed flight have been killed . People involved in those plans said they were waiting for the results of the investigation before reconsidering. Most wanted to know whether the problem was mechanical or pilot error. Indonesian . officials initially speculated there were two possibilities surrounding the fate of the . aircraft - that it had crashed or had been hijaked. A military source in Indonesia said it was apparent that . the jet had 'fallen from the sky' after it suddenly vanished from radar screens  at an altitude of 6,200 feet over a mountainous area.

A prototype inflatable module is to be tested aboard the International Space Station to give astronauts an extra bedroom, Nasa has announced. The inflatable module can be compressed into a 7ft tube for delivery, and is being heralded as a key component of future exploration and the development of commercial space travel and research. It is designed by Bigelow Aerospace, based in Las Vegas, which has been awarded a $17.8 million (£11m) test . project for the inflatable room - and hopes to develop space hotels and even planetary bases using the technology.

NASA is expected to install the module by 2015 . Bigelow Aerospace president Robert Bigelow, left, and NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver with a one third scale model of the inflatable room . Echo . 1, launched in 1960 was the first inflatable space craft. The NASA . communication satellite rose 1,000 miles into space as a balloon. It was . dubbed a ‘sateloon’. In . 1961 an inflatable space station was proposed and a prototype built by . NASA. It was intended to be manned by one or two astronauts but it was . never launched. With the . development of kelvar and other materials, the inflatable concept was . revived in the 1990s, with NASA creating the TransHab. Budget cuts meant . it was scrapped in 2000. Astronauts will test the ability of . the bladder, known as the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, . to withstand heat, radiation, debris and other assaults. Some adventurous scientists might . also try sleeping in the spare room, which is the first piece of private . property to be blasted into space, Nasa said. Lori Garver, NASA’s deputy administrator, said as she unveiled the contract award that the inflatable module concept is simultaneously cutting edge technology and affordable. ‘This partnership agreement for the use of expandable habitats represents a step forward in cutting-edge technology that can allow humans to thrive in space safely and affordably, and heralds important progress in U.S. commercial space innovation,’ she said. ‘The International Space Station is a unique laboratory that enables important discoveries that benefit humanity and vastly increase understanding of how humans can live and work in space for long periods.’ Part of NASA’s interest in the inflatable technology is prompted by its potential for deep space missions. If the module proves durable during two years at the space station, it could open the door to habitats on the moon and missions to Mars, Nasa engineer Glen Miller said. The agency chose Bigelow for the contract because it was the only company working on inflatable technology, said Nasa deputy administrator Lori Garver. An artist's rendering of Bigelow Aerospace's balloon-like module attached to the International Space Station . Founder and president Robert Bigelow, who made his fortune in the hotel industry before getting into the space business in 1999, framed the gambit as an out-of-this-world property venture. He hopes to sell his spare-tyre habitats to scientific companies and wealthy adventurers looking for space hotels. Nasa is expected to install the 13ft blimp-like module in a space station port by 2015. Mr Bigelow plans to begin selling stand-alone space homes the next year. The new technology provides three times as much room as the existing aluminium models, and is also easier and less costly to build, Mr Miller said. Artist renderings of the module resemble a tin-foil clown nose grafted on to the main station. It is hardly big enough to be called a room. Mr Miller described it as a large closet with padded white walls and gear and gizmos strung from two central beams. Bigelow Aerospace founder and president Robert Bigelow with his inflatable module. He hopes to use it to create the first space hotel . Ms Garver said sending a small inflatable tube into space will be dramatically cheaper than launching a full-sized module. 'Let's face it; the most expensive aspect of taking things in space is the launch,' she said. 'So the magnitude of importance of this for Nasa really can't be overstated.' The partnership is another step towards outsourcing for Nasa, which no longer enjoys the budget and public profile of its heyday. The agency has handed off rocket-building to private companies, retired it space shuttles in 2011 and now relies on Russian spaceships to transport American astronauts to and from the space station. NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver and President and founder of Bigelow Aerospace Robert T. Bigelow in front of what could become one of the first space hotel rooms . If the Nasa scheme is a success, the inflatable technology could be used to built the first space hotel. A 60-day stay will cost 25 million . dollars (£15.6m), which does not include the 27.5 million dollars (£17m) it costs to get there and back, believes Mr Bigelow. Mr . Bigelow predicted that the primary customers would be upwardly mobile . countries including Brazil, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates that . 'have a difficult time getting their astronauts into orbit' and could . use a private space station to barter and build up prestige. He said the Nasa brand would enable him to begin selling Kevlar habitats several times the size of the test module. 'This . year is probably going to be our kick-off year for talking to . customers,"" he said. ""We have to show that we can execute what we're . talking about.' Mr Bigelow, . who launched a small prototype of the module in 2006 after licensing . the patent from Nasa, will rely on Boeing and Southern California rocket . developer Space Exploration Technologies to provide transportation. The biggest technological challenge will be transporting the collapsed module through the sub-zero temperatures of space without tearing or cracking any part of it, Mr Miller said. When it arrives at the space station in 2015, scientists will blow it up and let it sit for a few days to test for leaks. If it does not hold as promised, Nasa will take back a portion of the already bargain-basement price it paid Bigelow. Bigelow Aerospace founder and president Robert Bigelow,with a third scale model of the inflatable module . Standing beside scale models of research stations on Mars and the moon, Mr Miller said the project will encourage commercial ventures to follow the path Nasa blazes into space. He added that it could also help achieve the holy grail of space exploration: missions that send astronauts out of orbit for more than a year. 'The only way to do that is to expand it out and, voila, you have living space for three people to go to Mars,' he said. 'You can get three times the volume of a metallic can, and you can go up in the same ferry.' A model of a concept space station made with Bigelow Aerospace habitat modules . The experimental unit, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, is intended to be easily launched because it takes up much less room than conventional space craft yet once in orbit is inflated to be much bigger. Bigelow hopes that while providing practical solutions to space research, the modules will also serve as craft that can provide accommodation and working space for astronauts in orbit.

Inflatable space modules are intended to provide more room for the astronauts based in them. Its stated aim is ‘to provide affordable options for spaceflight to national space agencies and corporate clients’. Previously, the company has launched two other inflatable modules but this is the first time it will be tested as part of a manned craft. Genesis 1 was launched in in 2006 and Genesis 2 in 2007, both on Russian rockets, and are still in orbit. Each has been tested to ensure a constant temperature and pressure can be maintained within the inflatable hull. Bigelow last year announced a link up with the SpaceX company which is working to create Dragon spacecraft that can carry passengers into space. The intention was that SpaceX would transport people into space where they would transfer to orbiting Bigelow inflatables. Among the potential projects that Bigelow is looking at is building a base on the moon constructed from a series of linked inflatable modules.","Inflatable modules hailed as cheaper to launch and transport .

So spare a thought for Joanna Krzysztonek, who endured an astonishing 75 days of it. And as if that wasn't challenging enough, the 31-year-old was forced to lie upside down for the entire time. Mrs Krzysztonek was pregnant with triplets when she went into labour at 21 weeks. Her first baby was born prematurely and, tragically, was too weak to survive. Delight: Joanna Krzysztonek with one of her surviving babies after she was able to hold off giving birth for 75 days . Sleeping easy: Iga rests unaware of her dramatic birth . The other two were in danger of suffering the same fate – until doctors stepped in to try to delay their delivery. They gave Mrs Krzysztonek medication . to stop her contractions and got her to lie on a  bed tilted at a 30 . degree angle, with her feet pointing upwards, to reduce the risk of . contractions starting again. The umbilical cord was tied and put back . inside her uterus. She remained in the upside down . position 24 hours a day for two and a half months.  After 75 days – and . what is believed to be the longest labour ever recorded – Mrs . Krzysztonek gave birth to a healthy girl, Iga, and boy, Ignacy, at a . neo-natal clinic in the Polish town of Wroclaw. Yesterday she said she had not been put off by the prospect of lying in such an awkward position for months. 'I was relieved that there was a . chance to keep the pregnancy and to give the babies a chance to be born . successfully,' she added. 'I am feeling so elated that words . can't describe it. They are such good babies, they are really calm and . sometimes they even have the gentlest little smile. 'I've been told the labour was a world . record. I am amazed by what happened but all I want to do is express my . gratitude to the staff of this hospital for their wisdom and . helpfulness. I would never have been able to get through this without . them.' At 32 weeks into the pregnancy, the doctors decided to deliver Iga and Ignacy (pictured) by Caesarean on February 15. Each weighed just under 4lb . Professor Mariusz Zimmer, head of the . Wroclaw obstetrics and neo-natal clinic, explained that Mrs . Krzysztonek's labour is considered to have begun when the first baby was . born because that was when 'the birth had started'. He said Mrs Krzysztonek was kept at the 30 degree angle to 'take pressure off her body'. Dr Mariusz Zimmer led the team that saved Iga and Ignacy . Her contractions were suppressed by . the drug Tokoliza throughout most of the 75 days to prevent her giving . birth to the babies too early. One of the biggest dangers was Mrs Krzysztonek picking up an infection which could have killed her or the babies. 'It would be fair to say that this . situation, throughout the 75 days, was like trying to not jog a live . bomb,' Professor Zimmer said. 'This [labour] started with the . premature birth of Mrs Krzysztonek's first triplet, who had no chance of . survival, and ended with the birth of third triplet. The whole process . was very risky.' Mrs Krzysztonek was not allowed to move from the bed until the birth, and was fed and bathed while tilted in the same position. She added: 'I had to be very . disciplined as I was not allowed to move out of the bed for the whole 75 . days. This was very uncomfortable, but the staff kept me going.

Labour MP Diane Abbott has warned her own leader Ed Miliband not to panic and to be careful to avoid 'dog whistle politics' on immigration. The shadow health minister said the party could be plunged into a downward spiral if it tried too hard to apologise for its record on immigration. The UK Independence Party had made people 'panicky' about immigration but Mr Miliband must resist the temptation to become 'over-anxious' to reassure voters. Labour MP Diane Abbott said the party could be plunged into a downward spiral if it tried too hard to apologise for its record on immigration . Ms Abbott said: 'We are in the middle of a . recession, or as near as damn it. In a recession you always see a rise . in racism and anti-immigrant feeling - you had it in Germany in the . 1930s. 'We have to be very careful about our language because when people are frightened about their future, they want to blame outsiders, they want to blame the other, ' she told the Sky News Murnaghan programme yesterday. 'I know Ed thinks very carefully about what he says on the question, there is nothing he has said I disagree with. 'All parties need to be careful of dog-whistle politics on immigration where the text is fine but the underlying message is one that is maybe not so fine. 'I think the rise of UKIP have made people panicky about immigration, but the truth about the fear of immigration is that it’s just a fear – the more immigrants there are living in your area the less likely you are to worry about it. 'I don’t think Ed Miliband is scared of that kind of message. I think as a party we need to be clear, there’s a danger of a kind of downward spiral, if we kind of panic about UKIP and feel over-anxious about reassuring people on immigration.' Her comments came as the Bulgarian ambassador to the UK lashed out at local election 'propaganda' describing Bulgarian people as a 'threat' to Britain. Konstantin Dimitrov said such messages were 'completely unacceptable' in a European country and said a strong response was required. He singled out UKIP for criticism and blasted the euro-sceptic party as offering 'feeble' messaging. Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband was told not to apologise for its record on immigration . Faith minister Sayeeda Warsi earlier told Murnaghan that David Cameron had made great strides in taking racism out of the immigration debate. She said: 'Politicians are regularly looking for those which can unite us - we talk about values, sometimes we talk about symbols like the Union Flag. 'We have to keep focussing on those things that unite us. Of course there has to be some quite targeted work... but I think we have got to come back to the approach this Government has adopted, which is about focusing on those things that unite us, being very strong against issues of discrimination and protecting those communities who feel they're subjected to hate crime. 'One of the things David Cameron did incredibly well, even in opposition, was to de-racialise the immigration debate. 'Immigration is not about the colour of anyone's skin any more, it's a simple issue of resources at any one time.'","MP said the party could be plunged into a 'downward spiral'

Easy ride: Prisoners are four times less likely to be jailed if they offend in the 'right' areas . Nationwide, just 3.8 per cent of offenders are jailed when they appear before magistrates, the report by the Howard League for Penal Reform found. In England, courts imposed immediate . custodial sentences in 3.8 per cent of cases in 2011, down from 4.9 per . cent in 2001. But the rate in Wales rose over the same period, however, from . 4.0 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Although the discrepancies may appear relatively small, courts are dealing with thousands of cases every day. Overall magistrates jailed 46,000 offenders in 2011 as they handed down 1.2million sentences. The figures show that in Warwickshire just 162 jail terms were handed down during 11,097 sentencing hearings.

Frances Crook, the Howard League for Penal Reform's chief executive, said: 'One cannot ignore the striking . disparity in sentencing trends between different criminal justice areas. 'A short-term prison sentence is a . catastrophe for everyone. It does not help change the life of the person . sentenced – indeed, it is likely to compound issues such as drug . addiction and make them more likely to reoffend. 'It costs the taxpayer a fortune and it does nothing to help victims, who get no recompense or easing of trauma.' Magistrates' courts can jail criminals for a maximum of six months if they have only committed one offence, or a year if they have committed more.

Scroll down for video . Dayna Cline . (pictured), the Leadership Institute Coordinator at Best Buy's . leadership training institute in Richfield is reportedly the employee . Dunn was having an affair with . Her identity came out after Thomas Lee, a reporter from the Star Tribune, tweeted Dunn to ask for a response to the allegations, citing Cline's name. Lee meant to send a private, direct . message, but accidentally pressed the wrong button, sending her name out . into the public domain. He quickly spotted his mistake and deleted the accusatory tweet but reporters from the City Pages blog had already noticed the revealing post and printed a publicly available photograph of Cline online. Best Buy spokesman Bruce Hight said the company would not comment on the identity of the woman involved. Messages sent to Cline were not responded to. In the wake of the scandal Dunn resigned from his position, taking home a hefty payoff of $6.6m to his wife and three sons. Dunn's golden parachute is made up of a $2.85 million severance payment, his previously earned bonus of $1.14 million for fiscal 2012 . and previously awarded stock grants, valued at $2.54 million, as well as unused vacation time. The only catch for the dad-of-three, who last year earned more than $10.2 million, is that he must not work for a competitor for three years, up from the . standard one year that is Best Buy's policy. Best Buy said an investigation by the board had found that the . relationship 'negatively impacted the work environment', but involved no . misuse of company resources. The investigation report detailed how the employee spoke openly in the office about her relationship with Dunn, who gave her tickets to at least seven concerts and sports events, according to the New York Times. They pair met several times for lunches and drinks, both during the week and on weekends. Dunn, a Best Buy veteran, worked for . the company for 28 years, following in the footsteps of his mother, . Ethel, who was an accountant there, Smart Money reported. He had worked in grocery stores since . he was 14, never having gone to university, and made the switch to Best .

Analysts say it's going to be a big . challenge to find a CEO to lead the company in this new era. Up until a . few years ago, Best Buy had been the big bully on the block, pulling . shoppers away from small electronics stores with its massive offerings. Now, in the age of the Internet, those offerings look paltry. In response, Best Buy has been trying to revamp its business.

It's also cutting $800 . million in costs over the next five years. 'Best Buy faces an uphill battle to find the right CEO,' said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush. 'Mr. Dunn's replacement must be prepared to manage the transition from big . box to small box format. A CEO with this experience will be difficult to . find'. The abrupt departure of Dunn, 50, ends a . Best Buy career that spanned nearly three decades. He stated as sales . clerk at a store in Minnetonka, Minn. in the mid-1980s. At the time, the chain was losing sales due to the recession. Best Buy officials were hoping to benefit from the liquidation of the company's main competitor Circuit City, which had was overcome by the growing competition in the sector. But Best Buy never regained its footing. Veteran: Dunn has been with Best Buy for 28 years, and has been its CEO since 2009 . Revenue at stores opened at least a year . - a key measure because it excludes results from stores that open and . close within the year - has declined in three of the past four years. In the most recent fiscal year ended March 3, revenue at stores opened at least a year fell 1.7 per cent last year after having fallen 1.8 per cent in the prior year. The chain lost $1.23billion, or $3.36 per share, compared with a profit of $1.28billion, or $3.08 per share, in the prior year. Its stock also has taken a beating. Best Buy's shares were at $19.67 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading on Monday after initially climbing higher on the CEO departure. Best Buy's shares have lost more than half of their value since April 2006, when they were trading at $56.66 per share.

Meanwhile, sales of lower margin items like tablet computers, smartphones and e-readers have increased. And Best Buy's largest vendor Apple Inc., has become a fierce competitor as its products like iPads have hurt overall computer sales and sucked up shoppers' dollars earmarked for other electronic purchases, says Jefferies & Co. analyst Daniel Binder in a recent note. Adding to that, Best Buy, like other . big-box retailers, is finding that those hulking stores are no longer . attractive to consumers looking for one-stop shopping. Instead, . more people are using them as showrooms to browse for products and then . going online to Amazon.com and other rival sites to buy at a lower . price. Over the past year, Best Buy has made some inroads in shoring up its business. In the community: Dunn is pictured with the first shoppers in line at an Eden Prairie, Minnesota, Best Buy store on Black Friday last year . The company has cut its square footage by 15 per cent in about 43 stores. It did that by either subletting the space to other merchants or giving it back to the landlords. But analysts and industry watchers say Best Buy hasn't moved fast enough to reduce its large foot print. And, they say, Best Buy should close even more stores and take advantage of its fast-growing mobile business. Gary Balter, an analyst at Credit Suisse, says Best Buy's mobile business makes up nearly one-third of the retailer's profits but accounts for less than 10 percent of the overall square footage.

Keeping on: Doreen Lawrence poses in December 2011 with a picture of her murdered son, Stephen . The parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence have vowed never to give up their quest for justice ahead of today’s 20th anniversary of his stabbing. Doreen and Neville Lawrence were united in their message as they tried to gather strength to mark his appalling racist killing. Although 4,500 miles apart – one will attend a memorial service in London, the other will take flowers to Stephen’s grave in Jamaica – they defiantly insisted they have not given up hope that one day all his killers will face justice. Mrs Lawrence vowed to hold the head of Scotland Yard to account over his recent pledge not to close the investigation, while her former husband said he believes detectives could yet nail all those responsible. In January last year, two of the original five suspects accused by the Daily Mail of murdering Stephen in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993 were convicted of his killing after a forensic breakthrough. Drug trafficker Gary Dobson, 37, and gangster’s son David Norris, 36, were jailed for life for their role in the murder. But three of the other prime suspects named by the Mail in its famous front page in February 1997 – brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt and their friend Luke Knight, who all still live in south-east London – continue to evade justice. Senior political figures and Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe are among the VIPs due at a memorial service for Stephen in London today. David Cameron said last night: ‘The senseless killing of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 was a tragedy. Killed: Stephen Lawrence, 18, an aspiring architect, was stabbed to death by a group of five or six racist thugs - all white youths - as he waited for a bus in Eltham, south-east London, on 22 April, 1993 . 'It was also a moment that sparked monumental change in our society – change that has been brought about by the tireless efforts of Stephen’s family in challenging the police, Government and society to examine themselves and ask difficult questions.’ In an article for the Mail, Home Secretary Theresa May says: ‘Stephen’s murder became a catalyst for a drastic, and sometimes agonised, reappraisal of the police’s approach to racist crime. 'Today, it is almost inconceivable that a black woman whose son had been murdered would be treated in the way Doreen Lawrence was in 1993.’ In an interview with the Mail, Mrs Lawrence, 60, conceded that Scotland Yard’s inquiry into her son’s murder cannot go on indefinitely but said the time for it to be shelved had not yet arrived.‘ . Jailed: In January last year, two of the original five suspects accused by the Daily Mail of murdering Stephen - drug trafficker Gary Dobson (left), 37, and gangster's son David Norris (right), 36, were convicted of his killing . Just after the court case last year, there were rumours that certain officers felt that they had gone as far as they could go. Named: Brothers Neil (pictured) and Jamie Acourt and their friend Luke Knight continue to evade justice . ‘I . think at the time I questioned that. Because I feel that, yes, evidence . is now difficult to come by after 20 years and you need that to convict . the other three. ‘But I don’t think they should give up and the fact that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is saying that is good.’ Mr Lawrence, 71, who will say a prayer at his son’s grave in Jamaica with a pastor friend who has flown from England, is equally determined that police continue their investigation. ‘It took us nearly 20 years to get this result [guilty verdicts],’ he said. ‘I do not know if I am going to live another 20 years but I have not given up. I think that all those people who told me to give up do not understand the nature of love.’ Mr Lawrence – who split from Stephen’s mother in 1999 – suggested someone might confess or provide vital information. Stephen, 18, an aspiring architect, was stabbed to death by a group of five or six racist thugs – all white youths – as he waited for a bus in Eltham on 22 April, 1993. Last month Dobson dropped his appeal against his conviction, a move seen by Yard chiefs as an admission of guilt. But Mrs Lawrence said she doubts whether he will ever publicly admit his guilt. Looking ahead to today’s memorial service, she said: ‘I have been feeling very low recently. ‘It is difficult to believe it is 20 years since I saw my son, 20 years of speaking out against racism, 20 years of challenging the police, challenging the Government. 'But one of the things I have always said is that Stephen deserved better. He did not deserve what happened to him.’ Mrs Lawrence said that, in her opinion, the police are still racist and she accused the Government of not doing enough on the issue of racism.

In the 20 years since the ghastly murder of Stephen Lawrence, policing in Britain has been transformed. That is in large part due to the unstinting efforts of Doreen Lawrence, Stephen’s mother, who has pushed and pressured the authorities relentlessly and effectively – first to get the Met’s initial inquiry into Stephen’s murder reviewed, and then to improve the way Britain’s police handle and investigate racist killings. Stephen’s murder became a catalyst for a drastic, and sometimes agonised, reappraisal of the police’s approach to racist crime. The Macpherson Report identified the Met as ‘institutionally racist’, and triggered very significant changes in police practice. Today, it is almost inconceivable that a black woman whose son had been murdered would be treated in the way Doreen Lawrence was in 1993. The police are more sensitive to race issues than they used to be. The toleration of racist banter that used to be such an offensive and depressing characteristic of many police canteens has diminished. No one who cares about policing in Britain can be complacent. There are no grounds for thinking everything is fine and dandy, because it isn’t. There are still racist officers . It is being replaced by the realisation that no officer with racist attitudes can expect to remain in the force. The surveys of black and ethnic minority opinion show that confidence amongst those communities in the police is at a significantly higher level than it used to be in the bad old days. But no one who cares about policing in Britain can be complacent. There are no grounds for thinking everything is fine and dandy, because it isn’t. There are still racist officers. There are also officers who unconsciously treat those whose race is different to their own in unacceptable ways. Though their number is diminishing, there is still a great deal to do before we achieve a police force that is recognised by everyone as treating all members of our community fairly. I believe that the way this Government has restructured policing will help that progress to be achieved. We have replaced diktats from the centre with local control: Police and Crime Commissioners, directly elected by local people, now set your local force’s priorities - and if those priorities do not match yours, for instance because they do not do enough to ensure that the police treat everyone fairly, then you can hold them to account and vote for a Police and Crime Commissioner who will do so. We have established the College of Policing to set professional standards for all officers, and to ensure that every new recruit, and indeed every experienced detective or bobby on the beat, understands and respects those standards. Every force needs to build trust and confidence, and to secure greater co-operation from ethnic minority communities . Every force needs to build trust and confidence, and to secure greater co-operation from ethnic minority communities. I have never thought that those goals can be achieved by having teams of people with titles such as ‘equality and diversity officer’. Our reforms have been dedicated to making the police accountable to the people. I believe that, in time, the result will be police forces that are much more representative of the communities they serve, and which treat everyone with decency, respect and justice. When that goal is finally achieved, it will be a fitting way to commemorate Stephen Lawrence.

Tight couple: The actress and husband Jim Toth, spotted leaving their hotel room Sunday, were released on bail early Friday morning . She also said: 'You're about to find out who I am' and 'You're about to be on national news,' according to the report. Reese said she can't comment further 'out of respect' for the pending case, and her publicist, Meredith O'Sullivan Wasson, offered no other details. According to a police report released on Sunday, Reese was handcuffed and briefly jailed for refusing to obey orders given to her by an officer of the law. Toth was apprehended after midnight on Friday for recklessly weaving across Peachtree Street in the city of Atlanta.

Brunette: Reese went for the darker look for her role in The Good Lie, which she is currently filming in Atlanta .

The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered an inspection of more than 1,000 Boeing 737, the most popular jet model used worldwide, to examine the tail planes for a potentially faulty part which could cause pilots to lose control of the aircraft if it failed. The airworthiness directive issued by the FAA calls on airlines and other operators to replace tail plane fixing pins with improved pins following concerns over how their protective surface coating was applied. The directive comes just days after a Boeing 737, the most commonly used aircraft in the world, crashed off the coast of Bali as the Lion Air flight lost control as the jet approached the runway. It is not immediately believed the fixing pin was a factor in the accident, in which all 108 people aboard survived. The FAA has ordered an inspection of more than 1,000 Boeing 737 jets after finding a potentially catastrophic problem with fixing pins on the tails . 'We are issuing this AD to prevent premature failure of the attach pins, which could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane,' the FAA said in the directive issued on Monday. The airworthiness directive was posted on the website of Federal Register. The FAA said the inspection was 'prompted by reports of an incorrect procedure used to apply the wear and corrosion protective surface coating to attach pins of the horizontal stabilizer rear spar.' FAA said its directive affects 1,050 aircraft flown by U.S. carriers and may cost up to $10.1 million across the fleet, or up to $9,627 per aircraft. The directive applies to models including 737-600, 737-700, 737-700C, 737-800, 737-900, and 737-900ER series aircraft. The FAA order only applies to U.S.-based carriers but foreign governments may adopt similar inspections, the Wall Street Journal reported. The order takes effect in late May and is not expected to have an impact on flight schedules. This Boeing 737 crashed into the sea off the coast of Bali on Saturday but it is not believed to have been caused by the potentially faulty fixing pin . On Saturday, a Boeing 737 smashed into . the sea off the coast of Bali. All 108 people aboard the Lion Air flight . survived and an investigation is underway to determine the crash's . cause. The pilot has described how he felt it 'dragged' down by wind while he struggled to regain control, a person familiar with the matter said. Officials stress it is too early to say what caused the incident, which is being investigated by Indonesian authorities with the assistance of U.S. crash investigators and Boeing. But initial debriefings, witness comments and weather bulletins have focused attention on the possibility of 'wind shear' or a downdraft from storm clouds known as a 'microburst.' Although rare, experts say such violent and localized gusts can leave even the most modern jet helpless if they are stronger than the plane's ability to fly out of trouble - with the critical moments before landing among the most vulnerable. The pilot of the Lion Air jet reported feeling 'dragged' down by a microburst of wind . News of the inspections come a little more than week after Boeing said its successful flight of a 787 should be the final test of the battery problems that have kept the plane grounded. Boeing called the flight 'the final certification test for the new battery system.' It will analyze the data and submit materials to the FAA, which will then decide whether Boeing's battery fix is good enough for airlines to safely fly it again. Final check: A Boeing-owned 787 production plane built for LOT Polish Airlines lands after a demonstration flight last week meant to be the final certification test for the 787's new battery system .","The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered an inspection of the jets .

The lengths of skirts have historically been an indicator of economic downturn and if what is on offer on the high street is anything to go by, the economy is in a dire state. Hemlines have hit their lowest since the 1929 Great Depression, with celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Katie Holmes and Christina Aguilera sporting skirts as long as 33in, below the knee. However according to the Hemline Index, the ‘official’ indicator for skirt-lengths in relation to the economy, says we may be looking at brighter times. Victoria Beckham follows the 'recession' trend in a long skirt of her own design but it was very different in 1997 . The return of the long skirt has . historically been a sure sign of a reclining economy with below-the-knee . skirts featuring heavily in designer shops and high street chains . during recessions. Last time the fashion industries reported maxi skirts on trend was in the early nineties when inflation hit 15 per cent. This is compared to financial highs . such as the 1960s, the time of the creation of the mini skirt and the . later nineties where the economy boomed and 18in skirts were the . norm. 1929 – 1933Hemlines were long during the years of the Great Depression following the Wall Street Crash in 1929. 1960’s .

Although shop windows predict a bleak . autumn when put to the test the Hemline Index show that things are . looking up for both hemlines and the economy. The longer hemline featured heavily on the Autumn/Winter runways last year which is now reflected on the high street. However observations made at the . 2012/13 shows indicate that by the time the catwalk creations become . common fashion we may be out of the recession. The Hemline Index was established by . economist George Taylor at Wharton School of Business in 1926 who . noticed a connection between good times and short skirts. When the economy was good women would . wear higher hemlines to show off the more expensive hosiery compared to . rough times where the skirts would become longer so women could hide . their cheap stockings. Observations were made during the New . York Fashion Week earlier this year where online magazine Business . Insider compared the Hemline Index from Autumn/Winter 2011 collections . with A/W 2012. The Hemline Index rose from 35.04 in 2011 to 44.38 this year. The higher the index the shorter the skirts and, according to George Taylor’s calculations, the better the economy. If this is anything to go by it gives a . more positive prediction than Prime Minister David Cameron who last . month warned that  the dire state of the economy may last until the end . of the decade. ‘I don’t deny for a minute that it is a lot tougher than the forecasters were expecting,’ he told The Daily Telegraph. The British economy has yet to escape . the double-dip recession of last year and economic experts joined the . Prime Minister’s gloomy outlook. The Bank of England’s latest forecast released earlier this week slashed Britain’s predicted growth for 2012 to zero.

A baby who developed a rare condition called a hair tourniquet - where a strand of hair wrapped around her toe and cut off the blood supply - was given a morphine overdose upon arriving at hospital. Olivia Pooley was rushed to Colchester General Hospital after her toe became infected. Although rare, hair tourniquets are most common in babies because their mothers suffer from post-pregnancy hair loss. A stray hair that ends up on clothes can then wrap itself around a child's toe like . cheese wire, cutting off the circulation. Olivia Pooley (with father Daniel) developed a rare condition called a hair tourniquet - where a strand of hair wrapped around her toe and cut off the blood supply . Tourniquets occur when a stray hair ends up on babies mittens and clothes. This can then wrap itself around a child's toe like cheese wire, cutting off the circulation . Infections can develop as the hair cuts into the flesh as it tightens, potentially leading to amputation. Although . most commonly seen as a 'toe touniquet', other appendages such as . fingers, ear lobes and male genitalia can also be affected. Olivia's parents Daniel and Christine noticed her red, swollen foot when they undressed her for bed one night. Surgeons said they had never experienced such a severe and sore case and had to cut through the skin to break the knot. As they operated, nurses gave Olivia morphine, to relieve the pain. Hair tourniquet syndrome is a rare condition that, in half of cases, affects children's toes. The hair is wrapped around the digit by a repetitive movement of the . body part in a confined area, such as hands in mittens or feet and legs . in pyjamas or socks. Babies are particularly at risk due to the post-pregnancy hair loss their mothers experience. Because human hair is so thin and, in the instance of colours like blonde . almost invisible to the naked eye, tourniquets can be misdiagnosed as a foreign body reaction or infection. Infections can develop as the hair cuts into the flesh as it tightens, potentially leading to amputation. Tourniquets are usually identified with a magnifiying glass and then cut away with small scissors. But her parents were horrified to discover that staff had . given the 11-month-old double the recommended dose of morphine. It took staff 45 minutes before they realised Olivia had received 4mg of the powerful painkiller, instead of 2mg. Her father Daniel said: 'I found out they had given her the dose recommended for a 12-year-old, not a baby. 'A doctor told us we had been lucky not to lose her.' Staff then had to perform a lifesaving reversal procedure by injecting drugs directly into a blood vessel. Mr Pooley, 27, said: 'Olivia’s breathing started slowing down where her lungs were too relaxed. 'It was terrifying seeing her out-for-the-count and her all wired up. The worst thing was the lack of information with no-one telling us what was happening to her.' Olivia, who has scabs and scarring to her foot, made a full recovery after spending a day on children’s ward. Surgeons had to cut through the skin to break the knot of hair, but accidentally gave Olivia double recommended dose of morphine, which could have killed her . Olivia, who has scabs and scarring to her foot, has now made a full recovery . Her parents, who also claim she caught gastroenteritis while at the hospital, have lodged an official complaint.

Fed up, Mr Herman invoiced the law firm £10 for every minute he wasted answering their phone calls. He . had not been involved in the accident and, in any event, should not . have received the calls after signing up to the Telephone Preference . Service, which protects homeowners from cold callers. Yesterday, the company sent him a cheque for £230 for bothering him five times over two days. In . a letter to Scott Rees & Co, the company behind the nuisance phone . calls, Mr Herman said: ‘I have been cold called by your telemarketing . about a supposed car accident, despite being registered with the . Telephone Preference Service for years, not being involved in a relevant . car accident, and never having opted in to any telemarketing with you . or anybody else. ‘I . notified [the caller] that if I had to deal with any other calls from . your organisation or people involved with your organisation that I would . be charging £10 per minute for my time, use of phone and electricity. Despite making these efforts to stop being called, I was called yet . again several times. ‘I therefore enclose an invoice for the 23 minutes at £10 a minute, total £230.’ Mr Herman, of Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, said: ‘The number of cold calls I was receiving dramatically dropped after October. But I was very sad and annoyed when I received phone calls lying to me about this supposed car accident.’ Mr Herman was initially contacted by Furious Claims Management, which sells referrals to personal injury lawyers. The company passed his details on to three different law firms, one of which admitted to Mr Herman that it was illegal for solicitors to cold call. Mr Herman has said he is determined to put an end to the nuisance of cold calls . The Solicitors Regulation Authority said: ‘Solicitors cannot pay for referrals from introducers who obtain business cold calling by telephone or in person.’ In a letter to Mr Herman, Scott Rees & Co said: ‘The matters about which you complained related to an organisation entirely separate from this firm. ‘Upon receipt of your complaint, we investigated the matter promptly and in view of the seriousness with which we regarded your complaint, we took the decision to refuse to accept any future referrals of work from that organisation. ‘Notwithstanding that we had no involvement whatsoever in the matters giving rise to your complaint, please find enclosed herewith a cheque in the sum of £230 as a gesture of goodwill on our part to bring this matter to an amicable conclusion.’ Mr Herman, who is overwhelmed by his second victory, said he is determined to put an end to all cold calls. ‘The best Christmas present I could give to anybody would be that they are not cold called,’ he added. ‘I feel angry for society as a whole. Because everybody I meet says they’re oppressed by these calls and it upsets them in their own home.’ He is urging others to follow his example and has set up a website  – www.saynotocoldcalls.com – to help other victims.","Richard Herman has won a payout after being targeted by no-win, no-fee personal injury lawyers .

Cause of death: Matthew Warren, the son of popular American evangelical pastor Rick Warren, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, his autopsy showed . An autopsy has determined that the son of popular U.S. evangelical pastor Rick Warren, found dead in California on Friday, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, an Orange County Sheriff's spokesman said on Monday. Rick Warren said in a letter to staff of his Orange County-based Saddleback Valley Community Church over the weekend that Matthew Warren, 27, committed suicide after a lifelong struggle with depression and mental illness. Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said an autopsy conducted on Monday found that the Matthew Warren had died at around 10 a.m. GMT on Friday at his home in Mission Viejo. He said the cause of death was determined to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Along with leading the Saddleback Church based in Lake Forest, California, Rick Warren is author of the best-selling book 'The Purpose Driven Life' and delivered an invocation at President Barack Obama's first inauguration in January 2009. In his letter to staff at the church, Warren said his son took his own life in 'a momentary wave of despair at his home' after a 'fun evening' with his parents. The pastor described his son as an 'incredibly kind, gentle, and compassionate man. He had a brilliant intellect and a gift for sensing who was most in pain or most uncomfortable in a room.' He said his son struggled with mental illness, depression and suicidal thoughts all of his life. 'In spite of America's best doctors, meds, counselors, and prayers for healing, the torture of mental illness never subsided,' he said. Saddleback, one of the largest evangelical churches in the United States, is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. About 20,000 people attend weekly services at the main campus in Lake Forest and at seven other churches throughout southern California.

The elder Warren founded Saddleback . Church in 1980, according to his biography on the church website, and . watched it grow to 20,000 members and several campuses beyond its home . base of Lake Forest. Already well-known among evangelical . Christians, he became a national celebrity in 2002 with the publication . of the multimillion-selling book ""The Purpose Driven Life,"" whose . popularity reached far beyond the usual religious readers. Scores of tributes poured in on social media, with supporters posting words of encouragement and prayers to the Saddleback Facebook page. 'Our hearts ache for you. We love you and are holding you close in our prayers. God bless you and give you strength,' one mourner wrote, with another adding, 'Matthew is home, free of all the pain he felt.' 'All I can think is that he wants his parents to have a happy last memory. He's with God and he is whole again.' Megachurch pastor Greg Laurie lost his 33-year-old son in a car crash in 2008 and offered his condolences to the Warren family. 'At times like these, there really are no words, but there is the Word. There is no manual, but there is Emmanuel,' he said in a statement on the Gospel Coalition website. Warren, 59, is one of the leading voices in the evangelical movement in America. His . church, located in Orange County, is ranked the seventh largest . congregation in the U.S. with an average weekly attendance of 20,000. The Southern Baptist pastor authored the Purpose Driven Life, a devotional study book, that was published in 2002 and became a New York Times bestseller, selling over 32 million copies as it exploded as a popular trend among conservative Christians.

The heir to a vast but abandoned English . estate has been revealed as a talented, free-spirited college professor with connections to the legendary aviation family the Lindberghs. John Figg-Hoblyn died on June 12, 2011 aged 85 at a nursing home in California. For more than 40 years, the heir had little to do with his Hoblyn estate in Cornwall with its enormous manor house and 300 acres worth $7.5million . Following years of legal . wranglings over the estate's century-old will, it was finally sold this year. The proceeds, amounting to almost $4million, will be split between Mr Figg-Hoblyn's . two elderly sisters Anne and Margaret in California. American heir: John Paget Figg-Hoblyn, pictured as a younger man. The Californian professor stood to inherit a vast English estate but ignored it and died impoverished aged 85 in a nursing home . How the life of a Stanford University-educated ancestor of English gentry spiraled into bankruptcy and ill health, has been revealed to MailOnline by Mr Figg-Hoblyn's close friend Ron Libert. John was born and raised in Santa Barbara County, California with his sisters Anne and Margaret (known as Peggy). His father Francis was a high school principal in the area. Mr Figg-Hoblyn's mother liked to travel and lived separately from their father once the three children had grown up. Free spirit: John Figg-Hoblyn was educated at Stanford, loved nature and adventure stories . As a young man, John studied at Stanford University, where he was on the track team and excelled in his major Biology. In the summer, he went on college expeditions to identify native fauna in regions like the Gulf of California. Mr Figg-Hoblyn was a close friend of the second son of aviator Charles Lindbergh. Jon Lindbergh was a renowned diver and a pioneer of cage diving who studied marine biology at Stanford. In his youth, John Figg-Hoblyn was extremely handsome but, according to Mr Libert, had no known romances and he never married. After gaining his Masters degree, Mr Figg-Hoblyn took up a teaching post at Stanford and later taught at San Jose University. Upon the death of his father in 1965, John moved into the family home in Santa Barbara with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. His sister Margaret, who was around ten years younger than John, also attended Stanford University. Margaret, known as 'Peggy', was involved in organic agriculture and established the Farmers' Market in Santa Barbara alongside her elder brother. Around 2005, Mr Figg-Hoblyn suffered a . stroke and his sister became his only carer, defying any use of Western . medicine and relying on her own remedies. The brother and sister moved to the Ojai Valley in Ventura County the following year. The way it was: This archive photo from the 1930s shows Fir Hill manor in all its pride on the Hoblyn estate in Cornwall . Falling down: This derelict remains of the 19th century Fir Hill manor house on the Hoblyn estate in Cornwall. The estate ran to ruin after lying uncared for over 40 years . He told MailOnline: 'I met John and Margaret in late 2006 and . decided to help them with their legal problems. I visited with John . frequently and I would take them to church on Sundays. 'They . ended up living in an old camper and were content, having no debts and . living quite simply on their combined Social Security checks of $1,400 . monthly. 'John only talked to people he felt . comfortable with. He could read out loud in a strong voice and loved to . read adventure stories and stories of the Old West.' However . Mr Libert said that the fortunes of the free-spirited Mr Figg-Hoblyn . changed when a relative filed a lawsuit to become . John's guardian. Mr . Libert added: 'Peggy ignored the court summons until an attorney . representing the Probate Court served them personally.  From that day . on, their life spiraled down hill.' Mr . Libert had a friend represent Mr Figg-Hoblyn pro bono - where a judge . handed over guardianship to Bank of America, including his possession . and Social Security checks. Fellow adventurous spirit: Stanford University graduate student Jon Lindbergh, son of aviator Charles Lindbergh, was a close friend of John Figg-Hoblyn . His friend continued: 'It was then reported that Margaret was not taking good care of John. He was placed in a ''guest home'' subject to only approved visitors and limited outings.' Following the death of the rightful heir to Hoblyn estate two years ago, the property and vast lands once again were open to dispute. The next male heir - the only person who wanted to restore the estate to its former glory - has been left with a vastly reduced sum because of a change to the century-old will. The legal document had originally said that only a male heir could inherit the lands and 19th-century Fir Hill manor house. Esteemed: Mr Figg-Hoblyn excelled in his studies at Stanford University and later went on to teach at the college . John Figgs-Hoblyn never indicated to the British High Court that he wanted to accept Hoblyn Estate after the death of his father Francis in 1965. This meant it was prevented from passing to the second-in-line, his cousin and only male heir, John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn. The retired farmer and father-of-four from Missouri said that he  wanted to live and work on the family estate. The British courts recognized Mr Westropp as a legitimate heir. However because of the legal impasse, Hoblyn Estate lay empty. Over the years, the mansion fell into disrepair after lying empty and unloved while the land and gardens became overgrown. Parts of the estate were sold off to pay death duties and administration costs. Cut out: John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn, pictured with his wife, visits the estate which he was due to inherit as the only male heir before changes to the will cut him out . Mr Figg-Hoblyn's death allowed the destiny of the estate to be decided by a judge at the Court of Protection in London. An original clause which said the estate would pass to a male heir was cut out and the sale proceeds of the . estate split between John Paget's next-of-kin, his elderly sisters in . California. Some £130,000 (around $200,000) will go to the closest surviving male heir, John Westropp, their cousin. Britain's Official Solicitor, who deals with such property matters, tried in vain to contact John Figg-Hoblyn about his vast inheritance 30 years ago. In 1985, the Official Solicitor wrote: . ‘John Paget Figg-Hoblyn, by the stroke of a pen and by meeting some . other details, can take over the property. 'Yet I do not know his . address.’ The history of Hoblyn Estate has long been marked with scandal and family tragedy. In 1856, William Paget Hoblyn was the first to move into Fir Hill Manor. He lived there in grandeur with his wife, son and four daughters. William Paget Hoblyn with three of his children, Ernest, Wilhelmin and Rosalind . However their idyllic life came to be tainted by a bitter legal battle surrounding William Paget Hoblyn's will. The estate, according to legal documents drawn up by a previous owner, was intended to pass to the eldest male heir. However William Paget Hoblyn also wanted his daughters to share in the property. However . Hoblyn's eldest son Ernest, a known heavy drinker, challenged the legal . changes while his father was still alive. Ernest lost the battle . against his sisters soon after his father died and shortly before his . own early death. The . Cornish estate was then thrown into turmoil. With only four Hoblyn . daughters left - all spinsters and with no male heir - no one could . inherit the house and lands. Two remained spinsters and one married . but did not have children. And the fourth sister scandalized local . society with her love life. When she was 19, she ran off to South . Africa with coachman John Jones who was in his thirties and married . with four sons. Rosalind soon regretted her actions. The Western Morning News reported in April 1882: . ‘The unfortunate girl’s story was a pitiful one. 'She wished herself . back home within 24 hours of leaving, and left her swain distinguishing . himself as a waiter at an hotel.’ Her parents were on the dockside to greet her on her return to Plymouth, Devon. She found a more suitable partner in Thomas Richard Figg, a tea broker's son, and they married in March 1884. The couple moved to Canada and then to California, and their four children took the surname Figg-Hoblyn. Rosalind’s . eldest son Francis Figg-Hoblyn, a gold miner in California, was due to . take over the estate on the deaths of his mother and Cornish aunts. In . 1947, he visited the estate and invited the tenant farmers to a meeting . at Colan to announce his intention of restoring the estate to its . former glory. However . Francis was annoyed that his elderly aunts had let the estate become run . down. He would not sign a document saying that he was satisfied the . estate and would take it on. He . returned to California and died in 1965. The estate then passed to his . eldest son John Paget where the legal wranglings continued until this . year. Derek . Luscombe, vice-chairman of Colan Parish Council said recently that he . was delighted the long-running will dispute was finally settled. He said . it gave a chance for the estate to be rejuvenated. Mr Luscombe said . that just before Christmas, Charlie Hoblyn, a distant cousin of John . Paget, addressed Colan Parish Council with plans to open a new campsite . on part of the estate he had just bought. That plan will be subject to . planning approval from Cornwall Council. ‘Most people have forgotten the estate is there because the dispute went on so long,' Mr Luscombe added. But I think locals will be pleased to know it's finally been settled.’ Crumbling: This picture shows the stable block at Fir Hill manor on the estate in Cornwall .","John Figg-Hoblyn, a marine biologist in California, lived a low-key existence with his sister Peggy in an RV .

Buddhist monks strive to reach spiritual enlightenment but their growing Buddha-sized bellies might stop them achieving nirvana. A health study of Buddhist monks in Thailand has found that nearly half of them are obese. They blame their weight gain on sweet treats given to them by worshipers and officials have decided that what the monks need is a diet plan. Obese monks: Almost half of the Buddhist monks studied in Thailand are clinically obese and 40 per cent face lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure . A study of 246  monks from the Dhammayuttika Nikaya and Mahayana movements  in 11 Thai provinces revealed that nearly half of them are clinically obese and suffering from lifestyle diseases such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. The research pointed to the oily, sweet foods monks are offered by worshipers as the reason behind their unhealthy lifestyle. Food is traditionally offered to monks as they beg for food on the streets to survive. Beg to survive: Monks eat one or two meals a day, their last by noon but they also beg for food on the streets which is where they are given unhealthy treats which have been blamed for the weight gain . The monks leave their monasteries . early in the morning and walk single file, with the oldest monk first, . with their bowls in front of them, collecting food from people as they . go. The monks do not do much exercise either according to the study. It said: 'To make matters worse, the . only exercise an average monk takes is sweeping the courtyard and . walking the streets asking for alms, or food.' Monks not laughing: While the laughing Buddha statue is a common symbol of Buddhism, it might be sending the wrong message to Thai Buddhist monks . Figures showed that 45 per cent of the monks in the study were either obese or morbidly obese and 40 per cent face diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. They are also more likely to develop allergies due to their rich, oily, sugary diet. A major cause was the amount of fizzy, sugar-loaded drinks drunk by monks, particularly in the evenings when they abstain from eating. Only 21 per cent of the monks questioned have regular health check-ups and doctor visits. Like Friar Tuck: Playing the portly Friar Tuck, Robin Hood's jovial companion in the 1950s TV series actor Alexander Gauge was another monk told he was unhealthily overweight . Health officials now plan a food education program to help the huge holy men to slim down. They hope to offer dietary and exercise advice appropriate for their lifestyles, teaching about them about nutritional alternatives to their unhealthy food and drink choices. They also plan to prepare guidelines on what worshipers should and should not offer to their holy men in order to keep them healthy. It is believed that the giving and . receiving of alms creates a spiritual connection between the monastic . and lay communities who make the offerings. Some monks eat their only one meal a day, others eat two but all of them have consumed their last meal by midday. Their diet consists of staples, desserts, preserved and dried food, fish and meat.","Nearly half of Thailand's monks are clinically obese and 40 per cent have lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure .

Details of the trip - and of the report's publication - emerged a day after Mayor of London Boris Johnson warned MPs against jettisoning centuries of British freedom by shackling the Press as a senior Cabinet minister openly mocked the inquiry into media standards. Described in publicity as the 'Chair . of the UK Leveson Inquiry', Lord Justice Leveson will be among a host of experts to speak . at the day-long symposium, billed as 'one of the key privacy events of the year', according The Times. He will then jet to Melbourne five days later to deliver a second oration on 'News . Gathering in a Time of Change'. Tickets for this event, which are free . so long as audience members book in advance, have already sold out. Margaret Simons, director of Melbourne . University's Centre for Advanced Journalism, which is hosting the . December 12 event, says in the release: 'Sir Brian's lecture will raise . issues that must be at the heart of any discussion about the way . journalists go about their work: how do we protect the vital role that . journalists have in our liberal democracies and, at the same time, hold . them to account for the ways in which they do their work?' She told The Times of her . surprise that Lord Leveson accepted her invitation, adding: 'Frankly, . when I invited him I thought it was a million to one, but he said . ""yes"".' A spokesman for the Judicial Office said:  'Lord Justice Leveson has received invitations to speak from two universities in Australia in December. 'Unmissable': Described on the event's flyer (pictured) as the 'Chair of the UK Leveson Inquiry', Lord Justice Leveson will be among a host of experts to speak at the day-long symposium, billed as 'one of the key privacy events of the year' 'He . has accepted those invitations, subject to him having completed and . published his Report by then and on the understanding that he is not . going to speak about the content of, or the recommendations in, his . report.  His travel costs will be met by the universities.' Meanwhile, it was announced today that the long-awaited report from the first . part of his wide-ranging probe into press standards will be released . next Thursday in which he is expected to call for a new Press regulator backed by law. Lord Justice Leveson and his panel of . advisors have heard months of evidence - some explosive - from key figures . including celebrities, lawyers, politicians and journalists. No censorship: Mayor of London Boris Johnson has told MPs to reject regulation of the press . Formal evidence started on November . 14, 2011, and, according to its website, the inquiry sat for a total of . 88 days up to and including June 30 this year. The final report will reveal Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations for the future regulation of the British press. The first part of the probe, which . started in September last year, looked at the culture, practices and . ethics of the press in general and its final report will be published at 1.30pm on November 29 followed by an 'on-camera statement', the inquiry announced today. The inquiry said it will be available on its website once it has been laid in both Houses of Parliament. But there are concerns that his recommendations could stifle press freedom, a liberty Britain has prided itself on for centuries. Speaking at an awards ceremony last night, London Mayor Boris Johnson made clear his opposition to any form of state regulation of the Press. He said MPs must resist the temptation to take revenge on the Press by imposing state regulation. ‘MPs, don’t you for a minute think about regulating the Press, which has been free in this country for centuries,’ he said at the annual Spectator magazine political awards in London, where he was named politician of the year. He was cheered loudly by an audience comprising senior media and political figures, including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Education Secretary Michael Gove. Mr Gove, who was presenting the awards, took a swipe at Lord Justice Leveson by suggesting he needed ‘lessons in freedom of speech’. He had clashed with the judge over Press freedom while giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry earlier this year. Anticipation: Lord Justice Leveson is expected to call for a new Press regulator backed by law when he delivers his long awaited report next Thursday . In . his speech yesterday Mr Gove, a former Times journalist, joked that . Speaker’s wife Sally Bercow deserved the 'Lembit Opik memorial award for . distinguished contributions to moral seriousness in public life'. He . also said her husband John deserved both the ‘Fox News Fair and . Balanced award for perfect objectivity and the Kim Kardashian memorial . thong for relentless self-effacement and shirking of the limelight'. Turning . to the Leveson Inquiry, he went on: 'It’s also a pity that His Honour . Brian Leveson cannot be here so he could receive the Bureau of . Investigative Journalism award for commitment to truth-telling for his . wonderful comments: ""I don’t really need any lessons in freedom of . speech, Mr Gove, really I don't"".' Accolade: Mr Johnson collects his award for Politician of the Year as Education Secretary Michael Gove looks on at this year's Spectator Magazine's Parliamentarian of the Year Awards in central London. Mr Gove suggested Lord Justice Leveson needed 'lessons in free speech' The . Bureau of Investigative Journalism helped produce the disastrous . Newsnight investigation into child abuse that falsely suggested Tory . peer Lord McAlpine had been involved in abusing boys at North Wales care . homes. The organisation’s managing editor . Iain Overton has since resigned over the affair. Its trustees include . Sir David Bell, a senior adviser to the Leveson Inquiry. During the inquiry the BIJ called for . a levy on the media to fund organisations like itself, which it said . produced ‘gold standard’ journalism. Speaking . during business questions in the Commons, Leader of the House Andrew . Lansley said today: 'Lord Justice Leveson intends to publish his report . on November 29, the Prime Minister plans to make a statement to the . House subsequently. 'On Monday December 3, there will be a general debate on the Leveson Inquiry.' Speaking . earlier, Culture Secretary Maria Miller urged MPs to await next week's . publication before rushing to judgment on how to reform newspaper . regulation, but she said the status quo was 'not an option'. Speaking . at Commons questions, she added: 'The principles that will drive any . solution to the problems we face with regards to the Press are that we . need to have an independent regulator that needs to be tough and . certainly doing everything to preserve free speech.' Stinging: In his speech Mr Gove, a former Times journalist, joked that Speaker's wife Sally Bercow, right, deserved the 'Lembit Opik memorial award for distinguished contributions to moral seriousness in public life' Labour's former culture secretary Ben . Bradshaw accused Cabinet ministers of repeatedly trying to undermine . Lord Justice Leveson's report in the run-up to publication. Yesterday victims of Press intrusion . and members of the Hacked Off campaign groups met separately with David . Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg at Westminster to urge them to . implement Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations in full. They . included Kate McCann and Chris Jefferies, who was caught up in coverage . of the investigation into the murder of Bristol landscape architect . Joanna Yeates. He said the party leaders had made clear the ‘status quo cannot be allowed to continue’ and were ‘all committed to change’. Brian Cathcart, director of Hacked Off, said the three leaders had agreed that ‘radical change’ was needed in Press regulation. He said they had agreed that a cross-party approach would be preferable, but they did not agree to a request from the group to hold cross-party talks before giving their responses to Lord Justice Leveson’s findings. Meanwhile the architect of a new regulator of the Press proposed by the newspaper industry said that Richard Desmond, owner of the Daily Star and Daily Express, has agreed to sign up to the body. One of the arguments against the existing Press Complaints Commission is that Mr Desmond’s newspaper group is currently no longer a member. But Lord Black, a co-founder of the proposed new regulator alongside Lord Hunt, the PCC chairman, told BBC Radio 4’s The Media Show that there was widespread support for the new body which would be ‘the friend of good journalism and the scourge of bad journalism’. Asked how the new regulator will get round the ‘Desmond problem’ and ensure full co-operation from all the main newspaper groups, Lord Black said: ‘I am confident that all publishers will sign up.’ Pushed by presenter Steve Hewlett on whether Mr Desmond had personally agreed to co-operate with the proposed new regime, Lord Black added: ‘Yes, he made that clear at the time of the Leveson Inquiry. He has made it clear since then.’","It was announced the report from the first part of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards will be released next Thursday .

"Cowell admits he once had a threesome with two women . Had a blind date with Denise Richards when she was heavily pregnant with Charlie Sheen's baby . Described condoms as 'something worn when you're 17' By . Liz Thomas In Los Angeles and Emily Sheridan . UPDATED: . 10:54 EST, 8 September 2011 . Simon Cowell raised fresh questions about the state of his relationship with fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy, after admitting he doesn't know if they are still engaged. The music mogul added fuel to speculation the pair are having problems. In an awkward phone interview with notorious DJ Howard Stern in America, he struggled to explain the state of the relationship. Are they or aren't they? Simon Cowell told DJ Howard Stern that he was 'not sure' if he was still engaged to Mezhgan Hussainy, seen here with him in March 2010, the month after they became betrothed . Asked if he was engaged, the 51-year-old said he was 'not sure'. Stern also said to Cowell: 'You seem embarrassed by the women you date, and I'll tell you why, they are lovely women, but yet you won't talk about about them. 'I'm a married man and if someone asks me a question about her I am proud to admit I have a relationship.' Cowell replied: 'If we were having this conversation off the radio I could have a normal conversation.' Stern then asked: 'Why is the question ""are you engaged?"" so painful to you?' Is it all over? Simon and Mezhgan were last snapped together in public seven months ago . The DJ and co-host asked why Cowell went to the pretence of having an engagement if he did not plan to marry. Clearly annoyed, Cowell spoke of their betrothal in past tense as he insisted the it 'wasn't a pretence of an engagement' but said he would only discuss the situation further. His response comes 18 months after he announced his engagement to the 38-year-old make-up artist. Confused: Howard Stern, seen here with wife Beth, made Cowell squirm as he questioned why he did not want to talk about his relationship . Cowell and make-up artist Miss Hussainy have been together for almost two years, and were initially inseparable. They became engaged after a whirlwind romance and Cowell spoke publicly of his love for the Afghan-born beauty - even suggesting he would like children with her. His engagement and talk of children came as a surprise because he had long said he had no desire to wed or have babies. But in recent months the couple have been rarely seen together and his mother Julie is even reported to have revealed the pair had taken a break. And in the latest issue of the American GQ he ruled out having kids and said: 'Truthfully, with the schedule, the crazy hours, I don't think it would work... With the way I live my life, I wouldn't have the patience. I'd sort of want people born at the age of 10.' Spokesman Max Clifford said: 'He likes to keep (his relationship) private. In terms of the relationship, it is long distance. He is back in England at the moment, and when he goes back she will be doing things. When he goes back to the States, she will be doing stuff. To my knowledge they are not having any problems.' Yesterday, his spokeswoman said: 'Simon was just making it clear he doesn't discuss his relationships.' The star also confessed to having a 'threesome' when he was younger and dating Denise Richards when she was . heavily pregnant with ex-husband Charlie Sheen's child. Discussing his ménage-a-trois, he . recalled: 'Do you mean like a threesome? Yeah, years and years ago... I . mean a long, long time ago, I was with these two girls and ended up in . bed. It was cool. It was a lot of fun.' Date or group dinner? Cowell and Denise Richards appeared to differ over the definition of their meeting . He also said he was set up with former Bond girl Richards in 2005, when she was pregnant with her daughter Lola... although he mistakenly called her 'Denise Lewis' before being corrected by Stern. He said: 'We arranged to meet at a hotel polo lounge. She turned up eight months pregnant and had a dog in her handbag.' When asked if her pregnancy put him off, he said: 'A little bit. But she is gorgeous. I liked her a lot, I think she's cute, funny, a bit of a wacko...but I like that. She's a great girl.' However, Richards wrote on her Twitter last night she didn't see their meeting as a 'date'. She wrote: 'I was at a group dinner 8mo pregnant not sure how that's considered a date, news to me! If I was being set up I didn't know it! 'S**t I wish I knew that it was a date!!! He's a hot piece of a*s!' Cowell was also asked about what contraception he used and described condoms as 'something you wore when you were 17 or something'. When asked what contraceptive methods he used, he replied: 'There are other alternative methods, I can talk to you about them Howard.'

"By . Louise Eccles . PUBLISHED: . 05:32 EST, 25 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:45 EST, 25 April 2013 . 'Attack': Malcolm Blackman, 45, allegedly twice raped a woman inside the Occupy London protest camp . An anarchist leader twice raped a woman at the infamous protest camp on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. The alleged assaults happened at the squalid tent city set up by hundreds of anti-capitalists in the Occupy London group. Malcolm Blackman, self-styled leader of computer hacking group Anonymous UK, raped the woman in her tent twice in seven days, including once when she had passed out drunk, the court heard. The woman sobbed as she told the jury why she had not informed other Occupy members about the alleged rapes. ‘It was all, protest, protest, protest, and if you had any personal issues you were out of line,’ she said. She was scared to report the rapes for fear of upsetting the ‘togetherness’ of the group, which reportedly encouraged members to ‘focus on the protests’. The woman also claims she was raped a third time and her hands violently bound with plastic ties – although Blackman, 45, has not been charged with this alleged offence. Blackman apparently acted as a ‘leader’ and spokesman for Anonymous UK, the British wing of the global internet hacking group that carries out cyber attacks on capitalist targets and governments. The court heard that he started a sexual relationship with the woman shortly after they met at the makeshift encampment in November 2011. He moved into her four-man tent in the new year after claiming the zip on his tent was broken. The woman said: ‘He was a welcoming sort of character, people turned to him. He seemed to be a leader sort of person.’ But on January 14, while they were kissing in her tent, he apparently pulled plastic ties from his pocket and roughly tightened them around her wrists, before raping her. Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said: ‘One minute it all seemed to be normal and the next minute he’s putting ties round my wrists and it’s really hurting. He held my hands in one hand and he put the ties round really quickly.’ Protest site: The woman was allegedly attacked twice by Blackman, 45, inside the central London camp . Afterwards he cut the ties and she lay . sobbing while he fell asleep, she claimed. Asked why she did not tell . anyone, she replied: ‘I was ashamed and embarrassed. I didn’t know if it . was me perhaps not being experienced in a relationship. I saw it as . something I had done wrong in some way.’ When asked why she had not evicted him . from her tent after that, she said: ‘I could have but I didn’t. 'He was a . very strong character and I was probably frightened of upsetting the . general togetherness of the camp. I wanted to keep quiet, to keep in the . background and not make a big issue of it.’ 'It was all, protest, protest, protest, and if you had any personal issues you were out of line' Woman . The woman would spend every weekend at St Paul’s, returning to her job and home in London in the week. The following Saturday, January 21, she returned to the camp and drank brandy and wine with other protesters. Later that night, Blackman went into her tent and they had a conversation before she apparently ‘passed out’. She said the next thing she remembered . was him assaulting her, but she was too ‘shocked’ to protest and he . later fell asleep in the tent. Camp: Blackman frequently spoke to the media on behalf of Anonymous UK during the Occupy London protest . ‘I was scared of him,’ she said. ‘I was . confused about what to do. I was confused about the relationship.’ Activists spent much of their time at the St Paul’s camp drinking instead of protesting, the Old Bailey heard. During the Occupy protest, between October 2011 and February 2012, some of those involved spent the days inside each other’s tents downing bottles of whisky, brandy and other spirits donated by supporters. When they did attend protests, including those outside the US embassy and the Bank of England, they would return to the camp via ‘a few drinks’ in the pub. Giving evidence against Malcolm Blackman, the alleged victim said: ‘There was a lot of drinking going on. Malcolm would drink most of the day. Other people would drink during the day.’ She recalled spending one day drinking wine and brandy, another sharing a bottle of whisky. Blackman was linked to another protester around the time he was seeing the alleged rape victim, the court heard. Jurors were played footage of the carnival atmosphere at the camp, with people performing juggling acts, waving flags and dancing on the cathedral steps. In lieu of security, the camp had a ‘tranquillity tent’ where people were encouraged to go to discuss any problems. The woman, who said her feelings for . Blackman were ‘complicated’, returned to the camp on January 28, and . went to a pub with other members. In the evening she had a row with . Blackman. She alleges they both later fell asleep in the same tent, . along with a third man, something Blackman denies. She told the court she awoke to find a . belt tied around her neck in a noose. Blackman allegedly forced her to . perform a sex act on him. ‘He was quite forceful,’ she told the . court. ‘He said, “You know you want it”.’ She said Blackman then told . her she was ‘too touchy feely’, before climbing back into his sleeping . bag. The woman did not report the rape until June, by which time there was bitter in-fighting in Anonymous UK. Gordon Ross, defending, claimed the woman had invented the allegations against Blackman because she wanted to ‘take him down’. ‘Effectively what you and others were trying to do was destroy him and his leadership of Anonymous UK,’ he said. The woman admitted she was expelled . from the Anonymous Facebook group by Blackman, along with others, after . angry exchanges about the group. She also admitted confronting him over a . relationship he had started with another woman. The Occupy London camp – in which . Anonymous UK members camped closest to the cathedral – remained at the . site for more than four months before being broken up by police in . February last year. Blackman, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, denies two counts of rape. The trial continues.

He suffered severe head injuries after falling more than 300ft . A heartbroken family have paid tribute to a 'fearless and sports loving' Oxford University graduate who was killed after a climbing accident in the Scottish mountains. Jack Wooding, 29, suffered severe head injuries after falling more than 300ft and had to be airlifted from the side of the snow covered mountain by a rescue helicopter team before being taken to hospital. Mr Wooding, a legal expert, was an experienced climber but according to his twin George, he was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident as it was 'just a gentle slope' and although he tried to stop himself with an ice axe as he slipped, he was unable to do so. The accident happened at a location . known as Aladdin's Mirror in the Cairngorms near Aviemore and he was . taken first to Inverness and then onto Aberdeen hospital after his . climbing partner alerted emergency services. His . father Eric, mother Margaret, sister Mona and George, rushed to his . bedside from their home in Ashtead near Dorking, Surrey, where doctors . told them he had suffered 'unsurvivable brain injuries' and he died 24 . hours later without regaining consciousness. Jack . had worked at the London chambers of Herbert Smith for several years . but left there four months ago to start work as a legal adviser at the . Department of Transport. As . the family cleared his flat in Tower Hamlets, East London, George paid . tribute to his twin, who graduated with a double first in politics and . modern history from Oxford, and said: 'He had many sides to him. He loved . extreme sports. He was so happy when he was ice climbing, mountain . biking or ski-ing. We just about managed to talk him out of moto cross. That's the type of guy he was. 'He had another side to him as well - he was funny and also gentle and soft. He was very intellectual and would write indepth legal articles for his work. He had only recently changed jobs and had also worked at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the past as well. Mr Wooding, pictured, was doing a climb known as Aladdin's Mirror in the Cairngorms. He had to be evacuated from the mountain by helicopter . 'He had lots of friends and was adored by everyone both locally and in London. The accident was just one of those things. He slipped in the snow and the momentum carried him down. It was a gentle slope - nothing more than Box Hill near where we live - and he didn't need ropes or a helmet. 'We spoke to the mountain rescue people and they said it was approachable and it wasn't too dangerous. It was just the momentum - I suppose if he had ropes and a helmet he would have been OK.

He tried to stop himself but he couldn't. It's just so sad that he has lost his life because he had so much potential. The only comfort we have is that he died doing something he enjoyed.' - Jack's twin brother . Mr Wooding said of the slope where his son was killed: 'They had done a risk assessment of it. They thought they didn't need ropes and helmets, they didn't see any great problems. But even with an axe he couldn't stop himself. jack didn't do things by halves. He had physical courage, he was a brave man. He liked the riskiness of climbing.' Jack was also a member of the Alpine Club, which was founded in 1857, which has described itself as 'a club of English gentleman devoted to mountaineering, first of all in the Alps, members of which have successfully addressed themselves to attempts of the kind on loftier mountains.' Members paid tribute to him on the club website where was described as 'aspirant' and fellow climber John Evans wrote: 'Sad news indeed he was a lovely bloke, a gentle sort but full of enthusiasm.'

The jury in the trial of a New York police officer accused of conspiring to cannibalism were forced to watch a video of a woman made to appear to be cooked over an open flame. The evidence, taken from websites devoted to torturing and eating women visited by Officer Gilberto Valle, also included images of women with apples in their mouths and instructions on ‘how to cook a girl’. The government rested a week after it began trying to prove that Valle tried to conspire with others on the Internet to kidnap, kill and cannibalize six women, including friends and his wife. On trial: Gilberto Valle visited websites containing instructions on how to tie up, 'chloroform' and cook a girl . Earlier, FBI computer forensics . examiner Stephen Flatly testified Valle frequently visited websites . showing women being tortured, including one that offered images of women . who did not survive. ‘Some are dead. A couple of them appeared to have been strangled,’ he said. As Mr Flatly described the images . displayed on video monitors in federal court in Manhattan, shocked . jurors put hands to their mouths and displayed other signs of distress. One cannibalism website allegedly visited by Valle promised customers they would ‘only receive the highest quality human beef.’ The jury also heard how the officer . allegedly looked up ‘how to tie up a girl,’ ''human meat recipes,’ ‘how . to chloroform a girl,’ ‘I want to sell a girl slave,’ ‘how to cook a . girl,’ ‘death fetish’ and ‘huge cooking tray’ among other topics the . defense says were part of a fetish fantasy that never posed a real . threat. View of Federal Courthouse in Manhattan where the trial of New York Police Department officer Gilberto Valle, accused of conspiring to kidnap women that he planned to cook and eat, began . An undated photo submitted as evidence shows Gilberto Valle with his daughter. Valle is accused of conspiracy to kidnap a woman and unauthorized use of a law enforcement database that prosecutors say he used to help build a list of potential targets . The video showed to the jury, which . was found by the FBI on Valle’s computer, is apparently staged and shows . a naked, screaming woman hanging over an open flame. Two images of naked women roasting on a . giant spit were discovered in a computer file of several dozen . photographs that Valle kept on a former college friend whom prosecutors . have identified as a target of the alleged plot. The face of one woman prosecutors say he targeted was cut out and pasted onto a cartoon of a woman being boiled in a pot. Prosecutors also had wanted to present . as many as 34 exhibits of even more ghastly images found on Valle's . computer depicting women being tortured, dead bodies and body parts. They include a picture of a dead body . with the feet cut off which Valle's wife testified she saw when she went . to one of his favorite sites and discovered why he stayed up late . online. However U.S. District Judge Paul . Gardephe ruled they were not admissible because they were automatically . stored in cache files on Valle's computer. ‘What we don't have is proof that he ever saw the images here,’ he said at the start of the second week of the trial.

The browsing history also showed that . an article titled ‘Cannibalism can be addictive, expert says’ and . Facebook pages of alleged targets were viewed. As soon as the government finished, . defense lawyers asked the judge to acquit their client, saying . prosecutors failed to present sufficient evidence to let a jury decide . whether Valle planned to carry out a crime. A judge reserved decision. Defense attorney Julia Gatto said it has not yet been decided whether . the officer will testify. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors . claimed the 28-year-old was involved in online chats with a Pakistani . man to whom he offered his ex wife for meat.

Tens of thousands of people have signed an online petition calling for British CNN host Piers Morgan to be deported from the U.S. over his gun control views. Morgan has demanded tighter U.S. gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre and last week on Piers Morgan Tonight, he interviewed a gun advocate and called him an 'unbelievably stupid man'.

Divisive: A petition has been launched to deport Piers Morgan after he has taken a strict stance on gun laws . The petition accuses Morgan of engaging in a 'hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution' by targeting the Second Amendment - the right to bear arms. It has already garnered more than 42,000 signatures - far exceeding the 25,000 signature threshold required to get a White House response. But Morgan seemed unfazed by the effort to oust him. In a series of Twitter messages, he urged his followers to sign the petition and in response to one article about the petition even said: 'Bring it on'. He wrote: 'If I do get . deported from America for wanting fewer gun murders, are there any other . countries that will have me?' Speaking out: The petition had already garnered more than 40,000 signatures by Monday afternoon . He also insisted that he is not attacking the .

In response to the petition, Jeremy Clarkson, the British Top Gear presenter, added on Twitter: 'Americans. It took us 40 years . to get rid of Piers Morgan. Pleease don't send him back.' Morgan will have to do more than express an opinion to get booted out the country, immigration attorney Mark Schifanelli told ABC News. 'He's got certain rights,' he said. 'Even as a foreign national in the United States, . he's afforded various rights under national security law and due . process.' He added that Morgan's supposed attack . on the Second Amendment would probably be protected by the First . Amendment, his right to free speech.

His remarks would have to present 'immediate danger' in order to break the law, but Schifanelli said it is unlikely that what Morgan has said has reached that requirement. The discussion was sparked after a gunman opened fire at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, killing 20 children and six members of staff. Following the tragedy last Tuesday, Morgan interviewed Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America. When Pratt suggested that the answer to the America’s gun problem was more firearms in schools, Morgan responded: 'You’re an unbelievably stupid man aren't you? You have absolutely no coherent argument. You don't actually give a damn about the gun murder rate in America.'","British CNN host has taken aggressive stand for tighter U.S. gun laws after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre .

A drink-driver who killed a teenager in a horrific crash tried to get his own son to frame the victim in a desperate bid to avoid prison, it emerged today. James Watson was jailed for nine years yesterday after causing the death of 18-year-old Brendon Main in a smash that left wrecked cars and debris littered along a quiet street. The 38-year-old got behind the wheel after a drinking session at a Newburgh hotel in Aberdeenshire to drive to his home - less than a mile away - with three teenagers in the car. Brendon Main (left), 18, died in a crash in Newburgh, Aberdeenshire. He is seen with best friend Levi Watson, who was injured in the incident. Levi's father James Watson admitted causing the smash at the High Court in Glasgow and has been jailed for nine years . Watson - who was only reunited with his son three years ago after being estranged for many years - lost control of the vehicle (pictured, front) on Main Street in July 2011 and smashed into a parked Land Rover Freelander. The car hit the 4x4 so hard that the SUV was forced onto the bonnet of a nearby Volvo . His son Levi Watson, who was Mr Main's best friend, has now vowed never to talk to his father again. Levi, who was in the car that night, said he has now lost two people in the tragedy - his closest friend and his father. He revealed that his father wanted him to tell police that Mr Main, the car's owner, had been driving, so he could avoid jail. Levi said: 'I got phone calls threatening me to change my statement, to say that it had been Brendon driving the car. He didn't want to go to jail.' 'It was bad enough that he took a kid's life, never mind asking your own son to lie for you. 'He got what he deserves in court.' Levi Watson (above), who was Brendon Main's best friend, has now vowed never to talk to his father again after he tried to make him frame the victim . Following the sentencing, Brendon's parents Anne and Bert said they were 'disgusted' by Watson's attempt to frame their son. Mrs Main said: 'All he's ever wanted is to come out of this free. 'The sentence he got is not enough and never will be enough. It should be a life for a life.' Watson, Levi, Mr Main and another friend, Michael Smith, had been drinking in the Ythan Hotel before the accident, which happened in the early hours of July 24, 2011. Brendon, who lived in Aberdeen's Cults area, had handed over the keys of his Ford Fiesta to Watson, so he would not be tempted to drive home once he'd had a couple of drinks. Levi said: 'Normally, we used to leave the car in the car park and walk to my dad's house. 'The Ythan Hotel is only five minutes away. 'That night, he decided to drive us home in Brendon's car. 'I said I would sit in the front but Brendon said he would. 'We started having an argument - nothing serious- and the last thing he said to me was ""love you, bud"".' Watson - who was only reunited with his son three years ago after being estranged for many years - lost control of the vehicle on Main Street and smashed into a parked Land Rover Freelander. The car hit the 4x4 so hard that the SUV was forced onto the bonnet of a nearby Volvo. Mr Main was crushed when he fell from the Fiesta as it overturned. He later died in hospital. Levi said: 'The last thing I remember is my dad saying ""let's see how fast this thing can go"". 'I heard everyone screaming and then it all went black.' The next morning, Levi was devastated when he was told his best friend had been killed. Two years later, he said he has had no contact with his father since the accident. Levi said his life had never been the same since he lost his best friend, Mr Main. Above, his tattooed tribute . Levi said: 'I've not spoken to him since the night of the accident and I never will again. 'He has never phoned to see how I am or how badly I was injured. I heard he was seen crawling away from the driver's seat on the night of the accident. 'After the threats I received, that doesn't surprise me.' Levi said his life had never been the same since he lost his best friend, Mr Main. He said: 'I miss him so much. I'd rather it had been me than Brendon. 'In the same day I didn't just lose my best friend - I also lost my dad.' Watson was jailed for eight years and nine months after admitting causing death by dangerous driving.

Steve Wozniak - known as Woz - founded the giant Californian firm with Steve Jobs in 1976. And although it's 35 years since the other Steve parted company with Apple, people still sit up and listen when he speaks out about the company and its products. Outspoken Steve Wozniak still prefers to queue up for a new Apple product at a local store, and camped overnight to buy the iPhone 4 when it launched . Speaking to Wirtschafts Woche, a German website, Mr Wozniak said that the iPhone is 'somewhat behind with features in the smartphone business. 'Others have caught up. Samsung is a big competitor. But precisely because they are currently making great products.' This is not the first time that Mr Wozniak has spoken out about Apple. Rivals: Samsung's Galaxy SIII (left) is perceived as more innovative than the iPhone 5 (right) Last year he told technology website Techcrunch: 'Apple was just used to cranking out the newest iPhone and falling a little behind and that worries me greatly. 'It worries me because I love Apple. 'It worries me if Apple were to lose ground because they were making the same things they know how to make. 'Improving is not Apple-style innovation.' And in a move that shocked die-hard Apple fans, he praised Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system: 'Just for looks and beauty, I definitely favour the Windows 7 phone over Android. 'I'm kind of shocked on every screen — much more beautiful than the same apps on Android and iPhone.' Steve Wozniak (pictured right) first met Steve Jobs (left) in 1970, and the pair founded Apple in 1976 and shortly after that launched the Apple I. That was followed by the Apple II computer, which established the company founded in a California garage as a major player on the fledgling computer scene. Mr Wozniak was seriously injured in a plane crash in 1981 when the aircraft he was piloting crashed on take-off. H . He spent two years making a slow recovery, and left Apple officially in 1987. Since then he's gone on to be a noted champion of technology start-ups. Mr Wozniak is also a well-known philanthropist, with his projects including financing the technology programme in his local school district. He's also been an occasional thorn in the side of the company he co-founded, making outspoken attacks on Apple's launch of its mapping app and Siri. Mr Wozniak also shocked observers last year when he praised Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system, saying he favoured it over phones using Google's Android operating system. However, he did go on to say that the iPhone is still his favourite handset. But in a cheeky sting in the tail, he also said that he thought 'Steve Jobs might have been reincarnated at MS due to a lot of what I see and feel with this phone making me think of a lot of great Apple things'. Mr Wozniak also spoke out about the Maps fiasco that erupted when the iPhone 5 was launched. Apple had dropped Google Maps in favour of its own mapping app, which turned out to be a disaster when it was revealed to be inaccurate and badly executed. Disappointed users were all over the web saying how angry they were, and sharing screenshots that showed missing roads, missing buildings - Milan's Duomo cathedral was nowhere to be seen on Apple's map of the Italian city. Mr Wozniak agreed, telling a conference in Australia: 'I tried to navigate somewhere, and I couldn't get to where I wanted to by voice. 'So, I was a little disappointed, because I love navigation by voice with my Google [Android] phones, actually, since they always get it and are based on a better database.' It was such a fiasco that Apple subsequently sacked Scott Forstall, the executive in charge of its mapping app. Maps hasn't been Mr Wozniak's only target. Earlier last year he had also expressed his disappointment with Siri, the iPhone's virtual personal assistant. He said that he had been a fan of Siri, but that it had got worse since Apple had bought it. He told a reporter that Siri had impressed him when he asked it how many prime numbers greater than 87 there are. When Siri answered the question correctly, Wozniak enthused: 'It's incredible. It's like it understands ""greater than"".' But he said that since Apple had bought Siri, 'A lot of people say Siri. I say poo-poo,' he said. Mr Wozniak is not alone is criticising Apple for a lack of innovation. Since the death of Steve Jobs in October 2011, many have felt that the Californian giant - which has a cash pile of $137 billion (£87 billion), only £3.7m smaller than the entire economic output of New Zealand - is falling behind. Analyst Trip Chowdry at Global Equities Research said in November: 'Apple's innovation is sputtering. 'Why is that Apple, the company that brought touch to phones and tablets, stopped just there and did not bring touch to notebooks and iMacs? Steve Wozniak (left) and Steve Jobs (right) founded Apple in a garage in California and went on to launch first the Apple I and then the Apple II computers, which helped established computers in the mainstream . 'Why is it that Apple brought high-resolution screens to some Mac MacBooks and not to all devices?' The company's ongoing battle with Samsung has turned off both fans and investors, while lacklustre product launches such as the iPad Mini have sparked suggestions that the Californian company has lost its way since the death of Steve Jobs. Apple's quarterly results, announced at the end of last month, disappointed investors. Although the figures were very good by any other business's standards (revenues were up 18 per cent on the previous quarter) flat profits led to a sense of unease about Apple languishing on innovation.The company's shares fell 11 per cent the day those results were announced and have yet to make a significant recovery.","Tech guru has attacked Apple products before .

The surprising sight attracted a large crowd in the coastal city of Balneario Camboriu in the . southern state of Santa Catarina. Scroll down for video . Traffic stopping: A massive elephant seal held up traffic for more than an hour after going on walkabout in Brazil . Making a scene: The animal, estimated to weigh over more than half a tonne, shuffled out of the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday afternoon in the coastal city of Balneario Camboriu in the southern state of Santa Catarina . In an effort to keep it hydrated police officers and firefighters splashed water on the 10ft beast as traffic ground to a halt along busy Avenida Atlantica. It initially moved quickly across the road before slumping down in front of a waiting car. The confused animal, estimated to weigh over half a tonne, finally sloped off back to the water after nearly 90 minutes in the sun. It is unknown why this giant beast decided to leave the ocean - elephant seals spend most of their lives at sea and only return to land to mate. Impromptu stroll: It left the beach and waddled along to the busy Avenida Atlantica - but of course it politely used the pedestrian crossing . Rescue: In an effort to keep it hydrated police officers and firefighters splashed water on the 10ft beast . Back home: An amused crowd gathered around the beast, although it finally sloped off and back to the water after nearly 90 minutes in the sun . There are two types of elephant seal, southern elephant seal and the smaller northern version. It is named after the males' snout which resembles the trunk of an elephant. The males can grow to be 16ft long and weigh over 6,000lbs . Their harems can contain several dozen females, which are somewhat lighter on their feet being a fifth of the males’ size - they are normally about 10ft long and weighing in at around 2,000lbs . They can hold their breath longer than any other cetacean animal – they can stay under water without air for up to two hours. They were almost hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries but since then the population is estimated to have recovered to about 700,000 members.

Hustler: Chris Holding's escapades came to an end when his DNA was found on socks left at a woman's home after a one night stand . With his dashing good looks and tales of a music career on the brink of take-off, Chris Holding appeared quite a catch. Using his 'sexual wiles', the 24-year-old charmed his way into the hearts and homes of successful women he met at trendy London nightspots. But he was a philanderer and a conman who betrayed their trust to steal cash and irreplaceable family heirlooms. Police know he struck up relationships with at least nine women. But they fear dozens more may have fallen victim as he invented a string of bogus names, careers and accents. Holding posed as an American musician on the cusp of a deal or a high-flying New York Times journalist. But, in reality, he was a barely literate chef from Preston who used his takings to fuel a hedonistic lifestyle of drink and drugs. The former Catholic school pupil pocketed cash, jewellery and valuables worth nearly £8,300. One victim, Kelly Williams, is seven months pregnant with his child but has refused to help police. The theatre company director, 35, once accused him of stealing goods worth £1,470 from her flat in Hampstead, North London. But she wept as he was jailed for 45 months by Judge Daniel Worsley. He branded Holding guilty of a 'breach of trust of the highest level' and said his sentence was longer than guidelines  suggest 'because of the harm you have inflicted on so many'. The judge added: 'This was serial  dishonesty and numerous breaches of personal trust.' Holding's youngest victim was a 19-year-old North West London schoolgirl and his eldest a Harley Street cosmetic surgery nurse aged 41. His lies finally unravelled after four years when a detective investigating a theft in May  spotted a similar case from a  fortnight earlier. DNA from a pair of socks he left behind after a one-night stand led to his identity and he was caught on a train at Waterloo station, London, on August 21. At Blackfriars Crown Court, prosecutor Mark James-Dawson said Holding used his 'sexual wiles' in two ruses. 'In the first, Holding entered into a prolonged sexual relationship with his victims, gulling them into trusting him,' he said. 'He then abused their trust, stealing money and jewellery, including heirloom pieces of incalculable sentimental value. 'In the second, often while in relationships with other women, he engaged in short-term flings, and once in his victim's home, stole goods and money.' Prosecutor Mark-James Dawson said Holding used his 'sexual wiles' to fool his victims . The two crimes which led to his capture took place in May in Camden Lock, North London. The conman met Sara McCluskey, 27, outside a restaurant and flirted by text message. Watching her tap in her PIN as she bought drinks, he pinched the card and withdrew £240. Later that month, Holding seduced Ana Calvo. After she let him stay in her home when she went to work, he stole a laptop, camera, phone, and cash. An earlier victim, Victoria  Barrett, 34, was chatted up in a Soho bar in June 2009. Holding moved into her flat in West London, and when she went on holiday, he stole seven gold rings worth £1,500. She refused to believe it was him until the following March when she returned home and found a £1,000 bracelet and Armani watch were missing. Holding then vanished. In June 2010, Holding posed as a journalist from California about to relocate to London when he met Anoeshka Smit, 25, while waiting for a flight at Stansted Airport. He moved in with her in Lewisham, South East London, but weeks later, she realised her grandmother's wedding ring had gone. She kicked him out but he went on to steal £260 from her bank account. In June this year, Mairi Campbell met Holding at a Covent Garden nightclub and invited him home. Holding siphoned £600 from her account but she  refused to believe he was to blame and ordered a new card, with the same PIN. He went on to steal another £773 and a £500 gold ring. Speaking afterwards, she said: 'He completely destroyed my faith in other people.' Holding, of Gravesend, Kent, who claims to have a six-year-old son in Australia, has convictions for shoplifting and theft. He admitted 13 counts of theft. Four counts were left on file.","Chris Holding, 24, charmed his way into the hearts and homes of successful women .

An Asian-American woman has filed a $1million lawsuit against CVS after she received a customer receipt that she claims was printed with an ethnic slur. Hyun Jin Lee, 37, of Galloway, New Jersey, says that she gave her correct name when she placed an order for photos on the CVS website back in February. But when she went to the to the store to pick up her order at a CVS store in Egg Harbor City, her receipt identified her as 'Ching Chong Lee.' Outrage: When Hyun Jin Lee returned to a CVS store in Egg Harbor City, her receipt identified her as 'Ching Chong Lee' Ms Lee, who identifies herself as Korean, is now taking legal action against the drugstore chain. In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday and obtained by The Smoking Gun, Ms Lee says: '""Ching chong"" is a pejorative term sometimes used by speakers of English to mock people of Chinese ancestry, or other Asians who may be mistaken for Chinese.' She goes on to say that she was 'shocked, stunned, mortified, humiliated and severely distressed that in the space  designated for her customer name or identification was instead the words ""Ching Chong"" Lee.' Ms Lee is accusing CVS of causing her 'immediate mental anguish, emotional distress, extreme embarrassment and anger.' Response: In an email to Ms Lee, CVS said that the offending employee would be 'addressed at a store level' and subject to counseling and training . In response to a subsequent email from Ms Lee, CVS said that the offending employee would be 'addressed at a store level' and subject to counseling and training. But her attorney says it's not enough, and they're seeking $1million in damages. Ms Lee's attorney, Susan Chana Lask, told CBS New York: 'There’s no amount, in my opinion, of training from . CVS or any company that’s going to stop this kind of hate and bullying . against someone's race.' Suit: Ms Lee's legal team says that CVS' actions to counsel the offending employee is not good enough, and she's seeking $1million in damages . She added: 'To me, this is something that deserves psychological counseling, not CVS counseling.' A CVS spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment. Last year, pizza chain Papa Johns issued an apology to a customer after an employee identified her as 'lady chinky eyes' in her order. The racial identification was caught by New York City customer Minhee Cho after the store printed her receipt. Later taking to Twitter, she uploaded a picture of the receipt with the caption: 'Hey @PapaJohns just FYI my name isn't ""lady chinky eyes""'. In a 2011 incident, Chick-fil-A faced a uproar when an employee in Irvine, California, was fired after using offensive names mocking Asian customers at the Chick-fil-A. Rather than take the real names of two students, she typed 'Ching' and 'Chong' on their food receipts. Restaurant bosses moved quickly to try and quell the controversy after a friend of the customers posted photos of the receipts on his Tumblr account.

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 11:23 EST, 26 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:21 EST, 26 November 2012 . WEALTHY criminals are being given millions of pounds in legal aid, an investigation has revealed. It uncovered almost 50 instances   over the last three years of millionaire defendants receiving an average of £300,000 in taxpayers’ money after exploiting a legal loophole. In one case, two defendants were handed legal aid of £100,000 each to defend themselves against charges that they had masterminded one of Britain’s biggest ever tax frauds –  although they lived in homes worth millions of pounds. In another trial, a fraudster received more than £5million of taxpayers’ cash, despite owning a £6million property in Mayfair, Central London. However, the scandal may extend even beyond these shocking cases. The quango which presides over legal aid, the Legal Services Commission, refuses to reveal the exact amount handed in legal aid to rich criminals on the grounds that the information is ‘private’. Scandal: Tax fraudsters Shakeel Ahmad (left) and Syed Ahmed (right) were worth millions but still managed to claim huge sums in legal aid by using a loophole . Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald QC is among those who are now demanding reform of the legal aid system. He said: ‘It’s completely wrong. The taxpayer shouldn’t have to pay the defence lawyers for wealthy criminals.’ The loophole is a result of controversial legal rules, under which assets that have been frozen by the authorities cannot be used to pay defence bills. This allowed VAT fraudsters Syed Ahmed and Shakeel Ahmad to plead poverty during their trial and each receive £100,000. Disgrace: Syed Ahmed said he was penniless but while on trial was living at his £4.5million home at Wellington Court in Knightsbridge (pictured) - one of the most exclusive blocks in London . At the time, Ahmed lived in a £4.5million flat overlooking Hyde Park and Ahmad lived in a £2.2million home in Middlesex. The two were members of a gang which set up fake companies to claim millions in VAT back from the taxpayer fraudulently. Investigators found that they owned a string of luxury properties and expensive cars. Ahmed and Ahmad were jailed for seven years in 2007 and given additional jail terms of ten years in 2010 after they had refused to reveal where they had hidden their fortunes. Fraudster Virendra Rastogi, who received £5million in legal aid despite owning a seven-bedroom home in Mayfair, was chauffeur-driven to court on every day of his trial, while yacht-owning multi-millionaire fraudster Raymond May was handed more than £400,000 in legal aid. In theory, the loophole in the rules is to enable assets to be preserved so that they can be confiscated after conviction. But in many cases criminals are successful at hiding their assets from the court, and escaping without financial sanction. Convicted criminals owe more than £1billion in unpaid confiscation orders. Leading legal figures told a joint investigation by the London Evening Standard and BBC1’s Inside Out that the rules should be changed to stop taxpayers being cheated. Assets: The pair also owned a stake in The Yacht Bay Tower (left) and the Royal Oceanic Tower (right), both in Dubai, and had fought to hide what they owned . Lord Macdonald said: ‘The Government has got a real blind spot, because we have a situation where fabulously wealthy people are not being required to spend their own money on legal representation and are instead getting legal aid. I am talking about people worth tens of millions of pounds getting money from the state to fund representation in criminal cases. ‘Legal aid has been cut for people who have housing problems, it’s been cut for people who have welfare problems, people right at the bottom of the pile. ‘It’s not fair that very rich people are getting legal aid and very poor people aren’t.’ Michael Turner QC, the chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, criticised the Government for refusing to release the figures which would reveal the full extent of the scandal. Loophole: (L-R) Asil Nadir, Raymond May, Abdullah Baybasin and Eyad Iktilat were all worth huge sums but still claimed legal aid when they were in court accused of various crimes . ‘This is something we have been concerned about for some time,’  said Mr Turner. ‘This is another example of the taxpayer being made to take the burden when there are potentially funds there to ease that burden. That would allow legal aid money to go to those who need it most,’ he added. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Offenders who can afford to contribute to the cost of their defence should do so. ‘Reforms to asset freezing are being considered to ensure that both proceeds of crime and legal aid costs are recovered. ‘We want to collect more money, not just change how the money we currently seize from criminals is distributed.’","Syed Ahmed and Shakeel Ahmad were worth at least £30 million .

So it's no surprise that London's latest batch of cute meerkat babies looked a little unsure about venturing out of their burrow and into the big wide world today. The youngsters were spotted creeping up to the very edge of the burrow before curiously examining all of the goings on. Tentative: A very cautious meerkat pokes its head out of the burrow to see it the coast is clear of predators around the enclosure at London Zoo today . Alert: The naturally wary creature looks both ways as it reconnoiters the area before setting foot outside the safety of its burrow . Blinking into the light: The baby meerkats get their first taste for fresh air as they peer out from the safety of the burrow at London Zoo for the first time . However, . not one of them was brave enough to step a paw out into the enclosure, . even when given a little encouragement from some adults. But soon the sheer wait of numbers trying to get a look at the big world outside from the burrow entrance was enough to open the floodgates and send the youngsters scurrying into the sunshine. The tentative critters - which rarely grow larger than 14 inches tall and weight little more than 1.5lbs - were snapped by photographer Dave Stevenson during one of his wildlife photography workshops. Baby . merekats or kits are born underground - in large social groups up to 30 strong - in extensive burrow systems and . remain there for the first two or three weeks of their lives. Safety in numbers: The little meerkat is emboldened when its sibling arrives to provide back up for the impending adventure at London Zoo . Now or never: Sensing this is the time to make the leap into the unknown and explore their surroundings, the pair tentatively set foot outside the burrow . But there always comes a time when they have to set foot outside the safety of their labyrinth. And what the tiny creatures lose in size to possible predators, they more than make up for with force of numbers. The highly social animals often display very altruistic behaviour - with several of the gang acting as sentries to keen an eye out for any approaching predators. The animals rear up onto their hind legs and into their distinctive pose for the best view. Floodgates open: With their new found confidence, the entire gang pour our of the burrow for their own taste of fresh air having spent the first two or three weeks of their lives underground . When . a predator is spotted, the meerkat performing as sentry gives a warning . bark, and other members of the gang will run and hide in one of the . many bolt holes they have spread across their territory. The . sentry meerkat is the first to reappear from the burrow and search for . predators, constantly barking to keep the others underground. If there . is no threat, the sentry meerkat stops signaling and the others feel . safe to emerge. Meerkats also babysit the young in the group. Meerkats have been known to engage in social activities, including what appear to be wrestling matches and foot races. On guard: The ever cautious adult meerkats keep an eye on their adventurous young as they frolic in the sunshine in case of any predators .",Latest batch of baby creatures get first taste of fresh air outside their burrow in London Zoo .

Huge demand for the Galaxy S3 phone has meant that Samsung simply hasn't been able to keep up - and has lost two million sales this month. The handset is forecast to hit 10 million sales in two months - with demand fuelled by lack of a credible rival from Apple. ‘It is simply that demand far . exceeded our expectation. But that doesn't mean we had set a very . conservative demand forecast,’ Samsung said. Samsung's Galaxy S3 - huge demand for the flagship Android handset has led to Samsung missing out on two million sales due to component shortages . For a company that has never stirred the sort of consumer frenzy that accompanies each new Apple Inc gadget, overwhelming demand is a nice problem to have. The latest Galaxy's launch has been well . timed as the next iPhone is not expected until later this year, and . offerings from others such as Google's Motorola and Nokia have not . created much of a market stir. Samsung said component shortages have been resolved and it is running at full tilt to meet demand. But some of the shortage stemmed from a manufacturing glitch that affected some European sales, while major carriers in the United States have had to delay delivery of some pre-ordered phones. The Galaxy S III has received the most positive reviews among any of the Samsung smartphones, and the technology giant says the phone is on track to become its fastest selling smartphone, with sales likely to top 10 million in the first two months since its launch. The handset is forecast to hit 10 million sales in two months - with demand fuelled by lack of a credible rival from Apple . ‘Samsung might have been caught off guard by the demand, not because they did not believe in their own products, but because they might have over-estimated the competition,’ said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. ‘In other words, aside from the iPhone and HTC's oneX there's not much out there at the moment, which would have certainly helped Samsung.’ Analysts reckon the Galaxy shortage will be a temporary hiccup, affecting some 2 million units of shipments in the April-June quarter. Samsung expects another record quarter of earnings from its handset business in the current period, helped by solid sales of its predecessor S II and phone-cum-tablet Galaxy Note. Barclays lowered its forecast for Samsung's second-quarter Galaxy S III shipments to 6.5 million from 8 million, but raised its third-quarter shipment forecast by 1 million to 15 million.","Korean giant predicted to sell 10 million handsets in two months .

A man who was convicted of breaking into a Florida home and snorting the ashes of two dogs and an elderly man has been sentenced to eight years in prison. Jose David Diaz-Marrero, 20, broke into a home in Silver Springs Shores in 2010, and stole two urns that contained the remains of the homeowner’s father and two Great Danes. He and fellow alleged burglars, Waldo Soroa, 21, and Matrix Andaluz, 19, reportedly snorted the remains, thinking they were crushed pills. They were horrified to find out days later when they watched a news report that they had actually snorted ashes. Diaz-Marrero pleaded guilty to burglarizing the house in June. He and his accomplices were also accused of stealing $1,500 worth of jewellery and laptop computers. Appearing in court last Friday, he apologized for what he did. ‘I recognize that I made a big mistake,’ he told Judge Sandra Edwards-Stephens, according to Ocala.com. ‘I wish the victims were here so that I could tell them how sorry I am,’ he said. The urns contained the remains of homeowner Holli Tencza’s father, as well as her two purebred Great Danes, Epic and Samson.

They, along with two juveniles who cannot be named, allegedly stole the cremated remains of the man and two dogs. According to reports, they believed the ashes to be drugs. Investigators learned what happened to the ashes after they arrested five teens in connection with another burglary attempt at a nearby home. 'The suspects mistook the ashes for either cocaine or heroin. It was soon discovered that the suspects snorted some of the ashes believing they were snorting cocaine,' the sheriff's report said.

Gabe Watson, who was acquitted of murdering his wife on honeymoon and making it look like a scuba diving accident, said his strange behaviour in the weeks following her death was part of his grieving process. The murder case against Mr Watson, 34, was dropped last week after Circuit Judge Tommy Nail cited a lack of evidence at the court in Birmingham, Alabama. The prosecution said the case was weakened by some of the judge's decisions to keep their evidence from the jury. This included surveillance footage of Mr Watson at his wife Tina's grave using bolt cutters to remove flowers chained to the memorial by her family. Acquitted: Gabe Watson, 34, spoke for the first time about his bizarre actions following his wife's death in a scuba diving accident in 2003 . Happiness: Gabe and Tina Watson on their wedding day in 2003 - 11 days before Mrs Watson drowned during a honeymoon diving trip . He told ABC: 'It definitely wasn't my finest hour...I (had) just been accused of murder... I . was still dealing with the death of Tina. I wasn't thinking clearly on . everything that I did.' He added that he had removed the flowers because his late wife, Tina Thomas Watson, would not have wanted the arrangement because they were plastic and not fresh flowers. Her family said they chained the flowers to the grave because Mr Watson had removed tributes in the past. Gabe Watson had been accused of turning off his . wife's air supply when they went scuba diving on their honeymoon in Australia and trying to cash in on her death. The 34-year-old had faced a sentence of life in prison without parole if convicted of murdering his wife in 2003. Mr Watson had already served 18 . months in an Australian prison after pleading guilty to a . manslaughter charge involving negligence. In the interview with 20/20 this week he explained: 'I pled guilty to... basically not rendering the proper aid, not saving my dive buddy.' Scuba: This photograph, showing Mrs Watson lying dead in the background, was presented as evidence . Acquitted: Gabe Watson has walked free after a case accusing him of murdering his wife Tina was thrown out by a judge on the grounds that the prosecution had presented insufficient grounds for conviction . During the two-week trial, the defence brought witnesses to testify to Mr Watson's strange behaviour following the death of his wife. Tina Watson's best friend and maid-of-honour Amanda Phillips told the court that when she and Gabe viewed her friend's body in the coffin, he commented: 'At least her breasts look perky.' 'I had just been accused of murder... I . was still dealing with the death of Tina. I wasn't thinking clearly on . everything that I did.' Gabe Watson . Ms Phillips also testified that at his home after the . service, Mr Watson showed mourners a picture of his late wife next to a sign which read . 'Caution: Drowning'. The newlyweds were in Australia in 2003 on their honeymoon and on the first day of a week-long diving trip off the coast of Queensland when Mrs Watson died. Judge Nail . agreed with defence arguments that prosecutors failed to show Mr Watson . intentionally killed the woman.

One of the big surprises at Samsung's Galaxy S3 launch last week was a charger that powered the smartphone wirelessly - but now it seems that the technology could soon be widespread. Samsung, Qualcomm and other tech companies have joined forces to establish a single standard to allow devices to charge wirelessly - using a technology similar to the one in electric toothbrushes today. One single charger will 'beam' power to several devices at once - and the chargers could even work in cars. A single standard could also mean that the new wireless era isn't plagued with the problem of 'finding the right cable' - one wireless technology should (hopefully) work for all. Wireless technology leaders Samsung and Qualcomm Incorporated have joined other technology leaders to form the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP), it was announced today. The A4WP will focus on a new wireless power transfer technology that provides spatial freedom for charging of electrical devices in cars, on tabletops and for multiple devices simultaneously. Benefits of this wireless power approach include: a transmitter and receiver antenna design that is easily implemented, a simple wireless power control system, and the ability to transfer power through non-metallic surfaces. The A4WP expects to achieve this capability without the need for costly multi-coil repeaters, which are required for other systems. One 'hub' will charge several devices simultaneously .

A Catholic nun is alleged to have sent six envelopes containing white powder to parliamentary figures including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, a court heard today. The defendant, who is known as Sister Ruth Augustus, is accused of scrawling 'devil worshipping' on envelopes filled with white powder that she posted to Nick Clegg and Baroness Scotland, Harrow Crown Court was told. The letters were intercepted, three at a time on two separate occasions, at a mail screening centre and the powder was found to be non hazardous, the court heard. Baroness of Scotland and Nick Clegg were both sent envelopes with a white substance inside . The defendant, 71, of Leyton, east London, denies six counts of hoaxes involving noxious substances or things. Mark Kimsey, prosecuting, said Augustus accepts that she sent envelopes with letters in them but says police put the white powder in them. Mr Kimsey said three envelopes were intercepted at a mail screening centre in east London on June 17, 2011. A worker was checking mail at 5.30am when three envelopes raised concerns. One was addressed to Mr Clegg and on . the envelope was written 'devil worshipping', 'freemason', 'sex with . thirty plus women' and 'your poor Catholic wife and children'. The second was to Baroness Scotland, and had a swastika on it, and two crosses, and 'stop this evil devil worshipping'. The third was to Baroness Kennedy, and was endorsed with a swastika, and 'stop these evil devil worshipping freemasons'. Sister Ruth Augustus is accused of sending envelopes to Baroness Kennedy and Edward Leigh MP . The envelopes contained a gritty . substance, but it was found they had already tested negative for . anthrax, and specialist police who were called in found them to be non . hazardous. On October 1, at the same mail centre, three more envelopes were found, addressed to Mr Clegg, Baroness Kennedy and Edward Leigh MP. The envelopes carried similar endorsements and slogans and contained white powder which was found to be non hazardous. Mr Kimsey told the jury: 'The issue is . whether she herself put the white powder within the envelopes, and, if . so, was it with the intention to induce the recipient to fear they were . hazardous. 'Albeit this is a hoax, it's a serious . matter, when what was sent was white powder, with the intention to make . the person believe they were receiving a noxious substance.' On December 7, Augustus was arrested at a hotel in north west London where she was staying and told police 'It's a load of lies', Mr Kimsey said. The court heard that Augustus told police during interview: 'I'm Sister Ruth, a 71-year-old disabled nun.' She also said: 'I look like a terrorist, don't I, working for a charity all over the world, with orphans?' The jury heard that she told interviewing officer Detective Constable Anne Adams: 'The police are run by freemasons. All the top women are in it.' Harrow Crown Court heard that the nun had told police she had more brains than they did . Asked why she had sent a letter to Mr Leigh, she said: 'He's a Catholic, and goes to Westminster Cathedral.' As for Mr Clegg, she said he 'lied about all the tuition fees and everything else, keeping those Tory millionaires and rats in government'. She added: 'He boasted about all the women he's had sex with. He's an atheist singing hymns in the Albert Hall.' At one point she said: 'I'm not a Muslim terrorist, I'm a Catholic nun.' And she said of the police: 'They opened the envelopes, and put white powder in, to frame me. I know they monitor it all. 'I'm a Catholic nun, with more brains and intelligence than the police.' Asked if she was sending the letters for 'attention', she said: 'Of course I am. I'm deliberately writing on the envelope as well so all the postmen will know all about it.'

David Cameron mistakenly left his eight-year-old daughter in a pub by herself when he drove off without her, it was revealed last night. The Prime Minister – who had been enjoying Sunday drinks with his family near Chequers – only realised his eldest daughter was missing when he arrived back at his official country residence. The Camerons had been drinking at the Plough Inn, in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, with their three children and two other families. David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him . As they went to leave, Nancy went off to the toilet without telling them. The Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the pub, with protection officers in one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their other children in another. Mr Cameron presumed that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister. A spokesman for the Prime Minister last night said he was ‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened. They later confirmed that Mrs Cameron returned to the pub to pick up Nancy. ‘Thankfully when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well,’ the spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister went down straight away to get her.’ When Mr Cameron arrived back at the pub he found his daughter happily helping the pub staff. It is understood she had been left by herself for 15 minutes. A Downing Street spokeswoman said today that the Camerons take full responsibility for looking after their children and were not blaming security officers for failing to ensure that Nancy was with the party before returning to Chequers. Popular: The Plough pub, where the Camerons are regulars . The Plough is a short drive away from Chequers . 'They are their children and they take responsibility for them,' said the spokeswoman. 'No-one is going to face disciplinary action. This was an error.' The spokeswoman declined to discuss whether Mr Cameron had drunk alcohol. 'He had gone with friends at . lunchtime, with a number of families with children, and they left in . various different vehicles,' she said. 'As you know, the Prime Minister is a very busy man but he always tries to live as normal a life as possible with his family.' Asked how often this involved a visit to the pub, she replied: 'Occasionally.' The spokeswoman declined to discuss . the security arrangements around Mr Cameron and his family but said they . were always kept under review. Last night a pub ‘insider’ said: ‘You’d have thought that someone would have done a headcount or something.’ Chillaxing? David Cameron enjoys a pint during a visit to a brewery . The . source told The Sun: ‘It’s not like you can look up David Cameron in . the phonebook and then ring to say you’ve left your daughter behind. ‘It’s frightening that the Prime Minister of Britain can forget something so important as his own daughter.’ Friends of Mr Cameron last month told how he enjoyed drinking ‘three or four glasses of wine’ over lunch at the weekend. The revelations were in a biography that criticised the amount of time the Prime Minister spends ‘chillaxing’ The . book records weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing frames of . snooker, and tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’. After long lunches the Prime Minister likes to recharge his batteries with an afternoon nap, the book claimed. A source told the authors: ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for ‘chillaxing’, the Prime Minister would win it.’ One adviser claimed that the Prime Minister ‘spends a crazy, scary amount of time playing Fruit Ninja’, a computer game in which players use a cartoon sword to slash fast-moving fruit. Mr Cameron has previously been branded ‘DVD Dave’ for his love of watching Danish dramas in bed with his wife Samantha.He also finds time for a weekly date night. Plough landlord Steve Hollings, who has run the pub with his wife Sharon for more than 13 years, said the Prime Minister and his family regularly pop in for lunch or drinks. Mr Hollings said Mr Cameron had again been in the pub with his family at lunchtime yesterday, and had spent about an hour there. Speaking as he prepared the bar for the lunchtime rush, Mr Hollings confided that the incident happened 'some time ago.' 'It certainly wasn't this weekend, or three weeks ago as they are saying on TV,' he insisted. Mr Hollings said: 'What do you want me to say? That he's a neglecting father? Well he's not. 'He's a great father and genuine family man and a genuine guy. 'I've only got good things to say about him. 'He's not the Prime Minister when he comes down here, he's just David Cameron, a family man.' The Plough has been nestled in the picturesque Chiltern Hills since the 16th century and is the oldest pub in the area. Its traditional Sunday roast is served  for £14.95.

A senior executive at the New York Times has broken ranks to suggest former BBC chief Mark Thompson is not fit to be her new boss in the wake of a paedophile scandal which has rocked the corporation to its core. In an extraordinary intervention, Margaret Sullivan questioned the integrity and ability of the man who was director general when a report that would have exposed Jimmy Savile as a predator who targeted young, vulnerable girls, was axed. Writing in a blog post yesterday, the public editor, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself said: 'How likely is it that [Thompson] knew nothing?' 'His integrity and decision-making . are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly. It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, . given this turn of events.' Drawn in: Incoming New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson (left) has denied having any knowledge of a BBC programme's investigation into alleged sexual abuse by television host Jimmy Savile (right) Controversial: Margaret Sullivan (far left) was the first employee at the New York Times to question Mr Thompson's fitness to take the top job . It has been Mr Thompson's assertion . that he knew nothing about the allegations against the late presenter . until last month after he had left the BBC. But his statement was today questioned by one of the corporation's respected foreign correspondents Caroline Hawley. Public Editor Margaret Sullivan wrote in her blog: . 'How likely is it that he knew nothing? A director general of a giant media company is something like a newspaper’s publisher... publishers usually don’t know about editorial decisions — unless they are very big ones, fraught with legal implications. 'His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect The Times and its journalism — profoundly. It’s worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.'The Times might start by publishing an in-depth interview with Mr. Thompson exploring what exactly he knew, and when, about what happened at the BBC. 'What are the implications of these problems for him as incoming Times chief executive? What are the implications for the Times Company to have its new C.E.O. – who needs to deal with many tough business challenges here – arriving with so much unwanted baggage?' She . said she believed she told Mr Thompson, who is due to take up his post . at the New York Times next month, about the 'broad context' of the . investigation into Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, . Ms Hawley said she voiced her concerns about the cancellation of the report, which would have aired on the BBC's flagship current affairs show Newsnight, at a Christmas drinks party last year. The investigation had been scheduled to run in November - but was pulled at the last minute. She told The Times in London: 'I . think I must have mentioned the broad context of the investigation but . genuinely don’t remember the words I used.' Contradiction? BBC foreign correspondent Caroline Hawley today said she thought she had told Mr Thompson of the 'broad context' of the corporation's Newsnight investigation into Savile . Mr Thompson, director general at the BBC from 2004 until September, said he only learned . about the planned documentary at the party Ms Hawley told him: 'You must . be worried about the Newsnight investigation.' He said he did not ask for any more details, but made informal enquiries from BBC News the next day . and was told that the programme had been dropped for 'journalistic . reasons'. The 55-year-old added that he did not ask what . allegations against Savile were being investigated, and only found out . about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the BBC. Mr Thompson's spokesman yesterday . told The Times: 'The clue to the strength of your story may be [Ms . Hawley's] words ""I think"".' He also issued a . statement saying there were 'no inconsistencies' between his . recollection of the conversation and a statement Ms Hawley has given to a . BBC review into the decision to cancel the Newsnight programme. Scandal engulfed the BBC earlier this month after a rival broadcaster ITV aired a documentary which accused Savile of being a paedophile who had abused hundreds of young victims in hospitals, schools and even on the corporation's premises. But even as the documentary went out, it emerged that Newsnight had carried out its own investigation - including an interview with the same victim - nearly a year before. A team spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, south-east . England, speaking to at least four women who claimed they had been assaulted or knew about events at the school. The report was shelved at the last minute at the request of the programme's editor Peter Rippon. It was not until this week that the BBC aired its own investigation into the scandal, put together by documentary strand Panorama. The show covered both Savile's crimes and the corporation's reaction. In the wake of broadcast, Peter Rippon stood aside from his Newsnight role after the BBC said his explanation for shelving the story had been 'inaccurate or incomplete'. On Wednesday, new director general George Entwistle was grilled by MPs in parliament. He denied the the broadcaster helped cover up allegations that Savile preyed on women. The BBC has now launched two inquiries into the affair; one will address Savile's actions and how he went undetected during his six decade career and a second which will examine why the Newsnight report was pulled. Revered: The New York Times prides itself on a reputation for quality, serious journalism . Meanwhile pressure grew on his predecessor Mr Thompson, who left his £622,000 post at the BBC earlier this year. The New York Times tapped Mr Thompson . in August as CEO - a role that had been vacant for eight months after . the company ousted its former CEO Janet Robinson last year. It is understood that he will take up his post at the New York Times on November 12. He received a $3million (£1.8m) 'sign-on bonus' and is set to receive a $1million (£620,000) annual salary, with a potential $1million bonus. He also stands to be paid a further $3million bonus, paid over three years, for meeting 'long-term objectives'. One Wall Street analyst called . for the paper to delay Mr Thompson taking over the company, . adding more pressure on executives to address the matter on the . company's earnings conference call tomorrow. 'The New York Times should delay . [Thompson's] start date until there is more clarity,' said Doug Arthur, . an analyst with Evercore Partners who follows the New York Times. 'It seems to me he will have to . attend a hearing in the UK parliament. That is going to be a . distraction. It's unfortunate. It's an unexpected complication.' Mrs Sullivan declined to comment further on her blog as did the New York Times. As public editor and a representative . of readers, she writes about issues affecting the newspaper independent . from News York Times management, including chairman and publisher . Arthur Sulzberger Jr and executive editor Jill Abramson. Since stepping into the role in . September, Mrs Sullivan has already made waves including a post that . criticised the paper's decision not to publish on the front page a story . about a congressional hearing into attacks on a U.S. consulate in .

"By . Margot Peppers . PUBLISHED: . 14:52 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:48 EST, 26 April 2013 . Under fire: More than 1,000 women are suing the makers of contraceptive device NuvaRing, claiming that it 'causes blood clots' Over 1,000 NuvaRing users have filed lawsuits against Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the contraceptive device, alleging that it has caused them to suffer blood clots. The plaintiffs have taken their cases to a federal district court in Missouri, and are claiming that the company did not adequately test or label the device before it hit the market in 2002. The particular way the rings deliver hormones to the body plays a part in their risk factor, say the plaintiffs. Unlike other methods of contraceptive, NuvaRing emits hormones directly into the bloodstream. Expert witnesses for the lawsuits say that the hormone 'spikes' that women experience when using the device may make them more susceptible to blood clots. There are currently no studies to support or refute this claim. Rachel Lietzke Payne, a former NuvaRing user, told Yahoo! News that she began using the device in 2008 because it was more convenient than other birth control methods. She cited the fact that the ring requires less discipline than a once-a-day-pill, since it is inserted into the vagina and removed once a month. In 2010, Mrs Payne, who was 22 at the time, was out to lunch with her father when she suddenly fell ill outside the restaurant and 'spat up quarter-size chunks of blood onto the cement'. As a young, healthy non-smoker, the Orlando, Florida resident did not fit the profile of someone susceptible to blood clots. For ten days, doctors at a hospital administered anticoagulants to thin her blood as they tried to determine the health issue. Finally, they agreed that her NuvaRing was responsible for putting her at risk to blood clots. Now, Mrs Payne and more than 1,000 other women are suing Merck for claims that it has caused them to suffer blood clots; in some of the cases, the clots were fatal. But studies looking at the risks of the device have obtained contradicting results. NuvaRing stops ovulation by releasing a combination of the hormones estrogen and progestin into the body. Dozens of studies - including a recent one funded by the FDA - have found that women taking contraceptives like NuvaRing, which contains a third-generation progestin, are 1.4 to four times more likely to develop blood clots than those taking contraceptives with second-generation progestin. The study, which examined the health . histories of over 835,000 women, revealed that those who used a vaginal . ring like NuvaRing were more at risk for venous thrombosis - a blood . clot that forms in a vein - than those who use oral contraceptives. The NuvaRing, which first hit U.S. markets in 2002, is a small, flexible ring made of transparent plastic. When inserted into the vagina, it releases the hormones estrogen and progestin into the blood stream, preventing ovulation. The most common side effects according to WebMD are headache, weight gain, nausea, breast irritation, and vaginal irritation. A website for the device warns women not to use it if they are pregnant, smokers, or have a history of blood clots. DruskRisk.com estimates the number of NuvaRing users at over 1million worldwide. Other experts, however, have asserted that there is no increased risk at all associated with these hormonal contraceptives. Indeed, some claim that the allegations against contraceptive methods have done more harm than good, since they have frightened women out of taking birth control precautions altogether. A group of more than 20 researchers published a letter in the Journal of Family Health and Reproductive Planning this month, claiming that studies opposing these contraceptive devices don't take into account certain variables, like obesity, which is a main risk factor leading to blood clots. So far, the cases against NuvaRing have not held up in court. Last week, a New Jersey judge threw out seven suits . against NuvaRing, explaining that the women did not sufficiently prove that the devices were the cause of their blood clots. And even though Mrs Payne and her fellow plaintiffs claim that Merck did not adequately test the device before it hit shelves, executives at the company have maintained that their product is an effective and safe method of birth control. Lainie Keller, a spokeswoman for Merck, . said in a statement: 'We are confident the company has provided appropriate and timely information about NuvaRing to consumers and the medical, scientific and regulatory communities.' Many of the cases against Merck will face trial in the federal court system starting this October.","Women claim the vaginal ring - which emits hormones directly into the bloodstream - has caused them to suffer potentially fatal blood clots .

A U.S. congressman who once seriously warned that a U.S. military buildup on the island of Guam could make it 'tip over and capsize' launched into a speech on the House floor on Thursday mocking about funny-voiced clowns and children without helium for their latex and mylar inflatables. 'Imagine, Mr. Speaker, a world without balloons,' Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson urged. 'How can we make sure that the injustice of there being no helium for comedians to get that high-pitched voice that we all hold near and dear to our hearts.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rep. Hank Johnson implored Republicans to focus on the sequester instead of worrying about kids' birthday parties and clown acts . Godzilla is not amused: Johnson devoted House floor time to worrying about the end of balloon festivals and giant floating mascots . 'Too often lately, this body has sat deflated - not for lack of hot air, mind you,' Johnson continued. 'But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, unlike a noble element, this House has failed to act on Americans’ real concerns.' Johnson's spokesman, Andy Phelan, told The Washington Post that Johnson was only half-joking. He was annoyed at Republicans, Phelan said, for devoting so much time debating a bill about helium instead of 'working on more important issues such as creating jobs, fixing the sequester and on budget issues.' Send in the clowns: The Georgia congressman fretted about cutting off Bozo from his supply of voice-raising gas . 'This tea party Congress,' Johnson mocked during his speech, 'will make the tough choice to keep children's birthday parties on schedule, and give industries that rely on helium the lift that they deserve.' When Johnson speaks, a rim-shot is often not far behind. In 2010 the congressman said during a House Armed Services Committee hearing that an increased presence of military personnel on Guam could literally destroy the island by making its weight unbalanced. 'My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize,' Johnson said. 'We don't anticipate that,' replied Navy Admiral Robert Willard - to his credit, without laughing. Island overboard! Johnson warned in 2010 that Guam could 'tip over' if too many military families moved there . Natural gas wells are the most abundant source of natural helium, something which - like the physical makeup of islands - may have escaped Hank Johnson's notice . The helium legislation, which the House passed 394-1 on Friday, will allow the federal government to continue selling off its domestic supplies of helium on the open market. That, say Republicans, will help prop up prices for domestic manufacturers by keeping supplies low. The current sell-off policy, originally a temporary measure designed to help the government's helium program pay off its debts, is set to expire later this year. Helium is plentiful in the earth's crust, and is harvested as a byproduct of natural gas drilling. Most existing deposits are sitting in depleted gas wells, waiting for industry to extract them.","Hank Johnson was angry at Republicans for debating a bill to open the U.S. helium reserves to the world market .

Federal investigators are looking into possible connections between today's bomb attack on the Boston Marathon and the Patriot's Day anniversaries of the Branch Davidian compound seige in Waco, Texas, and the Oklahoma City bombing, a Justice Department source tells MailOnline. Today's attack took place on Patriots' Day, which marks the first battle of the Revolutionary War and the 'shot heard 'round the world.' It is a day held in reverence by right-wing domestic groups and others who oppose the federal government. President Barack Obama himself acknowledged the significance of the holiday during his briefing this afternoon. 'Today is Patriots Day,' he said. 'A day that reflects the freedom Boston has celebrated throughout its history.' Shadows of the past: Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City was heavily damaged by a truck bomb explosion on April 19, 1995 - the day after Patriots' Day . Rallying point: The April 19, 1993 federal siege of the Branch Davidian Cult became a rallying cry for right-wing anti-government groups . The 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, which killed 168, occurred the day after Patriots' Day. Bomber Timothy McVeigh was said believe the date was significant. The federal siege of the Branch Dravidian compound, which left 82 members of the cult dead, began on Patriots' Day in 1993. Significant: Timothy McVeigh, the man behind the Oklahoma city bombing, held Patroits' Day as a significant date . Today is also Tax Day, when federal income tax returns are due. In recent years, it has been seized on by members of the Tea Party as cause to protest federal government policies and tax rates. A Justice Department source tells MailOnline that authorities are looking into the possibility that the Boston attack, which killed two and injured 86 more at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, could have been planned to coincide with Patriots' Day.

"By . Becky Barrow and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 08:29 EST, 9 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:03 EST, 10 July 2012 . A top Bank of England executive was yesterday accused of being asleep on the job despite repeated warnings that Britain’s banks were fiddling key interest rates. Paul Tucker was slammed for ignoring the warnings and failing to take notes of key meetings – shortly after a string of newly-published emails detailed his cosy relationship with top bankers and civil servants. During a ferocious grilling by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie, the chairman and a Tory MP, warned: ‘This does not look good, Mr Tucker' Denial: Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury Select Committee he did not encourage the manipulation of Libor by Barclays . Scrutiny: Andrew Tyrie MP (left), chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, grilled Mr Tucker (right) on what he knew about rate-fixing . But the Bank’s deputy governor fought . back, insisting he was simply not aware that banks had been . ‘low-balling’ their submissions on Libor, the inter-bank lending rate. ‘Low-balling’ is a slang reference to . banks submitting lower Libor rates in a bid to make themselves appear . stronger than they actually are. In an explosive warning, Mr Tucker . said the whole financial system needs to be reviewed amid fears the . unfolding Libor rigging debacle is just the start of the scandal. He . said: ‘We can’t be confident of anything after learning of this . cesspit.’ Questioning: The committee heard from Mr Tucker after Bob Diamond released his note of a phone conversation between the two men . Insight: New e-mails from Bank of England deputy . Governor Paul Tucker, left, to former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, right, . have been released . Under fire: Barclays has had billions wiped off its shares since it was rocked by the Libor-fixing allegations and the resignation of Bob Diamond . All financial indicators, such as . Libor, which are based on a bank’s opinion, rather than an actual . transaction rate, should be over-hauled, even if they appear ‘squeaky . clean’, he said. Paul Tucker flatly denied that any senior figure in the former Labour government asked him to 'lean on' Barclays to lower its submissions. His comments appeared to contradict statements made last week by Chancellor George Osborne, who claimed that members of Gordon Brown's inner circle had put pressure on the bank. Speaking to The Spectator magazine last week, the Chancellor said people around Mr Brown 'were clearly involved' in the discussion about how to keep Libor down and had 'questions to answer' about rate-fixing. In a reference to shadow chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Osborne said: 'My opposite number was City minister for part of this period and Gordon Brown’s right-hand man for all of it. 'So he has questions to answer as well.' To avoid any doubt about who he was referring to, Mr Osborne added: 'That’s Ed Balls, by the way.' Mr Osborne did not mention any other individuals by name, but it was widely assumed that he was referring to former Treasury minister Baroness Vadera, a close ally of the ex-prime minister. However, Mr Tucker challenged these suggestions in a key exchange with committee member Pat McFadden, a Labour MP. Mr McFadden asked: 'Did (the Downing Street chief of staff in 2008) Jeremy Heywood or any other Government official that you have mentioned... ever encourage you to lean on Barclays or any other bank to lower their Libor submissions?' Mr Tucker replied: 'Absolutely not.' McFadden: 'Did any government minister from the last government ever encourage you to lean on Barclays or any other bank to lower their Libor submissions?' Tucker: 'Absolutely not.' McFadden: 'Specifically, did Shriti Vadera ever ask you to lean on Barclays or any bank to lower their Libor submissions?' Tucker: 'Absolutely not, and if I may just add, what is more I don’t think that I spoke to Shriti Vadera throughout this whole period at all.' McFadden: 'Did Ed Balls ever ask you to lean on Barclays or any other bank?' Tucker: 'No, no.' McFadden: 'Or any other government minister?' Tucker: 'No.' Mr Balls seized on Mr Tucker's comments and swiftly issued a statement calling on Mr Osborne to apologise. 'It is now absolutely clear that the Chancellor’s allegations last week were totally false and completely without foundation,' Mr Balls said. 'George Osborne should now publicly withdraw these false allegations and apologise. 'With the economy in a double-dip recession and our banks in need of serious reform, the country needs a Chancellor who works full-time in the national economic interest.' Mr Tucker, who had asked to give . evidence to MPs, used the word ‘cesspit’ several times to refer to the . manipulation of Libor by Barclays and up to 20 other banks. Emails released yesterday after a . Freedom of Information request by Labour MP John Mann reveal that Mr . Tucker was in regular contact with Barclays boss Bob Diamond at the . height of the financial crisis. In one email sent to Mr Diamond and . the then Barclays chief executive John Varley, he wrote: ‘Could I talk . to one of you about Libor, please? It’s a slightly sensitive point.’ Other communiques between Mr Diamond, . who was forced out of Barclays last week, and Mr Tucker and former . No 10 permanent secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood reveal how informal their . conversations were. Messages were exchanged on a Sunday and references . made to ‘dinner’. In one email sent on October 21, Sir . Jeremy, who had recently had ‘supper’ with Mr Tucker, asks why Libor is . not falling ‘as fast as [in the] US?’ Five days later, he emails Mr Tucker on a Sunday to say he is ‘an advocate’ of finding ways to speed up the fall in Libor. Although the emails fail to prove . that the Bank put Barclays under pressure to fiddle the Libor rate, MPs . from all parties attacked Mr Tucker amid suspicions that he knew that . Libor was being fiddled but did nothing about it. They quoted from minutes of a Bank . meeting, chaired by Mr Tucker, on November 15, 2007, at the height of . the credit crunch attended by all Britain’s banking giants. In paragraph . 2.1, it says: ‘Several group members thought that Libor fixings had . been lower than actual traded interbank rates through the period of . stress.’ Mr Tyrie said: ‘This does not look . good, Mr Tucker. 'That you have [in these minutes] what appears to any . reasonable person a clear indication of low-balling about which nothing . was done. In a further blow, he was lambasted . for failing to do anything after Mr Diamond appeared to clearly tell him . that other banks were fiddling their Libor rates. Mr Diamond, who resigned last week, . wrote a note on October 29, 2008, following a phone call from Mr Tucker. Mr Diamond wrote: ‘I asked if he could relay the reality, that not all . banks were providing quotes at the levels that represented real . transactions.’ Questioned by Tory MP David Ruffley, . Mr Tucker said: ‘A bell did not go off in my head [that banks were . lowering their Libor submissions.]’ He said: ‘I did not understand Bob . Diamond’s conversation to be a whistleblower conversation at all. He did . not say, “Listen, Paul, I’m trying to tell you something absolutely . terrible”.’ As a result of Mr Diamond’s note, his . deputy, Jerry del Missier, who also resigned last week, instructed . Barclays staff to start cutting its Libor submissions. Mr Tucker also came under fire for . failing to keep a note of this crucial conversation despite the fact . that it is the Bank of England’s policy to make a note of all important . conversations. He told MPs yesterday that he . ‘greatly wished’ he had taken a note, but said his note-taking had . imploded when the financial crisis struck in 2007. When Mr Tyrie said the situation at the Bank was ‘a bit of a mess’, Mr Tucker agreed: ‘It was a mess, Mr Chairman.’ Disillusioned: Police and security guards stand in front of a Barclays Bank branch last week where protesters stuck messages to a banner during a demonstration against former CEO Bob Diamond . October 22: Mr Tucker asks for meeting with Barclays Chief Exec John Varley to discuss 'a slightly sensitive point.' He then writes to another Barclays worker asking about 'the structure and sources of your money market funding before the turmoil began.'October 25: Mr Tucker sends an e-mail to Bob Diamond and writes he was 'struck that your govt gnteed bond was issued at around 140 (points) over gilts', 'That’s a lot,' he said.October 29: Bob Diamond and Paul Tucker speak on the phone, and he writes a note suggesting Mr Tucker was condoning Barclays submission of low Libor bids.October 30: Mr Diamond writes again saying simply: 'Investor confidence is slowly (very slowly) returning.

Jonathon Bennett, a junior at East Carolina University in North Carolina, was walking across a fallen tree with four friends early Wednesday morning when a branch he was holding broke causing him to slip, according to police. Bennett fell six to eight feet before landing on a waist-high metal fence post, impaling him from the lower left of his back through his upper right chest. Untimely death: Jonathon Bennett, 21, a junior at East Carolina University, died on Wednesday when he was walking on a fallen tree and fell onto a metal post .

"PUBLISHED: . 23:53 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 27 April 2013 . North Korean said it will soon put on trial an American tourist they’ve accused of trying to overthrow the government. After weeks war cries against the U.S. and South Korea, the indictment of Kenneth Bae broke a relative lull in threats and provocative acts by the rogue state. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has expressed rage over U.N. sanctions over a February nuclear test and ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills, though analysts say Pyongyang's motive is to get its Korean War foes to negotiate on its own terms. Rogue: Led by Kim Jong Un, pictured, North Korea has indicted an American tourist on charges of plotting to overthrow the government . Identified in North Korea’s state media by his Korean name, Pae Jun Ho, Bae is a tour operator of Korean descent who was arrested after arriving with a tour on Nov. 3 in Rason, a special economic zone bordering China and Russia. He is the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009. The other Americans were eventually deported or released after high-profile diplomatic interventions, including some involving former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Analysts say the North will likely soon hand Bae a harsh punishment to use him as a bargaining chip in possible negotiations with the United States. In 2009, American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee were arrested and sentenced to 12 years of hard labor for trespassing and unspecified hostile acts. They were freed later that year after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang to negotiate their release. Odd: The rogue state has lately made many unusual threats from its capital Pyongyang, pictured . Hereditary: Like his father Kim Jong Il, pictured, Kim Jong Un is likely using Bae as a bargaining chip with the U.S. and South Korea . ‘The preliminary inquiry into crimes committed by American citizen Pae Jun Ho closed,’ the official Korean Central News Agency said in a brief report. ‘In the process of investigation he admitted that he committed crimes aimed to topple the DPRK with hostility toward it. His crimes were proved by evidence.’ Under North Korea's criminal code, terrorist acts include murdering, kidnapping and injuring the country's citizens can lead to a death sentence or life in jail. North Korea and the United States fought the 1950-53 Korean War and still don't have diplomatic relations. Token: In 2009, North Korea held two American journalists until former president Bill Clinton negotiated their release . The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang represents the United States. KCNA didn't say when Bae's trial will take place or what the charges were. North Korea's state media and the U.S. government have made little information about Bae public. But his friends, colleagues and South Korean activists specializing in North Korea affairs said Bae is a Christian missionary based in a Chinese border town who frequently made trips to North Korea to feed orphans there. It is not known whether he tried to evangelize while in North Korea. Officially, North Korea guarantees freedom of religion. In practice, authorities crack down on Christians, who are seen as Western-influenced threats to the government. The distribution of Bibles and secret prayer services can mean banishment to a labor camp or execution, defectors from the country have said.","Both the U.S. and North Korea are mum on details of Kenneth Bae's indictment, but Bae's friends and colleagues say he was on a Christian mission to feed orphans .
Bae will likely be handed a harsh sentence, making him a valuable bargaining chip in negotiations with the United States and South Korea ."

The New York man accused of killing an entire Brooklyn family in a brutal hit-and-run crash last month leading to his arrest across state lines is defending himself while saying 'accidents happen.' 'Sure I played a part, I couldn't stop. Accidents happen,' Julio Acevedo told WABC News in a jailhouse interview while being held without bond on three counts of vehicular manslaughter in the March 3 crash. Nachman and Raizel Glauber, as well as their infant son, were killed as the 21-year-old couple rushed to deliver their baby at a hospital. Their hired vehicle collided with Acavedo's on the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Minor role: Julio Acevedo, held on three counts of vehicular manslaughter, says he played a minor part in the death of a young New York couple and their infant son but has pleaded not guilty to his charges . Their son, delivered by cesarean . section, died the next day of extreme prematurity due to blunt-force . injuries to his mother, who was seven months pregnant and was thrown . from the hired car, the city medical examiner's office said. The couple were only married one year when the tragic accident happened. Acavedo fled the scene but turned himself in four days later in Pennsylvania. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, including speeding at 70 MPH. He blames the couple's livery cab driver for running a stop sign, leading to the crash. 'Let's ask the cab driver, why did he run the stop sign?' he asked. 'He was in more of a rush than I was. He was rushing the woman to the hospital.' Acavedo previously told the Daily News that he was fleeing a gunman trying to shoot at him when his borrowed BMW . slammed into the Glaubers' hired car. He told the newspaper he fled . because he was worried he would be killed. But police said there were no . reports of shots fired in the area at the time of the wreck. Killed: Nachman and Raizel Glauber, as well as their infant son, were all killed as the young couple rushed to deliver their baby at a hospital, their hired vehicle colliding with Acavedo's . Collision: Authorities accuse Acevedo of speeding 70 MPH on the street before colliding with the couple's livery cab driver. Acevedo says their driver ran a stop sign . The Glaubers' driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, has told police that he doesn't remember anything after being knocked unconscious in the wreck. 'I'm made out to be the monster in all . this,' Acevedo told ABC. 'I can't bring 'em back, it was an accident. I . apologize deeply,' he said. Asked if he would have done anything different, he says he wouldn't have left the scene like he did. 'Now knowing what I'm going through, I would have stayed,' he said. 'I was afraid of being treated unjustly, as I was in 1987.' In that year he was charged with the murder of a man known as the original ‘50 Cent,’ Kelvin Martin. Local gangsters wanted Martin dead and so kidnapped Acavedo and forced him to carry out the hit or they'd kill him and his family. 'He was my best friend at the time,' Acevedo said. 'I was forced to kill him.' Unjustified: Asked if he would have done anything different, Acevedo says he wouldn't have left the scene (pictured) like he did but that the law has yet to prove itself just with him . Dodgy past: In 1987 Acevedo was sentenced for the intentional murder of the original '50 Cent,' Kelvin Martin, pictured, whom he calls his best friend and a crime he was forced to perform . Avacedo . was sentenced to 20 years to life for Martin's death before the . Brooklyn District Attorney's office found evidence proving Avacedo's . claims to be true. 'They sat on the information until Acevedo got wind of it,' his attorney Scott Brettschneider told ABC. Avavedo was released after spending 10 years in prison. 'I don't trust the system, I don't believe in it. I've been through it. I hope to be treated fairly, that's it,' he told ABC. Just two weeks before the deadly crash in Williamsburg, Acevedo was stopped by police for driving erratically and his blood alcohol level was far above the legal level at .13. He told police he had drunk just two beers at a baby shower before he was pulled over. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day without bail. Impact: Roughly one thousand community members in Brooklyn's close-knit ultra-Orthodox Jewish community turned out for the couple's funeral while demanding justice for their death . Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the . family's Orthodox Jewish community, called Acevedo a 'coward' before his . arrest and demanded he be charged with three murders. 'We in the community are demanding that . the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this . couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a . statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even . bothering to check on the people of the other car.' The couple belonged to a close-knit ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest community of ultra-Orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000. They were members of the Satmar Hasidic sect. Nachman Glauber, whose family founded a line of clothing for Orthodox Jews, was studying at a rabbinical college. Raizy Glauber grew up in a prominent rabbinical family. The couple's son was buried near their graves, a community spokesman said.

"President Obama faces rising pressure to intervene in the civil war . U.S. officials say they suspect the deadly agent sarin has already been fired off in small-scale attacks . Mr Obama wary of launching military action based on primary intelligence reports of chemical weapons use . Obama: investigation into whether Syria was using chemical weapons on its own people could take a long time . By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:18 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:39 EST, 27 April 2013 . President Barack Obama warned Syria on Friday that its use of chemical weapons would be a 'game changer' for the United States but made clear he was in no rush to intervene in the Syrian civil war on the basis of evidence he said was still preliminary. Speaking a day after the disclosure of U.S. intelligence that Syria had likely used chemical weapons against its own people, Obama mixed talked tough while calling for patience as he sought to fend off pressure for a swift response against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 'Horrific as it is when mortars are being fired on civilians and people are being indiscriminately killed, to use potential weapons of mass destruction on civilian populations crosses another line with respect to international norms and international law,' Obama told reporters at the White House as he began talks with Jordan's King Abdullah. Scroll down for video . Delicate situation: U.S. President Barack Obama listens to remarks by Jordan's King Abdullah (left) prior to a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office of the White House to discuss the Syrian crisis . 'That is going to be a game changer,' he said. But Obama stopped short of declaring that Assad had crossed ""a red line"" and described the U.S. intelligence evaluations as 'a preliminary assessment.' While some more hawkish lawmakers have called for a U.S. military response and for the arming of anti-Assad rebels, several leading congressional voices urged a calmer approach after Secretary of State John Kerry briefed them. 'This is not Libya,' said Nancy Pelosi, the senior Democrat in the House of Representatives, referring to the relative ease with which a NATO bombing campaign helped overthrow Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. 'The Syrians have anti-aircraft capability that makes going in there much more challenging.' President Obama: 'To use potential weapons of mass destruction of civilian populations crosses another line' U.S. officials said on Thursday the intelligence community believes with varying degrees of confidence that Assad's forces used the nerve agent sarin on a small scale against rebel fighters. Obama had warned earlier that deployment of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would trigger unspecified consequences, widely interpreted to include possible U.S. military action. Aides have insisted that the Democratic president will need all the facts before he deciding on action, making clear it is mindful of the lessons of the start of the Iraq war more than a decade ago. Then, the Republican administration of President George W. Bush used inaccurate intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq in pursuit of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons that turned out not to exist. U.S. officials said the evaluation that Syria probably used chemical weapons was based in part on 'physiological' samples but have refused to say exactly where they came from or who supplied the material. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES FOLLOW . Syrian weaponry: The White House says it doesn't have 'airtight' proof that the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its own people . Battle wounds: A wounded Syrian man holding his injured son after an air raid in the northwestern of Syria. The White House has said the Syrian government has twice used chemical weapons . Symptoms: Pictures have suggested Syria may have used chemical weapons . WMD usage? A woman foams at the mouth while lying on a stretcher at a hospital in Syria. It is not known if the symptoms resembled those triggered by a chemical weapons attack . Were WMD's Used? Animal carcasses lie on the ground, killed by what residents said was a chemical weapon attack in the northern city of Aleppo. The UN says it will investigate the claims . White House spokesman Jay Carney said the evidence so far of Syrian chemical weapons use was not an ""airtight case"" and declined to set a deadline for corroborating reports. Obama and his aides also appeared intent on deflecting pressure for swift action by stressing the need for a comprehensive U.N. investigation on the ground in Syria - something Assad has blocked from going forward. The United States has resisted being dragged militarily into Syria's conflict and is providing only non-lethal aid to rebels trying to overthrow Assad. Washington is worried that weapons supplied to the rebels could end up in the hands of al Qaeda-linked fighters. But acknowledgment of the U.S. intelligence assessment appeared to move the United States closer - at least rhetorically - to some sort of action in Syria, military or otherwise. Carney said Obama would consider a range of options including, but not exclusive to, military force, should it be determined that Syria has used chemical weapons. 'Often the discussion, when people mention all options are on the table, everyone just talks about military force,"" he said. ""It's important to remember that there are options available to a commander in chief in a situation like this that include but are not exclusive to that option.' Protestors: Demonstrators chant slogans and wave Syrian opposition flags as a boy shouts into a loud hailer during a protest against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad afer Friday prayers . Evidence: The US believes with varying degrees of confidence that Syria's regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale. President Obama says he needs 'credible and corroborated' facts before acting . Some U.S. experts warn that Obama risks further emboldening Assad if he acts too slowly or not all, but the White House must also keep in mind polls showing most Americans, weary of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, are against new military entanglements. As a result, Obama is unlikely to turn to military options quickly or without allies joining him. Those options vary from limited one-off missile strikes, perhaps one of the least complicated scenarios, to more bold operations like carving out no-fly, ""safe zones."" One grim scenario envisions sending tens of thousands of U.S. forces to help secure the chemical weapons. Current and former U.S. officials see little chance of achieving success through the two main diplomatic options: persuading Russia to increase pressure on Syria at the U.N. Security Council, or pressuring Assad to negotiate his own departure. 'There is no evidence of any interest on the part of Assad, who seems to think Iran and Hezbollah and Russia can pull his chestnuts out of the fire,' said Fred Hof, who was a top State Department official working on Syria until September. Destroyed lives: The number of Syrians who have fled their conflict-ravaged homeland has surpassed 1.4 million, the United Nations refugee agency said, warning that it was no longer able to meet their medical needs . The Obama administration's sudden disclosure of its chemical weapons findings came just two days after it played down an Israeli assessment that there had been repeated use of chemical weapons in Syria. France and Britain have also concluded that evidence suggests chemical arms have been used. It is unclear why the Obama administration changed its mind so quickly this week. Weapons inspectors will determine whether banned chemical agents were used in the two-year-old conflict only if they are able to access sites and take soil, blood, urine or tissue samples and examine them in certified laboratories, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which works with the United Nations on inspections. Assertions of chemical weapon use in Syria by Western and Israeli officials citing photos, sporadic shelling and traces of toxins do not meet the standard of proof needed for a U.N. team of experts waiting to gather their own field evidence, the organization said.","President Obama faces rising pressure to intervene in the civil war .

It's the sort of poise and self-assurance  in front of the camera shown only by Hollywood veterans and top models. But this is Silver Linings Playbook actress Jennifer Lawrence as a teenager, displaying a maturity beyond her years. These pictures, from the Oscar-winning star’s private portfolio, were taken when she was aged 14 and 15 and pursuing a modelling career. Self-assured: Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence in modelling shots taken when she was aged between 14 and 15 . And Jennifer must have been wishing she had looked so self-assured when she famously stumbled as she walked on to the podium to collect her Best Actress Oscar in February. Despite her tender years in these photos, she already had a fearless streak. She not only turned down a number of early modelling offers, but as a 15-year-old she stormed out of a meeting at a top showbusiness agency in New York – because a receptionist was rude to her. Photographer and agent Chris Kaufman, who took these pictures, says there was never any doubt that Jennifer was headed for stardom. He said: ‘When I first took her picture, I stopped shooting and turned to my assistant and said, “You don’t see people move like that.” I just thought, “Where did you get this ability?” She’s always had such natural talent. Modelling shots from Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence's private portfolio have been released for the first time . She’s always wanted to act and I’m not surprised that she’s got to be where she is today. It’s been a meteoric rise.

Ironic: While covering his medical marijuana beat, Michael Montgomery accidentally ate high potency pot brownies . A reporter with a beat in the seedy dealings of medical marijuana found himself swallowing a bitter pill as he accidentally got a taste of his own medicine and was forced to re-evaluate his notions of the pot world. Though many journalists get wrapped up in their work, not a lot cover what Michael Montgomery does. For the Center for Investigative Reporting and KQED, Montgomery has covered California’s medical marijuana laws and booming pot industry for years. In 2010, he spent the day in Los Angeles . with a pot dealer turned business woman looking to reap the benefits of . the state’s newly loosened marijuana laws. ‘She let us follow her as she was . doing her thing,’ Montgomery said in a video produced by the Center for . Investigative Journalism about the incident. He’d . gone to the woman’s home, where she hosted a weekly gathering of weed . enthusiasts. A doctor was on call to write marijuana prescriptions for . those who needed them, bongs were packed and waiting in a back cottage, . and food was available, some laced, some not. ‘It was brunch with pot,’ he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cute: With the Center for Investigative Journalism, Montgomery made a comically animated video on his ordeal . Eager to capture the ‘remarkable scene,’ Montgomery wasn’t focused on what was going into his mouth. Thinking he was merely indulging a sweet tooth, he indulged with his subjects. ‘I didn’t really pay close attention…so I ate the brownies.’ ‘In a little bit of a hurry,’ Montgomery left for the airport to catch a flight back to San Francisco shortly thereafter. But when he got there, something wasn’t right. ‘It hits me,’ he said.  ‘I am, like, totally stoned.’ Unfortunate: Montgomery boarded a Virgin America plane soon after the brownies kicked in, his first time on the unusually lit air carrier . Montgomery managed to get on his flight, but even that didn’t seem normal. ‘I had never flown Virgin America before this trip,’ he said. Accidentally stoned, the reporter also happened to board what can only be described as the trippiest of all U.S. air carriers. He boarded a cabin filled by moody purple and pink lights and trance music. ‘I gotta get out of this plane,’ he recalled thinking. Montgomery quickly deboarded in a panic and found a lonely corner in LAX, where he attempted to just sleep it off.  He even called his wife in hopes she could calm him down and she advised him just to wait things out. For four hours he experienced severe . anxiety before he was able to ‘even think about’ boarding another plane. He’d later learn that the marijuana brownies from the party were of a . very high grade and even experienced users were encouraged to only eat a . quarter to a half of the large dose confections. He’d eaten two full brownies. But the experience, Montgomery said, was an educational one . The experienced marijuana journalist had gotten a dose of his own bitter medicine. Panicked: Montgomery ran off the plane and spent four hours in the airport that forced him to rethink his views on medical marijuana . Rethink: Montgomery wondered what a 16-year-old in his position might have done and suggested that more regulation is a good thing . ‘[It] got me to think a lot harder about pot.’ Montgomery said he now believes today’s marijuana is a far cry from that of 20 or 30 years ago. ‘If I was a 16 year old kid and ate two of these brownies,’ he wondered. ‘Where would it leave me if I were driving a vehicle?’ Right now, Montgomery said, medical marijuana is not closely regulated. He likely thinks that should change when he’s in the San Francisco Bay area he calls home and commonly encounters the aroma of pot. ‘Every time I smell a joint, I still have that slight little pulse of panic.’","On assignment in the hemp jungles of Los Angeles, Michael Montgomery inadvertently ate what turned out to be marijuana brownies .

The 'Terrorista#1' license plate adorning a BMW driven by friends of the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect is a joke about hard partying and does not imply a thirst for jihad, their lawyer has claimed. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, have been held in a Boston jail since April 20 on administrative immigration charges because their . academic visas had expired. The two men from Kazakhstan raised eyebrows when it was revealed that they had been driving around in a BMW with a license plate that read 'Terrorista#1' Best of friends: Azamat Tazhayakov, left, Dias Kadyrbayev, center, and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, are pictured in New York's Times Square . A lawyer for Kadyrbayev, Robert Stahl, says that the plate was given to his client as a joke about his late-night partying ways and does not mean that the 19-year-olds are terrorists. Mr Stahl told CBS News: 'It's such a silly thing. Bad timing. [Kadyrbayev's] desire is to be released so he can return home. He would like to go home to the comfort of his family. 'You can imagine being 19 years old and having SWAT teams break down your door. It's a terrible situation.' Another concern was raised when Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were found to be among a group of men pictured with Tsarnaev in New York's Times Square - the bombing suspects' next target. The three were classmates at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Wrong plate, wrong time: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends liked to cruise around in a car with the 'Terrorista #1' license plate . Mr Stahl says that Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov had nothing to do with the deadly attack at the marathon finish line on April 15, and had seen no indication that Tsarnaev harbored any violent or terrorist sympathies. He said: 'These kids are just as shocked and horrified about what happened as everyone else. They can't even fathom something like this from a kid who seemed to be a typical young college student.' Tsarnaev would hang out at the their New Bedford, Massachusetts apartment frequently and may have stayed with them on the night of the bombing and the following night. In addition to the suspicious 'Terroristas' plate, Kadyrbayev's black BMW 330XI had a sticker on the back that reads: 'F*** . you, you f****** f****'. Los terroristas means 'the terrorists' in Spanish but it's also a slang reference to 'buddies and friends.' Jailed: Azamat Tazhayakov, left, and Dias Kadyrbayev, right, have been detained for immigration violations since April 20 . Complex: The apartment complex where the men live is about 10 minutes from the Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, had been a student . Tweet: Dzhokar had tweeted pictures of himself with the car on his account under the name J_tsar . Symbol: The BMW is pictured outside the housing complex where the arrests took place on April 20 . They are now being held at Suffolk County House of Corrections in Boston. The April 2012 photo shows Dzhokhar posing with four pals in Times Square with four pals, including Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev. But officials had no clear idea of where the suspect was staying in the city or whether he met with anyone during the two trips. It was revealed last week that Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan, 26, had hatched a plot to bomb Times Square after they shot and killed MIT Officer Sean Collier three days after the marathon bombing. The brothers pair carjacked a Mercedes SUV and took its owner hostage with the intention to drive to New York. But the brothers noted the stolen vehicle was low on gas, and stopped to refuel - only for the car's owner to escape and call police. Tamerlan, 26, died after he was riddled with bullets and run over in the ensuing firefight, and Dzhokhar was arrested after a day of hiding inside a docked boat in a Watertown backyard. Charged: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was taken into custody late on April 19 after a day of hiding out in a boat .","Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both from Kazakhstan, raised suspicion after their car was revealed to have a 'Terrorista#1' license plate .

Wanted man: Philip Egglishaw is alleged to have 'absconded with or spent all' of Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan's money . A British tax adviser accused by Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan of stealing £22 million of his earnings is hiding out in Switzerland – directly above a police station. Philip Egglishaw, 59, who allegedly helped conceal the movie star’s earnings in offshore tax havens,  is said to have ‘absconded with  or spent all’ of the money and is a wanted man in Australia. Australian authorities – who have been told by The Mail on Sunday of Egglishaw’s whereabouts – are hunting him in connection with a massive tax evasion scheme used by wealthy people there. Egglishaw is understood to have helped 73-year-old Hogan move the money through his Geneva firm, Strachans, so he did not have to pay tax on it in Australia. Egglishaw has issued a statement denying accusations that he had stolen the money. When The Mail on Sunday tracked him down to his home in a quiet five-storey block in an upmarket area  of Geneva he refused to discuss the allegations against him. Neighbours said they saw the well-spoken Briton only when he walked his dog. Hogan became a star after the success of Crocodile Dundee in 1986. He married his co-star, Linda Kozlowski. The Australian actor has filed legal papers against Egglishaw in the US. Egglishaw has ‘absconded with or spent all’ of the star’s millions, according to documents filed in the Californian District Court. Hogan’s representative provided the court with an email sent last October to Egglishaw’s lawyer in Geneva, Paul Gully-Hart, claiming Egglishaw was engaging in criminal fraud. The email said the ‘actions of Egglishaw have now crossed the boundary of legality and he is now engaging in criminal fraud, theft and breach of fiduciary duty, and you are now directly aiding and abetting his criminal actions’. Writ: Paul Hogan as Crocodile Dundee with co-star Linda Kozlowski . This newspaper also visited  Mr Gully-Hart’s office in central Geneva on Friday, but he refused to come downstairs to the reception. Instead he sent an email referring to an earlier statement released on behalf of his client. The statement said: ‘It is a matter of public record that I have acted for various Australian clients. ‘My firm is regulated, externally audited and operates openly in  Switzerland. The accusations made in the media that I or my firm have stolen or inappropriately dealt with client funds are completely false and vehemently denied. ‘We are strictly following advice received from our Australian QCs  to achieve an outcome satisfactory to our clients and the Australian authorities to allow repatriation of funds to Australia ensuring that all due taxes are met.’ Egglishaw has operated from  Switzerland since the Nineties. But in 2003 Australian tax inspectors found evidence that his ‘tax efficient’ schemes breached the law, after searching his five-star hotel room in Sydney. When Egglishaw’s laptop was seized, it revealed names of numerous wealthy clients. But by then he had fled to Switzerland. Operation Wickenby, a joint investigation by the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Tax Office, discovered that Strachans was setting up fake companies for high-earners, who sent money off shore with fake invoices that were later used to seek tax deductions. In a statement, the Australian Crime Commission’s executive director Paul Jevtovic said: ‘The Australian Crime Commission can confirm a warrant has been issued for Philip Egglishaw’s arrest.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Philip Egglishaw, 59, alleged to have 'absconded with or spent all' of star's money .

They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And if your idea of a hearty start is a sausage and egg McMuffin, then good news - fast food giant McDonald's could be set to serve all day breakfasts. McDonald's President and CEO Don Thompson said in a television interview that the chain has 'looked at' the idea of serving its breakfast menu all day and that the company's Innovation Centre is coming up with ideas on how to 'expand' current serving hours. The fast food firm is also considering a loyalty scheme for regular customers, mobile payment systems and even home delivery in a bid to boost sales further. When asked by a viewer if the chain would consider all day breakfasts, Mr Thompson told CNBC: 'Yes, we would consider it. We have to focus on our existing menu, focus on the delivery of that and great customer experiences. 'But we have looked at breakfast across the day. 'We have it in some markets around the world and our Innovation Centre has come up with some innovative ways for us to expand the breakfast hours and some of these things we'll be seeing in the near future.' The majority of its UK restaurants currently stop serving breakfast at 10.30am. But with an increasing number of outlets starting to open 24 hours, breakfast staples such as Sausage McMuffins, fruit and maple oatmeal and breakfast wraps could be served around the clock. It is not the first time that McDonald's has hinted that it will extend breakfast hours. In 2006, then CEO Jim Skinner said that the chain was making changes that would see breakfast served 24/7. There is no suggestion however that customers will be able to purchase other items from McDonald's menu, such as its famous Big Mac, before 10.30am. McDonald's is also looking to follow rival Burger King's lead by branching out into home delivery and Mr Thompson said that the idea has already been launched in Latin America. He said that delivery is a 'big, big opportunity particularly in areas where we don't have a Drive Thru.' Expanding: Breakfast staples such as the sausage and egg McMuffin could be served for longer hours according to the company's CEO Don Thompson . Limited: The majority of McDonald's UK restaurants currently stop serving breakfast, including its breakfast wrap, at 10.30am . Burger King began delivering to homes in Washington last year and has since expanded the service to several other major cities. Mr Thompson admitted that McDonald's is a latecomer to ideas such as mobile payment, but he says that the company will learn from others who came to the market before them. Last year the chain launched the imaginatively titled 'Breakfast After Midnight' programme offering some of its morning menu late at night. Interview: Changes at McDonald's were hinted at by CEO Don Thompson . It promoted the idea using the newly coined term 'nocturnivores' created by the fast food chain's advertising agency. The idea was trialled in 127 outlets in central Ohio. Although McDonald's announced an increase in profits last week, sales in the US and Europe were weaker than expected.

'What I thought was, ""He's dead and I'm still here,""' said the resilient 27-year-old double amputee.

They were once Japan's highest social caste, remembered for their fearsome fighting skills and immortalized in popular culture since their demise at the end of the 19th century. But a collection of fascinating portraits of real Samurai warriors taken in the decades before reforms saw the warrior class abolished and a western-style conscripted military drafted in, give an authentic insight into military life in pre-modern Japan. Some are clad in their distinctive tosei-gusoku, or plated armour, while some look slightly less ready for combat in kimono style robes. Ruling class: A group of samurai warriors in their traditional armour and brandishing bow and arrows and swords are pictured in the 19th century . Armed and deadly: These Samurai are both seen clutching katana, or swords. The Samurai was the highest social caste until it was abolished as part of the Meiji reforms in the late 19th century . But almost all are clutching the Samurai's most famous, and perhaps most deadly, weapon - the iconic Samurai sword. Two of the images depict a group taking part in a ceremonial suicide known as harakiri, part of the warrior code which saw Samurai disemboweled to fall with honour rather than be defeated by their enemy . Thought to have been taken in the 1860s, the portraits were made at a time when of great change in terms of rule for Japan. The Edo period had seen the feudal military government the Tokugawa Shogunate rule Japan for more than 250 years, and the establishment of a rigid social caste system that would see the Samurai placed at the top. But Edo, or modern Tokyo, was about to fall and Emperor Meiji was to sweep to power, spelling the beginning of the end for the Samurai, or bushi as they were also known. The Samurai originated in the Heian . period dating back to 710 and in particular campaigns to subdue the . native Emirishi in the Tohuku region of the northern part of Honshu. Last hurrah: A group from the Satsuma clan are pictured during the Boshin War in 1868, shortly before the demise of the samurai . Respect: A pair of warriors take part in a traditional samurai ceremony. The samurai were bound by a set of Confucian influenced rules that came to be known as bushid¿ . Over the centuries they became more and more powerful and eventually became the 'warrior nobility' of Japan, making up the ruling class from about the 12th to the 19th century. The Samurai followed a set of Confucian influenced rules that came to be known as bushidō - literally 'the way of the warrior'. The unwritten and unspoken code emphasised frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honor unto death. But the code also evolved to stress heroic bravery, fierce family pride, and selfless, at times senseless devotion of master and man. Ritual: A group of samurai pictured taking part in a ceremonial suicide known as harakiri, part of the bushido code which saw warriors disemboweled to fall with honour rather than be defeated by their enemy . During the 15th and 16th centuries there were many warring factions, but later wars reduced in number. The traditions of the Samurai have developed over more than a millennium and are deep routed in Japanese society. Samurai were the military nobility of pre-industrial Japan. The Samurai followed a set of rules that came to be known as bushidō - literally 'the way of the warrior'. The unwritten and unspoken code emphasised frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honor unto death. But the code also evolved to stress heroic bravery, fierce family pride, and selfless, at times senseless devotion of master and man. The fearsome warriors wore plate armour and a vast array of weapons including the bow and arrow, spears, guns, and of course, the Samurai sword. But as peace seemed to endure during the Edo period, many became teachers, artists or bureaucrats as the need for martial skills became less important. And when Emperor Meiji came to power in 1868 he began to abolish the Samurai's powers. Firstly, he stripped their right to be the only armed force in Japan and began to introduce a western style conscripted army from 1873. One of the pictures in the collection . shows some of the Satsuma faction of the Samurai fighting in one of its . last hurrahsin 1868, the Boshin War - an attempt to return political . power to the imperial court. The . Samurai became the shizoku, merging with another social class under . Meiji reforms and the right to wear a katana (sword) was lost along with . the power to execute anyone who disrespected them in public. The name shizoku continued to be a part of Japanese culture until the end of World War Two but was outlawed in 1947. Despite . the Samurai making up no more than 10 per cent of the Japanese . population at its height, its influence is still heavily seen in . Japanese culture, in particular modern martial arts. Doomed: A kneeling samurai warrior understandably looks glum as he is about to take part in a ritual suicide ceremony . The Samurai sword, or katana, is characterized by its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single-edged blade with a circular or squared guard and long grip to accommodate two hands. It has historically been associated with the Samurai of feudal Japan and has become renowned for its sharpness and strength. The sword dates back until before 900ad and is said to have increased in popularity among Samurai because of a change in the nature of close combat. Traditional: A samurai sword . The katana, worn in a form of sash known as an obi, and the blade of the sword facing upwards, meant that in theory a warrior could arm himself and strike an opponent in one single, swift movement. A quick response to an attack often meant the difference between life and death. The swords, which are traditionally around 70cm in length, are traditionally made from a form of specialised Japanes steel called Tamahagane. The steel is created using a smelting process that results in several levels of different carbon concentrations. Polishing the blade of the katana takes between one and three weeks. Production of the swords was banned in 1945 but began again under restrictions in 1953.","The portraits are thought to have been taken in the late 1860s .

A scorned lover accused of plunging a kitchen knife into her boyfriend's chest in a vicious domestic dispute has opened up about the pair's fraught relationship and revealed that she still has feelings for the alleged bad boy. Latvian-born Yekaterina Pusepa, 23, faces attempted-murder charges and is being held on $75,000 bail at New York's Rikers Island. The only correspondence she has had with her ex, Alec Katsnelson, after the May 2012 fight that saw her led off in handcuffs with blood splattered on her midriff-baring white T-shirt, is a curt order to abort his baby, she claims. Accused: Latvian-born Yekaterina Pusepa, 23, faces attempted-murder charges and is being held on $75,000 bail at New York's Riker's Island . She says she fell pregnant in March 2012, at around the time the pair's 'exclusive' relationship turned violent, culminating in the angry argument in May. Pusepa faces 12 years in prison and will likely be deported to Latvia if she is convicted. The young woman, with her late mother, left her homeland for California when she was 11 and no longer has friends or family in the eastern European country. In an hours-long jailhouse interview with The New York Post, Pusepa paused when asked if she still loves Katsnelson, 23, who underwent surgery and has now recovered from the stabbing wound. 'I don't know,' she answered softly. She says her ex, who she met at a nightclub in late 2011, is already back to his partying ways and hasn't come to see her at Rikers Island jail complex. When she was arrested, Katsnelson told her, through a friend, that he didn't want her to keep the baby, according to The Post. 'He said he wanted me to have an abortion,' she told the newspaper. Pusepa initially refused but later went through with the procedure after learning the child would have been placed in foster care. Grisly: Mr Katsnelson (left) was stabbed, allegedly by his girlfriend Pusepa (right) 'I was told the baby would go into the system, and I didn't want that,' she said. She describes Katsnelson as 'a child.' 'He has no remorse. He supposedly had all these injuries, and he's running around in the streets, smoking ...going to clubs. We're both in this because of what he did.' The two met at the club Pacha in November 2011, while Pusepa was working as a waitress at Manhattan restaurant Southern Hospitality and Katsnelson managed a Duane Reade drugstore. She told The Post that he offered her ecstasy and the pair soon began dating. 'We were exclusive,' she says. Katsnelson, who denies ever selling or using drugs, says Pusepa cheated on him and insists that he never got her pregnant. 'She's lying,' he told the newspaper. 'We weren't even having sex at the end.' Pusepa admitted to the Post that she abused ecstasy. 'I had a drug problem,' she says. Story: Pusepa allegedly claimed her boyfriend's wounds were self-inflicted but later changed her story . Bloody: Police found Yekaterina Pusepa standing outside her apartment drenched in blood . She claims a fight last March was sparked when she noticed he'd stolen money from her purse but neighbors at the time told The Post it was triggered after he confronted her about her drug problem. He 'put his hands on me,' she says of the incident. 'I thought I had broken my tailbone. It hurt so bad, I couldn't sit down.' Katsnelson was charged with assault and spent a weekend in jail, but charges were later dropped. She got an order of protection against him but the two reconciled. 'He pursued me, and I was in love. I thought he could change,' she told The Post. After the May incident, Pusepa first claimed that Katsnelson grabbed the knife and plunged it into his own chest in a suicide attempt, but then she changed her story to say she stabbed him in self-defense. Katsnelson told police Pusepa flew into a rage when he got a call from another woman and began ransacking his apartment before stabbing him when he tried to stop her. When police arrived Pusepa was covered in blood in the street, sobbing. Pusepa's attorney is set to argue self-defense, she says. And while she still feels fondly for him, Katsnelson told The Post the two will never get back together. 'Everybody has feelings for someone they loved once in their life, but when you have something that traumatic happen, there's no way you can go back,' he said.","Yekaterina Pusepa, 23, faces attempted-murder charges and is being held on $75,000 bail at New York's Rikers Island .

A nursing student has been accused of lying about having terminal brain cancer to her friends and community college, allegedly leading to her getting preferential treatment. Chanda Thie, 31, told staff at Ivy Tech Community College in Richmond, Indiana that she was dying from glioblastoma, an aggressive, deadly brain cancer, in 2008, according to a civil complaint. It led to the school to create a nursing scholarship for other students in her name, and she was also allegedly placed on a fast track to complete her degree, claiming it was her dying wish to be a nurse. As friends were fooled by her lies, one allegedly bathed and dressed her and pushed her in a wheelchair, according to the complaint which was reported in the Indianapolis Star Press. 'Lies': Nursing student Chanda Thie, pictured, has been accused of lying that she had terminal brain cancer to her friends and college administrators, leading to her receiving preferential treatment . She allegedly tricked them by never moving her right arm in public, and claiming she had a device for IV access under a bandage on her chest, as well as a catheter under an arm bandage. In yet more bizarre behaviour, she allegedly visited her former teachers to say goodbye before she died - leading one to write a eulogy - and she also allegedly attacked a care giver with a toilet lid. Thie was hired as a nurse at Indiana University Health bone marrow transplant unit in Indianapolis pending her gaining a nursing license in 2008. But the complaint in the Indiana attorney general's office claims Thie is unfit . to practice due to addiction of drugs or alcohol, mental . disability and the illegal possession of a catheter. School: She attended Ivy Tech, which set up a scholarship to honor her after the 'diagnosis' The complaint is now seeking disciplinary sanctions, such as suspension, revocation or probation, but it unclear whether she is still working at IU Health. It comes after she told the attorney general's office in 2011 and 2012 that she was hospitalized for an overdose, depression and suicidal thoughts but later returned to work, the Star Press reported. Despite the allegations, Ivy Tech spokesman Jeffery Fanter insisted that Thie was never fast-tracked or given preferential treatment due to her claims. He added that the scholarship was set up on the request of a staff member, but that it was cancelled when it emerged she had lied about her condition. The donations raised were then given to other nursing scholarships, he said. 'Fake': Thie's lies also allegedly led her to be bathed and dressed by a friend. She claimed she could not move her right arm, and that she was wearing catheters and IV access beneath bandages . 'Workplace': She reportedly worked at IU Health, pictured, but the civil complaint claims she is unfit to practice due to addiction, mental disability and the lies she told her friends and administrators . The Mayo Clinic added that someone is at greater risk of faking an illness if they suffer from low self esteem and the experience of being cared for during a childhood illness. Other factors could be the loss of a loved one, working in healthcare or the unfulfilled ambition to work within the health field, the Star reported. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer, and needs to be treated with radiation and chemotherapy. The median survival rate with treatment is 15 months, but without it, sufferers can die within three.","Chanda Thie, 31, 'told friends and teachers she had aggressive cancer'

Krystle, a 29-year-old steakhouse manager who went to the race every year, was the second fatal victim to be identified. Doctors initially told Krystle's father, William Campbell Jr., that his daughter had survived. But doctors had mistaken her for Karen, because she was carrying Krystle's identification they were unable to correct the mistake while she was in surgery. Campbell spent 12 hours believing his daughter was alive and only learned the truth after going into the post-operating room and saw Karen lying there instead. 'We had the doctors come out and tell us everything they did [to save Karen] — and it wasn't our daughter,' Campbell said. Victim: Krystle Campbell's parents had believed she survived for 12 hours and only learned she had died after going into the hospital room and finding Miss Rand instead . Krystle went to marathon, which she did every year, and was with Rand, cheering on Rand’s boyfriend. They were struck by the first blast as they waited near the finish line. William Campbell rushed to the hospital and felt relieved when doctors said they were operating on their daughter's leg at Massachusetts General Hospital. But when nurses brought him into a post-operating room around 2am and saw Rand instead. 'I said, ""That’s not my daughter, that’s Karen! Where’s my daughter?"" The doctors were as shocked as we were,' Campbell said. A Boston detective later showed them a photo of Krystle, who worked as a manager at Jimmy's Steakhouse.

Feelings after submitting top secret information to WikiLeaks: . 'I felt I accomplished something that would allow me to have a clear conscience.' On the 2007 combat video of U.S. helicopter assault that killed 11 in Iraq: . 'The most alarming aspect of the video to me was the seemingly delightful bloodlust the aerial weapons team happened to have.' Regarding State Department cables he leaked: . 'In many ways, these cables are a catalogue of cliques and gossip.' What motivated him to initially leak documents: . 'I felt we were risking for so much for people ... unwilling to cooperate with us. I began to become depressed.' Referring to investigative items that Iraq Federal Police shared with the U.S. Army regarding possible political opponents of now Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki: . 'I always want to figure out the truth.' 'The most alarming aspect of the video to me was the seemingly delightful bloodlust the aerial weapons team happened to have,' Manning said, adding that the soldiers' actions 'seemed similar to a child torturing ants with a magnifying glass.' As for the State Department cables, he said they 'documented backdoor deals and criminality that didn't reflect the so-called leader of the free world.' 'I thought these cables were a prime example of the need for a more open diplomacy,' Manning said. 'I believed that these cables would not damage the United States. However, I believed these cables would be embarrassing.' Manning also revealed that he . first tried sending his classified documents to the New York Times, . Washington Post and Politico before turning to WikiLeaks, according to a reporter Tweeting from the courtroom. 'Bradley Manning contacted New York . Times and left message it was very important. He had information. He . left email/Skype address. No response,' tweeted Firedoglake reporter Kevin Gosztola. 'Bradley Manning tried to contact POLITICO to give them war logs. Weather conditions hampered travel to office,' he wrote. 'Manning said he talked to person at WaPo who he did not think took him seriously when he described war logs.' According to the New York Times' report, Manning said he tried a number at their office and left a message for the public editor, an ombudsman, who is not part of the newsroom. At the hearing, Manning pleaded not guilty to the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, through his attorney. Manning said 'No one associated with WikiLeaks pressured me into sending more information.' Manning, who has been jailed at . Quantico Marine Base in Virginia for more than 1,000 days, could face . life imprisonment if convicted of that charge. New York Times: Reporting from the courtroom journalist Kevin Gosztola shared this tweet alleging Manning's attempt to contact the New York Times . Washington Post: Manning also told the court he spoke with someone at the Washington Post who didn't take his offer seriously . Politico: The U.S. Army private also said he tried to give his war logs to Politico but was unable due to weather conditions . He pleaded guilty to a series of 10 lesser charges that he misused classified information at the hearing before military judge Colonel Denise Lind. He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for those charges. Under a ruling last month by Lind, . Manning would have any sentence reduced by 112 days to compensate for . the markedly harsh treatment he received during his confinement. While . at Quantico, Manning was placed in solitary confinement for up to 23 . hours a day with guards checking on him every few minutes. Manning admitted to unauthorized . possession and willful communication of information from military . databases, including the Combined Information Data Network Exchange Iraq . and Combined Information Data Network Exchange Afghanistan. He . also admitted to misuse of documents from the U.S. Southern Command . pertaining to Guantanamo Bay, a memo from an unnamed intelligence . agency, and records from a military operation in Farah province in . Afghanistan. Locked away: Manning has been jailed at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia for more than 1,000 days and could face life imprisonment if convicted of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy . Manning, an Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in May 2010 while serving in Iraq and charged with downloading thousands of intelligence documents, diplomatic cables and combat videos and forwarding them to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks began exposing the U.S. government secrets in the same year, stunning diplomats around the world and outraging U.S. officials who said damage to national security from the leaks endangered U.S. lives. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has taken refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since June to avoid extradition to Sweden for alleged sex crimes. WikiLeaks has been careful never to confirm or deny Manning was the source of the documents. Reached by telephone in Britain on Thursday, Assange would not say whether he had any dealings with Manning but called him a political prisoner and said his prosecution was part of an effort by the U.S. to clamp down on criticism of its military and foreign policy. Assange himself remains under investigation by the U.S. and has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for the better part of a year to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex-crimes allegations.","Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of 22 charges in connection with leaking a cache of classified documents to WikiLeaks .

Confusion is currently surrounding whether Germany is prepared to back a £600billion bailout scheme to rescue the crumbling euro. Last night, European leaders were said to be inching towards a deal. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was understood to be poised to announce that two eurozone funds worth €750billion (£605billion) would be used to buy up the debts of Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and others. The move would essentially mean Germany and the wealthy countries of the eurozone would underwrite struggling member states. But now sources are saying Germany may not actually be backing the package, and has so far not agreed to a deal. Officials have already conceded the scheme . will be only a stopgap – designed to reduce the eye-watering borrowing . costs for eurozone members – while they take steps towards a true . ‘fiscal union’. Despite . eurozone assistance for Spain’s tottering banking sector, the interest . rates charged by international lenders on its debts soared this week . above 7 per cent - the danger point at which Greece, Portugal and . Ireland had to seek bailouts. Investors treated the announcement cautiously, with European shares steady today. The FTSE-100 is 0.48 per cent up at 5,613.12; France's CAC 40 is 0.14 per cent up at 3,122.24; and Germany's DAX is 0.37 per cent up at 6,387.21. The . European Financial Stability Facility, worth £202billion, and the . European Stability Mechanism, worth £403billion, are the schemes that . would be used to buy up the struggling countries’ debts. Previously, . the funds have been designed to make bailouts directly to stricken . governments, such as commitments to austerity measures. But in the future, if the deal is confirmed, they would be used to buy up government debts. Governments would be expected to have to make a request for the funds to buy up bonds used to raise cash, and conditions could be imposed. Scroll down to see live stock market updates... Out of order: French President Francois Hollande (left) said the rates paid on borrowed debts by Spain and Italy were unacceptable, while laws put in place by George Osborne (right) means Britain will not have to contribute . Britain does not contribute to either fund after Chancellor George Osborne changed the law to get us off the hook. Mr Osborne, speaking at the meeting of the G20 group of leading economies in Los Cabos, Mexico, said last night: ‘I think one thing we have learnt is don’t expect a single summit to solve the eurozone’s problems, otherwise you are going to be disappointed. ‘I am not claiming that this summit has solved those problems, but the eurozone is inching towards solutions. ‘Basically, we do need to see the richer countries, like Germany, like Holland, spend some of their resources in propping up the weaker countries of the eurozone. ‘Obviously it is difficult for them to do that, it is not a popular thing to do, but it is absolutely necessary. 'It’s a reminder of why we are not in the euro because I think British taxpayers would find these things difficult to stomach. Stopping: The European Central Bank has already bought ¿210billion in bonds issued by eurozone governments, but stopped the programme last year amid German resistance . 'But British taxpayers need to see the eurozone sort their act out if we are going to get sustainable growth and jobs. ‘We will see what the eurozone announce over the next couple of weeks, but there is no doubt that they realise that individual measures in individual countries. 'Like recapitalising Spanish banks and getting a Greek government in favour of staying in the euro and doing what is necessary to stay in the euro – are not by themselves enough. ‘These are systemic problems in the eurozone which require a systemic answer and we need to see measures from the eurozone that help bring borrowing costs down, that help ensure there are common resources transferred from richer countries to poorer countries, that the whole eurozone stands behind the banks of the eurozone.’ French President Francois Hollande promised ‘mechanisms that allow us to fight speculation’. He said rates paid by Spain and Italy to borrow on debt markets were ‘unacceptable’. The European Central Bank has already bought €210billion in bonds issued by eurozone governments, but stopped the programme last year amid German resistance. Mrs Merkel has been hugely resistant to moves that would result in her having to persuade German taxpayers that their money should be used to prop up troubled members of the eurozone. And German officials insisted no decisions had been reached on whether to use the eurozone bailout cash to buy up government debts. The latest move, which G20 officials suggested could be announced within days, will be seen as the first step towards sharing the burden of stricken countries’ debts across the single currency’s 17 members. Centre stage: U.S. President Barack Obama (centre), German chancellor Angela Merkel (right) and Australian prime minister Julia Gillard (left) during the G20 Summit in Los Cabos . However, it falls short of the ‘eurobonds’ – collective eurozone debts – first proposed by European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso. Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for the EU's eurozone commissioner Olli Rehn, said it would likely only work for 'a certain time' and would not resolve root tensions. He said: 'It would be financial paracetamol. It could soothe tension, pain and malaise, but it does not heal the root causes, the structural problems of the economies of Italy, Spain and others. 'It is not a substitute for structural and economic reforms that can boost confidence.' The G20 summit communique, agreed last night, promised ‘important steps towards greater fiscal and economic integration that lead to sustainable borrowing costs’. In another development, the US and the EU were expected to agree to negotiate a free trade deal by 2014. Officials said the move would be worth huge amounts to economies on both sides of the Atlantic. U.S. President Barack Obama voiced confidence in Europe's ability to 'break the fever' of its raging debt crisis as he sought to calm both global financial markets and the election-year worries of voters at home. Obama, speaking at the close of the Group of 20 economic summit, said Europe's leaders showed a 'heightened sense of urgency' during two days of talks. The president maintained Europe had the capacity to solve the crisis on its own, indicating the U.S., still battling its own economic woes, would not be offering any financial pledges to help its international partners. He said: 'Even if they cannot achieve all of it in one fell swoop, I think if people have a sense of where they are going that can provide confidence and break the fever.' Obama waded deep into the summit discussions on Europe's debt crisis, which could have repercussions both for a U.S. economy still struggling to recover from a recession and Obama's own re-election prospects. He acknowledged that 'all of this affects the United States' but that his administration does not have control over how quickly the Europeans fix the problems. He said: 'All of these issues, economic issues, will potentially have some impact on the election.' Mindful of his audience of voters in the U.S., Obama added: 'The best thing the United States can do is to create jobs and growth in the short term even as we continue to put our fiscal house in order over the long term.'","Angela Merkel 'poised' to announce two eurozone funds worth €750bn .

A 'Dad's Army' scheme which will see residents gathering information for police investigations has been criticised due to the risks involved. Essex police are asking volunteers to take part in Operation Homeguard, where 'back-up bobbies' will share information and be asked to help officers notify residents after break-ins in Colchester. It is the first scheme of its kind in the country and police chiefs have hailed it as a way of getting more information from people who might otherwise be reluctant to speak to officers. However, the plans from the force - which has to cut £42million from its budget by 2015 - have been called into question. Essex Police are asking volunteers to take part . in Operation Homeguard, where citizen police in Colchester will be asked to gather information after break-ins (file picture, left). The Dad's . Army (scene from sitcom, right) scheme will also see the back-up bobbies help spread crime prevention messages . Concerns have been raised that volunteers could put themselves in dangerous situations, with nobody there to help them. Resident Charlotte Salmon, 36, said: 'It is policing on the cheap - something that the officers would have done themselves previously. 'Who is going to give the members of the public the protection or back-up? 'You can call 999 but I would be worried. Surely there are other ways to cut spending and still have the police available to do their work rather than asking the public to step in?' And Martin Goss, the town's Neighbourhood Watch Co-ordinator Of The Year, also questioned the motivation behind Operation Homeguard. He said: 'It all sounds great in principle but isn't it just policing on the cheap to make up for all the cuts? 'I don't see who they will get because the people who come forward will be those already involved in the community.' Chief Inspector Richard Phillibrown (above), the man who came up with the plan, said he believes officers are currently only getting about 25 per cent of information about crimes . Chief Inspector Richard Phillibrown, the man who came up with the plan, said: 'Operation Homeguard aims to raise public awareness . of crime by providing an opportunity for people in the community to . work with the police to help spread crime prevention messages and get a . greater understanding of police work. 'There . is no question of any member of the public being asked to carry out any . police enquiries or act in any front-line policing capacity. 'This . is not about replacing police with members of the public - it is about . engaging with the community to help develop intelligence about what . crime is occurring and who is doing it. 'At . the moment, we believe we receive about 25 per cent of the information . held by members of the public in relation to crime in their communities. 'The . aim of this initiative is to increase that percentage significantly. It . involves Essex Police in partnership with the Safer Colchester . Partnership and Colchester Volunteer Services and we are still looking . at the finer details of how this will work in practice.' Police are currently checking issues for their volunteers such as insurance in case they are hurt while taking part in the operation. Tim Young, the Colchester borough councillor in charge of community safety, said he was in favour of getting the public to be back-up bobbies. He said: 'I have had an initial meeting with Mr Phillibrown and support the idea of getting the public to assist. 'Any way that we can work together to combat crime and anti-social behaviour should be welcomed.' The volunteer scheme is set to focus on burglaries in neighbourhoods across Colchester after 400 were committed in just four months leading up to January 2013. This is not the first unique initiative launched by Essex police. During . Operation Leopard in 2007, anti-social behaviour offenders were . followed and filmed by police around the district of Vange.

British holidaymakers were last night warned to expect less cash in their pockets when they head abroad as the value of the pound tumbles. Sterling fell to a 16-month low against the euro and a nine-month low against the US dollar yesterday. Today, the pound at 12pm was at $1.525 compared to $1.530 at the previous close, and the euro was at £0.865 compared to £0.873 at the previous close. The pound has fallen 5.5 per cent this year against a basket of world currencies – the second worst performance among the world’s major economies behind the Japanese yen. Tough journey: The GBP drop against the euro and the US dollar is going to hit British travellers hard with holidays becoming more expensive . Going down: This 18-month graph shows how sterling fell to a 16-month low against the euro yesterday . The slump has pushed up the cost of . travelling abroad for Britons, with everything from hotel rooms in New . York to ski passes in the Alps far more expensive. Analysts warned that the slump was likely to continue in the coming months as Britain teeters on the brink of a triple-dip recession and the national debt spirals higher. ‘The market has sterling in its cross hairs,’ said Gavin Friend, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank in London. Lee McDarby, an expert at banking group Investec, said: ‘2013 just goes from bad to worse for the pound.’ The pound fell to as low as 1.14 euros against the single currency and to below $1.53 against the dollar on the foreign exchange markets. Sterling was trading above 1.23 euros early this year and at close to 1.29 euros in July last year – meaning it has fallen 11 per cent in just seven months.

This is one of the UK’s first dedicated weight loss wards, where last year four surgeons performed more than 600 operations to try and help clinically obese patients. Based at the Sunderland Royal Hospital, the ward is at the heart of one of the fattest places in the country, where more than 40 per cent of adults are overweight. Scroll down for video . One patient on the Weight Loss Ward is 29-year-old Terry Gardner. At 47 stone, he was too big to wash himself at home or even fit through his bathroom door . It's a case of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Patients who come to the ward are generally treated with extreme surgery, such as gastric bands, sleeves and . balloons to reduce stomach size. And with . obesity and its related illnesses expected to cost the NHS £50 billion . each year by 2050, it's thought many more units will open across the country going forward. Sunderland's ward has been captured in the new ITV1 documentary Weight Loss Ward, which follows the stories of patients seeking surgery at the hospital and explores possible reasons behind their weight gain, the reality of gastric surgery and what it means for them – plus the challenges faced by the staff who work there. Terry is one of the largest patients the unit has ever treated. And too heavy for a reinforced ward bed, the hospital has been forced to hire another one at £150 a day . In . the programme, consultant surgeon Peter Small is brutally honest about . why the patients are there. ‘There is no medical problem that is causing . people to be obese,’ he says. ‘The . vast majority of people are obese because their calorie intake over . time has not matched their calorie burn. The usual patient we get has . been trying all the diets under the sun and all the medicines under the . sun and they’ve failed. And they’re just crying for their life back.’ One such person is Terry Gardner. He is so fat that he can’t fit through his own bathroom door – and he’s too big for even a reinforced hospital bed. The 29-year-old weighs a whopping 47 stone – only ascertained by using industrial strength scales. Housebound for over a year and with his life at serious risk, during the show the father-of-two is admitted for an indefinite stay to be put on a . controlled diet, with a view to surgery if he can lose some initial . weight. When he married 10 years ago, Terry had a . slimmer figure. Right: Everything on the Weight Loss Ward is big - from . double-sized doors to reinforced wheelchairs . At 47 stone, he is one of the biggest patients the unit has ever treated. And too heavy for even a reinforced bed, the hospital has been forced to hire another one for him at a cost of £150 a day. He said: ‘At the moment I feel like my weight’s just eating my life. If I don’t do anything now I just feel like I’m not going to be here.’ During the programme consultant surgeon Peter Small explains:  ‘We’re bringing him in to get him to confront his addictive behaviour. He’s almost pathologically obese, but why?’ And with no sign of any significant weight loss within the first few days, the staff suspect that Terry is buying crisps and fizzy drinks from the hospital trolley. With Terry’s stay in the Weight Loss Ward costing the NHS £250 a day, they are forced to confront him about his commitment. Deborah Adams (left) was 26 stone and wheelchair-bound until she went to the ward. After a gastric sleeve procedure she can walk again . Until she went to the ward, 47-year-old Debra Adams, weighed 26 stone. Wheelchair-bound and suffering from raised cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes, her husband Colin had become her carer. During the course of the documentary she shed four stone to prove her commitment to making permanent changes to her diet. After undergoing gastric sleeve surgery, which reduced her stomach by 7/8ths, her Debra’s diabetes improved rapidly and she is now able to walk unaided with just a walking stick. She said: ‘It’s unbelievable. I just never, ever thought I would get down to this weight again.’ Dr Small adds:  ‘If we get the right people, 98 per cent who go for surgery will succeed.’ With the high cost of medication for obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes, asthma, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. 'Gastric surgery costs about £8,000…If we get them (the patients) off the medicines, we recover the cost of the operation in less than two years.' ‘Weight Loss Ward is on ITV1 on Wednesday at 8pm.","Based at the Sunderland Royal Hospital, the ward .

The U.S. winners will each have to pay 1,500 dollars (£995) if they want a test version of the product, called Google Glass and hailed as the latest in 'wearable computing.' They will also have to travel to New York, Los Angeles or the San Francisco Bay area to pick up the device, which is not expected to be available on the mass market until late this year or early next year. The excitement stems from the belief that Google Glass is at the forefront of a new wave of technology known as 'wearable computing'. Google, Apple and several other companies are also working on internet-connected watches, according to reports citing people familiar with the projects.

Google Glass is supposed to perform . many of the same tasks as smartphones, except the glasses respond to . voice commands instead of fingers touching a display screen. The glasses are equipped with a hidden camera and tiny display screen attached to a rim above the right eye. The engineers who have been building Google Glass tout the technology as a way to keep people connected to their email, online social networks and other crucial information without having to frequently gaze down at the small screen on a smartphone. The hidden camera is designed to make it easy for people to take hands-free photos or video of whatever they are doing. Privacy watchdogs, though, are already worried that Google Glass will make it even more difficult for people to know when they are on camera. One contest winner promised to take Google Glass to Veteran Administration hospitals so soldiers who fought in the Second World War can see their memorials before they die. Another plans to wear Google Glass during a trip to Japan so she can take video and pictures that she can share with her grandmother, who lives in the US but would like to see her native country again. A zookeeper wants to use Google Glass to show what it is like to feed penguins and another contest winner plans to use the technology to provide maps that will help firefighters in emergencies. Google said the test, or 'Explorer' version of Glass, will help its engineers get a better understanding of how the technology might be used and make any necessary adjustments before the device hits the mass market. The company sold an unspecified number of Explorer models to computer programmers last year.

Wayne Middleton was today cleared of benefit fraud after claiming £22,500 in incapacity allowance, while working as a salsa teacher. Pictured today at North Somerset Magistrates' court . A magistrate was today cleared of benefit fraud after claiming £22,500 in incapacity allowance while working as a salsa teacher. Wayne Middleton, 48, took up salsa dancing as a hobby seven years ago and continued to teach despite being 'unable to walk without being in severe pain'. He was also filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking and grass skiing when he appeared on Channel 4’s Coach Trip. Mr Middleton trained as a salsa teacher in 2008 and taught at least two 45-minute classes each week. But the former zoo volunteer was found not guilty of fraudulently signing paperwork declaring he was incapable of working. District Judge Lorraine Morgan said she believed his role as a dance instructor was 'passive not active' and that his TV appearance took 'exceptional effort'. She added that his work at a salsa club mainly involved aspects of organisation and administration. The judge also said she could 'not attach any importance' to the fact that he was fit enough to work as a magistrate while claiming to be unfit to do paid work. Sitting at North Somerset Magistrates Court in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, District Judge Morgan said: 'At first glance, the activities seem to be at variation with the money awarded to him and on the face of it wholly inconsistent. 'But I accept his participation in . those activities needed careful planning and preparation and came at a . price of increased pain and greater restriction on his mobility in the . days that followed.' Mr Middleton, from Stanton Drew, near Bristol, first received benefits in 1999 after he twice appealed a decision to reject him.

Magistrate Wayne Middleton was shown downhill grass skiing during his appearance on Channel 4's Coach Trip in 2011. However, District Judge Morgan said she believed his ability to take part in the activities needed careful planning and had not been without consequences . He re-filed his application in 2003 and was listed as receiving the benefits indefinitely unless he informed officials that his circumstances had changed. Mr Middleton claimed he was entitled to the cash because he suffered with fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over his body. He was accused of fraudulently claiming at least £22,500 in disability living allowance and incapacity benefits from 2005 onwards. Prosecutors claimed he failed to declare a change in his circumstances which left him fit enough to work. During the trial, Mr Middleton . insisted he did not want to 'sit around and do nothing' and that his . doctor recommended he take up salsa dancing. He told the court: 'I have nothing to hide whatsoever. My condition is very real. Wayne Middleton appeared on a salsa class flyer . (circled in red). In relation to his salsa dancing, . District Judge Morgan said: 'I have found the defendant's role at Salsa . Bristol is more of an involvement in the organisation and administration . of the club than that of a leading dancer or instructor' 'I knew I would never be able to be a dancer so I decided to learn to teach. It gave me a lot of friends, it makes you feel like you are alive and have something to do. 'I have to do something with my life - you just can’t sit and do nothing. 'You don’t know what it is like to live in pain your whole life, my pain is never going to go away. It doesn’t matter what I do - you either do these things or you don’t. 'You have to live with it.' In 2008, he helped set up Salsa Bristol, a dance company to teach others after training as an instructor. The court heard that Mr Middleton also undertook a volunteer role at Bristol Zoo to help feed birds one day a week in 2005 but it soon became apparent it was 'beyond his physical capabilities'. But despite the role, Mr Middleton said his condition left him in so much pain that he could not stand to cook a meal. He . said: 'I don’t eat in the mornings, I don’t want to get out of bed. Many times my first meal is at around five or six when friends come to . visit me. 'Other than that, I just stay in bed, it is too painful to move. I just lie there, take my medication and that’s it.' During Coach Trip, Mr Middleton was filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking, salsa dancing and tumbling head over heels while grass skiing (pictured above).

In 2009, Middleton successfully applied for the position of magistrate at Bristol Magistrates' Court, overseeing and determining the outcome in hundreds of cases. He told the court: 'My condition hadn’t improved from 1999 and 2003 but it allowed me to fulfil my responsibility as a magistrate. 'Sitting as a magistrate was fantastic, it was one of the proudest achievements of my life.' In 2011, Middleton signed up for Channel 4 show Coach Trip, which required participants to undergo strenuous activities. He was filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking, salsa dancing and tumbling head over heels while grass skiing on the trip to Poland and Slovakia. The Department of Work and Pensions began investigating his circumstances after receiving an anonymous tip-off. Divorcee Mr Middleton, who takes 39 . tablets for his condition, told the court: 'I had reservations to taking . part, they knew my condition. 'I didn’t say no to some things, especially the grass skiing, because I really wanted to do it.' District . Judge Morgan agreed with his version of events and said she was not . fully convinced that his active lifestyle had amounted to a 'permanent . and long-lasting change in his condition'. She . added that she believed his ability to take part in the activities . needed careful planning and had not been without consequences. Mr Middleton told the court: 'I have to do something with my life, you can't just sit and do nothing' 'I’m satisfied the defendant was aware of the legal responsibilities of reporting changes in his condition,' she said. 'Using evidence given to me on the limitations of the defendant's mobility, which his friends witnessed on an almost daily basis, I am drawn to the conclusion that the defendant was able, on the programme Coach Trip, to make a very limited and exceptional effort to participate. 'That is what is shown in the edited programme that was broadcast. 'I’m not satisfied that I’m sure that the broadcasting activities are a representation of his general daily level of his mobility. 'What was broadcast on Channel 4’s Coach Trip was three minutes' total of footage showing the participation in the activities. 'Participants were filmed for 12 hours a day and what was broadcast was highly edited and was selected to make good television. 'The audience do not see the defendant being persuaded to take part and the consequences of his actions. 'I’m not satisfied so I’m sure that the prosecution have satisfied me that those permanent and long-standing changes to his condition have taken place.' In relation to his salsa dancing, District Judge Morgan said: 'I have found the defendant's role at Salsa Bristol is more of an involvement in the organisation and administration of the club than that of a leading dancer or instructor. 'His technique to teach is passive not active.' Dismissing his ability to work as a magistrate, she added: 'The magistracy prides itself on being open to anyone of any ability so I do not find that this is a point the court can attach any importance to.' She said there was no evidence to prove that Mr Middleton had been earning a wage from Salsa Bristol and breached the conditions he was under to gain incapacity allowance. Mr Middleton was found not guilty of two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain payment between 2005 and 2011.

He stole £40,000 from his mother which was supposed to pay for her residential care at a home in Manchester . An elderly mother was left on the brink of eviction from her care home after her son plundered her fees so he could go on a £50,000 spending spree. Simon Shonn, 49, had been put in sole charge of 75-year widow Irene Shonn's finances after she was forced to go into a private residential home due to her Alzheimer's. But instead of using his mother's savings to pay her weekly £665 living costs, the father-of-one used the money to buy a range of household luxuries for himself. Despite money being tight, he . splashed out on expensive electrical goods including TVs, computers and . music, home improvements, new shoes and meals out at restaurant. Shonn, of Radcliffe, Bury, was also said to have spent a 'significant amount' of money buying CDs at ailing music store HMV. The outstanding bill for Mrs Shonn's . care home fees rose to £29,000 and at one stage she faced eviction under . debt recovery legal action before the local authority stepped in and . settled the amount at cost to the taxpayer. Mrs Shonn, whose company director . husband Alan died 10 years earlier aged 70, is still thought to be living . at the Heathlands Residential Care Home in Prestwich, Manchester, . looking forward to her son's visits - blissfully unaware of his . betrayal. Bank records initially indicated he had pocketed £58,000 of her money. At Bolton Crown Court, Shonn admitted fraud but was spared jail after a . judge ruled he should continue visiting her. The hearing was told Shonn became . power of attorney to his mother's financial affairs in 2010 when her . health severely deteriorated to a point where she was forced to moved . out of her flat in Prestwich. Shonn - one of three brothers - had . been in receipt of Carer's Allowance for being the sole carer of his . mother but it was withdrawn when she was transferred to the care home - . and her placement was funded with her savings. Mr . Adam Lodge prosecuting said: 'The defendant having power of attorney . was responsible for her affairs and he was responsible for paying for . the care home. 'The cost was . £665 per week plus incidental costs. For the first six months no . invoice was signed on behalf of her due to non-payment. 'A . great deal of money was spent for the benefit of himself his family and . some was used for day to day living like food with a great deal spent . on luxurious items like electrical goods, TVs, computers, music, CDs and . a significant amount was spent at HMV. 'There were home improvements carried out, shoes bought and meals out. It was dishonest. 'The . care home were going to evict her from the private care home and they . were perusing debt recovery proceedings. fortunately it never got to . that stage and the local authority stepped in. 'There . was a certain amount of correspondence between the defendant and the . care home and he agreed to pay the arrears and even allowed them to take . out a charge on her property.' Shonn, pictured with an unknown woman leaving court, became power of attorney to his mother's financial affairs in 2010 . when her health severely deteriorated to a point where she was forced . to moved out of her flat . Shonn, of Radcliffe, Bury, was arrested in June 2012 and accepted that he as not acting in the best financial interests of his mother . Heathlands Village residential home in Prestwich, where Mrs Shonn racked up the bills . The court heard that some payment was made towards the arrears but by May 2012 the figure stood at £29k. Mr Lodge added: 'By this stage the local authority had been informed of the care he's concerns and it was passed onto the police and the Office of Public Guardian.' In June 2012 Shonn was arrested and accepted that he as not acting in the best financial interests of his mother. In mitigation the court heard Shonn had single handedly been given the responsibility of the care of his mother and was the only family member who visited her. Defence lawyer Martin Callery said Shonn had 'succumbed to temptation' and added: 'There came a time when she had to be taken into a home. 'Some of the care he was responsible for was relieved from him but he maintained a constant relationship with his mother who he visited three times a week and while she was living at her own home on a daily basis and more than once during the course of the day. 'Your actions meant that it was not the care home which lost money but the state.' Judge Peter Davies . 'There was a time when she offered him money to put railings around his house and there were times when he took advantage of the situation he found himself in, taking between £44,000 and £54,000 over a period of two and a half years.' The court heard that Shonn had little or no assets and was unemployed and on receipt of benefits. There was said to be a time when his father was alive that there had been a certain 'fluidity' of monies and Shonn when living in Israel had given his father a significant amount of money, around £10,000. Mr Callery added: 'There was a relaxed attitude to money but he clearly took advantage of that relaxed attitude and he assumed ownership of it. 'His attitude would have been 'well my mother would have not minded' and if she was lucid and able to say properly 'you can have this', she probably would have done but that is not the point he was vested with looking after the money. He is from a devout Jewish family and he is thoroughly ashamed.' Shonn was ordered to complete 300 hours unpaid work within 12 months and abide by a curfew for a period of six months between 8pm and 7am. He was also given a 21 month jail sentence suspended for two years. Judge Peter Davies told him: 'You were in a high degree of trust, you were your mothers power of attorney. 'Yet you stolen for your own benefit and that of your family. Money was spent of luxurious items, items of electrical significance, home improvement, clothing and meals. 'That money was used to supplement your lifestyle when money was tight. This was a grave offence, however you are the only family member who cares for your mother and that is to your credit. 'You continue to look after your mother as she endures this dreadful condition. Your actions meant that it was not the care home which lost money but the state. 'I have to think what is the public benefit, you are unlikely to commit further offences, you are not a danger. 'Your mother may not know what was going on and looks forward to your visits and I would not wish to deprive her of that.'","Simon Shonn was put in charge of 75-year-old Irene Shonn's finances .

"By . Jack Doyle and Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 11:29 EST, 17 February 2012 . Theresa May will visit . Jordan in a bid to secure radical cleric Abu Qatada's extradition to the country, it was announced today. Qatada has been released from jail under . strict bail conditions while the Government seeks assurances that . evidence gained through torture would not be used in any trial against . him. But times is ticking because the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks. Shock: Abu Qatada's (pictured earlier this week) landlord has told of his shock after discovering the radical cleric is living in his house with his family and has been in touch with the lettings agent to have him removed . The Home Secretary said today: 'The UK and Jordan remain committed to . ensuring that Abu Qatada must face justice and are pursuing all options . with regard to his deportation and it is my intention to travel back to . continue those negotiations shortly.' Meanwhile the landlord of the house . where hate preacher Abu Qatada is living following his release from . prison has revealed he had no idea he was even there. The landlord said he wants the radical cleric out . and has already been in contact with letting agents who rented the . property out on his behalf. He said he had let the . house in Wembley, north-west London out to a woman and her four children . who had a different name to Qatada. But the 51-year-old cleric moved in with his wife and children to the £400,000 property after being freed from maximum security Long Lartin on Monday night. His release as the result of a European human rights ruling caused outrage after it emerged 60 police will keep tabs on him, costing taxpayers £10,000 a week . But the 51-year-old cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, could be freed from his bail terms in just three months if Mrs May fails to show significant progress is being made in the talks. Speaking after he heard the news the landlord, who cannot be identified, said he rented the property out on January 9 to a woman and four children whose name is different to Qatada. She signed a year's contract with a six month break clause. He said: 'If he is living there I want him out. I’ve been on the phone to the agents all day. They didn’t even tell me. 'I don’t want someone like that living there. It’s not good for me. I would never rent my property to someone like Qatada. 'This is not something I stand for, it is humiliating. I cannot believe it. I want Abu Qatada and his family out of my house.' Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet . The landlord added: 'I am shocked. I knew nothing about this.' He said he was called by a lettings agency in January saying the woman wanted to rent the property on a year's contract. The tenancy agreement was drawn up and he was told the woman did not have a husband. He said the woman claims benefits and is paying him £1,900 a month. It comes as yesterday a senior European human rights official has admitted Britain would face no real punishment if Qatada was put on a plane tomorrow. Thomas Hammarberg said ‘there isn’t really a sanction’ were the government to ignore the European Court of Human Rights and deport the radical preacher. The comments will heap pressure on Home Office ministers to ignore the court’s ruling and send Qatada back to Jordan. The radical cleric, described by a British court as a ‘truly dangerous individual’ was released on bail this week as a result of the Strasbourg ruling. Tory backbenchers have challenged Home Secretary Theresa May to follow the example of countries such as Italy and France who have ignored court rulings to deport dangerous foreign nationals. Yesterday, in a further blow to hopes of deporting Qatada, a senior member of the Jordanian royal family appeared to pour scorn on the idea it would give in to Strasbourg’s demands. Speaking to the BBC, Prince El Hassan of Jordan, uncle of King Abdullah, said: ‘If this man has committed crimes which is presumably why he is being held in England, I don’t know what kind of court one has to offer to the Europeans. Does it want a juvenile court?’ No sanctions: Thomas Hammarberg, a senior official, said kicking Abu Qatada out would 'set a negative example' He added: ‘This is essentially a British European conversation and I don’t think democracy means that we have to appeal to every single European parliamentarian.’ Mr Hammarberg is commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, the court’s governing body. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper he accused ministers of not even reading the court’s judgement in the case. Asked what the repercussions would be if Britain ignored the court’s ruling, he said: ‘Someone may file a complaint and there would be a judgment that there’s a violation of human rights, but it’s more the bad example. ‘It would send a signal that the UK, which currently holds the chair in the Council of Europe, is ignoring [judgments] and that would be such a bad signal. There would be a chain effect.’ ‘It would set a negative example that would be used by other countries in Europe which are less keen on human rights. It would be extremely unfortunate to ignore the ruling. It’s a serious ruling and a serious matter.’ He added: ‘I have read the discussions in the UK and know that [Abu Qatada] is seen as a dangerous person. So I understand the heat but I’m not impressed by the arguments.’ ‘The key point in the [ECHR] judgment in Strasbourg is torture, but it seems that the arguments have become about whether Britain should co-operate with European institutions. ‘It seems the ministers had not even read the judgments. They mixed up the EU and the Council of Europe. It was about torture, not whether to co-operate with European institutions. Mr Hammarberg’s intervention is likely to inflame tensions between London and the council, at a time when ministers are trying to agree reforms to how the court works. Qatada was released from high security Long Lartin prison on Monday night and placed on a strict 22-hour curfew. He must stay at his home in Wembley, north London and cannot use a mobile phone or the internet. The ECHR judges said Qatada could not be sent back because he would not get a fair trial in Jordan - because evidence could be used against him which resulted from torture. Home Office minister James Brokenshire travelled to Jordan earlier this week to attempt to broker a deal which would satisfy the ECHR. Mrs May said: 'The Home Office . Minister for Crime and Security, James Brokenshire MP, has led useful . discussions with the Jordanian authorities and talks with officials will . continue.' Mr Hammarberg said the court would need ‘watertight guarantees’ that evidence obtained from torture would not be used against Qatada at trial. His comments sparked fury in Westminster last night. Tory MP for Esher and Walton Dominic Raab said: ‘If Mr Hammarberg thinks Britain should go back cap in hand to the Strasbourg Court after this ludicrous judgment, he’s got another thing coming. In fact, since he is neither a judge nor an elected politician, he is pretty irrelevant to this debate.’","Home Secretary Theresa May to fly to Jordan in bid to deport Qatada .

"By . Tim Shipman and Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 17:49 EST, 19 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:11 EST, 20 August 2012 . Downing Street insisted today that honours will be given to  gold medal-winning Olympic athletes on merit rather than 'according to quotas'. With 43 athletes scooping gold at the Games and more expected in the Paralympics, there has been speculation some could miss out in the New Year Honours List. The most senior civil servant at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport cautioned at the weekend there would be no 'automatic gong' for winning gold in the London Games. Campaign: Supporters, politicians, and fellow sportsmen alike called for Bradley Wiggins to be honoured following his gold medal performance at London 2012 . Jonathan Stephens said the sports honours committee - which makes recommendations for awards - would be looking to recognise those who 'put something back' and showed a 'sustained effort' as well as succeeding in their chosen event. No 10 today denied reports that new rules drawn up by the head of the Civil Service Sir Bob Kerslake - who chairs the main honours committee - meant there was a limit to the number of honours which could go to Team GB. 'Honours are awarded on merit, not according to quotas,' said the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said. His comments appeared at odds with those of sports honours committee member Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, however, who said they were restricted in the number of awards they could make. In a normal year, the former Paralympic gold medallist said, the committee would be restricted to one or two knighthoods, 'a few more' CBEs and between 45 to 50 MBEs - the lowest tier in the honours system. She said there might be 'a little room for manoeuvre' in the light of Team GB’s success, but that they were trying to 'manage expectation' ahead of the publication of the Honours List at the end of the year. National hero: DOuble Olympic gold medal-winner Mo Farah has had his chances of a knighthood rocked by recent revelations about honours rules . 'We do have a limit on the numbers that we can award each year. I think that is where we are trying to manage expectation,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'The sports honours committee can’t just give out 20 knighthoods or 20 dames. We have a number each year that we allocate. 'Although there might be a little room for manoeuvre with the success of this year’s Olympics and hopefully Paralympics, we are trying to manage expectation a little bit.' Golden girl: Heptathlete Jessica Ennis became a national favourite after her Olympic performance . She said that gold medallists - who in the past might have expected an MBE as a matter of course - would have to be considered alongside those who had contributed through years of volunteering. 'We’d love to give out honours to absolutely everyone but I think the key is in the title - it’s an honour, it’s not an automatic reward,' she said. 'We are trying to balance achievement in sport against somebody who has maybe volunteered for a number of years.' Officials were fighting a frantic damage-limitation exercise last night after Mr Stephen's  comments amid fears some of Team GB's champions will be snubbed. Double gold medallist Mo Farah's chances of a knighthood were rocked by claims that Whitehall officials on the Honours Committee have imposed a quota of just one sporting knighthood a year. Last night the man who masterminded Team GB's record-breaking success urged them to junk the rules and give every gold medallist a gong. Lord Moynihan, who has just quit as head of the British Olympic Association (BOA), told the Mail: 'Every single gold medallist has achieved both objectives. They have shown a lifetime of commitment and inspired a generation. They all deserve recognition.' The sport honours committee is led by Lord Coe, architect of London 2012. but his hands are tied by rules drawn up by Sir Bob Kerslake. They must now 'take account how the candidate has used their profile for the benefit of the wider community and/or development of sport'. That could lead to 'a silver medallist who has competed at the highest level over a long period getting an award, when an 18-year-old winning gold at their first competition might not'. Contenders: Victoria Pendleton and Ben Ainslie, both gold medallists at the Games, are among those who could be honoured . Repeated success may also not lead to an upgrade of a previous award. Under the plans, there is supposed to be just one sporting knight or dame, four CBEs, 20 OBEs and 38 MBEs from the world of sport. But the quotas take no account of the runaway success of the London Games, which saw 43 gold medallists in 29 events. That figure is expected to hit three figures once the Paralympic Games have finished. Yesterday Mr Stephens defended the rules, saying: 'It's the contribution over career and over a lifetime, it's how that's sustained, it's whether you put something back. 'But also all those behind the scenes: the volunteers, the organisers, the coaches, both at the elite level and at grassroots level.' He said the decisions would be taken by experts. 'It's chaired by Seb Coe, it has other Olympians and Paralympians on it like Tanni Grey-Thompson and Tessa Sanderson. I'm sure they will not in any way underplay the achievement of our athletes.' The rules put the Honours Committee on a collision course with the BOA, which is expected to nominate every gold medallist for an honour. They were rewritten this spring after . criticism of the way 35 members of the England rugby set-up were . honoured after the 2003 World Cup win and the decision to give an MBE to . every member of the England cricket team after they reclaimed the Ashes . in what is essentially a two-horse race in 2005. Earlier . this year, Sir Bob told a committee of MPs that it 'no longer seems . right' that all Olympic champions should get honours 'given the move . away from “automaticity” in other fields'. Downing Street is backing at least four sporting knighthoods – Bradley Wiggins, Ben Ainslie, Mo Farah and Dave Brailsford. Sailor . Ainslie is considered a shoo-in after becoming just the third British . athlete – after Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Matthew Pinsent – to win four . golds in as many games. Wiggins won his fourth gold this year and became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France, while Brailsford ran both Team GB's cycling team that won nine golds and Team Sky, which finished 1-2 in the Tour. He has a CBE, so the next honour has to be a knighthood. Former head of the British Olympic Association, Lord Moynihan (left) has led calls for gongs for every gold medallist, but rules drawn up by chairman of the main honours committee, Sir Bob Kerslake (right) could affect the final decision . In winning two gold medals on the track, Farah has matched the achievement of Dame Kelly Holmes in Athens. A . source close to the Honours Committee hinted that Farah would get a . gong: 'Part of this is about community engagement and Mo runs a charity. He does a lot of charity work.' Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe told the Mail: 'This is an extraordinary time. This Olympics was a unique event for the country. 'The rules should be relaxed for the London Games.' A Culture Department source said ministers would push for as many gongs as possible.","Some of Team GB's 43 champions could be snubbed in New Year's Honours .

A 99-year-old Battle of Britain veteran hit out at airport chiefs today after they banned him from a memorial ceremony for his hero brother who was killed in World War Two - because he hasn't got a passport. Charles Crowther, of Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, was desperate to attend the unveiling of the memorial at Leeds Bradford International Airport (LBIA) in West Yorkshire but was told he would not be allowed through security. Next week's service is to be held for those killed in 609 (West Riding) Squadron during the war, which includes Charles's brother William, whose Wellington Bomber was shot down by a German plane in 1942. Charles Crowther, 99, cannot go to a WWII memorial ceremony in the departure lounge of Leeds Bradford International Airport (LBIA) to honour his hero brother William (black and white photo) because he hasn't got a passport or driving licence . Ground crew serviceman Charles Crowther (seen left in 1941) and flight engineer William (right, also in 1941) both served in 609 (West Riding) squadron . Speaking from his home Mr Crowther, who served in the same squadron, admitted he was devastated that the airport couldn't make an exception for him and let him attend the service. The former ground crew serviceman said: 'I can understand that there have to be safety checks but this might be the last time that I could go and commemorate my brother, so I'm upset I can't go. 'I'm 99 and so of course I'm not going to have a passport now or a driving licence. 'Unfortunately, this ceremony is taking place in a restricted part of the aerodrome - and I shan't be allowed in without these documents. William Crowther (pictured far left) in 1941 next to a Halifax bomber. He died when his Wellington Bomber was shot down by a German plane the following year . Charles (pictured eighth from right, in 1940) said he was devastated that the airport couldn't make an exception for him and let him attend the service . 'It feels awful that I can't attend a service to my own brother.' William, a flight engineer, died aged 30 when his Wellington Bomber was shot down on the way back from an air raid in Essen, Germany.

Right, William Crowther's commemorative scroll . The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940. It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain. The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the . English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences. From August 12, Hermann . Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the . destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. (Pictured above, RAF scrambling to their planes in 1940.) Convinced that Fighter Command was . now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter . planes to break British strength. But Goering grew frustrated by . the number of British planes still fighting off his . attacks. Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on . Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities. Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the . RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above . London and the south coast. Peter, of Fettercairn, Aberdeenshire, said: 'I don't know what to do about it. 'I just couldn't understand why a 99-year-old man would be treated this way. 'We've got plenty of proof about his identity, just not the two documents that are required and it seems mad that an exception couldn't have been made. 'The chairman of the 609 Squadron Association actually said I could get a passport for my father as they can be issued for free to anyone born before 1928. 'But when I said that he had lost his previous one, which he hadn't seen for 40 years, I was told that would take about six or seven weeks to sort out the paperwork which was far too long a process. 'It's just a bit of nonsense I think.' A spokeswoman for LBIA said that two ceremonies were taking place, but the first would be in the departure lounge which would require passport or driving licence identification for visitors to attend. She said: 'There are two plaques being unveiled at the airport on April 17 both commemorating the 609 (West Riding) Squadron. 'At 10am, a ceremony to reintroduce the restored plaque over a prayer of dedication in its new location will be held for original contributors and their immediate family. 'This is to take place airside within the departure lounge. 'A visitor pass needs to be issued for all attendees visiting the restricted areas and there are strict guidelines that the airport must comply with governing the issue of visitor passes - one element is an official form of identification. 'Both LBIA and the 609 Squadron Association have tried to assist the family in obtaining the required documents. 'At 11am on the same day, a second plaque will also be unveiled in the airport's main entrance landside. 'This brand new plaque not only commemorates the original 609 Squadron but also the squadron which re-formed in 1999 and still serves today. 'The family are very welcome to attend this event and have previously been encouraged to do so.'

Australian rock star Chrissy Amphlett, singer in the band Divinyls who found fame in 1991 with their hit I Touch Myself, has died aged 53 after a long battle with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis. Her husband and former Divinyls drummer Charley Drayton said Amphlett, who also acted, died in her sleep, in their adopted home of New York, surrounded by close friends and family. 'Chrissy's light burns so very brightly,' Drayton said in a statement posted on the Australian Recording Industry Association's (ARIA) website. 'Hers was a life of passion and creativity; she always lived it to the fullest. With her force of character and vocal strength she paved the way for strong, sexy, outspoken women.' Russell Crowe, with whom Amphlett acted in the 1988 Australian production of the musical Blood Brothers, wrote on Twitter: 'Dear . Chrissie, the last time I saw you was in the Botanic Gardens, loving . life and reciting verse. That's how I'll remember you, your boy, R.' Last month Amphlett was named one of Australia's top 10 singers of all time. Her cousin Patricia Thompson said: 'Our beloved Chrissy peacefully made her transition this morning. 'Christine Joy Amphlett succumbed to the effects of breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, diseases she vigorously fought with exceptional bravery and dignity. 'She passed gently, in her sleep, surrounded by close friends and family, including husband of fourteen years, musician Charley Drayton, her sister Leigh, nephew Matt, and cousin Patricia Thompson (""Little Pattie"").' Amphlett founded Divinyls with guitarist Mark McEntee in 1980 in Sydney, and quickly became the quintessential 'Aussie rock chick', famed for her aggressive, brash, pouting style, as well as her trademark school uniform and fishnet stocking costumes.

We may be harvesting a formidable crop of Olympic medals - but when it comes to celebrating, man mountain Robert Harting can teach us a thing or two about style. Unlike many of our athletes,the 6ft 7in discus champion didn't bother shedding a tear when he took gold with a mammoth throw. Instead, he tore his shirt off Incredible Hulk style, flexed his muscles with a mighty roar and grabbed a German flag from the Olympic stadium. Then he tried his luck at another gold medal, this time in the women's hurdles. The track had already been set up for the women's 100 metre final but Harting wasn't going to let the hurdles become barriers to his victory lap. Scroll down for video . You wouldn't like him when he's angry: Robert Harting joyfully rips his shirt off Incredible Hulk-style after claiming gold last night in the discus . Celebration time: Harting was not shy in displaying his happiness at being crowned Olympic discus champion . Unleash the beast: Harting left Olympic Stadium spectators in no doubt how he felt about his latest discus win, which he clinched with a throw of 68.27m . So despite his 20 stone bulk, he jumped nearly all of them, cheered on by a delighted crowd in the 80,000 seat stadium. Next, he raced towards the Olympic cauldron, reached in, and attempted unsuccessfully to liberate one of the flaming prongs. Finished now Herr Harting? Er, not quite. After leaving the stadium he headed out with friends and team-mates for a night to remember. If only he could. His extraordinary celebration continued aboard a German cruise liner docked in London to accommodate the Teutonic team, embraced an alcohol-fuelled night on the tiles - and ended with him falling asleep on a train, being robbed, and barred entry to the Olympic village yesterday after losing his accreditation. Ripping it up: Harting has apparently made it a victory tradition to tear up his shirt after each discus win . Beat that for Olympic gold! The first fans and friends knew of his troubles came when he Tweeted in (almost) English: 'Puuh i just got robbed while I did some work to please athletic fans! I lost all my accredition [sic] for Olympic Village! - no entrance.' Shortly after dawn he managed to get a message to German team manager Siegfried Schonert but had to wait until 8am before arrangements were made to get him in. First reports said he went to bed 'dead tired' - and without realising he was no longer in possession of his kit and equipment. Don't stop me now: Harting, 27, showed impressive hurdling ability despite weighing in at 20-stone . Jumping for joy: After ripping his shirt off, Harting continued his . victory lap by vaulting the hurdles which had been placed for the . women's 100m final . Lap of honour: The big German vaulted all the 100m hurdles, to huge applause from the Olympic Stadium crowd . No stopping me: Harting went on from his impromptu hurdles vault to a drinking session on a German cruise liner, before falling asleep on a train and having his bag stolen . After waking up without his bag following his celebratory exploits, Harting took to Twitter to reveal the predicament he found himself in . Back home in the Fatherland, however, he was hailed as a hero. In his native Berlin, officials were preparing a homecoming victory parade and were singing his praises. Social Democrat mayor Klaus Wowereit described his victory as 'Phenomenal'. He added: 'He is, and remains, a symbol of Berlin sport. Berlin is proud.' Meanwhile the athlete's stadium antics took off on YouTube (and possibly on CCTV somewhere along the Docklands Light Railway). Harting, unbeaten in a straight run of 29 competitions, is known as Lord of the Ring by fans, a reference to the circle from which the discus is thrown. Harting's throw of 68.27m - the width of a football pitch - saw him crowned Olympic champion for the first time . His winning mark for the 2012 games was a formidable 68.27 metres, the width of an Olympic football pitch. The big German is unlikely to face any disciplinary measures for his exuberance, although officials did inspect the Olympic cauldron afterwards for possible damage. He was even allowed a lie-in yesterday. German medal winners are normally expected to be on public parade at 9.00am on the morning following their victory but Harting was allowed to sleep in and attend the afternoon one instead.

Cyprus faced threats of economic oblivion yesterday as hopes of a Russian rescue for the debt-riddled island were put on ice. With the country on the verge of bankruptcy, officials announced the banks would not reopen until next Tuesday while the country seeks a bailout. But Germany and the European Central Bank told the country’s government that unless an agreement was reached, ‘there’s a danger that they won’t be able to open the banks again at all’. Protesters chant slogans outside the Cypriot parliament. Cyprus faces threats of economic oblivion as hopes of a Russian rescue for the debt-riddled island were put on ice . With the country on the verge of bankruptcy, officials announced the banks would not reopen until next Tuesday while the country seeks a bailout . The government is today expected to impose exchange controls to prevent money being taken out of the country. But German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble raised the stakes with his warning that it needs to agree to a highly unpopular tax raid on bank deposits. And ECB officials threatened to pull the plug on Cyprus unless it agrees to find £4.9billion to pay its debts and win an £8.5billion  bailout from the EU. Its chief negotiator on Cyprus, Joerg Asmussen, said: ‘We can provide emergency liquidity only to solvent banks.’ German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Cyprus needs to agree to a highly unpopular tax raid on bank deposits . Mr Schaeuble added: ‘The ECB has made it clear that without a reform programme for Cyprus the aid can’t continue. Someone has to explain this to the Cypriots and I think there’s a danger that they won’t be able to open the banks again at all.’ Some 3,000 British servicemen have been told their savings will be safe but up to 60,000 other Britons on the island could be hit by the plans. The Cypriot finance minister Michalis Sarris was in Moscow yesterday begging for help in a bid to avoid the spectre of the tax raid, which was rejected by the Cypriot Parliament on Tuesday. Insiders say Russia may bail out Cyprus in exchange for the right to use military bases in Cyprus or for energy rights. ‘We will be here until some kind of agreement is reached,’ Mr Sarris said. ‘There were no offers, nothing concrete.’ Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last night turned on Europe and accused EU countries of deliberately trying to wreck the Cypriot banking system for their own benefit. Questioning the decision to close the banks in Cyprus, where Russians have stashed more than £30billion, he said: ‘It is likely that the goal was to destroy [the Cypriot banking system].’ He added: ‘It seems to me that every possible mistake that could have been made in this situation has already been made.’ Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said the ECB was not ‘a bottomless pit’ that would fund Cyprus indefinitely. Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades will chair further crisis talks with parliamentary party leaders today. One unlikely source of help did arise yesterday when the leader of the Orthodox Church in Cyprus, Archbishop Chrysostomos II, offered to put church assets at the government’s disposal. He said the church had offered to mortgage its vast property holdings to buy government bonds. The church is the largest landowner on the island and also has stakes in a wide range of businesses, including in the country’s Hellenic Bank, with total assets estimated to run into tens of millions of euros. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last night turned on Europe and accused EU countries of deliberately trying to wreck the Cypriot banking system for their own benefit . Banking officials in Cyprus said ministers are expected to draft a bill to limit the amount of money leaving the country. The ministers would also try to create a so-called ‘bad bank’, a fund in which to dump the non-performing investments of the country’s two largest banks, which lost billions on bad Greek debt.Another option under discussion is to nationalise pensions funds of semi-government corporations, which hold between two and three billion euros. In Brussels, EU chiefs came under fire for their ‘bullying’ of Cyprus. UKIP MEP Roger Helmer told EU Presidents Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy: ‘This is not a tax. This is EU theft by a fancy name. ‘I think gentlemen; the time has come to put your boots on for you are the grave-diggers of European democracy.’","Banks will not reopen until next Tuesday while the country seeks a bailout .

A sordid tale of teenage betrayal and brutality has authorities struggling to understand how the theft of over $600,000 ended with the tragic death of a 21-year-old woman and with five young men facing charges for a bizarre kidnapping with a near nude escape and the fatal shooting. An April 20 Miami Herald report tries to shed light on the strange South Florida story, starting with 19-year-old Luis Mir. After a mutual friend introduced Mir to several other young men in Miami-Dade County, Florida, police say Mir made a proposition that would eventually leave Alain Perea, 19, Roman Villacres, 19, Dexter Marshall, 27, Carlos Morillo, 26, and Joe Manuel Cotte Vazquez, 18 all awaiting trial for Mir’s own violent kidnapping and possibly the death of Perea’s girlfriend Damaris Jaramillo, 21. Star-crossed: Alain Perea (left) kidnapped and brutally beat Luis Mir after, police say, collaborating with him in a $600K heist that eventually left girlfriend Damaris Jaramillo (right) dead at the hands of police . Duped? Carlos Morillo, pictured, is one of five men who face kidnapping charges after police say they were double-crossed by Luis Mir . Mir’s uncle, it seemed, was allegedly involved in the marijuana growing business and kept a healthy sum of cash in the family home. The plan: with Mir’s explicit instructions and with him waiting in the getaway car, the other men, led by Perea, would enter Mir’s uncle’s home, push aside Mir’s grandmother and baby sister and lug out a safe full of over $600,000 in cash. ‘He told us all the little information, every detail about his uncle, his family,’ Perea told the Miami Herald. ‘Where it was located and what time to go in, who was inside the house, everything.’ In May 2012, the men allegedly succeeded in their mission. Back with Mir, they would split the mountain of cash. But that’s when things took a turn. According to Perea and the rest, Mir took far more than his fair share. And Mir would do little to dissuade Perea and even his own family of that fact. Though he told Perea that he only took his portion and denied any knowledge of the theft to his family, the unemployed Mir would suddenly start driving a 2010 Infiniti. His family was immediately suspicious and Perea, too, began to watch Mir closely. ‘I didn’t pay him no mind,’ Mir later said, though he would live to regret it. Police say that's when Perea and his friends decided to set up Mir to take him down. On August 8, Mir and his friend Xavier Valdes, 17, left a teen pool party but were lured back by a phone call from Perea’s girlfriend Damaris Jaramillo at Perea’s behest. Bad idea: Along with Morillo, Dexter Marshall, left, and Roman Villacres, right, helped Perea kidnap and brutalize Luis Mir before they fell asleep and Mir ran away naked, according to police . Young: Joe Cotte Vazquez, 18, is the youngest of the men police say helped kidnap Luis Mir, leading to the death of Damaris Jaramillo . Perea and his friends allegedly . jumped Mir and Valdes and took them back to Jaramillo’s place where they . tied them up and beat them brutally. Mir claims Perea made no mention of the stolen cash and was instead beating him mercilessly for much smaller trifles. ‘The only thing he said to me “This is because you were flirting with my girlfriend,”’ Mir said. Shortly thereafter, the kidnappers, who police say were under the influence of drugs, fell asleep. Meanwhile, Mir’s family ran to the police and Mir himself was able to escape as his kidnappers snoozed. Shortly thereafter, tragedy struck. Nearly naked and plodding through the streets of South Miami-Dade County, Mir managed to call police and inform them where he was. They reached Jaramillo’s trailer and burst inside to find her wielding a revolver. ‘The police were forced to utilize deadly force,’ reads the arrest report. Jaramillo was shot dead by officers on the scene. The rest of the men were arrested and now, under Florida law, face charges of Jaramillo’s death in addition to the kidnapping charges. They’ve all pleaded not guilty while Mir still faces charges for the May 2012 theft of his uncle's safe.","Authorities say the bizarre saga began when Miami-Dade teenager Luis Mir enlisted the help of five other young men to rob his own family of a safe full of cash .

The two brothers suspected of planting deadly bombs at the Boston marathon told a man whose car they hijacked that they planned to go to New York, it has emerged. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his younger brother Dzhokhar, 19, seized a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle and held the driver hostage as they sought to flee from police late on Thursday. They told the driver that they planned to head to New York, a senior official revealed, but it is not clear if they told the man what they intended to do there, the New York Times reported. The latest detail emerged as police confirmed the brothers likely planned more attacks, and suggests they could have wrought even greater devastation on the U.S. after being undetected by the FBI. Threat: Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told a driver they held hostage that they planned to go to New York . Next target? The men said they were going to New York, but did not reveal what they would do there . Boston police commissioner, Edward . Davis, said on Sunday that police believed they had planned more attacks beyond the bombings at . the finish line. The men were armed with a small  arsenal of guns, ammunition and explosives when they faced police on Friday morning. 'We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at . that scene - the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded . and the firepower that they had - that they were going to attack other . individuals,' Davis told Face the Nation on CBS News. Authorities said the men made at least five pipe bombs and used four firearms. Among them were two handguns and a BB gun that they are believed to have used in a shootout with police on Friday. Battle: The men were eventually stopped following gun battles with police, and authorities found a cache of weapons and bombs, revealing that the brothers intended on carrying out more attacks . Hideout: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in this boat after a massive manhunt . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following the shootout - where police believe as many as 80 rounds were fired - after being shot and then run over by his brother as he fled the scene in a vehicle. During the gunfight, the two brothers detonated a pressure cooker bomb - lending credence to the theory that the brothers were planning further terrorist strikes. They also unearthed an M-4 carbine rifle - similar to ones used by U.S. forces in Afghanistan - on the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in Watertown, Masachusetts on Friday night. Davis claims releasing photos of the two . suspects 'forced them out of their hideout' and spurred them into . Thursday and Friday's deadly night time car chaos and gun battle with . law enforcement. Close call: Authorities said that by police tracking down the men, they saved the city from further attacks . 'It forced them out of their hideout and . they decided to commit further violent acts. But it’s my belief that . they were already manufacturing explosive devices. Further violent acts . were inevitable,' Davis told The Boston Globe. The suspects 'were not making those explosives for nothing,' he added. 'There was a plan there.' Authorities are now investigating where the Tsarnaev brothers bought the weapons and explosives and whether they acted alone in the attack. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is still recovering from a gunshot wound to the neck, which is believed to have been self inflicted, and is answering questions from investigators.","The Tsarnaev brothers told driver of SUV that they hijacked on Thursday night that they were planning on going to New York .

"By . Nick Harris and Jonathan Petre . PUBLISHED: . 17:04 EST, 8 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:05 EST, 8 September 2012 . Football fans are being kept in the dark about how many top players have been disciplined for taking recreational drugs such as cocaine, marijuana and ecstasy. A Mail on Sunday investigation has discovered that since 2010 details of failed drug tests that were formerly made public by a Government-funded drugs watchdog have not been disclosed. Until then, an average of six to seven failed tests for recreational drugs were reported every year, including high-profile cases such as that of former Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu who tested positive for cocaine in 2004. Cover up: Incidents of any players failing tests for cocaine have not been reported since 2010 . The Football Association, whose chairman is David Bernstein, said there had been new, unreported cases during the past two-and-half-years, but would not give details. However, a spokesman said that following the Mail on Sunday’s investigation it would now explore ways to make the information public. The Mail on Sunday contacted all of the Premier League’s 20 clubs yesterday. Nine said they were  unaware any of their players had been caught taking drugs, eight failed to respond and Reading, Sunderland and Manchester United refused to comment. Until early 2010, UK Anti Doping (UKAD), . the agency that leads the fight against drug-taking in sport, would . routinely make public the details of every case in the UK when a . footballer failed a test, both for performance-enhancing and . recreational drugs. Garry O'Connor of Birmingham City, left, missed games because his club claimed he needed an operation, but he was suspended for cocaine use. The FA, whose chairman is David Bernstein, right, said new unreported cases of drug use had been detected in the last two-and-a-half years . Although the player and club were rarely identified, the substance involved, the date of the failed test and the length of any ban imposed would all be included in a database open to the public on UKAD’s website. Even before UKAD dropped its policy of reporting recreational drug offences, critics claimed that the lack of transparency over identifying offenders allowed clubs to deceive fans by claiming that players banned over drugs were not playing because of injury. The Channel 4 programme Dispatches revealed last year that in 2009 Birmingham City claimed its player Garry O’Connor had missed games because he needed an operation on a hip injury when in reality he had been suspended by the FA for two months after failing a drugs test for cocaine. Dispatches claimed that UKAD, which was established in 2009, and its predecessor caught a total of  43 professional footballers using cocaine, ecstasy or cannabis. Under current rules, footballers face two types of drugs tests. One is for the use of performance-enhancing substances during games, under which randomly selected players are required by UKAD to provide urine tests at full-time. Admission: The FA, based in Soho Square, pictured, says there are new drug cases . The other test is carried out on behalf of the FA specifically to unearth recreational drug use during the players’ leisure time, and often involve UKAD staff descending on clubs with little notice. While the FA is not obliged to perform tests for recreational drugs, it says the practice is part of its wider responsibility to ensure the game is clean. Players who fail tests face an FA tribunal and punishments range from fines to bans. After UKAD decided to stop reporting ‘recreational positives’ on its database, it also removed all past ‘social drugs findings’ as well. A UKAD spokesman said: ‘It was considered inappropriate for UK Anti-Doping to continue to publish this information since it related to testing undertaken outside of the UK Anti-Doping Testing Programme, so it is not “our” information or data to publish or process.’ The FA, which claimed that it did not know that UKAD had stopped revealing the drug tests until approached by The Mail on Sunday,  said it banned recreational drugs at all times because of the wider social implications.","Mail on Sunday investigation finds information about footballers' positive recreational drug tests has not been made public .

'Bonkers': Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured today before a speech to business leaders, told his team the PM would be 'bonkers' not to hire Lynton Crosby . David Cameron’s new election guru has again been cast into the spotlight after it was claimed he branded Boris Johnson’s closest aides ‘****wits’ as he guided him to a second mayoral victory. An explosive new book about Boris Johnson’s campaign alleges Lynton Crosby - brought in by the Prime Minister to rejuvenate the Conservative's election prospects - launched the foul-mouthed and withering rant during his time at City Hall. The latest damaging allegations come as Labour today demanded the Prime Minister investigate claims recently appointed Mr Crosby launched an expletive-laden verbal assault about Muslims. The timing of claims by Mr Johnson's former political director, Alex Crowley, in his book Victory in London, are likely to prove uncomfortable for Conservative hierarchy. Yesterday it emerged he once claims the Mayor should concentrate on winning support from traditional Tories, not ‘****ing Muslims’. Labour frontbencher Michael Dugher today wrote to the PM calling for Mr Crosby to make a public statement about the claims. Yesterday Mr Crosby, whose tactics helped to win four elections for former Australian prime minister John Howard, said he had absolutely no recollection of using the phrase and that any suggestion he was racist was ‘mischievous’. But in his letter to Mr Cameron, Mr Dugher says: 'Mr Crosby has been given the opportunity to deny using these words, and has refused to do so.' The Labour party vice-chairman calls on Mr Cameron to 'fully investigate the claims that Mr Crosby used such appalling language against Muslims'. If true he should 'refuse to give someone with such views a role in your Party'. ‘I hope you agree that there can be no place for racist attitudes or language such as this in any modern political party,' Mr Dugher adds. Crosby, known as the ‘Wizard of Oz’ for masterminding multiple election victories in his native Australia, has been hired to focus on winning back core Conservative voters over the next two-and-a-half years. The appointment is intended to rejuvenate the party after its crushing defeat in the Corby by-election on Friday, and record low turnout in the police and crime commissioner elections. But some in the party fear Mr Crosby, who has a reputation as a right-wing attack dog, will alienate floating voters by taking a hard line on divisive issues such as crime and immigration, which backfired when he ran the 2005 election campaign of then Tory leader Michael Howard. Victory: London Mayor Boris Johnson with his then campaign manager Lynton Crosby on the Mayoral Election results night in 2012 . Former deputy party chairman Lord . Ashcroft warned he was a ‘distracting influence’ and a recipe for . ‘conflict and confusion’ while Mr Cameron’s former speechwriter Ian . Birrell said hiring him was a ‘regressive step’. But . Mr Johnson, whose two successful London mayoral campaigns were run by . Mr Crosby, has been urging the Prime Minister to snap him up, saying he . is ‘the best campaign manager I’ve ever seen’. Election: Mr Crosby will start work for PM David Cameron early next year. Critics worry about his reputation as a 'right wing attack dog' A . Treasury source said George Osborne – Mr Cameron’s election strategist . in 2010 – had been pushing for his appointment for months. The . source said: ‘George has always argued for this. It was George who got . Lynton into the Boris campaign in the first place and we need a . dedicated campaign manager.’ Mr Crosby will start work as campaign . manager early next year, initially part time, and it is understood he . will focus on day-to-day planning, while the Prime Minister and the . Chancellor will remain in control of policy and strategy. He is said to be on a salary of £200,000. Polls over the weekend gave Labour a  12-point lead, following the Tories’ loss of Corby – a key middle England seat vacated by Louise Mensch – to Labour’s Andy Sawford on a swing of nearly 13 per cent, and concerns expressed by backbenchers about a lack of focus in No 10. Tim Montgomerie, editor of influential website ConservativeHome, said Mr Crosby had ‘a good record of success and is perhaps the alpha male that Team Cameron has been missing since Andy Coulson exited’. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps praised him as a ‘serious campaigner’. He added: ‘Lynton brings the kind of focus that’s required to manage campaigns and we have a big job to do to explain what’s going on.’ After the collapse of plans for boundary changes, the Conservatives will target 40 seats, half of which are held by their Lib  Dem coalition partners, in 2015. Mr Shapps said: ‘I don’t really mind who the opposition is. We need to win those seats if we are going to form the next government and have an outright majority and do some of the things this country desperately needs.’ Boris Johnson said he did not recognise ‘any suggestion of abusive or offensive language’ from his staff and that the Conservative party had ‘done well to retain [Mr Crosby’s] services’.","Cameron faces call to investigate claims his new election guru Lynton Crosby ranted about Muslims when advising Boris .

"By . Glen Owen And Brendan Carlin . PUBLISHED: . 17:47 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:02 EST, 10 December 2012 . Britain is losing the war on drugs and should consider the radical option of legalisation, a powerful committee of MPs will argue this week. In a controversial move which could lead to yet another Coalition rift, the influential Commons Home Affairs Committee is expected to put pressure on David Cameron to establish a Royal Commission to draw up changes to the law. The MPs have concluded that prison sentences – which can be up to life for dealers of heroin and cocaine –  are failing to deter drugs barons, and may even be encouraging a crime-riddled black market in the substances. Pressure: David Cameron, left, will be told by the Commons Home Affairs Committee, which heard evidence from witnesses including Russell Brand, right, that current drug laws are no longer 'fit for purpose' Despite a youthful flirtation with the idea of drugs liberalisation when he first became an MP, the Prime Minister is now opposed to the idea – as is the majority of his party. But a number of senior Liberal Democrats recently backed reforms under which drug users would receive treatment rather than be classed as criminals. Last night, an MP on the Home Affairs Committee – which took evidence from dozens of witnesses, including comedian and reformed addict Russell Brand – told The Mail on Sunday that current laws were no longer ‘fit for purpose’. The MP said: ‘The general view [of the committee] was that the drug laws in Britain are all a bit out-dated. We have a Drugs Act that’s really outlived its usefulness and that really belongs in the 1960s and 1970s. 'It seems to deal with the drugs world as a fairly simple market with a relatively small number of controlled substances out there. But that’s not the case.’ The MP added that, although the committee ‘had not reached a settled view’ on the decriminalisation of drugs, its members agreed Britain was ‘fighting a losing battle over drugs policy’. Holding forth: Comedian and actor Russell Brand tells the Commons Home Affairs Committee that the Government needed to change its approach to combating drug addiction among the young . In need of reform: Russell Brand told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that he once 'loved' heroin . Details of the report will not be . revealed until its publication tomorrow, but it is understood that it . will call on the Prime Minister to establish a Royal Commission on drugs . to report in time for the next General Election in 2015. Although the . conclusions of such commissions are not binding on Governments, they . have such clout that it is politically difficult for Prime Ministers to . reject their findings out of hand. The . MPs are not expected to specify which drugs could be subject to the . relaxation. But their report follows the controversial decision by two . American states, Washington and Colorado, to decriminalise cannabis – a . move expected to be copied widely throughout the US. The . committee also studied the situation in Portugal where, for the past . decade, it has only been an ‘administrative offence’, not a criminal, . one to possess small amounts of any drug. As a result, say supporters, criminal . offences such as robbery have fallen, as have HIV infections from dirty . needles used to inject heroin. Confusion: The British public are bombarded with differing views on the best ways to combat drug addiction . According . to the most recent UK poll on the subject, conducted by YouGov, 49 per . cent of voters supports keeping the law on drugs as it is, while 45 per . cent support liberalising the law on soft drugs – either by downgrading . offences or completely decriminalising drug use. In . the UK, under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, possession of Class A drugs . – ecstasy, LSD, heroin, cocaine, crack and magic mushrooms – carries a . jail sentence of up to seven years, while dealing carries a term of up . to life. Class B drugs – . including cannabis, amphetamines and unprescribed Ritalin – carry a . five-year sentence for possession and 14 years for dealing.  Even . dealing in Class C drugs, such as tranquilisers, carries a possible . sentence of 14 years – more than the maximum prison term for gun . dealers. Supporters of . decriminalisation cite the example of gay marriage, which has gone from . being a marginal issue to a key area of policy debate. The committee is also expected to call . for responsibility for drugs policy to be switched from the Home Office . to the Health Department, as part of a shift in policy emphasis from . ‘criminality’ to ‘medical addiction’. Punishment: Possession of Class A drugs, such as heroin, pictured, carries a jail term of up to seven years while being caught with Class B drugs – including cannabis – carries a five-year sentence. (Posed by model) In . his evidence to the committee, Mr Brand said that taking drugs should . not be seen as a ‘criminal or judicial matter’ and users should be shown . more compassion. He . argued that drug addiction was primarily a health matter, and while he . approved of partial decriminalisation, he opposed a ‘wacky . free-for-all’. In his 2007 . autobiography, Mr Brand described his extensive use of drugs and how his . ‘love’ of heroin in particular had damaged his relationships, health . and career. Addiction: Russell Brand, pictured before attending the Select Committee, spoke about his extensive use of drugs and how his ¿love¿ of heroin . One MP on the committee revealed: ‘We are going to back a Royal Commission as the way forward.’ Royal . Commissions – made up of a panel of experts appointed by the Government . and headed by a distinguished public figure such as a judge –  have . been used over the last 200 years to find answers on the key issues of . the day, covering everything from the width of railway gauges to capital . punishment. The most recent was the 1998 Royal Commission on long-term care for the elderly. The Home Affairs report comes ten years after the committee’s previous examination of drugs laws. That committee’s call for Ecstasy to be legally downgraded was firmly rejected by David Blunkett, the Home Secretary at the time. Angela Watkinson, a Tory member of the committee, distanced herself from the report, claiming colleagues were on a ‘slippery slope’ by even discussing legalisation. Last year, Tom Brake, head of the Lib Dem committee on Home Affairs, called on Ministers to establish an independent panel to examine the Portuguese experiment and to consider the ‘costs and benefits’ of decriminalisation or legalisation. But former Tory Shadow Home  Secretary David Davis  said: ‘The failure of drugs policy is at the centre  of a whole range of criminal problems from organised crime through petty pilfering. 'So what is needed is a firm implementation of clear anti-drugs policies – not procrastination that appeases today’s metropolitan elite, who are surrounded by a haze of  confusion.’ Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘There’s a liberal, fashionable view at the moment that will back softening the drugs laws as they back gay marriage. 'But making these drugs legal is not the answer – the answer is to break up the gangs that deal in these substances. 'We should not be giving these gangs any encouragement by giving the impression we’re setting off down the soft route of decriminalising hard drugs.’ Last night, Baroness Meacher, chairman of the all-party group on drugs policy reform at Westminster, said a full review of drugs laws was now needed to cope with the influx of new drugs. She said: ‘These are coming on the market at the rate of one a week – we cannot cope any longer.’ Last night, a government spokesperson said: 'Drugs are illegal because they are harmful - they destroy lives and blight communities. 'Our current laws draw on the best available evidence and as such we have no intention of downgrading or declassifying cannabis. 'A Royal Commission on drugs is simply not necessary. Our cross-government approach is working. 'Drug usage is at its lowest level since records began and people going into treatment today are far more likely to free themselves from dependency than ever before. 'We will respond to the report more fully in due course.'","Cameron under pressure to consider Russell Brand option of decriminalisation .

The world's smallest and most endangered dolphin 'will die out' unless radical changes are made to fishing, say scientists. It would be the first time in history that a 'cetacean' - the order of animals including whales, dolphins and porpoises - has been wiped out by human activity. Maui's dolphins, found near New Zealand, drown after becoming trapped in the heavy duty nylon fishing mesh - and fewer than 22 breeding females are left in the world. Doomed dolphin?

Numbers have fallen by 94 per cent since gillnet fishing began in the 1970s, an international conference on whaling in Panama heard this week.

Dr Barbara Mass, head of endangered species conservation for the German environmental charity, NABU International - Foundation for Nature, who has worked to protect the species for more than a decade including for the New Zealand Department of Conservation, warned that gillnets are only part of the problem. These findings were presented to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) annual meeting in Panama City. She said: ‘Make no mistake that these beautiful dolphins are well on their way to doing a dodo, and the New Zealand government is well aware of this. ‘Unless something happens immediately, and the New Zealand Government takes notice, the only place you’ll find a Maui’s dolphin will be stuffed in a museum.’ The Maui dolphin - the world's smallest - is under threat from fishing and just 55 individuals are left .

NABU International said the Hector’s dolphin - of which the Maui’s dolphin is a critically-endangered sub-species - is also facing extinction. NABU International is now urging New Zealand to ban harmful fishing methods in waters up to 100m deep to save the species. Dr Maas suggests more selective fishing methods, such as hook and line fishing, or fish traps, which do not catch dolphins, could be used instead. She added: ‘The New Zealand Government has been exposed to fierce pressure from fishing interests, which strongly oppose any measures to protect these rare dolphins. ‘The industry insists that fishermen don’t catch the dolphins, but we found that less than one percent of dolphins killed in nets are reported.‘NABU International sincerely hopes that New Zealand will finally show the commitment and leadership required to save the Maui’s and Hector’s dolphins.","'If we don't act, the only place you'll find a Maui's dolphin is stuffed in a museum' says researcher .

Only one in five Britons work in the job they dreamed of as a child - less than in any other large country, it was revealed today. As little boys and girls we fantasise about becoming pilots or doctors, but the overwhelming majority of us have failed to achieve our childhood aim. Nonetheless, many people in the UK have refused to settle for a lesser career - as a third of Britons still hope to land that dream job. Dream: This graphic shows the jobs most longed-for by British boys and girls respectively . In a survey conducted by networking website LinkedIn, just 21 per cent of the site's British users said they worked in the career they had wanted in their youth. This places the UK bottom of the 17 countries surveyed - Indians topped the list, with 44 per cent saying they had the job they had always dreamed about in their youth. Other English-speaking countries also did relatively poorly, with the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand all scoring less than 30 per cent.

British men said the career they had coveted most was to be an aeroplane pilot, followed by engineer, scientist or police officer. Most women, by contrast, wanted to be a doctor or nurse, with teacher, writer and singer also high up the list. Meanwhile, those in other countries have different aspirations - American men said they wanted to be Olympic athletes, while women in Sweden longed to become vets. Britons may not be all that happy with their jobs, but they have not lost hope of improving their lot, with 32 per cent revealing they still dream of getting the career they always wanted. When the 8,000 people surveyed in the UK were asked how they would define a dream job, the overwhelming majority - 75 per cent - said that 'taking pleasure in work' was the priority.

An American has been jailed for two-and-a-half years in Thailand after posting excerpts from a banned book about the country's monarch online - while living in the U.S. Joe Gordon, 55, who was born in the Southeast Asian kingdom but has lived in the U.S. for 30 years, translated pages from The King Never Smiles - a critical biography of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej - while living in Colorado five years ago. But when he visited the country of his birth in May to seek medical treatment for arthritis and high blood pressure, he was arrested and charged under Thailand's strict lese majeste laws. Rough justice: Joe Gordon (centre) is led into the Bangkok Criminal Court for sentencing earlier today . After being repeatedly denied bail, he pleaded guilty to defaming the monarch in October in the hope of obtaining a lenient sentence. Speaking after today's verdict in Bangkok, Mr Gordon said: 'I am an American citizen, and what happened was in America. 'This is just the system in Thailand. In Thailand, they put people in prison even if they don't have proof.' Washington has condemned Mr Gordon's sentence as severe 'because he has been sentenced for his right to freedom of expression'. And New York-based Human Rights Watch has urged authorities to amend the laws, saying the penalties being meted out were 'shocking'. Much loved: Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej pictured on his 84th birthday on Monday . Mr Gordon, a former car salesman, was . charged with translating excerpts from the unauthorised biography of the . king published by Yale University Press, into the Thai language and . publishing them in a blog. He also provided links to the translation to . other two web forums, prosecutors said. Thailand's lese majeste laws are the harshest in the world. They mandate that people found guilty of defaming the monarchy - including the king, the queen and the heir to the throne - face up to 15 years behind bars. Last month, 61-year-old Amphon Tangnoppakul was sentenced to 20 years in jail for sending four text messages deemed offensive to the crown. Opponents of the laws say that while the royal family should be protected from defamation, lese majeste laws have often been abused to punish political rivals in Thailand. That is especially true since the nation suffered a 2006 military coup. Thailand has come under increasing pressure to reform legislation that critics say is an affront to freedom of expression, and Mr Gordon's case has raised questions about the applicability of Thai law to acts committed by foreigners outside Thailand. Many had hoped that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's administration, which has some prominent supporters who have been accused of lese majeste, would reform the laws. The issue remains highly sensitive, however, and Yingluck's government has been just as aggressive in pursuing cases as its predecessors. Behind bars: Mr Gordon was arrested and detained while on a visit to Thailand in May . The rise of the Internet in recent years has given Thai authorities many more targets to prosecute. Last month, Information Minister Anudith Nakornthap said Facebook users who 'share' or 'like' content that insults the Thai monarchy are committing a crime. Anudith said Thai authorities asked Facebook to remove 86,000 pages between August and November because of alleged lese majeste content. King Bhumibol, who celebrated his 84th birthday on Monday, is the world's longest-reigning monarch and is profoundly revered in Thailand. Asked if he would stay in Thailand after serving his time, Gordon said: 'I would like to stay and see some positive Thailand. I want to see the real, amazing Thailand, not the messy Thailand.'",Car salesman arrested on a visit to Bangkok five years after committing his 'crime'

Cyber-security experts turned the tables on an alleged hacker by using his own malware to film him through his own laptop webcam. Specialists from Georgia's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-Georgia) tricked a man they claim has been targeting their networks by hiding the virus inside a file titled 'Georgian-Nato Agreement'. After the attacker stole that archive from an infected PC in their lab, they were able to seize control of his computer and capture video of him at work. 'Hacker': This is the picture of the alleged cyber-attacker captured by Georgian security experts after they took control of malware on their systems and infected his computer with it . The team also claim to have found out his home city, internet service provider and email addresses, as well as information that links him to Russian security agencies and other hackers in Germany. CERT-Georgia's experts had been investigating a botnet which had infiltrated the computers of politicians, civil servants, banks and NGOs in Georgia, the U.S., Canada, Ukraine and several other countries. They found that the attackers had planted malicious links to install the malware on specific news-site webpages that would be of interest to the kinds of people they wanted to target. '[The] threat was highly encrypted and used contemporary stealthy techniques, so that none of security tools could identify it,' the team said in a 27-page report into their investigation. Once installed, the virus seized control of the targeted computer, rifling its hard drives to search for Word and .pdf documents containing sensitive words like 'USA', 'NATO', 'Russia' and 'CIA'. A botnet is a collection of internet-connected computers over which a hacker has seized control. Each compromised machine - known as a 'bot' - is created when a computer is infected with malicious software (malware) which allows the hacker to direct its activities remotely. These infections can be accomplished by luring users into making a drive-by download, exploiting web browser vulnerabilities, or by tricking the user into running a Trojan horse program, which may come from via email. This malware will typically install modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled by the botnet's operator. Depending on how it is written, a Trojan may then delete itself, or may remain present to update and maintain the modules. The malware also scanned the computer's local network for find other hosts to infect, took screenshots, and took control of embedded webcams and microphones on machines to eavesdrop on targets. The investigation found the infiltration began as early as March 2011, with the virus undergoing a series of modifications as hackers tried to stay one step ahead of whatever security measures were used against it. CERT-Georgia's experts found that whenever they were able to trace the botnet's command and control servers, to which files were being uploaded, the hackers would switch the destination country and IP address. To fight the infections, the team blocked these IP addresses as soon as they were detected then cooperated with anti-virus software companies and foreign intelligence agencies to develop countermeasures. But their masterstroke was to work out how to take control of the botnet themselves and infect one of the hackers with his own malware. They then recorded him as he worked. Espionage: This screengrab provided by CERT-Georgia shows the various keywords that the virus searched for in files on targeted machines . Their report explained, in broken English: 'We have Infected our PC from Lab, then gave Cyber Attacker Fake ZIP Archive with his own virus inside and the name “Georgian-Nato Agreement”. 'Attacker Stole that archive and executed malicious files. 'As we had access to BOT Panel, we had maintained control over his PC. 'Then captured got video of him, personally.

'We have linked him with some of German and Russian hackers. 'Then we have obtained information about his destination city, Internet service provider, e-mail, and etc.' Russia has long been suspected as behind a string of cyber attacks on Georgian targets. There were crippling denial-of-service attacks on Georgian banks and government networks before the Russian military attacked in 2008, arstechnica reported. Now, with security experts able to turn the tables on hackers, it appears a new chapter in cyber-warfare has begun.","Georgian experts were investigating botnet that infected their computers .

A human rights group has released satellite images which appear to show a Burmese district, known for its ethnic unrest, razed to the ground. Human Rights Watch says more than 800 buildings and houseboats were torched in coastal Kyaukpyu, in western Rakhine state. It claims non-Muslims targeted Muslim Rohingyas, in the first serious attack since June, when the rape and murder of a young Buddhist woman in Rakhine in May triggered a string of bloody religious clashes.

However, the HRW fears the figure could be much higher and told the BBC security was desperately needed in the state. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at US-based Human Rights said the government needed to concentrate on the causes of the violence, the BBC reported. After comparing images of the city on October 9 and 25, they claim the differences are painfully clear to see.

HRW said many of the inhabitants are thought to have fled by boat out to sea. A local reporter who visited the site told the BBC's Burmese service the area had been completely destroyed, with some buildings still smouldering. The reporter said the district was also almost totally deserted. Officials said there were no new reports of violence since Friday and that they have restored order in Rakhine.

HRW said it feared the death toll from the latest unrest could be much higher, based on witness reports and 'the government's well-documented history of underestimating figures that might lead to criticism of the state'. In August, Burma set up a commission to investigate the violence between Buddhists and Muslims in the west of the country.

A grandfather was allegedly branded a 'drama king' by an NHS doctor just hours before he died in agony, an inquest heard today. The coroner decided Ronald Tatchell, 66, died of medical neglect after suffering severe pain following a back operation in hospital. Hospital officials have apologised to his family over his 'tragic' death with the promise of a full investigation. The hearing was told that a ward nurse alerted a doctor as Mr Tatchell was in extreme pain - but claimed she was told the patient was a 'drama king'. Father-of-two Mr Tatchell was the victim of a 'whole system failure' by staff at the 530-bed Llandough Hospital in Cardiff. Retired bailiff Mr Tatchell was recovering well from the operation and his family was looking forward to him coming home. But his colour suddenly drained, the whites of his eyes turned yellow and his abdomen became swollen and tender. Staff nurse Rhian Grapes told the inquest: 'I told the senior house officer who referred to him as being a drama king.' But senior house officer Dr Olamide Eso denied the nurse's claim - saying: 'I can categorically say that I did not refer to Mr Tatchell this way. 'That's just not how I would speak about my patients.' The inquest heard that ward manager Sally Lewis became so concerned she went over Dr Eso's head by contacting the surgeon who carried out the operation. Miss Lewis said: 'I didn't feel the doctor looking after him had assessed Ron's condition enough.' The inquest heard blood samples taken at 6.30am were marked 'urgent', but the results were not received until around 11.55am. Surgeon Declan O'Doherty, who carried out a review of the treatment, told the hearing: 'The whole thing was just dysfunctional. Mr Tatchell was the victim of a 'whole system failure' by staff at the Llandough Hospital in Cardiff, an inquest heard . 'At no stage did anyone actually know what his state was - I think there's been effectively a whole system failure.' Retired council bailiff Mr Tatchell, of Bridgend, South Wales, died of hypovolemic shock as a result of haemorrhage following spinal surgery. Cardiff assistant deputy coroner Christopher Woolley ruled that Mr Tatchell died as a result of neglect by hospital staff. He said: 'There was a continuous sequence of shortcomings.There's a link between the failure and Ron's death. So I do find there has been neglect.' Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has apologised to Mr Tatchell's widow Angela, 66, and his two sons Steven, 36, and Matthew, 42. Cardiff assistant deputy coroner Christopher Woolley ruled that Mr Tatchell died as a result of neglect by hospital staff . Director of nursing Ruth Walker said: 'Words are of little comfort at such a distressing time but we would like to offer our sincere and unreserved apologies to Mr Tatchell's family. The failures in his care are absolutely unacceptable. 'While no one individual is to blame, it is clear that the system let down Mr Tatchell, with tragic consequences. 'We have already undertaken a full and in-depth investigation into Mr Tatchell's care which we shared with his family and the coroner ahead of the inquest.

Historical experts have poured cold water over claims that an ancient papyrus proves Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, describing the fragment as 'suspicious' and 'a forgery'. The antique attracted worldwide attention because of a bombshell phrase written in Egyptian Coptic that says Jesus refers to Magdalene as 'my wife' when speaking to his disciples. The 8cm by 4cm fragment supports an undercurrent in Christian thought that undermines centuries of Church dogma by suggesting the Christian Messiah was not celibate. Scroll down for video . Explosive: The ancient papyrus that was said to prove that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene . In the text, Jesus appears to be defending her against some criticism, saying 'she will be my disciple'. Two lines later he then tells the disciples: 'I dwell with her.' But historical experts at a Coptic conference in Rome today began to dismiss the papyrus. Stephen Emmel, professor of Coptology at the University of Muenster, was on the international advisory panel that reviewed the 2006 discovery of the Gospel of Judas. He said the text accurately quotes Jesus as saying 'my wife', but added: 'There's something about this fragment in its appearance and also in the grammar of the Coptic that strikes me as being not completely convincing somehow.' University of Hamburg papyrologist Alin Suciu declared, simply: 'I would say it's a forgery. The script doesn't look authentic.' Wolf-Peter Funk, a Coptic . linguist, said the fragment cannot be judged as it has no context and dismissed it as 'suspicious'. He explained: 'There are thousands of scraps of . papyrus where you find crazy things. It can be anything.' The incomplete manuscript, written in . the ancient Egyptian Coptic language, has been studied by Karen King, . Hollis professor of divinity at Harvard University, the oldest endowed . academic seat in the US. Today, King acknowledged there were unanswered questions about the fragment, and said she planned to carry out ink tests to determine its authenticity. She said: 'We still have some work to do, testing the ink and so on and so forth, but what is exciting about this fragment is that it's the first case we have of Christians claiming that Jesus had a wife.' Ancient: The back side, or verso, of the papyrus is so badly damaged that only a few key words - 'my mother' and 'three' - were decipherable . King also made the point that the . text does not offer any historical evidence of Jesus being married, . merely that some Christians believed he was 200 years after he died. She also revealed that the owner of the papyrus wants to sell it - prompting further speculation over its authenticity. 'There are all sorts of really dodgy . things about this,' said David Gill, professor of archaeological . heritage at University Campus Suffolk and author of the Looting Matters . blog, which closely follows the illicit trade in antiquities. 'This . looks to me as if any sensible, responsible academic would keep their . distance from it.' Ancient papyrus fragments have been frequently cut up by unscrupulous dealers seeking to make more money. Gill . cited the ongoing debate in academia over publishing articles about . possibly dubiously obtained antiquities, thus potentially fueling the . illicit market. However, . if genuine, the document casts doubt on a centuries old official . representation of Magdalene as a repentant whore and overturns the . Christian ideal of sexual abstinence. It . elaborates an ancient and persistent undercurrent in Christian thought . that Jesus and Magdalene were in fact a couple, as picked up by Dan . Brown in the plot of his best-selling thriller The Da Vinci Code. Professor . King downplays the fragment's validity as a biographical document, . saying that it was probably composed in Greek a century or so after the . Crucifixion, then subsequently transcribed into Coptic. Its significance instead lies in the . possibility that an early Christian sect drew spiritual succour from . portraying their prophet as having a wife. This representation of Jesus as a man . with earthly passions and needs has not survived in the doctrines of . the established churches, which emphasise celibacy and asceticism as a . spiritual ideal. Professor . King's interpretation of the text are based on the assumption that the . fragment is genuine, a question that is by no means definitively . settled. The papyrus’ back side, or verso, is so badly damaged that only a few key words - 'my mother' and 'three'- were decipherable, but on the front side, or recto, King gleaned eight fragmentary lines: . Because chemical tests of its ink have not yet been done, the papyrus could still be challenged on the basis of its authenticity, though independent experts have given their support based on other benchmarks. To authenticate the papyrus, . Professor King sent photos of it to AnneMarie Luijendijk, a professor at . Princeton and an authority on Coptic papyri and sacred scriptures. Professor . Luijendijk forwarded the pictures to Roger Bagnall, a renowned . papyrologist who directs the Institute for the Study of the Ancient . World at New York University. Known . for his conservative assessments of the authenticity and date of . ancient papyri, Professor Bagnall nevertheless confirmed that he . believed the document was genuine. The . scribe's dialect and style of handwriting, and the colour and texture . of the papyrus, helped them to date it to the second half of the fourth . century AD and place its probable origin in upper Egypt. The details of the fragment support another view of the life of Jesus that has begun to gain traction since the discovery of a cache of ancient manuscripts in Nag Hammadi, Upper Egypt, in 1945. These manuscripts, including the gospel of Thomas, the gospel of Philip and the Secret Revelation of John, outline the so-called Gnostic version of Christianity which differs sharply from the official Church line. Christ Appearing to the Magdalen by Titian: A newly discovered ancient papyrus suggests the Messiah and Mary Magdalene were man and wife . Gnosticism is a modern scholarly term for a set of esoteric religious beliefs found among early Christian groups who believed the realisation of intuitive knowledge is the way to salvation. In general, they believed that the material world was created not by God but via some intermediary being sometimes identified as Ahriman, Satan or Yahweh. Jesus is identified by some Gnostics as an embodiment of the supreme being who became incarnate to bring gnōsis to the earth, according to Wikipedia. Others deny that Jesus was God made flesh, claiming him merely to be a human who reached divinity through enlightenment and taught his disciples to do the same. The movement spread in areas controlled by the Roman Empire and Arian Goths, and the Persian Empire; it continued to develop in the Mediterranean and Middle East before and during the 2nd and 3rd centuries. Conversion to Islam and the Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229) greatly reduced the remaining number of Gnostics during the Middle Ages, though a few communities still exist. Gnostic and pseudo-gnostic ideas became influential in some of the philosophies of various esoteric mystical movements of the late 19th and 20th centuries in Europe and North America. Persecuted and often cut off from each . other, ancient Christian communities had very different opinions on . fundamental doctrines regarding Jesus' birth, life and death. It was only with the establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire that the Emperor Constantine summoned 300 bishops to issue a definitive statement of Christian doctrine. This so-called Nicene creed - named for Nicaea, the town where they met - affirmed a model of Christian belief that is to this day taken as orthodoxy. The origins of this latest fragment are as yet unknown. Professor King received it from an anonymous collector who had found it among a job lot of ancient Greek and Coptic papyri. Accompanying the fragment was an unsigned and undated handwritten note from a translator claiming it is the sole example of a text in which Jesus refers in direct speech to having a wife. Professor King, who is able to read ancient Coptic, believes some of the phrases within the text echo passages in Luke, Matthew and the Gnostic gospels about the role of the family. These parallels convinced her that this account of the life of Jesus was originally composed in the second century AD when such questions were a subject of intense theological debate. Those who disagreed with the official line as established by the Council of Nicaea were in time branded by the Roman Church as heretics and their teachings suppressed.","Ancient document attracted worldwide attention because of a phrase that says Jesus refers to Mary Magdalene as his wife .

Previous theories had speculated that . Arafat, who died in a Paris hospital in November 2004, had contracted . cancer, cirrhosis, or even HIV. But tests carried out by the Institute . de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, showed that Arafat's . underwear registered a level of 180 millibecquerels of Polonium-210, . more than 20 times the dose to kill an average human being. Dr Francois Bochod, the director of . the institute, confirmed to Al Jazeera that there had been an . 'unexplained, elevated amount' of polonium found on the former leader. The Al Jazeera documentary revealed that Polonium was found on Arafat's underwear, kaffiyeh headscarf, and even his toothbrush. Al Jazeera had sent Arafat's clothes . to the institute to test them, after obtaining them from his widow as . part of a nine-month investigation into his death. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Investigation: Arafat's widow Suha Arafat, pictured here alongside then Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nabil Shaath (left) and then French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin, says her husband's body should be exhumed following the lab results . Many have speculated that Arafat, whose West Bank grave is pictured here, was killed by an Israeli spy agency . Those exposed to a lethal dose of Polonium, usually by ingesting it, die within 2-3 months. In most cases there are no serious symptoms for a week after being exposed, but nausea and fatigue would set in soon after. In theory, just a microgram of Polonium - the same as a spec of dust - is enough to kill someone, due to its slowly-excreted alpha particles which affect the body's organs. After ingestion, Polonium affects the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. Serious illness would not be expected for a month, due to the amount of time it takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures. As the severity of the exposure develops in the body, victims usually lose hair, and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed. This later leads to severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, loss of fluids, and disturbance of electrolyte balance. Though it takes 5-6 weeks to seriously affect most, the symptoms of Polonium poisoning contrast to the case of Litvinenko (above), who fell ill the day after he was exposed. The Russian died 23 days after being exposed, an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage. Bochud said the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210. 'But we have to do it quite fast because . polonium is decaying, so if we wait too long, for sure, any possible . proof will disappear,' he told Al Jazeera. It emerged today that Palestinians are ready to accept a medical examination of Arafat's body if his family agrees, according to a Palestinian official. The comments from Tawfiq Tirawi, who led a Palestinian probe into Arafat's death, came just hours after the Al-Jazeera investigation showed the Palestinian leader might have been poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium. The official told AP: 'After the Al-Jazeera broadcast I met today with president (Mahmud) Abbas and recommended accepting an analysis of the body of the martyr president Arafat, and Abbas for his part agreed on the condition that the family... accepts.' Polonium was found to have caused the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, and he was assumed to have been deliberately poisoned. Arafat's widow Suha said she would ask for Arafat's body - buried in the West Bank town of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian self-rule authority - to be exhumed. Speaking at the end of the documentary, aired on Al Jazeera's English and Arabic channels, she said: 'We have to go further and exhume Yasser Arafat's body to reveal the truth to all the Muslim and Arab world.' Arafat led the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's fight against Israel from the 1960s but signed a peace agreement with the Jewish state in 1993 establishing Palestinian self-rule areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. His mysterious death came four years into a Palestinian uprising, after years of talks with Israel failed to lead to a Palestinian state. French doctors who treated Arafat in his final days could not establish the cause of death. French officials refused to give details of his condition, citing privacy laws, fuelling a host of rumours and theories over the nature of his illness.","Polonium traces 20 times the dose needed to kill a human are found on Palestinian leader's underwear .

Hoyt's resolve to compete again sprang from the tragedy of the twin bombings at the race, which killed three people and injured more than 170. Scroll Down for Video . Another run: Dick Hoyt (left) ran last week's Boston Marathon thinking it would be his last. But now the 72-year-old father, who has pushed his disabled son (right) in a special wheelchair in 1,091 races, says he's planning to run again . Resolve: Hoyt's resolve to compete again sprang from the tragedy of the twin bombings at the race, which killed three people and injured more than 170 . 'We’re definitely going to run next . year, and we’re going to be stronger next year, and I know the marathon . is going to be stronger next year,' Dick Hoyt told NBC's Today Show. 'I don’t know how they’re going to . handle [all the people]. It’s just unbelievable,' he added. 'All these . people are so strong and we’re going to be strong, and we’re going to . stay strong.' Hoyt's 51-year-old son, Rick, has . cerebral palsy and is unable to walk or talk. The pair was at the 25-mile mark when the two bombs went . off about a mile away. 'As we got closer, things didn't look right,' Hoyt said. He said police were swarming the final stretch of the prestigious route so he asked an officer what was going on. 'He told me two bombs had detonated at the finish line,' the father said. Happy moment: The pair started Monday posing with a statue honoring them near the start of the Boston Marathon . Runners continue to race towards the finishing line at Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts on the sidewalk . 'That's when I got . really worried. I knew my son and his wife and my two grandsons were . waiting for us at the finish line,' Dick added. Thankfully, . their family escaped injury. But the chaos left the concerned Holland, . Massachusetts, man wondering how to get Rick back to their hotel. A police officer suggested they take a taxi but Rick's running chair is too big to fit in a cab. That's . when a a good Samaritan in a Jeep offered to give them a lift and, . according to Today.com, managed to navigate their way through the . blocked streets and frantic crowds to the entrance of the Sheraton. Once Dick had carried his son to their room the magnitude of what happened began to sink in, he said. Long time: The father and son team have competed in more than 1000 races since the 1970s . Dick could never stop running with his son when . Rick told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not . handicapped.' 'The thing about the Boston Marathon . is that it's always such a joyful day,' Dick told the website. 'Everybody's so happy and it's such a positive attitude. And then to . have this happen?... 'What kind of a world are we living in nowadays?' The . truly special bond between the heroic father and his courageous son was . honored with a life-sized trophy before the marathon's start last week after the inspirational pair finished 1,091 events, including . 252 triathlons, 70 marathons, 94 half marathons and 155 five-kilometer . races. Despite being unable to complete Monday's race, the father-and-son team still maintained their proud . record of never having finished last as thousands of other runners were also prevented from crossing the line. Rick was born with cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic, the result of oxygen deprivation at birth. Rick Hoyt (left) and his father Dick are preparing to compete in their 31st Boston Marathon - which will edge them closer to 1,100 endurance events as a father-son team . At . his birth, doctors were blunt. 'They said, 'Forget Rick, put him away, . put him in an institution, he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of . his life,' said Dick told the Today Show earlier this month. 'Today . he's 51 years old and we still haven't figured out what kind of . vegetable he is - and guess what? That vegetable has been turned into a . bronze statue.' The . statue was unveiled outside Boston's Center Elementary School to honor . Team Hoyts' racing record, which began in the mid 70s. Never even thinking for a second to institutionalize their son, the Hoyts decided to raise him like his two brothers. They . took him camping, cross-country skiing and swimming at the beach and . enrolled him into school - where he learned to spell words with his eyes . - one at a time. Using a computer device specially designed to allow him to communicate, Rich graduated from high school and from Boston University and now lives on his own with personal care attendants. The statue by Texas artist Mike Tabor marks Dick and Rick Hoyt, who have competed in more than 1,000 races ¿ including 30 editions of the Boston Marathon . It was during school that he told his father he would like to participate in a five-mile charity run for a Lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident. 'Rick came home ... and he said, ""Dad, I have to do something for him. I want to let him know that life goes on even though he's paralyzed. I want to run in the race,"" said Dick Hoyt. Dick agreed to push his son in his wheelchair and they completed the run together. Later that night, Rick told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not handicapped.' That sparked the creation of Team Hoyt, . an astonishing feat of love and courage that has seen the father and son . compete in more than 1,000 races, including marathons, triathlons and . Ironman competitions. Rick Hoyt graduated from Boston University and discovered his passion for racing along with his father while he was at school in the 1970s . During triathlons, Dick pulls his son in a boat from a cord attached to his waist during the swim, the pair ride a special two-seater bicycle for the bike section and Dick pushes Rick in a custom-made running chair for the final stage. The incredible pair set up the Hoyt Foundation in 1989, which aims to include disabled young Americans into daily life, especially through sports, in school and in the workplace. In 2009, they completed their 1,000th . race together at the Boston Marathon, which is why the event holds such a . special place in their hearts. The two had a special wheelchair . designed for them and Dick recalled how people didn't understand what . they were trying to do together. Heroes: Rick has cerebral palsy after being deprived of oxygen during his birth, but that has not stopped him taking part in more than 1,000 races . 'I used to get letters and phone . calls saying, 'What are you doing dragging your son to all these races? Are you just looking for glory for yourself?' Dick Hoyt recalled. 'What . they didn’t realize was that he was dragging me to all these races!' When . asked the one thing he would like to give his father, Rick said: 'The . thing I'd most like is for my dad to sit in the chair and I would push . him for once.' Both men now give talks across the U.S., as well as continuing to compete in events together in a bid to encourage other disabled young people to challenge themselves. They have been competing as a team for more than 30 years, and their website says they have no plans on retiring.

Divorce cases could be settled by Sharia and religious courts after a landmark High Court ruling. The settlement of a young Jewish couple was approved under the rabbinical court of Beth Din, which is said to be the first time that an English family judge has sent a divorce dispute to a religious court.

Divorce: A settlement of a Jewish couple was approved under Beth Din. A file photo of a synagogue is pictured . The Muslim Council of Britain praised the judgement, with a spokesman telling The Times: ‘If it leads to the eventual acceptance of Sharia court divorces then Muslims will be very encouraged.’ The relevant case involved an Orthodox Jewish couple in their twenties, who had a religious wedding in 2006 and first lived in Israel, before returning to London for their first child to be born. The couple were hoping to move to Toronto, Canada, but they broke up in 2009 after the birth of their second child. Disputes over access to the children led the father to begin court proceedings.

People gather on the site of the ruined factory as rescuers try to bring survivors out of the rubble. The death count is growing . It follows forty survivors being discovered yesterday, trapped in a partly-collapsed room beneath the wreckage. Authorities said they will now use heavy equipment to drill a central hole from the top to look for survivors and dead bodies. At least 362 people are confirmed dead in the collapse of the eight-story building that housed five garment factories. The death toll is expected to rise . further, but it is already the deadliest tragedy to hit Bangladesh's . garment industry, which is worth 20 billion dollars (£13 billion) annually and a mainstay of the economy. Wednesday's . collapse and previous disasters in garment factories have focused . attention on the poor working conditions of workers who toil for as . little as $38 (£24.50) a month to produce clothing for top international . brands. Army Major General Chowdhury Hasan . Suhrawardy, the co-ordinator of the rescue operations, said they will . try to save the nine people first by manually shifting concrete blocks . with the help of light equipment such as pick axes and shovels. The search for life is becoming more pressured as resuce workers enter their fifth day of picking through crumbled steel and concrete . A rescue worker shouts as dead bodies are removed from the building. Holes are now being drilled from the top of the heap to look for survivors and dead bodies . Police say as many as 900 people are still missing in the aftermath of the collapse. This woman is one of nine survivors who were pulled from the rubble today . Rescue workers survey the damage from the ruins of the Rana Plaza building. Officials say the factory had been built on soft ground without the correct permits .

'In this stage, we have no other choice but to use some heavy equipment. 'We will start it within a few hours. Manual operation and use of small equipment is not enough,' he said. The work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies, he said. All the equipment is in place, 'from a . small blade to everything. We have engaged many private sector . companies which supplied us equipment, even some heavy ones.' In rare good news, a female worker was pulled out alive today. Hasan .

The owner had the approval to construct five floors but he added three more illegally.

Owners of the collapsed Rana Plaza garment factory are led away by police. Police have made a total of six arrests including engineers who designed the building . Two arrested owners of the garment factory that collapsed outside the capital, are today escorted to an appearance at the court in Dhaka . Some people have survived five days in the wreckage with no food or water but 900 are counted as missing . Soldiers clear away the crumbled concrete of the Rana Plaza building. Fears are mounting that the death toll could rise far beyond the latest figure of 363 . Hours later the Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, and most victims were crushed by massive blocks of concrete and mortar falling on them. A garment manufacturers' group said the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not clear how many were inside it when it collapsed. About 2,500 survivors have been accounted for. Working round-the-clock, rescuers . have used bare hands and shovels, passing chunks of brick and concrete . down a human chain away from the collapsed structure. On . the ground, mixed in the debris were several pairs of pink cotton . pants, a mud-covered navy blue sock and a pile of green uncut fabric. The . badly decomposed bodies pulled out of the rubble were kept at a . makeshift morgue at the nearby Adharchandra High School before being . handed over to families. Authorities are now using heavy equipment to search for survivors. They said that the work will be carried out carefully so as not to mutilate bodies . People gather to watch the rescue operation, hoping their loved ones will be discovered alive five days after Bangladesh's worst ever industrial accident . Protestors light fires in the streets as rescue workers continue to search the rubble for survivors and bodies . Many people milled around at the school, waving photos of their missing loved ones. Among those arrested are Bazlus Samad, managing director of New Wave Apparels Ltd, and Mahmudur Rahman Tapash, the company chairman, and Aminul Islam, chairman of Phantom Apparels Ltd. Rana, the building owner, was a local leader of ruling Awami League's youth front. His arrest, and that of the factory owners, was ordered by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is also the Awami League leader. The disaster is the worst ever for . the country's booming and powerful garment industry, surpassing a fire . five months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to . improve worker-safety standards. But since then very little has changed in Bangladesh, where low wages have made it a magnet for numerous global brands. Bangladeshi garment workers beat a driver for not stopping a bus he was driving, during a protest against the collapse of the eight-storey building . Angry workers shout slogans in the streets as they protest against the killing of the workers at Rana Plaza . Bangladeshi garment workers throw stones and vandalize an industrial police control room . Bangladesh's garment industry was the third largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade. The country's minimum wage is the equivalent of about £24.50 a month. Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year. The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Britain's Primark acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered garments from them.","Rescuers forced to retreat from flames sparked as they tried to cut through a steel rod .

A hit and run driver who killed a barmaid while 'driving like an idiot' was banned for the eighth time when the deadly crash happened. Stephen Palmer, 28, was speeding when he lost control on a bend and crashed into Louise Clark's oncoming Audi TT. The collision left Miss Clark, 38, trapped inside her vehicle with broken legs and a serious brain injury. She was rushed to hospital by air ambulance but her life support machine was switched off more than a week after the smash on December 30 last year. Jailed: Stephen Palmer, left, was jailed for five-and-a-half years for killing barmaid Louise Clark, right, while banned from driving for the eighth time . Palmer, who the court heard had an 'appalling' driving record, had a previous dangerous driving conviction after he crashed his vehicle through the front of a house and into a pensioner's living room during a police chase. He also had convictions for drink driving, driving while disqualified and without a licence and insurance and aggravated vehicle taking. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years at Isleworth Crown Court yesterday. Judge John Dennis told Palmer: 'There was no attempt to go to Miss Clark with succour or call the emergency services and your driving record is appalling. 'You have heard about the devastating effect your driving had on that family. 'She was a gregarious young woman, deeply loved by those that knew her.' Palmer had borrowed a pal's blue Honda Civic hire car and was seen tailgating another vehicle and overtaking it at speed moments before he crashed into Miss Clark in Uxbridge. Loss: Louise Clark's family described her as family orientated who loved life and loved her family . She was cut from the wreckage by the fire brigade and rushed by air ambulance to St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, but her life support machine was switched off on January 8 after she suffered numerous strokes. Prosecutor Paul Cavin said witness James Baker was following the speeding Palmer along the unlit semi-rural road, which has several dips and humps, and told police: 'It (the car) overtook as it crested one of the humps and was either all or almost all on the wrong side of the road. 'It continued driving fast and continued out of sight. I thought he was driving like an idiot.' Moments later Mr Baker arrived at the crash scene, but Palmer had fled. Police found Palmer's DNA from blood on Miss Clark's driver-side door and he gave himself up the day Miss Clark died. Mr Cavin added: 'He must have been travelling well in excess of the speed limit, despite warning signs, plus a warning side of a double bend and 'slow' written on the tarmac.' Well-traveled Miss Clark, of Ickenham, Greater London, had visited 50 countries, worked at a Harefield bar and had two younger brothers. In a victim impact statement Miss Clark's mother Beryl said: 'Losing a daughter in such a callous and devastating way has taken away her life and our lives. 'Louise was a very family-orientated daughter, who loved life and loved her family. Everyday is unbearable, but you carry on. You have to. 'We will never see her married or see her children or the grandchildren she would have given us.' Beryl described the 'nine agonising days' her daughter clung to life saying: 'Every day the doctors gave us a glimmer of hope and then took it away. 'A future without her scares me. We are left with a deep ache of emptiness without her. That will for ever break our hearts.' Defending Palmer, Selwyn Shapiro said: 'The defendant didn't intend to cause death or serious injury. This was a catastrophic misjudgment case.' Sentencing Palmer, Judge Dennis said: 'Mercifully she was unconscious and was so immediately after the collision. 'The impact was avoidable and was caused by your dangerous driving. 'You have never had a driving licence and have committed offences after offences of driving dangerously or disqualified and have been sent to prison for it.' Palmer was also disqualified for six years and ordered him to pass an extended driving test before he is ever granted a licence. He had pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and causing death while disqualified and uninsured.

Witnesses who may have been too scared to talk to police investigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence will tonight be urged to help detectives catch those who continue to evade justice. The plea for new information days after the 20th anniversary of Stephen’s stabbing will be made by the detective who last year helped convict two of Stephen’s killers, Gary Dobson and David Norris. Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll will revisit the crime scene in Eltham, south-east London, where Stephen was killed on April 22, 1993, during a special BBC1 Crimewatch appeal on the case. Distinctive: A man in a green jacket was seen opposite the Coronet cinema near the scene of the murder wearing a green jacket with a large 'V' Stephen Lawrence was murdered 20 years ago and a special BBC1 Crimewatch appeal will be broadcast tonight for new information on the case . Police believe up to six white youths were involved in the racist attack, but only two have been convicted. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Officers believe there were individuals in the vicinity of the murder who have never come forward.’ These include two men who got off a bus opposite where Stephen was attacked and walked south along the east side of Well Hall Road, a man who ran from the area of Well Hall Road roundabout to the bus stop on the same side of Well Hall Road as the attack, a man walking on the east side of Well Hall south of the roundabout, opposite the Coronet cinema, wearing a green jacket with a large ‘V’, and anyone else nearby, such as those outside the cinema or on buses. Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris were convicted of Stephen's killing in January last year. Dobson dropped his appeal last month while Norris continues to fight against his conviction . The move piles pressure on the three thugs named as Stephen’s killers by the Mail in February 1997 – brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, and their friend Luke Knight, none of whom have been convicted. The others named on the Mail’s famous ‘Murderers’ front page that month were Norris and Dobson, who in January last year were convicted of the 18-year-old’s killing after a forensic breakthrough. Yesterday, it emerged Dobson claimed £200,000 in legal aid for Old Bailey hearings to do with the trial.

Out of a job: Paris Brown, Britain's first youth police and crime commissioner, was forced to stand down from her £15,000-a-year-role over her online activity . A £26,000 youth 'ambassador' is to be appointed by Cheshire Police - just weeks after Britain's first youth crime tsar was sacked over a series of allegedly racist, violent and homophobic messages. The job pays £10,000 more than the salary given to Paris Brown, 17, who lost her job in Kent after her Twitter posts were made public. Cheshire's decision to create a similar post for a candidate aged between 18 and 21 has raised questions about their use of public money. But John Dwyer, Cheshire's police and crime commissioner, still wants to hire a young person to 'act as a conduit between young people and the police'. The successful candidate would ideally have  A-Levels, but this is not essential, and the job pays between £23,799 and £25,449. New teachers get around £21,588 and the average salary in the UK is £26,500. Paris Brown, 17, was appointed to the . £15,000-a-year role to help Kent Police 'stay in touch with young . people' by providing their views on policing, but she was forced to step down. The teenager . was questioned over the posts by officers from Kent Police's Special . Branch, but the force said last week it would take 'no further action' after . concluding the case 'does not pass the evidential threshold for . prosecution'. In tweets posted on her personal . account before she was appointed youth crime commissioner, Miss Brown . called homosexuals 'fags', immigrants 'illegals' and travellers . 'pikeys', and said she had 'a thing for older men'. In another tweet she wrote: 'I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.' Miss Brown also posted: 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a f****** fag', in reference to the Channel 4 reality show. Post: Paris Brown's job was seen as a way of connecting Kent Police with young people but her Twitter account was not looked at before her appointment . Remorse: The 17-year-old, who denies being racist or homophobic, has apologised for any offence caused by the messages posted online . The Twitter account, which has since been deleted, was not checked as part of the recruitment process. Miss . Brown, from Sheerness in Kent has since apologised for causing offence . with the messages she posted between the ages of 14 and 16. Insistent: Cheshire's John Dwyer wants to appoint someone to act as a conduit between young people and the police, despite the Paris Brown scandal . She . denied being anti-gay or racist, and said she is against taking drugs, . insisting that the reference on Twitter to making 'hash brownies' was . from a Scooby Doo film. The teenager's Twitter account was not checked as part of the recruitment process. Announcing plans to create a similar role in Cheshire, John Dwyer insisted that it was an important post. He said: 'My role as commissioner is to be the bridge between the public and the police, and it's important that our young people are not left out of that partnership. 'I want to appoint a Youth Ambassador, someone who has experience of working with young people to ensure they have a voice. 'The role will not only provide young people with a point of contact but they will also deliver key messages such as internet safety and the dangers of drugs and alcohol.' The fixed-term post, whose salary was advertised as £23,800-£25,500, would run until May 2016. Potential applicants have until May 3 to submit their details. But critics say the decision 'does not bode well'. Dave Cargill, a member of the county's Police and Crime Panel told the Times: 'It’s a strange thing that you can pay up to £25,000 for a very young person and yet they expect members of the crime panel to scrutinise [the PCC] without any allowance, the jury’s out at the moment.' Police in Kent have received 26 applications to replace Miss Brown as Youth Commissioner. The 17-year-old was appointed by Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes last month. Mrs Barnes said: ''I think Paris would have been a really good ambassador for us. 'She was interviewed by very experienced people and they all liked her, she was a very mature young lady. 'But she has learned from this and we can't keep on poking the singer. You have got to forgive. 'What she said was absolutely awful but she has repented for that. 'So I'm looking for somebody special. We have the 26 already and I am sure there is somebody out there for this job.'","Cheshire wants candidate between 18 and 21 to link police with young people .

A senior SAS officer is to sue the Metropolitan Police for unlawful arrest amid clams he was 'treated like a terrorist' by armed officers for allegedly breaching the Official Secrets Act. The individual, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was one of two British army officers arrested during an investigation by Scotland Yard into leaks of government secrets to Sky News. The officer was driving through Hereford with one of his young children when, it is claimed, he was stopped by armed police surrounding his vehicle. An SAS solider falsely accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act says police officers treated him like a terrorist and is preparing to sue the Metropolitan Police . 'It was a disgrace,' said a senior figure speaking to the Independent on Sunday on condition of anonymity. 'He was treated as if he were a terrorist.' Charges of breaching the Official Secrets Act were subsequently dropped and the officer, who has since left the Army, has instructed his lawyers to start legal proceedings against the force. In a statement last night, the officer's lawyer, Simon McKay, said: 'I confirm that I act for a former special forces officer, known as AB. He was arrested by the Metropolitan Police in 2011 but the investigation was unconditionally dropped last year. 'He has now engaged the pre-action protocol with the Metropolitan Police's legal department in connection with a damages claim for, amongst other things, unlawful arrest.' It is understood the arrests took place in July 2012 after Lieutenant-General Jonathan Page, former director of special forces, asked detectives to investigate suspected breaches of the Official Secrets Act in the wake of a series of stories by the Sky News journalist Sam Kiley. Detectives claimed offences had been committed under Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act. Information had allegedly been leaked from 'high-level Cabinet Office briefing room A (Cobra) meetings' relating to 'military operations overseas and in the UK'. It is said to have included information about special forces operations and military tactics which 'was likely to have endangered the lives of military personnel', according to court documents. The officer says he was falsely arrested when with the SAS, which has the motto, 'Who Dares Wins' Mr Kiley, now Sky's Middle East correspondent based in Jerusalem, is thought to have been in contact with at least four military officers, including a member of the Defence Board and one of the country's most senior commanders. It is not known if the two high-ranking officers were also investigated. Police arrested the other two in 2011. The Metropolitan Police attempted to force Sky to hand over copies of emails between Mr Kiley and those arrested. But Sky appealed and managed to get the court order quashed in December 2011. High . Court judges did not find grounds to suspect that information had been . disclosed 'which was likely to cause or to have caused damage to the . security or intelligence agencies or to their work'. The charges against the two officers were subsequently dropped and they have since left the Army. It is not known whether the other man arrested intends to take action against the police.

The new chief executive of the BBC Lord Hall (above) has put a £150,000 cap on severance payouts but it has emerged that John Smith, the former chief executive of BBC Worldwide will walk away with £800,000 . A BBC executive is in line for an £800,000 payoff just weeks after the new director general ordered a £150,000 cap on severance payments, it has emerged. On joining the corporation at the beginning of April, one of Lord Hall’s first decisions was  to impose the ceiling on payouts after it was claimed that losing a job with the BBC was like ‘winning the lottery’. It follows public anger at payouts to executives, including former director general George Entwistle who was awarded a £450,000 lump sum after a disastrous 54 days in the top job. But it has since emerged that Lord Hall’s policy will not come into force until September, allowing John Smith, the former chief executive of BBC Worldwide, to walk away with a year’s notice of £477,000, profit-related pay of up to £386,000 and a £4million pension pot. That is despite Mr Smith, who has gone on to become chief operating officer at the fashion house Burberry, telling the BBC that he wanted to resign. Mr Smith, 55, joined the BBC in 1989 and left on December 31. He saw profits increase by fourfold during his time as the head of BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the corporation. However, he also oversaw the disastrous purchase of the travel guidebook company Lonely Planet, which was bought for £130million in 2007 and sold last month for just £51.1million. Last night, Conservative MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture select committee, said: ‘There are many who will feel that the level of payout to John Smith is unjustified, and we hope it will be the last. It’s even harder to justify that kind of payment when he was in charge when the BBC made such a disastrous decision over the Lonely Planet deal.’ A BBC spokesman said last night: ‘Tony Hall has been clear that the BBC cannot continue to sanction redundancy and severance pay of the size of those made in the past.’ Conservative MP John Whittingdale (above), chairman of the Commons culture select committee, said there were many people 'who will feel that the level of payout to John Smith is unjustified'","New BBC chief executive Lord Hall put a cap on payoffs at £150,000 .

Emma Johnston, 21, and Chris Goodwin, 30, were taken ill after taking a mixture of alcohol, amphetamine and mephedrone - otherwise known as 'bubble' - on Saturday night. Police and paramedics were called to two houses within the space of half an hour the following afternoon but the pair were already dead. Victims: Chris Goodwin, 30, left, and Emma Johnston, 21, who died after taking a mixture of alcohol, amphetamine and mephedrone on Saturday night . Three other friends were treated in hospital after taking a combination of drink and drugs. The double deaths occurred after Emma and Chris joined a group of housemates who decided to have an 'all night' Saturday night out in Bolton, Greater Manchester. It is believed the party met up at a house and started taking the drugs before they headed off to pubs and clubs. The group then fell ill after going their separate ways at the end of the night. The alarm was raised at 1.30pm on Sunday after Emma was found at a house in Farnworth. Half an hour later officers were also called to a house five miles away in Tonge Moor, Bolton, and found father-of-one Chris dead. Post-mortem examinations and toxicology tests are due to be carried out to establish the exact cause of death. Greater Manchester Police Superintendent Phil Davies said: 'The message is don't take drugs, they don't come with a quality seal of approval on them, or if you do don't mix them.

Racism: Vile messages were posted online about Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse, 27, and 22-year-old Rachelle Graham, seen here before taking part in a skydive for his charity . But the April 7 event was attacked on a website and social media by racists who are against mixed-race relationships. The Miss . England hopeful was . alerted to the website by her mother who was horrified at the language . used to describe her daughter and the £9million striker who have been dating for a . year. The comments are too vile to report here and police are now investigating the abuse as a hate crime, according to the Mirror. Good cause: Miss Graham, who was crowned Miss Newcastle last May, took part in a skydive from 10,000ft to raise funds for a specially equipped ambulance and on furnishing a hospital in Sedhiou, Cisse¿s home town in Senegal . Miss Graham's mother reported the online abuse to police . Miss Graham told Sky Tyne and Wear: 'It is horrific. The website targets the pair of us because I . am white and Papiss is black. 'Some of it is really threatening. I don’t understand why people would say these things, especially as Papiss is such a nice guy. 'I guess we just have to ignore it and move on.' She said the messages originated from a U.S. website 'which targets white people who are going out with black people. She told The Mirror that she suspected the person behind that website also set up a fake Twitter account pretending to be her. 'It was made to look as much like mine as possible, using my photos and virtually the same address. 'The first I knew of it was when I started to get messages from friends responding to tweets I had not sent. This person was sending out abuse and saying I was no longer with Papiss, and would use racist terms.' On her Twitter page Miss Graham wrote: 'Thank you everyone for your support regarding the racist website.' Miss Graham who runs a cafe on the outskirts of Newcastle has previously spoken about her desire to help her boyfriend's charity Friends of Sedhiou. 'His agent introduced me to the man who looks after the charity and it all began from there. Ever since I won Miss Newcastle I have always wanted to do a skydive for charity and so I decided to do it for Papiss’s charity.

The New York City skyline has the ability to take ones breath away at almost any time of day, but it is after dark when the shimmering lights of Manhattan's skyscrapers really stand out against the night sky. Those looking eastwards at the skyline from New Jersey last night were treated to a 'pink moon' rising in between the buildings. Traditionally, the April full moon is known as ""the Pink Moon,"" supposedly as a tribute to the Grass Pink Orchids or Wild Ground Phlox, considered one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring. The moon is particularly colourful as it is rising or setting for the same reason that sunrise and sunsets are red and orange. When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead. The moon appears to glow red as the reflected light from the sun is scattered and refracted by thick layers of atmosphere. By the time the moonlight reaches our eyes, the blue, green, and purple . pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules. That's why you only see yellow, orange, or red. It is also caused by the dust particles and other pollutants in the air. The phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering and makes for a beautiful sight both for our eyes and as shown here, the camera lens too! 'Pink' moon: A full moon rises over the skyline of New York next to One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, as seen from the Eagle Rock Reservation in West Orange . Why does the moon look orange or pink? This is because the light from the moon passes through a thick layer of atmosphere which refracts the sunlight reflecting off of the moon as it is rising. This combined with air pollution provides its distinct colour . Moonlighting: People watch the full moon as it rises over the skyline of New York City near 42nd Street as seen across the Hudson River in Weehawken . A supernatural delight: The moon appears to be as bright as some of the tallest buildings and busiest parts of New York City.

Thomas Jordan, the president of the Swiss National Bank, has revealed that 70 per cent of the country’s gold was stored in Switzerland, 20 per cent with the Bank of England and 10 per cent with the Bank of Canada. The president of the Swiss National Bank has revealed 20 per cent of the country's gold is stored in the Bank of England . Since the Second World War and the Cold War, several central banks in Europe have kept part of their gold reserves in foreign countries in case of invasion. But turbulence in financial markets in recent years has raised concern among Europeans, who see gold as a reliable store of value that a country can depend upon. Mr Jordan said he disclosed details on the reserves because ‘there has been a growing need for transparency in our population in the last few years. A week ago, the Swiss Cabinet announced the nationalist Swiss People’s Party had gathered enough signatures to force a referendum that would ban the central bank from selling off any gold reserves or storing them abroad. The party’s initiative, known as “Save Our Swiss Gold,” would go to a vote among Swiss citizens within the next few years. It would require Switzerland’s central bank to keep at least 20 per cent of its assets in gold, and all of those on Swiss soil.

A hilarious spoof of political drama ‘House of Cards’ that debuted last night at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner saw Washington big leaguers taking aim at Hollywood heavyweights with the goading hand of star Kevin Spacey. The aptly titled ‘House of Nerds’ starred Spacey in the same role he plays on the Netflix original series, that of remorseless politico Frances Underwood. Underwood is gunning for the best seats he can get at ‘Nerd Prom’ and goes to great lengths to get them in the video, reaching out to the likes of John McCain, Valerie Jarrett, and Michael Bloomberg. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Perfect match: Worlds collided in a 'House of Cards' spoof starring Kevin Spacey at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner as politicos went Hollywood . All of Hollywood’s biggest names and DC’s most powerful players watched as McCain, the former Republican presidential nominee, poked fun at host Saturday’s emcee Conan O’Brien. ‘He’s the one that got fired from 'The Tonight Show,' right?’ McCain asks. McCain also refused to sit beside former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. ‘She keeps trying to friend me on Facebook,’ the 76-year-old Arizona senator complained. Another equally unlikely, but just as funny, cameo was made by one of President Obama’s closest confidantes, Valerie Jarrett. ‘What on Earth happened,’ Jarrett asked the fake congressman. ‘You know I was supposed to sit next to Conan.’ And though he’s had his problems with the president, even New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg shows up. Reversal: Hollywood typically dogs Washington but politicos like Senator John McCain turned the tables last April 27 . Valerie Jarrett, a White House advisor, appeared in the spoof of the Netflix series, starring Kevin Spacey . ‘You can’t run for mayor again,’ Underwood counsels three-term Mayor Bloomberg. ‘That’ll put Anthony Weiner in a pickle and then he’ll tweet that pickle.’ Several other notable lawmakers show up, including House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who’s hoarding Ravens tickets, and everyone’s favorite interviewer of politicians, Charlie Rose. The first Netflix series produced just for the streaming platform created a great deal of buzz after its February 1 release. That, paired with its propensity to portray the seedier, sharkier side of politics, makes it no surprise that Beltway insiders would jump at the chance to help spoof ‘House of Cards,’ Hollywood, and themselves. And Spacey’s character closes the spoof with an appropriate greeting. ‘I hope some of you were taking notes…Mr. President, welcome to Nerd Prom.'

It is hoped the British fiver will come to be known as a 'Winston' when the note bears the image of the country's greatest wartime Prime Minister. The Bank of England has announced that Sir Winston Churchill will become the first politician of the modern era to feature on a banknote when the new design is issued in 2016. Unveiling the design at Chartwell, Churchill's former home in Kent, governor Sir Mervyn King said: 'Perhaps the note will become known as a Winston.' Scroll down for audio of speech . Honour: Great Briton Sir Winston Churchill is to appear on the new £5 note from 2016, the Bank of England has announced . His sentiments were echoed by the politician's grandson, Mid-Sussex Tory MP Nicholas Soames, who was at the ceremony along with other members of Churchill's family. Asked whether he thought the nickname would catch on, Mr Soames said: 'Of course it will. 'We are all going to go to Tesco and be . buying our groceries with Winstons, and that of course would have given . him more pleasure than anything.' The design will feature a renowned . portrait of the prime minister in defiant pose, taken by photographer . Yousuf Karsh in December 1941. Behind him is a view of the Houses of Parliament, with the hands on Big Ben showing three o'clock. Governor Sir Mervyn King made the . announcement during an event at Chartwell, Churchill's former home in . Kent, attended by members of his family. It reflects the approximate time of a statement to the House of Commons on May 13 1940 when he famously told MPs: 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.' The quote itself is also shown on the design. Hero: Sir Winston is regarded as the man who saved Britain from the clutches of Hitler's Nazi Germany . A background image shows the Nobel Prize for literature, with citation, awarded in 1953 to Churchill - who apart from being a politician was a prolific historical writer. Sir Mervyn said: 'Our banknotes acknowledge the life and work of great Britons. Sir Winston Churchill was a truly great British leader, orator and writer. Above that, he remains a hero of the entire free world. 'His energy, courage, eloquence, wit and public service are an inspiration to us all. I am proud to announce that he will appear on our next banknote.' Churchill's image replaces that of Elizabeth Fry, the philanthropist and penal reformer, who appears on current notes first issued in 2002. These will be phased out over two or three years, leaving no notes featuring the face of a famous woman - other than the Queen. The choice of Churchill reflects the fact that, though a political figure, he is widely revered across the spectrum as the man who saved Britain in its darkest hour from the fearful advance of Nazism across Europe. Another war hero, the Duke of Wellington, is the only other prime minister to have featured on a banknote image - the old £5 phased out in the 1990s. Churchill had a long parliamentary career during which he served as home secretary and chancellor before a spell in the political wilderness in the 1930s when he warned of the increasing threat of German rearmament. Honour: In front of a portrait of the great man at his Chartwell home in Kent, Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England hands the design to Lady Soames, the only surviving child of Sir Winston . In May 1940, he replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister in the newly-formed National Government. His leadership and brilliant oratory were credited with helping to steer Britain to victory. After war broke out Sir Winston Churchill became Prime Minister, replacing . Neville Chamberlain and leading the newly-formed National Government. As the country faced 'an ordeal of the most grievous kind', the 'British Bulldog', as the . Russians called him, stood up in the Commons on May 13 1940 and gave one of his most . famous speeches, declaring: 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, . tears and sweat'. These were the same words he had used when he met his cabinet for the first time earlier that day. He concluded with: 'Come then, let us go forward together with our . united strength.' Both are examples of the brilliance of his oratory. Winston Churchill became a patriotic icon, exemplar of leadership and a . national inspiration during the Second World War. Defeated in the . post-victory 1945 general election, he argued strongly for Western unity . against the threat of Communism. He was returned to office in 1951 and . finally retired in 1955, aged 80. Aged 90, he died on the morning of Sunday January 24, 1965. Defeated by Labour in the 1945 general election, he served again as prime minister from 1951 to 1955, when he retired aged 80. Churchill died in 1965 and was given a full state funeral, the first commoner to receive such an honour since Gladstone in 1898. He was also the first commoner to feature on a British coin - the 1965 crown or five-shilling piece. Speaking in the grounds of Chartwell, Sir Winston's grandson, Mid Sussex Tory MP Nicholas Soames, said featuring on a bank note would have given the former wartime prime minister great pleasure. He said: 'He was an extraordinary man and his ability to capture the mood and the people's mood was one of his great gifts as a statesman. 'The design of the bank note, the quotation and the whole idea behind it is so appropriate and fitting, and my grandfather would have been truly very proud.' Asked why it had taken so long for Sir Winston to feature on a bank note, Mr King said he is the most recent figure to appear on any note. He said: 'Normally we allow a much longer period of time to elapse before we are willing to make a judgment. 'I think Churchill is a very obvious figure and I was very proud, as one of my last acts as governor, to put him on a bank note. 'We don't put many figures on. 'The first historical figure to appear on a bank note was only in 1970. 'We have only had 15 since so there are not many opportunities to make this decision and Churchill is only the second figure from the 20th Century.'","Great Prime Minister is the first politician of modern era to receive honour .

Inquiry: Dan Halloran faces inquiry on charges he slept with an employee as a city councilman . A New York City councilman who was already charged this month in a plot to rig the city’s mayoral race can now say bad has gone to worse after his second young office mistress was exposed Monday. 41-year-old Dan Halloran, a married conservative Republican from Queens and America’s first openly religious pagan elected to office, was led from his home April 2 by FBI agents as a young woman stood by, covering her face. It has now been revealed in a New York Post report that woman is his former intern, 23-year-old Denise Batista. Batista has since given up the gig but still held the position when she and the councilman first began their relationship. ‘The council takes sexual harassment and . discrimination very seriously,’ Council Speaker Christine Quinn’s . spokesman Jamie McShane told the Post. ‘Speaker Quinn will immediately . refer [this] to the council’s Standards and Ethics Committee.’ And Batista isn’t the only young staffer with whom Halloran has been accused of spending extracurricular time. After his corruption charges this . month, the Post reported that between 2010-2011, Halloran had an affair . with his former deputy chief of staff Meaghan Mapes. Princely: Halloran, center, is the country's first openly religious pagan elected to such a high-profile office and serves as 'First Atheling' or prince, of his sect . First affair? The New York Post reported in April on Halloran's (left) alleged affair with former staffer, then 21-year-old Meaghan Mapes (right) in 2010 . While . then 21-year-old Mapes was a student at St. Johns College, her roommate told the Post, Halloran would sneak in through a side door and sleep . over ‘about twice a week.’ ‘He’s not attractive,’ said the . roommate. ‘He was constantly around. It was really annoying. Thank God . he never came out with his shirt off.’ By early 2011, Halloran would be locked in divorce proceedings with wife Cynthia. But philandering might be one of Halloran’s more mundane habits. Born . into a typical Irish Catholic family, it was reported during his . initial run for city council that Halloran had converted to Paganism in . the 1980s. Arrested: Seen here leaving a New York courthouse, Halloran was arrested April 2 by the FBI on charges he tried to bribe election officials . Halloran is prince, or ‘First . Atheling,’ of a group he formed in 2002 with the official name  ‘New . Normannii Reik of Theodish Belief’ according to a 2009 Village Voice piece, published after Halloran won the Queens District 19 seat. That’s at least the third of his . Pagan tribal affiliations. Halloran left his previous tribe, itself a . splinter group of his first, to start the ‘Normanii Reik.’ Nick Ritter, an affiliate from Halloran’s first tribe, told the Post April 6 that Halloran once received corporal punishment for an undisclosed act against a female ‘thrall,’ or underling. ‘He was given a choice,’ Ritter said. ‘He was going to leave Theodism or stay and pay the piper.’ Paying . the piper, it turned out, was a public flogging. Halloran was allegedly . stripped, tied to a tree, and struck with a belt 11 times. Powerful: Halloran, 41, front center, converted from Catholicism to Paganism in the 1980s and has risen in the religions ranks since . Halloran’s arrest, along with that of State Senator Malcolm Smith, came after charges the two men were trying to bribe state officials with thousands of dollars to allow Smith, a Democrat, to run for New York City mayor on the Republican ticket. The change of party was likely an attempt to give Smith an advantage in a field of five other democrats. Halloran allegedly told one of his cronies, 'Money is what greases the wheels. Good, bad or indifferent. That's politics. It's all about how much, and that's our politicians in New York. They're all like that. You can't do anything without the f---ing .' Smith and Halloran have both pled not guilty to the bribery charges. Meanwhile, Halloran has yet to deny his affair with Batista and, according to the Post, has even posted pictures of her to Facebook, where he’s changed his relationship from ‘It’s complicated’ to ‘In a relationship.’ As recently as Friday, the two were seen riding together in Halloran’s Jaguar. Halloran has indicated no intention to resign from city council. If convicted on the bribery charge, he could face up to 45 years in prison .

The troops removed a Union Jack from the £10,000 stone monument as dozens of friends and relatives gathered in Wells, Somerset. Mr Patch - Britain's last fighting Tommy - died in 2009 aged 111 having fought in the battle of Passchendaele in 1917. The moving ceremony yards from Wells Cathedral finished with a rendition of The Band and Bugles of the 6th Rifles, the successors to Mr Patch’s regiment. Tribute: Rifleman Benjamin Cox from 6 Rifles (second right) with local cadets, stand by the memorial to First World War veteran Harry Patch during a ceremony today . Alan Williams from Shepton Mallet, a friend of Mr Patch's, launched the bid for the memorial made from Doulting Stone earlier this year. 'Being Doulting Stone - the west facade of the cathedral is Doulting Stone so it works well together,' Mr Williams told the BBC ahead of the ceremony. 'It'll be recessed with a beautiful piece of Welsh slate, with some carefully chosen words - 217 letters in total. 'The letters cover Harry Patch as the spokesman for the lost generation, which is also very important.' Unveiling: The troops remove a Union Jack from the £10,000 memorial which is made from Doulting Stone . Proud: The memorial was built almost three years after Mr Patch died at a nearby nursing home having lived to become the last survivor of WWI . Honour: Friends and relatives gather on Museum Lawn in Wells and listen to a speech dedicated to Mr Patch after the unveiling of the stone . Mr Patch, who served with the 7th Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry, lost his three best friends at Passchendaele and did not talk about the war to anyone for 80 years. But as the numbers of veterans dwindled he became sought after by historians and the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal used him as a figurehead for the war. Mr Patch's memoirs - The Last Fighting Tommy - became  an instant hit for their revealing account of the Great War. His funeral at Wells Cathedral in 2009 was attended by Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall and other prominent politicians. He was the last living veteran of any nationality who served in the trenches and was also for a brief time Europe's oldest man before his death. Thousands lined the streets of his home town,in pouring rain rain to pay their respects to the soldier who came to be a reminder of unimaginable carnage. Mr Patch is honoured with a degree of Master of the Arts at Bristol University in 2005. Right, wearing medals including the Order of the Knight of Leopold on his 110th birthday celebrations . Friends in high places: Mr Patch, formerly of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, meets former Prime Minister Tony Blair inside Downing Street in 2006 . Veterans: Mr Patch leads a parade through the streets of Wells, Somerset, after a memorial service in 2008 . Bells rang from the cathedral at 11am - chiming 111 times, one for every single year of Mr Patch's life. Shortly afterwards, the funeral cortege left Fletcher House, the care home where he spent his last 13 years. Camilla had arrived shortly before the service began, wearing a hat and clutching an umbrella and joined Veterans Minister Kevan Jones and army chief General Sir Richard Dannatt. An array of soldiers from the nations who fought in the Great War marched together as the hearse was led by two mounted policeman on the veteran's final, sombre journey. Close friend Jim Ross, who gave the eulogy, said: 'Harry knew that by speaking out, the memories would come back, the demons I call them, would come back to torment and torture him.' He told the congregation: 'I believe . they did, but I believe Harry made the decision because he wanted to get . his message broadcast. His prime message is that we should settle . disputes by negotiation and compromise, not by war.' He . added: 'We are the ordinary ones. Harry was the extraordinary man. The . plumber from Coombe Down who showed us true heroism. Now at long, long . last Harry, you can rest in peace.' Born . in 1898, Mr Patch was the son of a master builder from a village near . Bath. He became an apprentice plumber but in 1916 was conscripted into . the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry at the age of 18. Death: The coffin of Mr Patch, the last fighting 'Tommy' is carried out of Wells Cathedral , Somerset by soldiers from the 1st Battalion The Rifles in 2009 . Conflict: Soldiers carry a fallen troop at the battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Mr Patch was at the bloody battle and saw three of his best friends die . He was an assistant gunner in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and within six months, he was on the front line. Mr Patch fought in the battle of Passchendaele in 1917 where more than 70,000 died. 'If any man tells you he went over the top and he wasn't scared, he's a damn liar,' he once said. As a machine-gunner, it was Mr Patch's terrifying job to carry and assemble the spare parts of the gun and make sure it worked. A shrapnel wound in 1917 ended his war and he was so traumatised that he would refuse to talk about his experiences until the final years of his life. Finally, in the late 90s, when he had already turned 100, he opened up and from then on did his best to keep the memory of his former comrades alive. He told a documentary in 2003: 'Any one of them could have been me. Millions of men came to fight in this war and I find it incredible that I am the only one left.' He returned to plumbing after the war and married three times. With his first wife, he had two sons, Dennis and Roy, who he outlived. By World War II, he was too old to serve and instead became a maintenance manager at a U.S. army camp and joined the Auxiliary Fire Service, tackling fires started by German bombs. He moved into a home in 1996, aged 98. It was not until he was 105 that he went back to Ypres. He then returned a year later to meet a German veteran. When he died, he had been planning another trip back to Flanders for later this year such was his determination for people never to forget the sacrifices made. An unlikely tribute from rock bank Radiohead has already been paid - the group has written a song in Mr Patch's honour using his own words. Singer Thom Yorke was moved to write it by an interview the veteran gave in 2005, when he declared: 'Irrespective of the uniforms we wore, we were all victims.' The composition's haunting words declare: 'I am the only one that got through, the others died where ever they fell' and 'I've seen hell upon this earth'.","Harry Patch died in July 2009 aged 111 - the last surviving WWI veteran .

Every winter, flocks of bald eagles gather along the Great Salt Lake, where there is plenty of carp to eat in freshwater bays. It’s not unusual for the eagles to fight over their food. Sometimes they will even go to war over one big fish even though there are others close by. The sky tussle was snapped in Farmington Bay, near Salt Lake City, Utah, which is a magnet for eagles in the US.

New York City's plummeting murder rate may have increased the average life expectancy for residents of the Big Apple has risen, and the NYPD is crediting it to their controversial stop-and-frisk policy. The life expectancy of New Yorkers was listed at 81 in 2010 compared to 78 a decade ago, according to a report from the city's Health Department. There are other reasons for the increased longevity besides less crime. The report credits two-thirds of the boost in life expectancy to a reduction in heart disease and cancer rates. Law enforcement advocates claim New York City's controversial stop-and-frisk policy has worked so well it's raised the life expectancy for New Yorkers . It also attributes 11 per cent of the increase to better treatment for residents living with AIDS/HIV. However, the report agrees that the murder rate's decline is contributing as much as 2 per cent to the change. Last year there were 419 homicides in New York City, compared to 536 in 2010 and 673 in 2000. The city's overall death rate dropped from 7.4 per cent in 2002, which saw the deaths of 59,651 people, to 6.4 per cent in 2010, when 52,575 people died. While every ethnic group benefits from the bump, the greatest increase is among the city's black residents, who got another 3.8 years. Whites were given 3.2 years more while Hispanics were given an extra 2.2 years. The murder rate for blacks is highest among ethnic groups at 16.8 per 100,000. Those figures are triple . that of Hispanics and eight times the rate among whites. When asked about the connection between the homicide rate and increased life spans by the New York Post, Health Department spokesman Sam Miller agreed that one had affected the other. 'Yes, it has,' he said. A health department report indicated the lowered homicide rate was responsible for 2 per cent of the boom in longevity . Law-enforcement called the numbers a special case. 'Wow. That’s amazing. Normally life-span increases are due to medical . advances — not law-enforcement advances,' said City Council Public . Safety Committee Chairman Peter Vallone Jr. The stop-and-frisk policy has been under fire recently, with critics claiming it is simply a tool for the city's police to target and harass minorities. The NYPD is in the midst of fighting a federal class-action lawsuit from the New York Civil Liberties Union alleging the the practice of stopping a person who an officer suspects has committed a crime, is committing a crime or is about . to commit one, is unconstitutional. The NYCL alleged that while black and Latino men ages 14 to 24 make up only 4.7 per cent of the city's population, they accounted for 41 per cent of stop-and-frisk cases in 2011. In testimony earlier this month, former NYPD Chief Joseph Esposito said no resident had ever criticized the program, The Huffington Post reported. 'I don't get a complaint from a civilian,' he said. 'I've heard it from Al Sharpton's group.' But an audio recording made public as part of the suit revealed a commanding officer ordering cops to stop 'male blacks.' The recording was made in secret in February by Officer Pedro Serrano in the 40th Precinct station house in the South Bronx and played for jurors. Serrano captured a heated argument with his commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Christopher McCormack. In audio released during a jury trial, a commanding NYPD officer can be heard demanding that 'black males' be subjected to stop-and-frisks as they're the ones 'causing trouble' In the tape, McCormack lambasts Serrano for not stopping enough people and insists that he has a duty to prevent violent crime by frisking 'the right people at the right time, the right . location.' After being pressed as to who the 'right people' were, McCormack explained that they were the ones causing the most problems, Gothamist reports. Finally, he specifies exactly who he means. 'The problem was, what, male blacks. And I . told you at roll call, and I have no problem telling you this, male . blacks 14 to 20, 21,' McCormack can be heard to say on the tape. Since Bloomberg took office the number of people subjected to stop-and-frisks has increased more than five times over. 531,000 were stopped-and-frisked last year.","New Yorker life expectancy up to 81 in 2010 compared to 78 a decade ago .

One in three drivers have had a crash or near miss because of baffling road signs on UK streets. New research out yesterday revealed that a majority of British motorists do not understand the road signs they come across on a daily basis. Further to this, over three-quarters - 76 per cent - of Brits think that distraction caused by road signs can be dangerous and nearly half - 46 per cent - have been distracted by road signs while driving. Confusing: One in three drivers have been involved in a crash or had a near miss because of baffling road signs . Of those who have had a crash or near miss after failing to understand a road sign, more than four in five - 81 per cent - had to fork out up to £600 on accident repairs. The Department of Transport has admitted that Britain has 9,000 redundant or misleading road signs which need to be revised. Four out of five - 82 per cent - Brits agree with the Government’s plans, with over 40 per cent believing that the public should vote for which signs are reviewed. Nearly a quarter  - 23 per cent - of . Brits feel that road signs aren’t useful, and more than half - 52 per . cent - would feel confident enough driving without signs. Alarming: Almost half of drivers admit to being distracted by road signs while behind the wheel . Research among 2,000 drivers by comparison website Confused.com, found 93 per cent were confused by the red circle on white background sign meaning no vehicles except bikes. More than eight in 10 - 83 per cent- did not understand yellow and black urban clearway signs, which mean no stopping between set times. Nearly seven in 10 - 67 per cent - did not understand the red and blue circle which means no waiting. Six in 10 - 61 per cent - failed to know the meaning of a red circle with a motorcyle and car inside, which means no motor vehicles allowed. And one in two drivers - 51 per cent - could not understand a sign which points out appropriate lanes at a junction ahead. The Department for Transport is currently revising its ‘Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions’, for implementation in 2014. Gareth Kloet, head of car insurance at Confused.com, said: 'Our research suggests that many accidents are actually caused by redundant or perplexing road signs. 'It is clear that the government needs to do a better job in educating people on what road signs mean in order to improve road safety. Any accidents caused because of distracting road signs will affect car insurance premiums, which will in turn cost the consumer more money.' In order to voice the public’s opinion on road signs, Confused.com is running an online petition where people can vote for which road signs should be revised via http://www.confused.com/car-insurance/confusing-road-signs. Any road sign which receives more than 5,000 votes will be petitioned to the government.
