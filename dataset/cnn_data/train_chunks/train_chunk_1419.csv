"A vengeful former employee who leaked sandwich franchise Subway’s secret recipes in a suspected $35 million extortion attempt has avoided all criminal charges and a potential multimillion dollar compensation pay out. The Victorian Supreme Court found the accused, Melbourne man Arun Singhal, responsible for uploading videos online in August which revealed the franchise’s recipes, known within the company as ‘The System’. Subway had accused Singhal of intending to destroy the company’s reputation and commercial viability for his own profit with his smear campaign, according to Sydney Morning Herald. The 31-year-old self-titled ‘entrepreneur maintained that he was being unfairly targeted by company, who he refers to as the ‘sandwich mafia’. However, despite the Supreme Court ordering Singhal to pay damages to the company Subway has chosen not to continue with its compensation claim. Singhal was hired in January 2014 to run Subway’s Oakleigh store in Victoria as a franchisee. However his contract was terminated on April 28 due to ‘breaches’, understood to be disagreements regarding the operation of the business. In court documents, the global corporation alleged that 31-year-old Singhal sent an email in May demanding $35 million from the company for his ‘silence’. He threatened to release the ‘The System’ online, filmed with his running commentary, to expose what he claimed are the company’s ‘shocking’ and misleading marketing tactics. Following the threat, Subway was granted an emergency restraining order against Mr Singhal by the Victorian Supreme Court which prohibited certain information from being released. Despite the injunction a website was set live, titled ‘Faith Killer Subway’ and videos were distributed. Melbourne man Arun Singhal, responsible for uploading videos online in August which revealed the franchise’s recipes, known within the company as ‘The System’ Mr Singhal vehemently denies releasing the information and any plot to blackmail Subway and claims he is the victim of the 'Sandwich Mafia'. Last year, he told Daily Mail Australia that he was forced to declare bankruptcy after the company allegedly duped him into closing his store by promising could open a new one elsewhere. No new store became available. 'After they took my authorisation to close the store and I closed the store, then they completely changed their words,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was told that they don't have any new location right now and I might have to wait for two to three years for a new location.' He blames what he calls ‘Subway's as usual deceptive behaviour'. 'Here a family man lost $350,000 in Subway's investment. They left me with no option then to declare bankruptcy. I told the ""Sandwich Mafia"" that if you don't compensate me for the loss of business, I am going to media to tell everyone about my story (sic).' A spokesman for Subway told SMH that they are pleased with the result. 'We were forced to take action against this former franchisee after he attempted to extort money from the company for his own gain,' he said. 'That is unacceptable to the company and to the dedicated franchisees that are in their restaurants every day servicing customers and working to build their businesses.'","Former Melbourne franchisee Arun Singhal created videos revealing the sandwich giant Subway's secret recipes .

"He was arguably the most recognisable face of the cult classic Star Trek film series. So when Leonard Nimoy died at his Bel Air, Los Angeles home on Friday, aged 83, following a long battle with lung disease on Friday, the outpouring of grief was constant. And so it is only right we take a look at some of his best moments as Mr Spock in Star Trek. William Shatner (pictured left as Captain Kirk in the original series) paid an emotional tribute to former Star Trek co-star and friend Nimoy (right), saying he 'loved him like a brother' Although Leonard Nimoy followed his 1966-69 Star Trek run with a notable career as both an actor and director, in the public's mind he would always be Spock. He earned three Emmy Awards for the role, meaning he could land almost any television or movie role he wanted. But Nimoy's ambivalence to the role was reflected in the titles of his two autobiographies, 'I Am Not Spock' (1975) and 'I Am Spock' (1995). His half-human, half-Vulcan character was the calm counterpoint to William Shatner's often-emotional Captain Kirk on one of television and film's most revered cult series. Nimoy, pictured with his wife Susan in October told fans to 'live long and prosper' in his final tweet posted on Monday . Despite his struggle, the actor maintained his connected to his fans right up until his death, urging them to support the franchise . Nimoy, who was first cast in the role in 1966, suffered from COPD - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - and was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center after a 911 call on February 19. But he suffered from COPD - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - and was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center after a 911 call on February 19. Nimoy, a Boston native, had been in and out of hospitals multiple times over recent months, following his announcement that he suffered from the potentially fatal lung disease. Message: Nimoy, pictured with his wife Susan in October, had been in and out of hospital for months receiving treatment for the illness . He took to Twitter in 2014 to share his diagnosis, and gave his followers some advice, saying: 'I quit smoking 30 years ago. Not soon enough. I have COPD. Grandpa says, quit now!! LLAP [Live Long and Prosper]'. On January 28, his declining health became increasingly evident when he was pictured being whisked through a New York airport in a wheelchair following a trip to the Caribbean. He was first cast in the role in 1966 and starred in the series until 1969. He then appeared in eight subsequent feature films and a number of spin-offs .

"As nasty as the polar vortex was, it made for some spectacular sights. One of the best was the hundreds of beach ball-sized ice boulders that washed up on the shores of Lake Michigan. The incredible winter phenomenon, which was captured by many YouTube videos, takes place when the water temperature falls to just below freezing. Scroll down for video . Wow: Hundreds of beach ball-sized ice boulders washed up on the shores of Lake Michigan this week . According to park ranger Annie Lipscomb, the balls, weighing up to 75 pounds, form when chunks of ice break off the large sheets of ice on the lake. The motion of the waves then smooth and round the edges of the ice, molding it into spheres similar to how stones are shaped, Lipscomb added to mlive.com. AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Jim Andrews added: 'It's possible that the ice is accreting like a snowball or like a hailstone, and that they keep growing.' Ice formations: According to park ranger Annie Lipscomb, the balls, weighing up to 75 pounds, form when chunks of ice break off the large sheets of ice on the lake . The wind pushes the boulders to the shore and they don't sink because solid ice is less dense than liquid water. The result somewhat resembles a giant bowl of Cocoa Puffs along the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and has drawn the attention of photographers and tourists alike. And while the process does require extremely chilly conditions, it's definitely not the first time such ice balls have appeared, Andrews said. s . Suttons Bay photographer Ken Scott knows this well. He told mlive.com that he was seen the boulders appear periodically for years, and loves to brave the wintry weather to capture them. This year was no different. He pulled on his warmest wear and hiked a half-mile from the road to where he had a good view. Unsurprisingly, he had the whole shore to himself following the storms brought on by the polar vortex. 'That's when some of the best shows are,' he said. In warmer weather: While the ice balls are not uncommon in specific weather, Lake Michigan generally looks like this . A Coast Guard helicopter flies along the Hudson River in New York, which is full of ice floes, on Thursday . Go with the floe: A ferry makes its way through the ice on the Hudson . The recent cold spell was caused by a polar vortex descending from the Arctic . America has finally begun to warm up after being in the icy grip of the polar vortex. But the chilling news doesn't stop, because it's estimated that the extreme cold weather has cost the U.S economy about $5billion. It brought about the biggest economic disruption delivered by the weather since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, said Evan Gold, senior vice president at Planalytics, a business weather intelligence company in suburban Philadelphia. While the impact came nowhere close to Sandy, which caused an estimated $65 billion in property damage alone, the deep freeze's impact came from its breadth. A barge makes its way up the icy Mississippi River on the St. Louis riverfront on Wednesday . Barging through: A boat makes its way up the icy Mississippi River past St. Louis' Gateway Arch . The barges on the Mississippi River have to muscle their way through the ice . 'There's a lot of economic activity that didn't happen,' Gold said. 'Some of that will be made up but some of it just gets lost.' Still, Gold noted his $5 billion estimate pales in comparison with an annual gross domestic product of about $15 trillion - working out to maybe one-seventh to one-eighth of one day's production for the entire country. 'It's a small fraction of a percent, but it's still an impact,' Gold said. According to the weather database, America is experiencing far fewer extreme cold spells than it used to. An Associated Press analysis of daily national winter temperature - averaged into one figure for the Lower 48 states - shows that since 1900 cold extremes like this week's happen about once every four years. Until recently. Government meteorologist Greg Carbin created a database of the winter daily national temperature average going back to 1900. And Monday was the first time since 1979 that the national average temperature dropped below 18 degrees. In 27 distinct cold snaps over 115 years, that's by far the longest the U.S. has gone without getting this frigid.","The balls, weighing up to 75 pounds, form when chunks of ice break off the large sheets of ice on the lake .

"Life can be exhausting for new mothers, especially those with several mouths to feed. After welcoming two pups to the world, new meerkat mum Akili, from Werribee Open Ranges Zoo in Victoria, was left a little tired. Footage from the zoo's 'burrow cam' shows the sleepy mum falling asleep in quite a dramatic fashion, toppling over from sheer exhaustion after a long day of looking after the lively pair. The young meerkats, who were welcomed to the world in mid-January, are now six weeks old and very used to feeding while their mum sleeps. New meerkat mum Akili, from Werribee Open Ranges Zoo in Victoria, was left a little tired from feeding . The young meerkats, who were welcomed to the world in mid-January, are now six weeks old . The underground video camera allows Werribee's zoo keepers to carefully monitor the new additions, who generally spend the first few weeks of their life in the burrow. As their sight and hearing develops, they start to explore their surroundings before venturing out of their home into the open plan zoo enclosure. When the pups were first born, Akili reportedly spent a few sleepless nights making sure her babies were well fed, but soon leant how to sleep through the process. 'As the days went on [Akili] became more relaxed and mum very quickly perfected the skill of being able to sleep and nurse at the same time,' Denny Burgoyen, a zookeeper at Werribee. The underground video camera allows Werribee's zoo keepers to carefully monitor the new additions . In the footage, taken two days after the pups were born, Akili falls fast asleep while the pups are suckling . In the footage, taken two days after the pups were born, the new mum falls fast asleep while the pups are suckling and even the impact of the fall doesn't wake up the exhausted meerkat. The zoo has reported that the pups are growing well and that Akili has recieved lots of support from the other meerkats in the enclosure. The pups will be named once their gender has been identified by zoo keepers, which is still a few weeks away. 'The pups are a lot more confident and are now often spotted playing together in the sand,' Ms Burgoyne said. The pups will be named once their gender has been identified by zoo keepers .

'It’s quite incredible to see how the adults work together as a team, with each taking turns as sentry to watch over them.' Out in the wild, meerkats will live in clans of between ten and 20, and are native to countries in the south west of Africa. A female leader is in charge of each smaller family unit, and the animals spend a large part of their day foraging for food, including beetles, flies, spiders, crickets, and moths.","New meerkat mum Akili was feeding her pups at Werribee Zoo in Victoria .

"When people move house they often refer to ‘entering a new chapter of their lives’ or ‘turning a new leaf’. For Jim and Maureen Franks, either expression couldn’t be more apt, as the couple are now leaving a former library they have lived in for almost 40 years. And it’s not just any old library. Fitzroy House, their Victorian Gothic revival home, was built by the most eminent and fashionable architect of the time, Sir George Gilbert Scott, the man who also created the Albert Memorial, the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras Station and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, all in London. He was commissioned to build the memorial library for Lewes MP Henry Fitzroy by his widow Hannah in 1862, and it was used by the town until 1958 and later turned into offices. Striking: The Victorial Gothic revival property's clock tower, right, and left, the large octagonal atrium . It then faced demolition in the 1970s before locals moved to preserve the building, and quantity surveyor Jim Franks saw an opportunity to save the structure while turning it into his family home. But now, in their mid to late 80s, the pair are finding the huge, 2,800 sq ft two-storey home right in the centre of the historic town of Lewes, East Sussex, just a little too much to cope with, and are looking to downsize while staying in the town. Fitzroy House is on the market for offers in excess of £1 million. ‘It was extraordinarily run-down and had been empty for six or seven years,’ says the Frankses’ daughter, Eleanor Austin. With her brother and family friends, she helped her parents with the extensive restoration, which was to take five years after they bought it in 1976. Sir George Gilbert Scott was commissioned to build Fitzroy House in 1862. Pictured, the octagonal atrium . ‘There was a tree growing in the area that is now the atrium. My father had to design the new roof and decided on an octagonal glass one that floods the atrium with light. Indeed, we’ve always considered it as our internal garden,’ says Eleanor, a teacher, whose former husband did much of the carpentry work on the renovation. Creator: Architect Sir George Gilbert Scott . The room she’s referring to is the magnificent 36ft-high octagonal reception room, which has a stunning balcony running around it on the first floor, and a large fish pond as its centrepiece on the ground floor. ‘Yes, that created a lot of debate within the family,’ says Eleanor. ‘Some of us wanted it to be a small swimming pool but my father won that one. But lots of our children have ended up in it anyway, so I suppose it’s doubled up in its use.’ Eleanor’s father kept a weekly diary of his work restoring the library, which he sent to his daughter while she was away at university, and later wrote a book about his work, Building And Saving Fitzroy Library, which is published by Pomegranate Press. The flexible layout could accommodate four bedrooms. There’s an L-shaped kitchen/diner, four bathrooms, a large first-floor lounge, and various snugs, nooks and crannies, as well as a clock tower and a fabulous 18ft-high entrance hall with original vaulted ceiling, pillars and tessellated tiled floor. ‘That’s my favourite place,’ says Eleanor, who also lives in Lewes. ‘The ceiling is incredible.’ The house is at the heart of Lewes, on the river Ouse and now part of the South Downs National Park. The town’s world-famous bonfire celebrations happen right outside the front door, with the various societies parading by every November 5. ‘That has always been one of the highlights of the year and we have a lot of friends then,’ laughs Eleanor.

Unique features Former library built by Sir George Gilbert Scott, octagonal atrium with balcony and fish pond, clock tower with bell . ‘And it goes on very late, so that was always a party night, but, because of its size and where it is, the house has always been a big party venue.’ A bookshelf, two tables and two librarian stools are all that’s left of the original library, and now the property is ripe for another renovation as it’s in need of updating. ‘It’s a real one-off,’ says Eleanor. ‘We’ve made it a family tradition to visit other George Gilbert Scott buildings to see what else he created, and we’ve found our tiles and some wrought iron work and certain colours he used at his more well-known buildings at our home, and that has made it very special. ‘But now it’s time for someone else to put their mark on what is one of the landmark buildings in the town.’ Graves Son & Pilcher, 01273 321123 .","Sir George Gilbert Scott was commissioned to build Fitzroy House in 1862 .

"The mother of a missing newborn found dead earlier this week has been charged with murder. Yolo County sheriff’s deputies discovered 20-day-old Justice Rees near wetlands along the Sacramento River in Knights Landing, California on Wednesday after a night of searching following a call from the boy's mother Samantha Green, who reported him missing and claimed the two had been abducted. Now, Green, who was found in wetlands nearby bruised and crying, has been charged with murder and was picked up Saturday at around noon by authorities. Saddening: Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (left) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and his mother, Samantha Green (right), 23, were reported missing . Green was arrested around noon on Saturday and charged with murder . The charges against Green were announced by Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto at a news conference, according to the Los Angeles Times. He did not give any information as to why they decided to charge Green, but did say that authorities were not able to substantiate claims that she had been abused. 'At this point here, we don’t have anyone else that was involved,' said Prieto. 'No stone was left unturned.' News 10 reported that Ricardo Villaseñor came upon Green shortly after that call, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough. Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' said Villaseñor. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby was dead, having frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know the exact location of Justice, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Police arrived around 5:30pm and found her 2011 Chevy Tanverse on the other side of the slough, separated from where the mother was by trees and brush. Sheriff's deputies launched a search that lasted through the night and into the morning, combing water and vegetation before finally finding Justice's remains shortly before 10am Wednesday. Scene: Search crews looking through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours through the night before finding Justice's body in the brush . Scene: Investigators flagged the spot where Justice was found by search crews . A spokesman for the sheriff's and coroner's office Captain Larry Cecchettini said the boy was 'located in a thicket of brush right off the slough.' The plan was for officers 'to cut a path to get in there to remove the body,' according to Cecchettini, his voice faltering in his announcement. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and has since been released. Green's father, Randy, told the Sacramento Bee that he'd spoken to her last on Saturday before she was planning to bring Justice to the house for a visit. Randy Green said that his daughter did not show up that day, and on Monday her mother and her sister reported her and the baby missing. Mother: Green had given birth to Justice only 20 days before she turned up next to the slough, crying and seeming disoriented . Family: Justice's grandfather said the boy's parents, Green and Frank Rees (right), were loving and fussed over the little baby . Loss: The grandfather, Bill Rees, also said that he was having a hard time believing Justice was dead, as his house - where Justice had been living with his parents - was filled with baby clothes and a bassinet . On Tuesday, Justice's father, Frank Rees posted on Facebook begging Green to come home with the baby. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' After police identified the body as Justice on Wednesday, the family of the little boy mourned, still in disbelief. 'They loved baby Justice,' said paternal grandfather Bill, whom Justice and his parents had been living with in Woodland. 'Frank just loved to carry him around at night when he was, he was fussing. Samantha, gosh, I understand she's crushed.' 'It's like it's not real for me, it's like I can't imagine you know,' Rees added. 'This whole house is full of baby clothes, bassinet, all that stuff.'","Samantha Green, the mother of  20-day-old Justice Rees who was found dead in a swamp of Wednesday, has been charged with murder .

"The final moments of Russian politician Boris Nemtsov as he walked across a Moscow bridge with his girlfriend before being shot in a 'contract hit' were caught on CCTV revealed today. The 55-year-old former deputy prime minister was gunned down on Great Moskvoretsky Bridge on Friday in a 'politically motivated' attack which has sparked outrage and public mourning. Footage of the killing has surfaced, with Russian media reports claiming the killer emerged on foot after loitering on the bridge waiting for Mr Nemtsov. A clip purports to show the killer appear moments after Mr Nemtsov and Anna Duritskaya walk along the bridge which overlooks St Basil's Cathedral. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage of the moment Boris Nemtsov was murdered on Great Moskvoretsky Bridge has emerged, with Russian media reporting his killer was driven away in a getaway car (above) after appearing on foot . Mr Nemtsov, 55, (right) had been out for dinner with his Ukranian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23, (left) when he was shot in front of her on Friday night . He appears to get into a passing car shortly before midnight. Mr Nemtsov's bullet-ridden body was removed from the scene hours later. It comes after a spokesman for Vladimir Putin said on Saturday the shootings had 'all the hallmarks of a contract hit'. Critics have attributed blame for the murder to the Russian President, claiming his government feared that an incriminating report Mr Nemtsov had been working on would be made public. The findings are said to present evidence linking Putin's regime to the Ukrainian crisis which has seen thousands slaughtered. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fingered the Russian leader as the culprit of Mr Nemtsov's death, with mourners at the scene where he was shot also alluding to his murder as having been politically engineered. Placards reading 'Je suis Boris' and 'We are all Nemtsov' in Russian were among mounds of flowers with critics likening the father of two's death to the murder of Charlie Hebdo journalists. A handful were killed by Islamic Extremists in January at the political magazine's Parisian office. The attack was widely described as an affront on free speech. Earlier it was claimed Mr Nemtsov was killed in a drive-by shooting with his assailants making off in a white vehicle. The footage revealed by Russian website TBU however suggests his murderer may have been waiting for him on foot before being driven off in a getaway car in a seamless, organised hit. The married politician is understood to have had dinner with his 23-year-old Ukrainian girlfriend on Friday in the hours before his death. The pair were seen walking across the bridge, just feet away from the Kremlin, before Mr Nemtsov was shot four times. The white car (pictured) that carried the assassins has reportedly been found by police not far from where the leader was murdered. Footage released on Sunday suggested his shooter may have been on foot and driven away after the killing . The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River . Mr Nemtsov was seen speaking on his mobile phone at a radio station, just hours before he was killed . Mourners laid flowers at the site on Saturday afternoon as critics of the Russian president alleged Mr Nemtsov's murder was politically motivated . Among mounds of flowers and candles left on the bridge in central Moscow are signs reading 'Je suis Boris' and 'We are all Nemtsov' in Russian claiming the 55-year-old was killed for openly criticising Putin in an attack on free speech . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (left) said he thought Mr Nemtsov was killed because of a report he had been working on which incriminated Putin (right) in the Ukrainian crisis . Ms Duritskaya was questioned by Russian police extensively following the killing having escaped unharmed. Weeks ago Mr Nemtsov told of how he feared for his life after identifying himself as a staunch critic of Putin's government. The 55-year-old said he was certain the Russian President would kill him in a February 10 interview. His 87-year-old mother warned him against publicly lambasting the leader. On Saturday she received a telegram from Putin in which he described her son's murder as 'vile and cynical'. A spokesman for the Kremlin denied it had any involvement in Mr Nemtsov's death but said it had hallmarks of a 'contract hit'. An investigating committee said it was pursuing several lines of inquiry including one which claimed the murder was designed to drum up support for an anti-government rally Mr Nemtsov was due to attend. It claimed he may have been made a martyr for the opposition party's cause, thought his has been dismissed by protesters maintaining Putin is to blame. Speaking of the report Mr Nemtsov had been working on, President Poroshenko said: 'Somebody was afraid of this, Boris wasn't afraid. Killers and executors were afraid.' Meanwhile opposition activists also blamed the Russian President for his death, claiming they were in 'no doubt' it was politically motivated. 'I have no doubt this was a political killing. The only threat to his life came from his political activity. He had no foes other than political ones.',' said Ilya Yashin. Among placards left on mounds of flowers were some reading 'je suis Boris', 'Putin killed my friend' and 'we are all Nemtsov'. World leaders have insisted on transparency as investigations into Mr Nemtsov's death continue. David Cameron described the murder as 'callous', while Ban Ki-moon said it was 'brutal.' Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55 . Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55. His 87-year-old mother Dina had a premonition that her son would be killed, according to the politician. He told earlier this month how his mother warned him: 'When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.' Nemtsov studied physics at State University of Gorky and earned a PhD in Physics and Mathematics. In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, Nemtsov organised a protest movement in his hometown, which prevented the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the region. The liberal reformer rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin and became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin. Nemtsov first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British premier Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. She praised his market reforms after visiting Nizhny Novgorod where as governor in the early 1990s he led spearheaded reforms. The father-of-four, 55, was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency.

The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. He was a prominent and vocal critic of Mr Putin and wrote a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and his inner circle to corruption.

He has written more than 60 academic publications about quantum physics, thermodynamics and acoustics and  designed n of antennas for space apparatuses. Jewish advocacy website AJC named Nemtsov as one of the most prominent Jews in Russia thanks to his mother's heritage.

"Madera (left) and owner Ed Davis in Ester, Alaska . Ed Davis never expected to see his dog alive again after she wandered off on February 6. When his pooch, a blind 11-year-old Labrador retriever named Madera, strayed from home in Ester, Alaska, a cold front had dropped the temperature to 40 degrees below zero. Madera, who is completely blind because of an autoimmune disease, usually would come right back inside when it was that cold. For some reason she stayed out and got lost, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported. Davis' wife was home at the time. When Davis returned from his job at the trans-Alaska oil pipeline on February 19, he was not hopeful about finding Madena. He said: 'My best hope was to walk those trails and look for a track that might be hers. 'My best hope was to find a frozen dog.' He never did find Madena, but another man did - and she was alive. Constantine Khrulev was on a trail about a half mile away from Davis' house with his own dog last week. Khrulev's dog was wearing a bell and when Madena heard it ring, she let out a loud whine. After venturing about 100 yards off the trail, Khrulev found Madera under a tree, a location where she 'was not going to be found accidentally', according to Davis. Madera was healthy but she did lose about 14 pounds. Davis was offering a $100 reward for Madena. Khrulev asked for the money to be given to the Fairbanks Animal Shelter Fund and Davis ended up donating $250 because he was impressed by the request.","11-year-old Labrador retriever Madera strayed from home in Ester, Alaska .

"Rising numbers of ‘massive’ babies born by caesarean section are driving Britain’s obesity epidemic, by allowing infants to thrive that would never have survived in the past, according to a controversial expert. Natural selection is being written out of the equation by the operation, claims Dr Edward Archer. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘When a mother is inactive and obese, their baby grows massive. The baby can’t get through the birth canal, and the doctor has to perform a C-section. ‘That allows both the mother and foetus to survive, when previously they would have died.’ Dr Edward Archer, pictured, wrote that obesity is hard-wired into babies while they are still in the womb . Dr Archer claimed that in the past both the obese mother and baby would have died (file photograph) His comments follow an article in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings by Dr Archer, suggesting obesity is not just a matter of genetics, or eating too much and exercising too little. Rather, it is hard-wired into the children of fat mothers while they are still in the womb. With girls of C-section mothers more likely to have caesareans themselves, the effect has snowballed over the generations, he said. ‘The evolutionary consequence is we are getting much bigger children than ever in the history of mankind.’ Caesareans account for more than one in four UK births – up from nine per cent in 1980 – with the figure continue to climb, leading to ‘sky-rocketing’ numbers of extremely obese people, Dr Archer, of the University of Alabama in the US said. Dr Daghni Rajasingam, spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, agreed women who had a higher body mass index were more likely to have caesareans. And babies born by caesarean did have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity in later life, she noted. But while there was a ‘complex association’ between the two, that did not necessarily mean cause and effect existed. And she stressed: ‘I don’t know of any obstetric data that relate being inactive in pregnancy directly to growing a big baby. Very small women who are very active can also have very big babies.’ She also emphasised that caesareans were carried out for a variety of reasons, and not just to deliver big babies.","Dr Edward Archer said C-sections remove the chance of 'natural selection'

"A man who forced a boy, 12, to hold paint buckets while standing outdoors in 90-degree heat for hours as punishment has been sentenced to life imprisonment plus 50 years. Omar Andrew Pitts, 32, of College Park, Georgia pleaded guilty on Friday to murder  in the death of his girlfriend's  brother, Jay'tavious Mahone, according to Fulton County District Attorney's Office. When paramedics arrived at the scene around 3.40pm, they tried to revive Mahone, who was also made to wear a dress and makeup, and suffered from a heat stroke outside of his home on June 17, 2010. He later died from blunt force trauma to the head while in hospital, according to a medical examiner. Pitts also pleaded guilty felony murder, child cruelty, aggravated assault and aggravated sexual battery. Omar Andrew Pitts (above), 32, of College Park, Georgia pleaded guilty on Friday to murder in the death of his girlfriend's brother, Jay'tavious Mahone, according to Fulton County District Attorney's Office . Mahone, 12, (above) was made to hold paint buckets while standing outdoors in 90-degree heat while wearing a dress and makeup for hours as punishment because he took off his shoes when he was asked not to . Mahone was reportedly being punished because he took his shoes off after being told not to, and was also kicked by Pitts after he collapsed in the sun, according to District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. During the punishment, the boy frequently complained of thirst and fatigue before he collapsed and passed out in the sun, according to the DA's office. He was then kicked several times by Pitts which left bruises and bumps all over his body, according to the AJC. Mahone's sister, Sabrina Powell (above), was also arrested following his death, and remained in Fulton County jail during Pitts' sentencing as she awaits trial . Neighbor Hakim Deen, who captured the assault on video from an upstairs window, said he saw Pitts kicking Mahone in the head. He said: 'Eight or nine times, he kicked him. The boy got up and then passed out.' Mahone was taken to the South Fulton Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. His older sister, Sabrina Powell, was also arrested following his death, remained in Fulton County jail during Pitts' sentencing as she awaits trial.","Omar Andrew Pitts, 32, of College Park, Georgia pleaded guilty on Friday to murder in the death of Jay'tavious Mahone .

"The mother of Baby P is planing to move in with a woman convicted of an appalling sex attack once both are released from jail, it was reported today. Tracey Connelly formed a close bond with Toni Hewitson while both were serving time at HMP Low Newton in Durham and would reportedly 'sneak off to each other's cells'. Despite being separated when they were moved to different prisons, they have kept in touch through letters and are hoping to set up a home together soon. Setting up a home:  The mother of Baby P, Tracey Connelly (left), is planing to move in with Toni Hewitson (right) who was jailed in 2008 for torturing a woman with learning difficulties . A prison source told The Sunday People: 'Tracey knew she would be a marked woman once she was released, and Toni and her talked about getting a place together. They make a formidable couple.' Hewitson, 39, was jailed in 2008 for torturing and sexually assaulting a woman with learning difficulties, while part of a gang of four. The victim, who was 25 at the time of the attack, was strapped to a chair, gagged, slashed and raped during the ordeal, and also had her head shoved down a toilet. She was handed an indeterminate sentence for the public's protection and was told she would serve a minimum of five-and-a-half years. Tragic: Tracey Connelly was jailed for r allowing her lover Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen to torture her 17-month-old son Peter (pictured)  to death in Haringey, North London, in 2007 . But she is now thought to be preparing for her release and believes she will be out in the next 12 months thanks to good behaviour. Connelly, 34, is thought to be awaiting a Parole Board hearing at the women's jail HMP Styal in Cheshire. She was jailed again for breaching the terms of her licence by trying to sell pornographic pictures of herself to perverts transfixed with her notoriety. Her offence came less than 18 months after she was released  following a five-year jail term for allowing her lover Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen to torture her 17-month-old son Peter to death in Haringey, North London, in 2007. Breached terms of licence: Connelly was jailed again after she was caught trying to sell pornographic pictures of herself to perverts transfixed with her notoriety. Pictured right, her ex-lover killer Steven Barker . The Mirror source added: 'Lots of the women have flings and they go from one woman to another and the ones in for sex crimes or other stomach-churning offences seem to gravitate towards each other. 'Tracey and Toni spent a lot of time together in the exercise yard and then would sneak off to each other's cells.' The source claimed that while sex between inmates is against the rules, many officers turn a blind eye to relationships within prisons.","Tracey Connelly met Toni Hewitson when both were inmates at Durham jail .

"Vicky Rockingham, 43, left, has been told that she must show her tumour is growing or else she will be denied the £4,500-a-month life-prolonging drug, with husband Adam, and sons Hector, 8, and Inigo, 11, right . Desperate cancer patients have been put in the ‘bizarre’ position of hoping their conditions deteriorate so they can get a drug that will soon be withdrawn from the NHS. A type of life-prolonging pill called regorafenib is to be denied to patients from later this month to save money – but sufferers who have already started the £4,500- a-month treatment before then will be allowed to stay on it. Mother-of-two Vicky Rockingham, 43, is one of the patients who must show her tumours are growing before March 12 if she is to be eligible for the drug. She said: ‘The drug I’m on at the moment allows me to lead a near-normal life. But it could stop working any day now.’ Her current medication, sunitinib, has been stalling the tumour’s growth, but cancer usually develops resistance to the drug over time, requiring a different prescription. Mrs Rockingham’s doctor told her she has to ‘fail’ on her current drug before the cut-off date if she is to qualify for regorafenib. Speaking from her home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, she said: ‘It feels terrible. If my tumours are growing, I will say to my consultant, “Let’s quickly apply for regorafenib.” It’s a bizarre situation.’ Regorafenib is one of 16 drugs being cut from the list of medicines available from David Cameron’s £280 million Cancer Drugs Fund for all but the most exceptional circumstances. The radical cost-cutting drive will affect thousands of patients with advanced cancer across England. Mrs Rockingham, who holds down a full-time job with the Environment Agency, suffers from a rare type of cancer known as ‘GIST’ – gastrointestinal stromal tumour. But the change will also hit those with breast, bowel and prostate cancer, as well as leukaemia and lymphoma. Studies show regorafenib could double average survival times, from about nine to 17 months. Some patients live far longer. Another GIST patient in the same situation is Richard Bassett, a 27-year-old PhD meteorology student, who also fears he is starting to become resistant to sunitinib. Mr Bassett, from Strawberry Hill in South-West London, said: ‘If sunitinib works less effectively for me, the next – and indeed only – treatment remaining is regorafenib. To find this will no longer be available through the Cancer Drugs Fund is highly stressful. ‘Living with this disease is worrying enough without having this added stress that regorafenib, which is proven to be successful for GIST treatment, will no longer be available.’ His girlfriend Victoria James, 28, added: ‘The Government seems to view people like Richard as dispensable. If his cancer starts growing after March 12, the fact that they are removing this drug will be a death sentence.’ The cuts are being made because the Cancer Drugs Fund has become a victim of its own success. Set up in 2010 with a £200 million- a-year budget, about 60,000 patients have benefited so far. But it overspent its budget by £30 million last year – in part because or more applications – but also, say critics, because it has allowed drugs firms to keep charging sky-high prices. Its budget has been raised to £280 million for this financial year and will be raised again to £340 million in April. Professor Peter Clark, chairman of the Cancer Drugs Fund, said: ‘These are difficult decisions, but if we don’t prioritise the drugs that offer the best value, many people could miss out on promising, more effective treatments that are in the pipeline.’ The cuts are being made because the Cancer Drugs Fund is so successful and costing more than expected .","Vicky Rockingham has been told she must show her cancer is growing .

"Outspoken Tasmanian Senator, Jacqui Lambie, says she 'will not be intimidated' as she receives a troubling letter threatening to behead her, unless she converts to Islam and implements Sharia law in Australia. The letter, which was received last week, has reportedly been referred to the Australian Federal Police after it was found to contain 3 images of a man being beheaded. It cautions the senator, she has now been identified as an enemy of the Islamic State Group. Scroll down for video . Senator Lambie says she 'will not be intimidated' as a personal security assessment is underway following the threats . 'By the powers invested in me by Allah, I sentence you to death,' ABC News has reported the letter says. 'I will take the honour in beheading you ... when you are least prepared; my men and I will take your office by surprise.' Senator Lambie, who's been a vocal critic of Islamic Sharia law since her debut in Australian politics, maintains she will not be intimidated by the letter and will continue to advocate for harsher penalties intended for those fighting with the Islamic State. The letter received by Senator Lambie's office on Friday along with three images of a man being beheaded . 'Obviously someone is trying to intimidate and scare me. I will not be intimidated or scared. 'I will continue to advocate for a ban on Sharia Law, unnecessary face coverings in public and tighter regulation of Halal certification fees in Australia - and to have those Australian Citizens who assist Islamic State in any way, charged with the high crimes of Sedition or Treason.' A personal security assessment is currently underway to ensure the safety of Senator Lambie following the threats. Police are currently investigating 'two lines of inquiry'. Firstly, that the letter was sent from a person opposing the erection of a mosque in Adelaide's northern suburbs, alternatively the threat may have been issued by Islamic State group members or supporters of the Sydney siege gunman, Man Haron Monis. The threat follows Senator Lambie's controversial statements about her intentions to overhaul the Australian citizenship oath and reintroduce death penalty for those accused of treason. Teenage defector Abdullah Elmir, from Bankstown in south-western Sydney, is among those who have taken up arms for terror groups and would be put to death under Senator Lambie's plan . 'It's time we adopted a much tougher approach to people who are Australian citizens and have fought or are now fighting alongside our enemies, or assisting them,' she said. 'In those cases the Australian laws are very clear. Australian citizens who take up arms against members of our ADF (Australian Defence Force) are guilty of treason.' The former Palmer United Party member's campaign comes at a controversial time with politicians, such as Abbott and Bishop, publically condemning the death sentence handed down to convicted drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaram. Australian's awaiting death: Andrew Chan (pictured right) and Myuran Sukumaram (pictured left) have been sentenced to death by firing squad despite pleas from the Australian government to spare their lives . Ms Lambie believes revoking citizenship or trying to rehabilitate ISIS fighters returning to Australia is a waste of time, and more importantly,  dangerous for the Australian public. 'Part of my solution to help defeat ISIS is to re-introduce the death penalty as a sentencing option for Australian juries who find our citizens guilty of treason,' she said, specifying the crime as taking up arms against Australian military personnel. Ms Lambie is pushing for treason charges to be laid against all ex-Australians who have taken up arms with terror groups such as ISIS . 'Putting terrorists and would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism.' 'We need to get rid of them permanently. Mr Abbott needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism.' Senator Lambie has called for Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, to support her campaign as she believes putting 'would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism'","Jacqui Lambie receives threatening letter with images of a beheading .

"The co-founder of a Mormon women's group, who was excommunicated last year, has lost her final appeal to regain membership to a Utah-based church. Kate Kelly of Ordain Women said she learned on Saturday that the highest authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints had rejected her appeal. Kelly was found guilty of apostasy, defined as repeated and public advocacy of positions that oppose church teachings. Kate Kelly, co-founder of a Mormon women's group,  who was excommunicated last year, has lost her final appeal to regain membership in the Utah-based church (Kelly pictured with her husband Neil Ransom during a vigil in June 2014) Kelly of Ordain Women said she learned on Saturday that the highest authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had rejected her appeal (above her Twitter post after receiving the news) The faith's governing First Presidency, comprised of church President Thomas S. Monson and his two counselors, Henry Eyring and Dieter Uchtdorf, is the final avenue for excommunicated Mormons. Her appeal was earlier denied by regional church leaders in Virginia, where she used to live, as she now resides in Kenya. Kelly's husband, Neil Ransom, now plans to resign from his Mormon membership, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. The couple was married in 2006 or 'sealed for eternity' in the Utah church. However, under Mormon teachings, her excommunication and his resignation would nullify that law. Kelly was excommunicated last summer and said she was punished by the church, but her husband, who did many of the same things she was accused of committing never received punishment. Ordain Women's Executive Board Chair Debra Jenson said she was deeply saddened by the choice of the First Presidency to uphold the excommunication (above the group posted a Twitter post on Friday that said they were concerned about the State of Women in Utah) Her group Ordain Women was founded in 2013 to push for women to be allowed in the all-male lay clergy. The group staged demonstrations outside two church conferences in Salt Lake City, drawing criticism from church leaders. 'I am disappointed in the outcome, but not surprised since the disciplinary process has been entirely opaque and inequitable from the get-go,' Kelly said in a statement. 'Fortunately, men do not control my happiness, nor do they control my connection to God. 'I am proud of what I have done. I am proud of the women and men who have taken a stand with me in this struggle for gender justice. We will continue to act with integrity and courage. Mormon women and their legitimate concerns cannot be swept under the rug or summarily dismissed by one 'Court of Love',' she added. Church officials said church discipline is a private matter between members and their local leaders. The faith's governing First Presidency, comprised of church President Thomas S. Monson and his two counselors, Henry Eyring and Dieter Uchtdorf, is the final avenue for excommunicated Mormons (above Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Utah) Ordain Women's Executive Board Chair Debra Jenson, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the choice of the First Presidency to uphold the excommunication of our sister, Kate Kelly. 'We are profoundly troubled by a definition of apostasy that seems to include members asking sincere questions of our leaders. We reaffirm our commitment to faithful action and our hope for gender equality in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.' In early February, a Mormon man who gained notoriety for running a website that offers doubting Latter-day Saints a forum to chat was kicked out of the religion. John Dehlin of Utah became the second high-profile church member to be excommunicated in the past year in what Mormon scholars consider to be the faith's way of keeping dissenters in line.","Kate Kelly, co-founder of women's group Ordain Women, was told highest authority of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints rejected appeal .

"Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos is set to seek damages for libel from The Sun newspaper over claims that she dealt cocaine. The N-Dubz singer has lodged a High Court application in Dublin for permission to sue Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, The Sunday Times and The Times. The Sun on Sunday used undercover reporter Mahzer Mahmood – also known as the 'fake sheikh' for his habit of disguising himself in Arab clothes – to pretend to be a Bollywood producer who tried to get the X Factor judge to star opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in a new movie. The reporter then set up a cocaine deal. Legal action: Tulisa Contostavlos (pictured) has lodged a High Court application for permission to sue Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, The Sunday Times and The Times . But the criminal case against Ms Contostavlos was thrown out by Judge Alistair McCreath after a year-long criminal investigation. In the meantime, she lost her job, reportedly worth £470,000 a series, as an X Factor judge, as well as endorsement contracts worth more than £725,000 a year. After the criminal case against her was thrown out, Ms Contostavlos claimed to have been abandoned by some of her friends, to have lost a stone in weight and to have attempted suicide. Ms Contostavlos, 26, failed to bring a case for libel against News Group Newspapers within a 12-month deadline for such cases in the UK. However, an extension to that deadline can be obtained in Ireland, where The Sun, which has a daily circulation of 2.2 million, sells around 60,000 copies a day. It is this extension that Ms Contostavlos has asked for from the court and her request will be heard later this month. Damages: The case against Ms Contostavlos was thrown out after a year-long investigation but she lost her X Factor job reportedly worth £470,000-a-year during that time . Libel damages in Ireland are considerably higher than in other jurisdictions and the law is much more favourable to plaintiffs. The star's Belfast lawyer, Paul Tweed, has represented a string of celebrities who chose to sue for libel in Ireland rather than in their own countries, including Britney Spears, Whitney Houston, J-Lo, Harrison Ford, Reese Witherspoon and Nicolas Cage. A spokesman for The Sun declined to comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The former X Factor judge to seek damages for libel from the Sun newspaper .

"Former Labour Foreign Secretary and party donor David Owen has been exposed as having invested in a tax avoidance scheme – in a major embarrassment for Ed Miliband. Lord Owen has been ordered to repay around £50,000 after an investigation by the tax authorities. He is a supporter of Mr Miliband and last year he gave £7,500 to the Labour party. HMRC investigators will this month insist the 76-year-old settles within 90 days or face legal action. Lord Owen has been ordered to repay £50,000 following an investigation by HMRC in an embarrassing development for the Labour party. Leader Ed Miliband has in the past taunted the Tories over having 'dodgy donors' His tax avoidance arrangement appears to have undermined Mr Miliband’s ‘dodgy donors’ taunt hurled at the Conservatives in the wake of the HSBC tax scandal. Lord Owen served in the Callaghan government as Foreign Secretary between 1977 and 1979. He left Labour in 1981 – one of the Gang of Four who formed the SDP. He now sits in the Lords as an independent Social Democrat. In 2010, he ploughed almost £70,000 into a business partnership called the Cumberland House BPRA Property Fund. Investment advisers Downing claimed it offered ‘attractive taxation incentives’ under the Business Premises Renovation Allowance. One expert estimated that Lord Owen’s original sum would have ‘grossed up’ to around £130,000 – leaving him with an avoidance bill of ‘between £50k and £60k’. Lord Owen said: ‘My accountants are instructed to be completely open with HMRC and to pay what is due.’ Last night, the Labour party did not respond to our requests for a comment.","Former Labour Foreign Secretary took part in large tax avoidance scheme .

"Rebekah Brooks has moved to America to lead Rupert Murdoch’s hunt for new online investments, it can be revealed. The former News of the World editor has made the permanent switch from Oxfordshire to New York, with husband Charlie and three-year-old daughter Scarlett. She has been put in charge of finding promising internet start-ups for News Corp to invest in. It ends a period out of the public eye after the phone- hacking scandal. An insider said: ‘She is still trusted and very much held in high regard by Murdoch. Rebekah Brooks (pictured) has moved to America to lead Rupert Murdoch’s hunt for new online investments, it can be revealed . 'This is a high-status job at the top of the business.’ News Corp declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. In November speculation Brooks was to rejoin the company were rife after she was seen at its New York offices. Staff confirmed the former editor had visited the Sixth Avenue site as she continued to 'explore her future' in the news industry. 'She and her family are here in the United States for a visit, reconnecting with friends and meeting with businesses as she explores and considers her professional future,' a spokesman for the company told the Guardian last year. While the company has not publicly confirmed her new position sources claimed Ms Brooks had already moved from London to Manhattan with her family. It comes after bosses Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thompson boasted of the company's digital acquisitions at its Annual Meeting in November. An insider said the former editor of News of the World is still trusted and very much held in high regard by Rupert Murdoch (pictured) Addressing shareholders, Murdoch, 83, said: 'The creation of the new News Corp has given us an opportunity to innovate. 'We are purposeful in our pursuit of new businesses and have the potential to change the world as we know it. Thompson, who was reportedly overheard by an Australian journalist last year speaking of 'another redhead I'll have to worry about,' added: 'We told you on our investor day that we would become more digital and global and resolutely kept that vow. Brooks, 46, was cleared of charges of phone hacking in 2014 . 'We acquired for a very modest price the world's leading social news agency for video, Storyful.. and are now integrating Harlequin Books at Harper Collins.' 'Tomorrow we are due to close on our acquisition of Realtor.com. This will give us a remarkable opportunity to profit from the digitization of the US real estate market. 'We are absolutely intent on fashioning an ever more rewarding future for our audiences, our employees and for you our investors.' In December the company announced it had acquired Indian education start up Big Decisions after taking a large share in the real estate company, Proptiger. It is understood to have bought Storyful for $25million while its acquisition of Realtor.com's operator Move Inc is said to have cost $950million. In June Brooks was sensationally cleared of charges in the high-profile phone hacking investigation which saw other News International employees jailed. During the trial she revealed a six-month affair with co-defendant Andy Coulson who was sentenced to 18 months behind bars. After rising through the ranks of Murdoch's media organisation Brooks became the youngest ever editor of News of the World when appointed in 2000 aged 32. Three years later she was moved to the helm of the Sun and promoted again in 2009 to an executive position. When several of the organisation's journalists were arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and making illegal payments, Murdoch rushed to her side in the UK, reportedly describing the flame-haired 46-year-old as 'his top priority'. She resigned from News International in June 2011 two days before being quizzed by police herself. After being acquitted in June 2014 following a 138-day trial at the Old Bailey, she told reporters gathered outside her London home: 'I am innocent of the crimes I was charged with. I feel vindicated by the unanimous verdicts.' Brooks and Rupert Murdoch in 2011 some weeks after the flame-haired journalist was arrested on suspicion of phone hacking . During the sensational trial of News of the World journalists much focus was afforded to how Brooks was able to rise so quickly through the ranks of Murdoch's organisation. Having started work as as a newsroom secretary, many are said to have questioned her abilities when  the 83-year-old Australian appointed her editor of the now defunct News of the World in 2000 aged 32. Even the criticism of his son, James Murdoch, is said to have been ignored by the media mogul. What Brooks brought to the organisation was an uncanny ability to schmooze. Having wormed her way into the Chipping Norton Set - a group of high placed politicians and businessmen and women living in Oxfordshire - she became a regular fixture at dinner parties given privately by prime ministers. At her 2009 wedding to old Etonian Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer, David Cameron and Gordon Brown were among guests. She had already charmed the showbiz set through a failed marriage to EastEnders actor Ross Kemp whom she was accused of giving a fat lip in an explosive domestic tiff which ended in Brooks being arrested. So close was the Cheshire-born Brooks to David Cameron the politician ended text messages with 'LOL'. It is unclear whether he meant 'lots of love' or 'laugh out loud' in his cryptic sign-offs. But while politicians and public figures distanced themselves from Brooks after her 2011 arrest and subsequent trial, Murdoch remained a loyal fan and confidante. He is said to have rented a property near the Old Bailey for the 46-year-old and her legal team. So undeterred was her tendency to preside over others that even as her 'car crash' personal life was revealed in open court, the harem of lawyers working around Brooks referred to her as 'HM' - Her Majesty. And while details of her 'car crash' personal life were agonised over in court - jurors were told of her struggles conceiving a baby and were read an excruciatingly personal letter to her former lover, co-defendant Andy Coulson, Brooks remained defiant. Upon her acquittal she told reporters she had been 'vindicated' by the trial's outcome but insisted on learning 'valuable lessons'.

"Warning: Sir John Sawers said Russia posed a ‘state to state threat’ and dealing with that would require defence spending . Russia has become a danger to Western nations and Britain must be prepared to take steps to defend itself and its allies, the former head of MI6 said yesterday. Sir John Sawers, who recently retired after five years as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, said Russia posed a ‘state to state threat’ and dealing with that would require defence spending. He said he was disappointed at how, after the Cold War, Russia’s and Europe’s paths had failed to converge. ‘The one level in which Russia and America are equals is at the nuclear level,’ he said. ‘We shouldn’t kid ourselves that Russia is on a path to democracy because it isn’t.’ He said we lived in a much more dangerous world. ‘The stability that we had during the Cold War, or the predominance of the West that we had in the decade or two after the Cold War, that is now changing… and there are real dangers associated with that.’ Sir John told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Russia had always been a concern for the Security Services. ‘Europe and Russia are not converging with one another so we’re going to have to find a new way to co-exist. ‘This crisis at the moment – it’s focused on Ukraine but Ukraine is a symptom. It’s not the real problem. ‘The real problem is how we live with a Russia which feels very exposed. Putin’s actions are ones of a leader who believes his own security is at stake. And here, we’ve got nuclear bombers approaching the Cornish coast.’ Speaking on Radio 4, Sir John said: 'Putin’s actions are ones of a leader who believes his own security is at stake. And here, we’ve got nuclear bombers approaching the Cornish coast' On the threat posed by Islamic extremists, Sir John said there were several reasons why people became radicalised. The first was that Muslims ‘are less well integrated’ into UK society ‘and there are a number of social and economic factors that are related to that’. Secondly, he said, the Islamic religion ‘as a whole’ was not geared to reviving and modernising itself. ‘So there’s a big political challenge which can only really be taken up by leaders in the Islamic world… it can’t be imposed by the West,’ he added.","Sir John Sawers recently retired as chief of the Secret Intelligence Service .

L/Cpl Leakey's parents Rosie and Mark have had to have had to step up their security after the announcement of their son's VC award . L/Cpl Leakey's actions as part of a joint UK/US mission to attack a Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan in August 2013 included saving the life of a US Marine wounded in a gun battle. He is also credited with displaying outstanding leadership after insurgents surrounded US troops and destroyed their communications. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'Security arrangements are regularly reviewed to ensure the appropriate security of staff.' L/Cpl Leakey comes from a distinguished military family. His cousin won a Victoria Cross in the Second World War and his father is a former RAF Wing Commander. His uncle is Lieutenant General David Leakey, who is now Black Rod, the Queen's representative in Parliament. The US Marine Corps confirmed last night that no process had started for L/Cpl Leakey to be decorated in the United States. Mother of Victoria Cross hero tells of her tears when she heard of his award and says he told her: 'I'm fed up of reading about wars, I want to be in one’ By Tim MacFarlan . Victoria Cross Joshua Leakey gave up his military history studies just weeks into the course as he was 'fed up of reading about wars' and wanted to 'be in them' instead, his mother said. The para brought tears to his mother's eyes when he told her he had been given the British armed forces' highest military decoration. Rosie Leakey said she always knew her eldest son was going to sign up, and she recalls the phone call in which he told her about the life-changing decision. Left to right: L/Cpl Leakey's uncle Lieutenant General David Leakey, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, brother Ben Leakey, mum Rosie Leakey and dad Mark Leakey . He was in his first term studying military history at the University of Kent, having spent years reading about the topic after a childhood of playing soldiers. Mrs Leakey said: 'He always wanted to, but he was at uni studying war studies and he rang me after eight weeks of being at uni, and said ""Mum, I'm fed up of reading about wars, I'm going to go and be in them"", and that was it. End of conversation.' The 1 Para man's father Mark said when his son told him about the VC award he was speechless. 'He just came straight to the point. He said ""Dad, you need to know that I'm going to be awarded the Victoria Cross"", and it was as simple as that. There was a sense of unreality about it. I felt I was in a bit of a dream.' Younger brother Ben, 24, who is doing an MA in terrorism, security and society, said he remembers playing soldiers with his sibling and 'running around in the woods all day' and Mrs Leakey recalls that 'sticks were always guns or swords'. Ben said: 'That's all he's ever wanted to be is to be a soldier.'","Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey, 27, told by top brass he faces kidnap threat .

"An Ohio police chief is accused of pointing a gun at an employee's head, refusing to investigate a sexual assault claim against another officer and lying to investigators about both incidents. Put-in-Bay Police Chief Robert 'Ric' Lampela was charged with four misdemeanor counts by the Ohio Attorney General's office after a misconduct investigation. Lampela is facing one count of aggravated menacing, one count of dereliction of duty and two counts of falsification, according to documents filed yesterday. Put-in-Bay Police Chief Robert 'Ric' Lampela (pictured left and right) was charged with four misdemeanor counts by the Ohio Attorney General's office after a misconduct investigation . Lampela is accused of pointing a gun at an employee's head and refusing to investigate a sexual assault claim . According to investigators, Lampela refused to investigate the sexual assault claim because he wanted to'prevent negative publicity for the Put-In-Bay Police Department' (pictured above) Put-in-Bay, which has close to 500 residents, is one of about 20 islands located in the shallow western end of Lake Erie. According to investigators, Lampela refused 'to allow police reports to be filed or an investigation to commence after two employees reported another employee allegedly sexually assaulted them' because he wanted to 'prevent negative publicity for the Put-In-Bay Police Department'. That alleged incident occurred in 2003. Lampela is also accused of pointing a gun at police officer Jeff Herald while the two discussed the Bill of Rights in 2012, the Mansfield News Journal reported. An officer who observed the incident was so concerned for Herald's safety that he unstrapped his holster in case he had to draw his gun. It is believed that Lampela's gun was unloaded at the time. The Attorney General's Office believes Lampela made false statements about both incidents to an Ottawa County Sheriff's Office investigator. He said 'the sexual assault was never officially reported to him', the Sandusky Register reported. Lampela is due to attend a hearing on March 25 in Ottawa County Municipal Court. It is unclear if Lampela is still running the Put-in-Bay Police Department. Village Councilman Jeff Koehler said the charges against Lampela are serious even though they are misdemeanors. He said: 'Anything in this capacity of alleged wrongdoing usually results in a suspension.' No other officers were charged and no further charges will be filed unless more evidence surfaces. Lampela (left) and other officers from the department work in a building with a clocktower in Put-in-Bay (right) Lampela is accused of pointing a gun at officer Jeff Herald while the two discussed the Bill of Rights in 2012 . Special prosecutor Margaret Tamaro called the conduct of others within Lamepla's department unprofessional, but not criminal, The Blade reported. She wrote: 'The professionalism of the Put-in-Bay Police Department often fell far short of what should be expected. 'However, it is not a crime to be unprofessional. 'There appeared to be a pattern of inconsistency in the enforcement of the laws at Put-in-Bay and disparate treatment of individuals.' The  department has a small year-round staff but hires a number of seasonal officers to deal with the busy summer tourist season. Put-in-Bay, which has close to 500 residents, is one of about 20 islands located in the western end of Lake Erie . According to the department website: 'Put-in-Bay is a summer resort, and has been for over 100 years. 'Today, Put-in-Bay is a vibrant tourist resort complete with taverns, gift shops, hotels, boating, fishing, a national monument, caves and other island attractions. 'Under the command of Chief Robert Lampela, the police department has progressed into a department that the community can count on.' The department advises visitors 'what you might think is fun now, may be costly later' and 'use common sense, don't do something here that you would not do at home.' Lampela's Facebook page contains numerous postings from someone named Bruce Kroger. It has been alleged that Kroger was actually created by Lampela. In a post from August 2014 that appears on Lampela's page, Kroger wrote: 'This guy Mark Mathys has been quoted in the Sandusky newspaper that the police are corrupt. 'Well, a simple google search found a recent arrest of his in FL. 'How dirty is the pool he's swimming in? Of course criminals will think the police are corrupt.'","Police Chief Robert 'Ric' Lampela of Put-in-Bay, Ohio is facing four charges .

"Kim Kardashian is the most well-known of the reality TV family . Sex tapes, scandals, selfies, screaming matches and diva-driven dramas both real and imagined … it is the heady mix which has helped turn the Kardashians into the most successful TV family ever. The Klan, as they call themselves, at once the most reviled and loved dysfunctional family in the world, last week signed a record $100 million deal to keep their show Keeping Up With The Kardashians on the E! channel for another four years. In just seven years (it feels longer), the Kardashian girls – headed by ‘tiger mum’ Kris – have transformed themselves from, frankly, a rather tacky bunch of seemingly talentless nobodies into a global franchise reportedly valued at $1 BILLION. But while they have turned being ‘famous for being famous’ into a lucrative art form – using their name to flog everything from pillows to perfume – everyone has heard of them, even if they’re not sure what they do. Prime Minister David Cameron recently admitted he can’t fathom ‘why everyone is interested in Kim Kardashian’. A show insider said: ‘When the Kardashians started out, they were a laughing stock. But no one is laughing now. 'They may have no discernible talents but they have ambition and drive in spades and they all work incredibly hard to build their brand. ‘Underneath all the drama they are a family who truly love each other and that’s what fans relate to. The boobs and bottoms might be fake but the family drama is real and that is the secret of their success. They are also oddly aspirational. If the Kardashians can make a fortune, dress in designer couture and carry $10,000 handbags there’s hope for us all.’ The show now airs in more than 100 countries with Kim’s derriere so famous it has its own Twitter feed. So who ARE the women who have stormed reality TV – and how KAN they be the most famous family on the planet? Khloe: The normal one . Who is she? Battling with her weight and insecure about her looks, sensible middle sister Khloe, 30, stars in her own spin-off reality shows Kourtney And Khloe Take Miami and The Hamptons. A disastrous marriage to drug-taking basketball player Lamar Odom only boosted her popularity. Reportedly worth $22 million thanks to property deals. Plagued by rumours she is OJ Simpson’s illegitimate child. Has fiercely denied all such claims. Kringe Factor: In a 2013 episode of Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, Khloe was the judge in a competition between Kim and Kourtney so vulgar it is unrepeatable in a family newspaper. Khloe and Kim: Khloe is known as the sensible middle sister while Kim hit fame for her explicit 2007 sex tape . Kim: The queen of selfies . Who is she? Paris Hilton’s one-time assistant is famous for her explicit 2007 sex tape, ample derriere and being married to husband number three, rapper Kanye West. The second eldest daughter of Kris and Robert Kardashian, Kim is the star of the family reality TV series and worth $45 million, according to Forbes. Kringe Factor: In 2013, Kim surpassed herself when she straddled and simulated sex with then fiance Kanye West in music video Bound 2. It went viral and was much parodied. The ‘selfie’ queen also treats her 27 million fans on photo-sharing website Instagram to the occasional ‘belfie’ or bum selfie. Last year she balanced a champagne glass on her buttocks. Kris: The mastermind . Who is she? Known as the ‘momager’, Kris masterminds her daughters’ every move. A former airline stewardess, Kris, 59, is creator, star and executive producer of the reality show, has her own collection on QVC and has just released a cookbook. Her late ex-husband and father to Kim, Khloe and Kourtney was lawyer Robert Kardashian, who represented OJ Simpson. She divorced second husband Bruce Jenner, father to Kendall and Kylie, last year and recently moved toyboy Corey Gamble, who at 33 is 26 years her junior, into her California mansion. Kringe Factor: Last year, Kris donned her tightest Lyrca catsuit and most vertiginous heels for a pole-dancing class. Is open about plastic surgery and her ‘amazing’ sex life . Mother and daughter: (L-R) Kris masterminds her daughters’ every move. Her eldest is Kourtney . Kourtney: The Earth mother . Who is she? The oldest of the Kardashian girls at 35, Kourtney is considered by many as the ‘boring one’. Has several spin-off shows and is reportedly worth $20 million. Along with sisters Kim and Khloe, Kourtney owns upmarket US boutique Dash and clothing line Kardashian Kollection, sold though Dorothy Perkins in UK. Kringe Factor: Kourtney allowed the cameras to keep rolling for Penelope’s birth in 2012. Was even shown pulling the little girl out with her own hands. Kendall: The supermodel . Who she is? Model of the moment, Kendall has managed to carve out a career away from her half-sisters’ TV antics. The 19-yearold was queen of New York Fashion Week last month. She is also the new $5 million ‘face’ of Estée Lauder and counts fellow model Cara Delevingne as a best friend. Kringe Factor: Surprisingly scandal free. Once dated Harry Styles but refuses to discuss it publicly. Has taken the mature decision not to bare all on the show. ‘Kendall is determined to have a proper career as a model,’ a friend says. ‘She’s the one to watch.’ Younger sisters: (L-R) Kendall, the model of the moment, and Kylie, the baby of the Klan . Kylie: The baby . Who is she? The baby of the clan, but no shrinking violet, Kylie is reportedly worth $2 million. The 17-year-old will this year design a collection for Topshop and is already CEO of several businesses including Kylie Hair Kouture. Has her own collections with OPI Nail Polish and US shoe ‘king’ Steve Madden. Kringe Factor: Hangs with the Hollywood ‘brat pack’ headed by Justin Bieber. Has an on-off relationship with rapper Tyga, 25, who reportedly left the mother of his child for her. Reports of late-night partying have been swirling around of late. After divorcing Kris last year, 1976 US Olympic gold decathlete Bruce Jenner is focusing on ‘transitioning’ into a woman . P.S. Meet the man of the house (until he has a sex change) Who is he? After divorcing Kris last year, the 1976 US Olympic gold decathlete is focusing on ‘transitioning’ into a woman. Once he has completed his gender reassignment, Bruce Jenner will reportedly be known as Belinda. He will be sharing his ‘journey’ into womanhood in a documentary but the series was recently put on hold while Bruce deals with the legal repercussions of a tragic car accident in which a woman died. Kringe Factor: In a 2013 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris admitted she and Bruce had once made a sex tape. Unlike his daughter, the former Olympian had the sense to erase it afterwards.","Klan last week signed record $100 million deal to keep show on E! channel .

"Hours before flying to Washington to try to scuttle an emerging US nuclear deal with Tehran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a high-profile visit  to Jerusalem's sacred Western Wall. Wearing a black skullcap, he rested his hands on the Wall on Saturday while praying briefly, before he made remarks expressing his respect for US President Barack Obama. This is amid tensions with the White House caused by his acceptance of an invitation by Republicans to speak on Tuesday at Capitol Hill, as Netanyahu stands firm on his bid to persuade Congress to fight Obama's Iran plans. Scroll down for video . Hours before flying to Washington to try to scuttle an emerging US nuclear deal with Tehran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a high-profile visit to Jerusalem's sacred Western Wall (above pictured on Saturday in Jerusalem at the holy prayer site) Wearing a black skullcap, he rested his hands on the Wall (above) while praying briefly, before he expressed his respect for US President Barack Obama. This is amid tensions caused by his acceptance of an invitation by Republicans to speak on Tuesday at Capitol Hill . 'I want to take this opportunity to say that I respect US President Barack Obama,' he said. 'I believe in the strength of the relations between Israel and the United States. That strength will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and those yet to come.' Netanyahu's visit to the Western Wall is his first to the sacred site before a US trip since he became prime minister for the second time in 2009, according to The Jerusalem Post. It was followed by a visit to his father's grave two days prior. The Prime Minister said his father, Benzion, who passed away in 2012 and often gave him advice during crucial moments in his life, told him to 'always look at the threats endangering our people'. Netanyahu reiterated that in his position as prime minister, it is his job to be concerned about Israel's security, and to also identify dangers in time and do whatever possible to try to stop them from occurring. Netanyahu said: 'As prime minister of Israel it is my duty to care for the security of Israel. 'That is why we strongly oppose the agreement emerging between Iran and the world powers which could endanger our very existence.' The Prime Minister referred to previous leaders, David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol, and Menachem Begin, who he said all took action when they believed it to be necessary, even though they went against strongly-stated US policies. His planned speech has caused 34 Democrats (30 House Members and four Senators), including Vice President Joe Biden, to boycott his speech during the joint session of Congress next week, according to CNN. The Israeli Prime Minister said that he 'respects President Obama' and that he 'believes in the strength of the relations between Israel and the US' (above President Obama) But even a Republican is planning to miss the speech as US Representative Jan Schakowsky released a statement on Thursday and said she will also not be in attendance. Schakowsky, the only Jewish member of Illinois' Congressional delegation, said she agrees with the criticism of Republican House Speaker John Boehner's decision to invite Netanyahu without consulting Obama, according to The Chicago Tribune. She also reportedly said she is more concerned about his speech scuttling negotiations with Iran to stop it from building a nuclear weapon. And earlier this week, National Security Adviser Susan Rice came out saying the Prime Minister's decision to give the speech 'was destructive to the fabric of the relationship' between the US and Israel. Netanyahu is set to give his speech on Tuesday at 11am, which will be followed by lunch with a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders before he returns to Israel. Secretary of State John Kerry will leave at the weekend for Switzerland for another meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif. The pace and intensity of the talks have increased as global powers gathered under the P5+1, a group of six world leaders, have sought a deal with Iran to stop it acquiring a nuclear weapon - something Tehran denies trying to do. A March 31 deadline for a political framework for the deal is looming, with negotiators saying they will aim to pin down the final technical details by June 30. Israel believes the sides are likely to reach an agreement that eases international sanctions on the Islamic republic without applying sufficiently stringent safeguards to stop it developing nuclear weapons. During his US visit, the Prime Minister, who arrives on Sunday accompanied with his wife and top advisers, will also give a speech at American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference on Monday. Netanyahu's trip to Washington comes two weeks before Israel's March 17 general election in which he is seeking a third consecutive term in office. HOUSE MEMBERS . Rep. Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) Rep.

"An 'American airplane pilot' with 'Latino roots' has been detained by Venezuela's government, accusing of spying and recruiting citizens to stage a coup, President Nicolas Maduro declared. The President said the pilot, who has not been named, was part of a group of six U.S. nationals arrested in the state of Táchira, near the Colombian border, in the last few days. Addressing a rally on Saturday, Maduro said the man had 'documentation' that suggested he was involved in 'espionage' and 'recruitment'. It comes after four missionaries were questioned over alleged 'spying' after running a medical assistance campaign in the coastal town of Ocumare de la Costa. Scroll down for video . Claims: President Nicolas Maduro claims an American pilot has been detained in Caracas suspected of spying . A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Caracas said he was unable to comment, citing a lack of any official diplomatic communication with the Venezuelan government. Maduro, Hugo Chavez's left wing successor, has waged a bitter war of words against the U.S. in recent weeks. Last week he accused the White House - which he dubbed 'arrogant Yankees' - of trying to overthrow him. The Obama administration vehemently denied the charge. In his latest attack, Maduro said his government will prohibit some U.S. officials from entering Venezuela in retaliation for a similar measure by the government of President Barack Obama against a group of Venezuelan public officials. He said U.S. tourists will also be subject to hefty visa fees - akin to those Venezuelans must pay to visit America. The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010. Nonetheless, they have continued to exchange diplomatic staff. On Saturday, Maduro said the U.S. has far more officials in Venezuela than his socialist government has in the U.S. 'They have 100 diplomats and we have 17,' Maduro said. In an address that all Venezuelan television and radio stations were required to carry, Maduro addressed Obama directly, saying the U.S. president has 'arrogantly' refused to engage in talks to resolve the issues between the two countries. 'I'm very sorry, Mr. President, that you have gone down this dead end,' he said. Maduro asked that the changes regulating diplomats be implemented immediately, within the limits of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Among other things, U.S. diplomats will be required to seek approval from the Foreign Ministry for meetings they conduct here. Unrest: A supporter of Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma holds a poster of him with chains during a protest demanding his release in Caracas last Friday. He was accused of plotting against President Maduro . The news comes amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela and a surge in anti-government protests in the capital, Caracas. He recently called on other Latin American nations to form a coalition to investigate America for 'human rights violations'. It is not clear if the pilot is one of the six U.S. nationals arrested recently, all accused of espionage by President Nicolas Maduro. The head of a Venezuelan evangelical organization on Friday said a group of four missionaries had been called in for questioning after participating in a medical assistance campaign in the coastal town of Ocumare de la Costa. That pastor, Abdy Pereira, on Saturday said in a telephone interview that the four had left the country for Aruba after having been questioned for several days about alleged involvement in espionage. Pereira said the group had been coming to Venezuela 14 years and denied they were involved in espionage.","'Pilot' with 'Latino roots' detained in Táchira, border with Colombia, in the last few days, President Nicolas Maduro claims .

"A senior RAF nurse awarded one of Britain's highest medals for nursing on the front line has said she was unprepared for the horrific nature of the injuries she treated in Afghanistan. Squadron Leader Charlotte Thompson-Edgar spoke movingly about the bravery of the 600 soldiers she brought back from the brink of death after fierce battles against the Taliban. But at a ceremony last week to mark the latest Operational Honours and Awards for Britain's Armed Forces, Sqn Ldr Thompson-Edgar – who was awarded the Royal Red Cross 2nd Class – said no one expected such injuries, during the fighting in which 453 troops lost their lives. Sqn Ldr Charlotte 'Charlie' Thomson-Edgar (left) previously Staff Officer 1 of the Medical Emergency Response Team in Afghanistan, with a colleague . In an interview with the Mail on Sunday the 40-year-old revealed: . From 2007 to 2013, Sqn Ldr Thompson-Edgar, from Peterborough, commanded a medical response unit that flew by helicopter to the battlefield, braving Taliban gunfire, to rescue injured soldiers. Speaking about her 'horrific' experiences in the war zone, she said: 'There was no training for the job and I'd never done any pre-hospital care. 'I was used to working in a nice emergency room in a safe environment with kit and with everyone on standby. 'Suddenly I was in a Chinook helicopter, unable to hear myself think, treating guys with horrific injuries and being shot at. I was not prepared to see these injuries but then the military was not expecting to see them either. Sqn Ldr Thomson-Edgar (left) working onboard a Chinook helicopter with a colleague on Operation Herrick: the codename under which all British operations in Afghanistan have been conducted. She said she was a 'complete mess' on returning to Britain after her first tour . 'I pulled 600 patients from the battlefield – about 80 per cent of them had limbs missing or gunshot wounds. Quite a lot died, especially those with gunshot wounds to the head and chest. 'We also saw guys were dying because they were losing too much blood.' The officer, who enlisted in the RAF after completing a nursing degree, was first exposed to the gruesome reality of the Taliban's tactics on Christmas Eve 2007. On that freezing day, her medical response team was sent on an emergency mission to rescue a young Royal Marine who – on what was supposed to be a routine desert patrol in Helmand province – had stood on an enemy landmine. The force of the explosion blew off both his legs and his right arm. When the alarm was raised, Sqn Ldr Thompson-Edgar and her four-man team flew from Camp Bastion to where Mark Ormrod, of 40 Commando, had been horrifically wounded. Marine Mark Ormrod, 24, who had both his legs and his right arm blown off by an IED blast. Sqn Ldr Thompson-Edgar and her four-man team flew from Camp Bastion to help save his life . He had suffered a catastrophic haemorrhage, yet the team had no blood or plasma to give him – because at the time medical helicopters did not carry these supplies. She said: 'I was gobsmacked – we all were. We'd never seen anything like it. I mean, where do you start? 'We had a reservist doctor with us who was supposed to lead the treatment and he just froze – literally for about five minutes he couldn't move because he was overwhelmed. 'So me and a paramedic took a deep breath and got to work on Mark as the helicopter flew back to Camp Bastion. 'We needed to get a fluid line into Mark but the veins in his remaining arm were flat. 'Our only option was to perform an intraosseous infusion, which means drilling through a patient's bone to deliver fluids. Fourteen of the service men and women recognised for gallantry and meritorious service in the Operational Awards ceremony at Lancaster House, London. Sqn Ldr Charlotte Joanne Thompson-Edgar is fourth from left . 'Our usual landmarks are through the arms and legs but, because of Mark's injuries, the only option was to go through a part of his pelvis called the iliac crest. 'It is a nerve-racking procedure because you've got a lot of vital organs in that area. 'So that is what me and the paramedic Corporal Keith Mills did. He went in one side and I tried the other. Eventually we got it right.' However, leading so many missions commanding the Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT) soon took its toll. Sqn Ldr Thompson-Edgar said: 'Every time the red phone rang to signal another MERT mission I would think, 'Is today going to be the day?' 'And when I came back to Britain after that first tour, I'll be honest, I was a complete mess. 'So I said right, we've got to prepare our people better because I hadn't been prepared and didn't want somebody else to go through it.' British soldiers with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) walk to a Chinook helicopter in Helmand province in May 2008. From working in a 'nice emergency room' Sqn Ldr Thomson-Edgar suddenly found herself in a Chinook 'unable to hear [myself] think' Once home, she played a key role in setting up a MERT training programme, which used amputees in Britain to act as injured soldiers to help medics train before they were deployed to Afghanistan. As a result of recommendations from senior medical staff, blood and plasma started to be carried aboard MERT helicopters in 2008. But as the campaign continued, the Taliban changed their tactics – leading to injuries becoming even more horrific and the experiences of UK medics more traumatic. She said: 'Originally they just wanted to hurt as many soldiers as possible in order to dent morale and get the public up in arms. 'Then they decided that if they maimed somebody really, really badly that's going to affect people more and affect the minds of the soldiers on the ground. 'So the blasts got bigger and the amputations started getting higher up the soldiers' legs. This made our jobs a lot harder, especially when someone was bleeding from the groin because it is very difficult to stop that sort of bleeding. Taliban fighters  in the main bazaar of Kandahar in November 2001. IED blasts got bigger as the group moved away from seeking to hurt groups of soldiers towards maiming individuals as much as possible . 'It was complicated, and I started to see my guys in the MERT teams burnout and leave. 'At one point both the MERT teams were working 24 hours a day for ten days without a break. As I was the RAF's most senior nurse I had to take accountability, I had to make sure my guys were okay.' Sqn Ldr Thompson-Edgar – whose mother Diane was also a nurse – is married to Surgeon Lieutenant Commander Iain Edgar, of the Royal Navy. She currently serves as a military nurse at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and is also about to start a PhD in nursing studies. She added: 'The past seven years have been very difficult and I know my family have been concerned. 'I got through it for a reason – because of the guys on the ground, the soldiers, who deserved the best. 'Their bravery was my reason for going back to the war zone so many times.'","Squadron Leader Charlotte Thompson-Edgar spoke of soldiers' bravery .

The executioner  agreed with Hitler's massacre of Jews and called them 'f***king pigs', another said. While some former peers say they are struggling to believe the quiet boy they knew turned into one of the world's most notorious killers, others have spoken of a boy with extreme beliefs and a thirst for blood. Mohammed Emwazi appears as a picture of innocence in this school photo . After moving to London, he appeared to embrace British life - playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United. But a former classmate at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London, told LBC: 'We were in the playground and Mohammed was running away from someone, I think he was just about to get into a fight. 'And as he was running, another guy blocked his path. And he ran into a goal post and hit his head on a metal goal post and fell to the floor. 'This was Year 6 - we didn't see him for six weeks. He was not the same ever since that brain injury. I am telling you one million per cent. He was not the same'. A former friend of the terrorist, who met him in 1999 when they both attended Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in St John's Wood, North London, said he found out Emwazi was a Nazi sympathiser during a Year 9 lesson. The 27-year-old told the Daily Mirror: 'The teacher told us the Nazis drew up plans to get rid of all the Jews. 'I heard Mohammed mutter ""Good, they deserved it"". I thought he was joking but later he told me that he hated all Jews and blamed them for the plight of Muslims.' The school friend said that if they ever walked past a house in Golders Green that Emwazi knew was owned by a Jew, he would shout obscenities such as 'f***king pigs'. These anecdotes appear to be reinforced by what details have emerged of Emwazi's adult life. Just over a decade after the picture of him at school was taken, he was pictured attending a hate-filled rally where one of the killers of Drummer Lee Rigby gave a speech. Emwazi is said to have attended the demonstration outside the Harrow Central Mosque in North-West London in 2009 to 'celebrate' the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. During the rally, which attracted at least 1,500 people, Michael Adebolajo spoke to the crowd of his contempt for 'unbelievers'. Adebolajo - who is in prison for Rigby's murder - said: 'They are pigs. Allah says they are worse than cattle. Do not be scared of them. And do not turn your back to them. Don't be scared of them, or police, or the cameras.' Onlookers said they also saw a tall Kuwaiti man, believed to be Emwazi, masked with a scarf, and holding aloft a black flag with the Islamic testimony of faith in Arabic. The flag is usually associated with extremists and jihadis.

Fusilier Lee Rigby (left) was murdered by fanatics Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale. Adebolajo spoke at the radical 2009 rally which was attended by Emwazi . Scarce details of Emwazi have emerged in the past week after he was named as the notorious ISIS killer, but together, they paint a picture of a man tormented by run-ins with British security services as he became increasingly radicalised. It has now emerged Emwazi was involved with a violent street gang who targeted the wealthy residents of Belgravia with stun guns, and was a member of a secret Osama Bin Laden sleeper cell based in Britain called The London Boys, which planned to carry out atrocities in the West. Other members of Emwazi’s cell include Ibrahim Magag, a Somali-born former train conductor from London involved in arranging ‘financial support for Al Qaeda’. Magag was put under a control order to stop him fleeing overseas to join a jihad. But on Boxing Day 2012 he vanished. Officials believe he went to join British jihadis in East Africa. All this occurred amid his beliefs he was being harassed by security services when detained at Heathrow Airport. In a series of remarkable emails with Mail on Sunday journalist Robert Verkaik, he comes across paranoid that his every move is being shadowed by British intelligence officers. The emails, sent in 2010 and 2011 before Emwazi travelled to Syria, offer a remarkable insight into his state of mind at a time when he was already deeply immersed in extremism.","Peering over a classmate's shoulder, this is ISIS killer Jihadi John aged 10 .

"The 19-year-old man charged with murdering a Las Vegas mother in a neighborhood gunbattle suffered a fractured skull as an infant -  an injury that lawyers said could become a factor in the case. Erich Milton Nowsch's father pleaded guilty in 1996 to child abuse for the injury, according to archived Clark County District Court. He later killed himself in 2010 at 39 when his son was 14. Attorney Augustus Claus said he wants to investigate the extent and effect of the injury on Nowsch before deciding whether to use it in his client's murder defense. Scroll down for video . Erich Nowsch Jr. appears in a Las Vegas courtroom for his initial court appearance Monday, Feb. 23 . Nowsch's lawyer Augustus Claus may use a fractured skull he suffered as an infant at the hands of his father in his defense . 'Obviously, an injury like that has potential for long-term consequences,' Claus said. Nowsch also is facing attempted murder and weapon charges in the Feb. 12 shooting that killed Tammy Meyers and involved her 22-year-old son, Brandon Meyers. The case received international attention after family members said she was the victim of road rage while giving her daughter a driving lesson. Road rage was later revealed to be less a factor than originally thought. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson will consider Nowsch's childhood injury while deciding whether to seek the death penalty against him. David Stanton, the chief deputy district attorney handling the case, declined to comment. Dr. Jeffrey Max, neuropsychiatric research director at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, said a doctor evaluating Nowsch would consider the severity of the injury, Nowsch's personal and family psychiatric history, evidence of defiance, mood swings and violent or impulsive behavior, and even his family income level. His father's actions would also come into play, Max said. 'The head injury could be one component of multiple risk factors,' Max said. 'It could suggest he had a multitude of factors himself, and a genetic risk toward violence.' Nowsch Sr. acknowledged in court in 1996 that he dropped the boy on the garage floor while getting out of his truck, recalled Brent Bryson, the father's defense attorney at the time. The baby was taken to University Medical Center in Las Vegas and diagnosed with a right parietal skull fracture, severe bruising on his back and a handprint bruise on his left buttock, according to an Oct. 9, 1995, police report. Nowsch Sr. had separated from the boy's mother by the time he was arrested in May 1996 on a felony child abuse causing substantial bodily injury charge, according to the court record. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor child abuse and neglect and was sentenced to three years' probation. He worked as a flooring installer before killing himself. The Clark County coroner said the father had cocaine and over-the-counter cold medication in his system and died of carbon monoxide intoxication. Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in what initially appeared to be a road-rage incident involving Nowsch . Robert Meyers watched in court as his wife's alleged murderer made his first appearance earlier this week . Several doctors said they would need to talk with the defendant and review school and juvenile justice records along with his behavior growing up before linking his injury — or the effect of his father's suicide — to the fatal wounding of Meyers. 'Just having a skull fracture, you can't draw any conclusion from that,' said Dr. Dale Carrison, head of the emergency department at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. Dr. Stephen Reich, a New York lawyer and psychologist, called it crucial to learn if Nowsch at times in his life lost emotional control or acted out, and equally important to consider whether he has the ability to identify right and wrong. Seattle forensic psychiatrist Dr. Richard Adler, a medical expert who has testified in death penalty trials in at least nine states, said the father's suicide may have had a profound effect on the son. Meyers, 44, was shot in the head after a series of roadway encounters beginning with an altercation heading home from a late-night driving lesson with her 15-year-old daughter. The story changed dramatically following the revelation that Meyers fetched her 22-year-old son, Brandon Meyers, and his gun and drove around the neighborhood looking for a motorist who frightened her. Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, later said his wife knew Nowsch, at least in passing, and that Nowsch had been to the Meyers family home several times in the past. Meyers didn't respond this week to messages.","Erich Nowsch of Las Vegas, Nevada has been charged with murder of Tammy Meyers, 44, a mother of four and grandmother of one .

"Two alcoholic bears fed beer and caged at a Russian restaurant have been saved thanks to Brigitte Bardot's animal rights charity. A court ordered the bears to be confiscated from the restaurant in Sochi, in south-western Russia's Krasnodar Krai region, after they were found lying in a filthy cage surrounded by rubbish. The pair developed drinking problems after customers were permitted to buy them beer, but Russian zoos refused to take the bears on because of their addiction, which made them bad tempered. Finally, British animal welfare organisation Big Hearts Foundation stepped forward and with backing from the Brigitte Bardot Fund, helped rehome the two animals to a bear park in Romania. The two alcoholic bears were confiscated from a restaurant in the city of Sochi, Russia, after they were found lying in this filthy cage (pictured) surrounded by rubbish. Patrons regularly bought them beer for 'fun' The alcoholic bears are believed to have lived in the squalid cage at the back of a restaurant for 20 years . The animal rights charity founded by Brigitte Bardot (pictured left in 1960 and right in 2007) stepped in to help rehome the ill-treated bears . The restaurant owner, Dzheniks Uzaroshvili, rejected the suggestion that it was cruel to give the bears alcohol, and said: 'Beer is good for the bears because of the Sochi climate.' The court heard the bears often had a spotlight unexpectedly shone on them on them as people laughed at their reaction. According to evidence given in court, the spotlight was the reason one of the bears was virtually blind. Anna Kogan, from the British Big Hearts Foundation, said that the bears had been served alcohol to entertain guests in a cage at the back of the restaurant for around 20 years. A British animal charity became involved in re-homing the bears after zoos refused to take them on . Dzheniks Uzaroshvili (pictured) the restaurant owner, denied it was cruel to give the bears alcohol . Alcoholic bears suffer in the same way as humans including unpredictable tempers and withdrawal symptoms . The alcoholic bears, which are currently going cold turkey, will now be moved to a huge Bear Park in Romania . Ms Kogan said: 'The problem is that they are alcoholics, and it is even more difficult to wean bears off alcohol than is with human beings.' Experts said that alcoholic bears suffer all the same problems that humans do, including unpredictable tempers and the withdrawal symptoms that a human being might expect. Vets say with proper care the bears will be able to beat their addiction. After a lengthy appeal the British charity won backing from the Brigitte Bardot foundation and a new home has now been found. Prosecutors decided to confiscate the bears after 500 activists protested outside the restaurant in 2012 . The alcoholic bears, which are currently going cold turkey, will now be moved to a huge Bear Park in Romania. But first they must be confiscated from the restaurant, where they remain, and moved to the Romanian port of Constanta by funds paid for by the Brigitte Bardot foundation. They will then be sent to the Bear Park in central Transylvania, just 20 miles from the city of Brasov. The sanctuary has offered to re-home the bears and provide them with treatment for their alcohol problems. However, Ms Kogan says they are still looking for a company to transport the bears - which they cannot do until the Russian authorities act on the court order and confiscate them. She said today: 'The bears are still with the restaurant owner. 'The Ministry of Natural Resources, which is the body that has to take them away, is taking their time with acting on this decision as there is no where in Sochi to put them temporarily. 'There is a home for these bears in a rehabilitation centre in Romania. 'Big Hearts Foundation and others are happy to organise the move when the authorities start cooperating with us on document preparation and veterinary assessments of the animals.' The sanctuary is home to around 70 bears who have been mistreated and have spent years in captivity. Prosecutors decided to confiscate the bears after 500 activists protested outside the restaurant in 2012.

"Major Laura Nicholson was the captain of a Chinook launched to rescue and provide urgent medical assistance to a critically-injured member of the US Marine Corps in Afghanistan - the same day she helped save an Afghan mother and her four children . Major Laura Nicholson has become the first female pilot to win the Distinguished Flying Cross in Afghanistan after rescuing a family caught in crossfire between US Marines and the Taliban. The Army Air Corps officer, 39, defied rockets and rifle rounds to land her helicopter in a war-torn village and save an Afghan mother who had been shot in the head. During the mission on December 3, 2013, Maj Nicholson’s Chinook helicopter was struck at least three times. One bullet passed through a 1in gap between armour plates – which are supposed to protect the cockpit – wounding one of her colleagues. At the time, RAF Sergeant Chris Purkiss was sitting just behind her and manning a M134 machine gun. The impact of the round threw the gunner forwards and he struck an ammunition container perched in front of him. As Maj Nicholson, from Salisbury, recalled: ‘When Chris was hit I had this horrible sinking feeling. He’s only a young lad and it was his first tour of Afghanistan. 'In the back of the helicopter I had the mother and her four distraught children. ‘They had been travelling in a car which had driven between the Taliban and the Marines. The vehicle was riddled with gunfire. ‘I felt responsible for all but as captain I had to let the medics do their job on the casualties and concentrate on climbing back up to a safe height. 'While Chris was being treated, the co-pilot and I assessed the engine temperatures and pressures for signs of leakage. ‘We made it back to our base. Then I had to tell the engineers that we’d broken the helicopter, which was amusing. 'I also realised just how lucky we’d been to get out of there. The Afghan mother was treated in hospital but I don’t know what happened to her after that.’ The action for which Maj Nicholson was decorated occurred during her fourth operational tour of Afghanistan. In a separate incident on the same day, she also rescued a US Marine who had suffered a gunshot wound to his abdomen during clashes with the Taliban.","Army Air Corps officer and Chinook pilot Major Laura Nicholson, 39, rescued a family caught in crossfire between US Marines and the Taliban .

"John Prescott's junketing has pumped more than 24 tons of carbon into the atmosphere . Lord Prescott’s return to frontline politics as Ed Miliband’s ‘climate change adviser’ has already hit turbulence – after research uncovered the size of the junketing peer’s own carbon footprint. The former Deputy Prime Minister has enjoyed an astonishing 23 foreign trips in the course of this Parliament, amassing more than 181,000 air miles and depositing an estimated 24 tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Lord Prescott, 76, says his new role will involve helping a future Labour government broker international agreements on reducing emissions, which campaigners claim are pushing up global temperatures. Aviation will be one of the key areas for discussion: activists have called for higher taxes on air travel after calculating that environmental pollution from planes has increased by more than 80 per cent since 1990. However, this has not deterred Lord Prescott from taking enough junkets since 2010 to fly seven times around the globe. The Mail on Sunday has established that since joining the House of Lords in July 2010, he has flown – at someone else’s expense – to China (seven times), India (four times) and America (twice), as well as Russia, South Africa, Cuba, Norway, Iceland, Mexico, Japan and Germany. According to his declarations in the Lords’ Register of Interests, he has also visited France twice, although it is unclear whether he flew or took the more environmentally friendly Eurostar. Six of the trips were funded by Globe International, an organisation which gathers parliamentarians from different countries together to discuss climate change issues. The bills for all his other junkets were either met by quangos, private companies or the UK Government. Lord Prescott, who served as the EU’s lead negotiator at the Kyoto talks which led to the first global agreement on cutting carbon emissions in 1997, said he was taking the new frontbench role under Mr Miliband ‘to raise ambition on this crucial issue and… to help the man I hope will be the next Prime Minister so that together we can help the next generation’. But critics claimed the job was just an excuse to bring Lord Prescott back in order to beef up Labour’s media performances in the run-up to the Election. It was also seen as an attempt to stop the haemorrhage of both working class votes to Ukip, and environmentalist votes to the Green Party. Mr Miliband said that he had given Lord Prescott the job because he ‘knows how to knock heads together’. Lord Prescott first developed a reputation for ‘junketing’ during the 13 years he spent as Tony Blair’s deputy. Lord Prescott, left, has jetted around the world to discuss and highlight the issue of climate change . Ed Miliband is believed to have given Lord Prescott, pictured, a job to secure working-class votes . Shortly before leaving the Government in 2007, he embarked on a seven-day ‘farewell tour’ of America and the Caribbean which was estimated to have cost taxpayers as much as £50,000. Prescott and his eight-strong team stayed in luxury hotels in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Jamaica and Barbados as part of a visit to highlight his ‘interest in urban planning and the end of slavery’. Last night, Conservative MP Julian Smith said: ‘It is not surprising that “Two Jags” Prescott is completely hypocritical on climate change – saying that he wants to save the planet while jetting off to far-flung parts of the globe. ‘The surprising thing is that Ed Miliband thinks hard-working taxpayers should have to pay John Prescott’s bills again. ‘It would be a disaster if the John Prescott global vanity tour was allowed to obscure the important task of tackling climate change.’ Lord Prescott did not respond to a request for comment.","Lord Prescott has made trips to China, India, the US, Russia and France .

"The married British diplomat accused of conducting a sordid prison affair with a convicted drug dealer has broken her silence about the scandal, telling friends it was ‘a huge error of judgment’ on her part. But despite confessing her naivety in forming a friendship with the man known as Bali’s ‘Mr Big’, Alys Harahap also feels the Foreign Office has ‘thrown her to the wolves’. Harahap, a mother of two, was suspended by officials last month after she befriended Julian Ponder, the British-born ringleader of a drug-smuggling syndicate, who claimed that he and the Cambridge graduate were in love. She denies their relationship was intimate, branding Ponder’s claims of secret prison trysts as ‘malicious, nasty and ridiculous’. Alys Harahap has told friends she did not have an affair with convicted drug dealer Julian Ponder when she visited the Bali prison where he was being held on behalf of the British Consul . As vice-consul, Harahap met Ponder, 44, when he and three accomplices – including British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford – were jailed at the island’s Kerobokan prison. Yesterday family friends of Harahap, who is described as ‘a brilliant academic but hardly street-wise’ insisted: ‘Ponder was depressed and Alys worried he might harm himself. She responded by empathising with him. She felt sorry for him and tried to reassure him that she too had felt the same at times in her life. But she never hugged him or made any sort of physical contact. ‘Now she realises in her effort to try to help him she was terribly naive. She exchanged far too much personal information with Ponder.’ Friends insist Harahap is now living in fear of her life and has become so stressed that she has twice been admitted to hospital. One friend even questioned why she was ever allowed to visit antiques restorer Ponder unaccompanied. ‘Alys had no previous experience in consular work, no proper training and no support or guidance,’ he said. ‘To allow Alys to visit these prisoners on her own was absurd. We all believe the Foreign Office showed an extraordinary lack of care and welfare for her. Its actions put Alys’s safety at risk. ‘Alys was – and still is – forbidden by them to speak out and yet her silence has been wrongly misconstrued as guilt. Meanwhile, Ponder has continued to harass her. Presumably the Foreign Office has to investigate any allegations made against a diplomat. But in not robustly defending her as it should have done, it has simply thrown her to the wolves.’ Allegations that Alys is ready to leave her Indonesian husband to be with Ponder are nonsense, said the source. ‘Alys is a happily married young woman with two children. There is no way she would have even entertained an affair with a convicted criminal.’ Harahap visited Kerobokan Prison in Bali to see Ponder when she was working for the British Consul . The revelations are the latest twist in the story of ‘death-row grandmother’ Lindsay Sandiford, 58, who was sentenced in 2013 and whose execution by firing squad is believed to be imminent. The former legal secretary from Cheltenham was caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.5 million from Thailand to Bali in 2012. She claims she was forced to act as a drugs mule by a syndicate who threatened the lives of her sons in England. The other gang members convicted include Paul Beales, 41, and Ponder’s partner Rachel Dougall, 41 – sentenced to four years and one year respectively. Ponder was sentenced to six years. Harahap took up her position as vice-consul in Bali in February 2014. Part of her role involved visiting and helping British people in jail over there, although, according to the source, Sandiford didn’t want any help and always refused to see Harahap or anyone else from the British Consul. The Foreign Office first investigated Harahap’s relationship with Ponder last March after the prison complained to the British Consulate that she had been caught kissing and embracing Ponder on a visit. The mother of two with her Indonesian husband Teguh Umara . ‘It was not appropriate for them to act like that,’ the prison governor told The Jakarta Post. Harahap, who was questioned in London, denied any wrongdoing and remained in her job. She was suspended only last month when the Foreign Office became aware of tape recordings said to reveal intimate conversations between the two. Last week, however, friends of Harahap continued to deny there was even so much as an embrace between the pair. The friend took up her side of the story: ‘In March Alys accompanied Ponder to a local hospital for a routine check up. 'He is a convicted criminal, a drugs lord, and yet she was put in the vulnerable position of expecting to take him to hospital by herself.’ It was during this visit, claims the friend, that Ponder began threatening Harahap. ‘This is a job primarily where she was to offer support and she wanted to help people who found themselves in prison in a foreign country,’ said the source. ‘And wanting to help, she chatted to Ponder. ‘Whether or not he became infatuated with Alys, we don’t know. But he began calling her every day. ‘He constantly messaged her, saying she was duty-bound to visit a prisoner if requested. ‘When she said she was too busy, he became extremely upset. Certainly she realised how naive she’d been when Ponder told her he’d recorded conversations they had shared and was planning to sell them to the press, as taken out of context these could have given the wrong impression. 'He also said he knew of people who could impersonate her voice on the phone and would doctor recordings. ‘She realises she should have told her superiors but, then again, this was a new job and she was anxious not to give the wrong impression. ‘She was terrified. Ponder said he knew where she lived. She was beside herself with worry for the welfare of her children and husband if she did not agree to his demands.’ Fearful, Harahap asked for extra security at her home but was told she’d have to fund it herself. Friends said Harahap felt let down by the Foreign Office who she felt should not have allowed her to visit Ponder alone . The friend further alleges: ‘Over the next few weeks three mobiles belonging to Alys were stolen along with her bank cards. She now wonders if Ponder was behind this. ‘Certainly Ponder became obsessed with Alys, and wanted her to visit him every day in prison. If she didn’t visit, he would fly into a terrifying rage. She refused. But she simply didn't have the nous to be able to cope. ‘While her husband and close friends knew the affair allegation was rubbish, Alys was devastated,’ said the friend. ‘By now even Ponder had confirmed in writing to her superiors that they’d never had a romantic or physical relationship and she’d cut off all contact with him. ‘Alys has never ever said anything of an explicit or sexual nature to Ponder. Bizarrely he even sends her texts now – which she never responds to – apologising for his lies. He just seems to be totally obsessed with her. ‘Before this nightmare Alys had a promising career with the Foreign Office. She has won a consular excellence award and has been praised for her high standards, support and guidance. Yet in her bid to do the job to the best of her ability she has made errors of judgment. ‘But so have others with far more experience, and yet she finds herself being the only one singled out, the person who is being blamed.’","Alys Harahap has told friends she never had an affair with Julian Ponder .

"A California woman says she woke up from shoulder surgery only to find a series of increasingly creepy text messages from her anesthesiologist nurse. Darcy White told reporters she was only set for some reconstructive surgery and didn't remember much until waking up Monday. That's when she found the disturbing messages on her phone. Scroll down for video . California woman Darcy White says a nurse got her cell phone number while she was in for the hospital for surgery, then proceeded to text her inappropriate personal messages . 'The next thing I remember is waking up Monday morning and reading through a series of text messages and call logs,' she told KERO Bakersfield. She said the nurse not only commented on her appearance in the messages but her clothing size as well. A friend, Randall Anthony, was with her at the hospital and says he witnessed the harassment. 'It continued and then on Monday, she said he called again and she already called the hospital I think,' he said.

"Wearing glossy lipstick and sporting glamorous wigs, they engage in banter with Ant and Dec about the size of Kim Kardashian’s bottom and ‘boobs’. It’s a typically risqué moment for ITV’s Loose Women – yet to the horror of watching parents, these panellists are just five and six years old. The four girls had been taken out of school to appear on the flagship day-time show in a moment that has been accused of humiliating and objectifying the children. Wearing make-up, the four girls aged between five and six years old were dressed as mini versions of the Loose Women for the interview on Saturday Night Takeaway . Wearing make-up, they were dressed as ‘little women’ for the interview with the Geordie comics, who famously use mini versions of themselves to interview guests on Saturday Night Takeaway. During the Friday feature, seen by around one million viewers and dubbed ‘little women quiz big boys’, the children – dressed to resemble the show’s regular presenters – read out scripted questions they appeared embarrassed to ask, with one child too nervous to even speak. One of them was required to ask the I’m A Celebrity duo about their on-stage encounter with Kim Kardashian at the Brits last week. The girl, who appeared not to understand the sexualised nature of the question, asked: ‘How big is her bum?’ Loose Women presenters Nadia Sawalha (left) and Sherrie Hewson (right) are pictured with their tiny dopplegangers . Andrea McLean (left) and Jane Moore (right) are also pictured with their 'mini mes' who have all been dressed in matching oufits and wigs . ‘That was the biggest topic of conversation,’ Ant joked, adding: ‘Is it real, is it implants? It’s fascinating. It’s because she’s so thin in the waist and her legs are thin.’ Between roars of laughter, Dec quipped in front of the children: ‘To be honest, I didn’t look. I was too busy looking at her boobs.’ Last night, Camila Batmanghelidjh, chief executive of charity Kids Company, said the children had been exploited for ratings and turned into objects, adding: ‘For the children it would have been a difficult experience, even though they may have appeared to have gone along with it. ‘In effect, it’s turning the kids into objects in order to deliver a joke. ‘It is an adult joke and the children are being used to deliver something which is essentially adult humour. ‘It’s poor judgment to place the children in that kind of environment in front of such a wide audience. In the world of children, body scrutiny has become a big problem. Children are very coy about these things. During the Friday feature dubbed ‘little women quiz big boys’, the children – dressed to resemble the show’s regular presenters – read out scripted questions including one girl who spoke to the duo about their on-stage encounter with Kim Kardashian at the Brits last week and asked: ‘How big is her bum?’ But the presenters have come under . ‘They find it very difficult and they struggle to even go there. I am surprised no one thought this through properly.’ And broadcaster and psychologist Oliver James said: ‘A commentary about the desirability of a woman’s body is not appropriate in front of children.’ Their comments were echoed by angry viewers, who took to the show’s Facebook page to criticise the stunt. Aimee Phillips wrote: ‘Shouldn’t they be in school? Us parents get fined if our kids are off school. SHOCKING.’ But one of the children’s parents, Katie Bee, hit back, writing: ‘My daughter is still very much a “child”. She loved it and is already asking when she can next go on TV.’ An ITV insider said: ‘Ant and Dec weren’t aware of the questions before they came on and everyone on set, including the children, had a great time.’ A Loose Women spokeswoman said that no complaints had been received, adding: ‘The children were actors and were given permission by their schools. ‘Each child was accompanied by a parent or guardian. The children and their parents or guardians were happy with the questions, which were agreed in advance.’ Loose Women (L-R) Andrea McLean, Nadia Sawalha, Sherrie Hewson and Jane Moore are pictured with their 'mini mes' for Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway .","Girls appeared on Saturday Night Live feature 'little women quiz big boys'

"An army of Islamic State terrorists has advanced to the outskirts of Vienna, Spain has cut off routes to Gibraltar and Nigel Farage – prime minister of 'Great England' – has deported all immigrants who have arrived in the past ten years. This, according to the BBC, is what the world would be like if the European Union were to collapse. The apocalyptic vision of a continent in which social order has broken down – to be screened on BBC4 tonight at 10pm – has been condemned by Eurosceptic critics as 'scaremongering'. Scroll down for video . Calamity: The Great European Disaster Movie, according to the BBC, is what the world would be like if the European Union were to collapse . The 75-minute film shows what the supposedly impartial broadcaster suggests might happen should the EU implode, and depicts the final days of the European dream as it turns into a nightmare of worthless currencies and predictions of even darker days to come. The BBC describes The Great European Disaster Movie as an 'authored documentary', but the film – which features comedian Angus Deayton as an archaeologist struggling to explain what the single currency was to a young girl sitting next to him on a plane – has been criticised as a hyped-up piece of pro-EU propaganda. Horrifying images of concentration camp victims are interspersed with wartime footage of devastated cities, while commentary is provided by former Economist editor Bill Emmott, who made the film with Italian journalist Annalisa Piras. The terrifying sequence of events ends with Angela Merkel resigning as European Council president and overseeing a vote to abolish the EU. In his commentary, Mr Emmott admits immigration imposes financial burdens on nations but insists that in the long term it creates the resources needed to maintain a welfare state. In the film, the girl – apparently being deported from Britain because she has an Italian mother – asks Angus Deayton about pictures of bridges on an old euro banknote. He tells her: 'They were supposed to symbolise unity, unification, all the countries being connected. It was a great idea but unfortunately it didn't work.' 'Faction': The BBC describes The Great European Disaster Movie as an 'authored documentary', but the film has been criticised as a hyped-up piece of pro-EU propaganda. Mr Emmott and Ms Piras say the film expresses their personal views and is intended to provoke debate. But last night it was condemned by Tory eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash as 'scaremongering'. He said: 'It would be much better if the BBC provided us with a proper analysis of what has gone wrong with European structures.' And Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said: 'This is typical of the pro-EU side. They make such ludicrous claims they make themselves look ridiculous.' Tonight's broadcast will be followed by a discussion by a panel of guests including Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens and Ukip MP Mark Reckless. A BBC spokesman said: 'BBC editorial guidelines do not prevent the commissioning of programmes which approach subjects from a particular perspective.' And Mr Emmott said: 'It's a warning of what could happen if Europe continues on its current path.' Comment by PETER HITCHENS . Even the BBC sometimes grasps that it has gone too far. And 11 days ago, it went into a five-star panic over its plan to show a more-or-less crazy pro-EU film tonight. I assume that, spooked by the derisive reaction to its laughable pro-Labour drama A Casual Vacancy, its chiefs suddenly realised that they had another embarrassment on their hands. The planned transmission was abruptly cut by several minutes, losing a large chunk about the migration wave across the Mediterranean. And this helped make space for a post-programme discussion, heavily loaded with critics of the European Union, including me, former Chancellor Norman Lamont and Ukip MP Mark Reckless. This is really a figleaf to cover its naked bias, as you will see when you watch it tonight. I took part because it seemed silly to miss any opportunity to make the case for British independence. I'm very happy for Bill Emmott to make as many films as he likes for the BBC about the wonders of the EU. The trouble is, you cannot imagine the Corporation giving anyone the chance to make a film about how miserable it will be if Britain stays in, and how good it will be if we leave. For this programme is blatant propaganda. And the only cause for joy is that it's not very good propaganda. A doomed plane is zig-zagging across a divided, blacked-out Europe, bearing Angus Deayton and a little girl who has supposedly been deported from a xenophobic, cruel England because her mother isn't paid enough. This provides the excuse for a patronising series of lecturettes from Mr Deayton. Everything about it is run through with the stupid, ill-informed prejudices of the BBC. Opponents of the EU are portrayed as 'anti-European' nostalgists and haters of abroad. Opponents of immigration are portrayed as dislikers of immigrants. Things which are the EU's own fault, such as its self-inflicted economic crisis, are not blamed on the EU. Wild fantasies are explored in which a British departure causes everyone else to leave – though why they would, if it is so wonderful, I cannot tell. Baseless guff, about how the EU has brought peace, is repeated unquestioned. In fact, to the extent that it has had any influence on war and peace, the EU has brought war, most recently thanks to its aggressive push into Ukraine. Winston Churchill's Zurich speech of 1946, which it partly quotes, is a plea for continental Europe to unite, with Britain, the USA and the USSR acting as outside sponsors. Oh, and the Berlin airport for which the fictitious plane is originally bound closed in 2008, as anyone who knows Europe would be aware.","Apocalyptic vision of Europe descending into social chaos aired tonight .

"An apparent joke between a mother and son has ended in criminal charges after the boy’s father failed to see the funny side of receiving a photo of the child with his face covered in duct tape. Tiffany Ennis, 31, of Sandusky, Ohio, sent a text message with a picture of her 8-year-old son with his forehead, eyes, and mouth duct-taped to the boy's father, Rudy Yado, on Monday. No message was attached to the photo. The estranged couple exchanged angry texts before Ennis put the phone down on Yado. Tiffany Ennis sent her son's father this picture of their 8-year-old boy with his forehead, eyes, and mouth duct-taped . Tiffany Ennis, 31, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of child endangerment . Fearing for his son's safety, Yado contacted Sandusky police and asked officers to check on the boy at Ennis' home. Ennis told police she was playing around with duct tape with her friend and their kids and that she had wrapped tape over her son's eyes and mouth because they both thought it was funny, according to the police report. Only the boy's nose was left uncovered. She also taped up the head of an 11-year-old girl, according to the police report. The report did not identify the parents of the girl. Ennis said it was not meant to be hurtful and they were joking around, the report said. Estranged couple: Tiffany Ennis and Rudy Yado exchanged angry texts before Ennis put the phone down on her son's father . Detective Sgt. Dana Newell of the Sandusky police department went to Ennis' home on Feb. 19 with Erie County Child Services to check on the children. 'I think somebody made a bad judgement,' he said.

"Ed Miliband's plan to cut university tuition fees is facing internal opposition with predictions it could cause a civil war within the party . Ed Miliband's plan to cut university tuition fees was yesterday facing mounting opposition - with even a former Labour No10 aide joining the attack. There were predictions last night that the party could descend into civil war over the controversial proposals after ex-Tony Blair aide Huw Evans was joined by the leader of Britain's nurses in challenging the plans. Mr Miliband has said his pledge to slash the fees from £9,000 a year to £6,000 is 'cast-iron', adding the plan will be a 'red line' in any possible future coalition talks. But the plan – to be paid for by cutting middle-class pension pots – has been condemned as 'financial illiteracy' by some critics, while university chiefs warn it could jeopardise the scrutiny of their long-term funding. The policy has also led to more than four years of rows within the Shadow Cabinet, with claims that Ed Balls repeatedly warned Mr Miliband that the £2.9billion fees cut was difficult to fund. Mr Evans, speaking in his capacity as director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), joined a growing number of pensions experts to challenge Labour's plans. Mr Evans, who worked for Mr Blair from 2005 to 2006 and is also a former adviser to ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett, said: 'The pensions and long-term savings industry supports reform of tax relief but this is not the way to do it. 'We need a focus on reforming the pension tax relief system as a whole to make it fairer, better value and encourage saving from middle earners, rather than piecemeal cutting back the existing system to pay for other policy objectives.' Under the Labour plan, tax relief for pensioners with incomes more than £150,000 would be cut from 45p to 20p while the tax-free lifetime allowance on a pension would drop from £1.25million to £1million. But the proposals could also hit people due to retire with a pension pot worth just £26,000 a year from an annuity while young people saving just £400 a month may also be affected. The plans have led to fears nurses, teachers and firefighters could also be hit. Dr Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Helping students financially is important. However, this must not be at the expense of hard-working nurses. We will examine these proposals to ensure their pensions will not be affected.' Last night the comments were seized on by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He wrote to his Labour opposite number, Andy Burnham, saying: 'I wanted to ensure you are fully aware of the impact of this announcement on NHS staff. For example, if a nurse team leader earning around £35,500, who is in a final salary, defined benefit pension scheme, achieves the promotion to matron they have been working 25 years to achieve, they will face a tax charge of £5,000 on their pension pot. This is what happens when policies are not properly thought through.' But Mr Miliband has claimed the pensions raid would hit only the very wealthy. He said: 'The scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people, it is a burden on our country.'

"Should the day ever come when the dead do rise from their graves a new disaster preparedness kit could give you an edge in those chaotic first hours for the reasonable cost of $1,499. Called the First 24, the 12'' by 9'' waterproof and dust tight kit includes a revolver, flashlight, emergency signals, fire starter, compass, 550 Para cord, batteries, and a battery caddy. To ensure that all of this stays in good condition while on the run from the ravenous hordes, the case is also resistant to UV, solvents, corrosion and fungus. Scroll down for video . The First 24 kit holds a revolver, flashlight, emergency signals, fire starter, compass, 550 Para cord, batteries, and a battery caddy . The kit's gun can take ammo for short and long-range targets ensuring you get the drop on the living dead . Fox News reports that Taurus International Manufacturing Inc. is selling the kit with the promise that 'Having the right gear at your finger tips can ensure a positive outcome to a life-threatening crisis.' The revolver, dubbed the 'Taurus Judge' by the company, a three inch barrel gun that can take both 45 Colt ammo for long distances and .410 2-1/2'' shotshells for close-range targets. Buyers can customize it with fiber optic front sights, fixed rear sights, and a rubber grip. As for the knife, it is a fixed blade tactical knife with two edges made of what the company calls a 'nearly indestructible form' of carbon steel. And with power grids likely failing along with the rest of society, it's a good thing that the case include a Brite Strike EPLI flashlight, the same model that won the NRA's 2013 American Hunter Gear of the Year award. Assuming you get into a situation where rescue might be possible, there are also plenty of emergency signals. The Taurus company notes that being prepared can make the difference between life or death in the first hours of a national disaster . The entire kit is built to be waterproof and withstand shocks so it stays together on the run through chaos . The kit's All Purpose Adhesive Light Strips, also from Brite Strike, can be seen for up to a mile and can be set to fast strobe, slow strobe, and steady. The lights are also waterproof, dustrproof, and shockproof just like the case. For absolute basic survival needs a good fire starter is a must, and Taurus covers that with a Emergency Fire Starter Kit from Zippo that contains a flint wheel ignition to light up water-resistant Waxed Tinder Sticks. A 550 Para cord, the same kind of nylon rope used in World War II parachute suspension lines, rounds out the kit and could have multiple applications. While these items will no doubt be helpful anywhere, a new study suggests you'd be best off having them in the hills. Researchers from Cornell University Alexander Alemi, Matthew Bierbaum, Christopher Myers and James Sethna used an approach for modelling disease to work out how an actual outbreak might play out. New research suggests the kit might be most effective if you're already safely hidden in the mountains . 'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' said researcher Alexander Alemi . They found that cities would fall quickly, but it would take weeks for zombies to penetrate into less densely populated areas, and months to reach northern parts of the mountain-time zone. Their advice is to head for the Rockies. The research involved results from simulations the researchers wrote themselves, similar to modelling chemical reactions. Also in the kit is an emergency light, compass, fire starter, and knife . 'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' Alemi told phys.org. There are four states a person can be in (human, infected, zombie, dead zombie), and these are dependent on possible interactions (zombie bites human, human kills zombie, zombie moves etc). 'Given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down - there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate,' says Alemi. 'I'd love to see a fictional account where most of New York City falls in a day, but upstate New York has a month or so to prepare.' The researchers aim to add more complicated social variables to their simulation such as awareness of the outbreak and ability to make a run for it. The group were inspired by graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading 'World War Z: an oral history of the first zombie war' by Max Brooks. Characters on 'The Walking Dead' have tried several different hide outs from the zombie apocalypse, including a remote farm and a prison, but researchers at Cornell think they have found the ideal place to go . Hollywood has had American survivors taking refuges in a shopping mall in 'Dawn of the Dead' (left), while Brits choose to head to their local pub in 'Shaun of the Dead' (right) Indeed the conclusions of their research match up with some of the plot points of the book, which sees the U.S. abandon two-thirds of the country and retreat behind the Rockies to regroup before launching a counterattack. The Cornell team are less optimistic about our prospects. The abstract for their research ends with the line: 'We build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the United States, and discover that for ""realistic"" parameters, we are largely doomed.' Despite this, since 2011 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has playfully used a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool for teaching emergency preparedness. The group presents its findings during the 2015 American Physical Society March Meeting, on Thursday, March 5 in San Antonio, Texas.","Researchers from Cornell University created a simulation of a zombie outbreak using techniques for modelling real diseases .

"The U.S. Air Force has a quarter of the number of fighter squadrons it did 25 years ago and two-thirds of the active duty airmen,  a drop that threatens U.S. air superiority, defense officials told lawmakers on Friday. 'Enough is enough,' Air Force Secretary Deborah James told lawmakers in the House of Representatives as she defended a Pentagon budget request that exceeds federal spending caps. 'Given the state of the world ... the number one thing we have to stop is this downsizing.' But members of the defense appropriations subcommittee said President Barack Obama's 2016 Pentagon base budget of $534 billion exceeded spending caps by nearly $35 billion and would have to be cut. Scroll down for video . Air Force Secretary Deborah James told lawmakers in the House of Representatives: 'Given the state of the world ... the number one thing we have to stop is this downsizing' Air Force officials said that 14 years on non-stop war have stretched the service branch at its smallest and has stretched it to the breaking point . Some $10 billion of that would have to come from the Air Force request, they said. 'The budget he (Obama) submitted ... frankly is politically ... a fantasy,' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. 'It's not going to pass, and he knows that.' Cole said he hoped lawmakers ultimately would be able to reach a bipartisan deal to provide some relief from the spending limits. Until that happens, however, 'we're going to have to live within the numbers that we have under the law, and sadly, that means we're going to have to make a lot of tough choices' about cutting billions from the Air Force spending request, he said. Air Force officials said the force is older and smaller than it has ever been, and after 14 years of continuous warfare is being stretched to the breaking point. 'When we deployed to Operation Desert Storm in 1990, our Air Force had 188 fighter squadrons in the inventory. This budget will take us to 49,' said General Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff. 'There were 511,000 active duty airmen during Desert Storm. We have 200,000 fewer today.' U.S. air superiority has also been threatened by the cuts, officials said . James said Air Force planes had an average age of 27 years, and Welsh said updating the fleet was imperative. 'The option of not modernizing isn't really an option at all,' Welsh said. 'Air forces that fall behind the technology curve, and joint forces without the full breadth of air, space and cyber power ... will lose.' James said if the Air Force had to cut another $10 billion, it would reduce purchases of Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter by 14, cancel work on a fuel-efficient engine and reduce the number of reconnaissance aircraft in service.","A quarter of the number of fighter squadrons it did 25 years ago and two-thirds of the active duty airmen .

"They could be any other young tourists arriving for a winter holiday in Turkey. But instead of heading towards a local hostel, these three girls are preparing to board a bus for the 17-hour trip to the Syrian border. This image shows Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase on their way to become ‘jihadi brides’ for Islamic State terrorists. Spotted: New CCTV footage shows the three UK schoolgirls waiting at Bayrampasa bus station in Istanbul . The teenagers sparked an international manhunt last month by slipping out of their East London homes to join extremists fighting a so-called ‘holy war’. Grainy CCTV footage shows the GCSE pupils waiting at Bayrampasa bus station, in a suburb on the west side of Istanbul, before the final leg of their treacherous trip. Hours earlier, on February 17, they had landed on a Turkish Airlines flight from Gatwick after telling their families they were going out for the day. The images were released as the UK’s top counter-terrorism officer revealed about 60 British women, including at least 18 teenagers, had travelled to Syria to join the barbaric Muslim fanatics. 'Groomed': Shamima Begum (right) is thought to have been contacted directly using Twitter by a female IS fighter. She later flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey with friends Kadiza Sultana, left, 16, and Amira Abase . Amira Abase (L) and Shamima Begum (R) were spotted on grainy CCTV footage alongside Kadiza Sultana . Spotted: The trio were seen entering Istanbul's Esenler bus station in the early hours on February 18, just hours after they disappeared from their homes in London . Crowds: The three teenagers are seen mingling amongst crowds at the bus station. They are believed to now have been smuggled into Syria . Detective Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball, of the Metropolitan Police, said the youngest were just 15. Campaigners said the schoolgirls had been the victims of ruthless ‘ideological grooming’ by IS using social media websites. Almost 20 teenage girls fled Britain to join Islamic extremists in Syria last year. At least 60 women and girls have travelled to join ISIS altogether. The stream of young women covertly leaving their families in the UK to live in the Islamic State is a 'growing problem' of 'real concern'. Figures were revealed by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball. The Met's National Coordinator for Counter Terrorism added that police are in talks with the Government about getting 'extra resources' to combat the worrying trend. Ms Ball told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show in the last year 22 young women have travelled to Syria. Of those, all but four of the 22 were aged 20 or younger. She said: 'The last five who've travelled were aged 15 and 16. 'This is a growing problem and it's one of real concern.' Yesterday’s footage shows the latest three, all pupils at Bethnal Green Academy, waiting 17 hours at the station after buying tickets to Urfa, near the Syrian border. Calmly carrying their luggage and chatting among themselves, they seem composed and confident as they move between the crowds. They also appear to have changed from the clothes they were wearing when leaving Gatwick to more traditional Islamic dress. The five images of the girls were taken between 8.27pm local time (6.27pm GMT) on February 17 and 1.22pm local time (11.22am GMT) the following day. A week after the trio left their homes, Scotland Yard said they were believed to have entered Syria. Smugglers in the Turkish border town of Akcakale said they had crossed the border using false Syrian IDs, accompanied by a man claiming to be their father. Police believe they are currently in the terror stronghold of Raqqa, where they face being married off to foreign fighters. Neither Turkish Airlines nor the UK Border Force reported that the girls were intending to travel unaccompanied to the region, despite it being a key staging post on the journey to Syria. Scotland Yard has also denied taking three days to inform officials in Turkey about the girls’ planned journey, insisting it was liaising with the Turkish authorities a day after the girls vanished. MPs have called for an inquiry into the effectiveness of border controls in stopping British youngsters travelling to the war zone. Flight to terror: Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to Istanbul last week. Police believe they have now been smuggled into Syria . Lured to jihad: Kadiza Sultana, 16, left, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and Amira Abase, 15, right, at Gatwick Airport. There are fears they are to be married off as 'jihadi brides' to Islamic State terrorists . Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Miss Ball said police were increasingly concerned about the growing trend of young women planning to make the journey from Britain – many of whom are disguised to avoid suspicion. She said: ‘This is a growing problem and it’s one of real concern. The more everybody involved in travel can be alert and be vigilant and look out for people the better. 'This is about vigilance of everyone who is working in the industry … some of those women and girls are very carefully prepared for their travel so that they don’t stand out. They take unusual routes and it is very hard to spot them.’ Kalsoom Bashir, co-director of the counter-extremism organisation Inspire, said it was ‘shocking but not surprising’ that young girls were being lured to Syria. She said IS had a ‘very specific campaign’ to target young and vulnerable women by ‘hooking into their vulnerabilities’. She said the women who were being ‘ideologically groomed’ were getting younger and younger.

"Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris is to be stripped of his CBE 'within days' Rolf Harris is to be stripped of his CBE in a matter of days after being convicted of child sex offences. Officials have reviewed whether the 84-year-old disgraced entertainer should have the honour removed following his conviction last year for sexually assaulting girls as young as eight. The Australian was awarded a CBE in 2006 for his services to entertainment and the arts but formal approval of the revocation of the honour is expected shortly. The decision by the Honours Forfeiture Committee will be approved by Prime Minister David Cameron and the Queen before being officially published. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who wrote an acclaimed book on the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, campaigned for the removal of the CBE. He said: 'I find it difficult to understand why it has taken this committee so long. 'A number of paedophiles, of which Rolf Harris is one, have held significant honours, including Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith. They used their power and cloak of respectability to abuse children.' Mr Danczuk had only this week written to Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude asking him for an update on plans to strip Harris of his CBE. He added: 'They have come close to bringing the whole honours system into disrepute, and you would have their honours would have been removed more quickly. 'The Australians acted more quickly against Rolf Harris than we did.' Harris, once among the Queen's favourite entertainers, was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later . He was awarded CBE in 2006, a year after he painted The Queen's 80th birthday portrait. But he was jailed in July last year for nearly six years for 12 indecent assaults against four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986. During sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: 'Your reputation lies in ruins. You have been stripped of your honours and you have no one to blame but yourself.' Seven of the 12 counts related to the friend of Harris's daughter Bindi, including one incident when she was 15 when he seriously sexually assaulted her while Bindi slept in the adjacent bed. Earlier this week, Harris was stripped of his Order of Australia honour and he has also had his BAFTA Fellowship removed. The entertainer's conviction caused widespread revulsion in Australia and Britain, where his television programs were watched by millions of children. Harris, pictured left with his CBE in 2006 and right during his trial last year, caused widespread revulsion in Australia and Britain where his television shows were watched by millions . All public traces of the entertainer have been removed from his home town of Bassendean in Western Australia following his convictions, while a plaque outside his childhood home has been demolished. His artworks have also been removed from the council chambers, and his status as a freeman of the city has been revoked. Harris, whose fortune is estimated at £11 million was the second person to be convicted under a wide-ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late Jimmy Savile, a fellow BBC star, was a prolific abuser. Campaigners criticised the Government last month after it emerged Harris still held a CBE six months after his conviction.","Australian entertainer Rolf Harris is to be stripped of his CBE 'within days'

"Police are investigating claims that a fox was killed in a hunt hosted by David Cameron’s father-in-law. Hunt protesters clashed with the York & Ainsty South Hunt amid claims that eight hounds chased and killed the fox after setting off from the 18th Century country estate of Sutton Park, in North Yorkshire, owned by Samantha Cameron’s father Sir Reginald Sheffield. The hunt saboteurs allege that a member of the hunt – the ‘whipper-in’ whose job it is to keep the pack of hounds together – tried to take the animal’s lifeless body away but fled when a protester came across the scene. Afterwards, the Hunt Saboteurs Association, who had been monitoring the hunt on Saturday, February 21, posted gruesome photos of a dead fox dripping with blood on social media. Police are investigating claims that a fox was killed in a hunt hosted by David Cameron's father-in-law after a graphic photograph of a dead animal was posted online . The hunt had met at the home of Samantha Cameron’s 68-year-old father, in the village of Sutton-on-the-Forest, before setting off on a legal ‘trail hunt’. Last night a spokesman for the hunt claimed the fox had not been killed by its hounds. But hunt saboteur Jay Gillette, 20, said: ‘We were following the huntsmen through a woodland, and then the hounds started to cry, which means they were on the scent of a fox. 'So we did our best to put them off – we used horn calls to try and stop them from chasing the fox. We use the same horn that a huntsman would use. ‘I then saw a fox bolt along the edge of the woodland so I raced over that way. The best way to stop the hounds from following is to get in between them and the fox. Once I got to the fence where I saw the fox run past, I saw about eight to ten of the hounds in a semi-circle and a whipper-in. ‘She was in the semi-circle with the hounds. I couldn’t see what she was doing but I believe she was trying to pick up the fox and take it away so we couldn’t see it. ‘The whipper-in then took the hounds away as soon as I got there, leaving the fox. ‘After that, none of the huntsman would talk to us. They went quiet and just carried on – moved off with the hounds to the next woodlands. Sir Reginald Sheffield (left) owns Sutton Park from which the York & Ainstry Hunt (right) took off . ‘I could see the fox’s intestines. The hounds had opened up its stomach. I believe it was still alive when the hounds left and I came to it. When I carried it back to our van I could still hear short breaths from its mouth. We then gave it to the police for evidence. I was pretty distraught.’ In 2004, Tony Blair’s Labour government banned the hunting of wild mammals with dogs. Instead, hunts now follow the trail of a scent. A spokesman for the hunt said: ‘The York & Ainsty South Hunt were involved in legal trail hunting and were afterwards asked by police whether a fox had been killed by hounds. The answer to that was no. It’s not unusual for hunt saboteurs, who’ve been harassing the legal activity on regular occasions, to make up such stories. From looking at the photos of the animal there was no indication of how it was killed.’ A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: ‘We are aware of reports a fox was hunted illegally in the Sutton-on-the-Forest area. We take any allegation of wildlife crime seriously, and our enquiries into this incident are ongoing.’ Sir Reginald Sheffield was not available for comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Protesters claim eight York & Ainsty hounds chased and killed the fox .

"Security breach: Royal protection has been stepped upfollowing the incident at Windsor Castle . Royal protection has been stepped up after armed police swooped on a tourist who breached the security cordon close to the Queen's private apartments at Windsor Castle. The intruder, a visitor from Japan, set off a major alert when he entered an unlocked door in a restricted area at the Royal residence. The incident came at a time when the official terror alert is set at severe, meaning an attack is ‘highly likely’. Startled castle wardens raised the alarm after spotting the tourist, who is believed to have been taking photographs in the high-security zone. Officers found him in an area used by servants and staff beneath the grand State Apartments, close to the Grand Staircase leading to St George’s Hall – the setting for State banquets – and eventually to the private apartments where Her Majesty spends most weekends. The hapless tourist was held and questioned by police for a short period but was released after officers were satisfied that he did not pose a security threat. The Queen was not at Windsor at the time, on February 12, but the major security gaffe has led to extra ‘pat-downs’ for thousands of visitors. It is thought the man had inadvertently gained access to the off-limits area via an internal door that had accidentally been left unlocked near the popular Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House attraction. To get to this point in the tour, the visitor would have climbed Castle Hill after passing through security at the castle entrance, then skirted the Round Tower above St George’s Chapel, before accessing those parts of the Royal Apartments open to the public. A Palace source said the incident has led to closer scrutiny of visitors to the castle, with additional checks and measures now in place to prevent similar slip-ups. A Royal spokesman said: ‘While completing the public visitor route within Windsor Castle, a visitor was able to gain inadvertent access to an administrative area which is not routinely open to the public. The intruder, a visitor from Japan, set off a major alert when he entered an unlocked door in a restricted area at the Royal residence . A map indicates the route that the Japanese tourist took to get just yards from the Queen's private appartment . ‘He was subsequently identified by on-duty Royal Collection Trust wardens and police officers and detained. 'He was released after checks indicated that he posed no security risk. Her Majesty the Queen and other members of the Royal Family were not in residence.’ At the point where he was found in an off-limits area on the ground floor of the State Apartments, the tourist was just a few steps from Windsor Castle’s Grand Staircase, leading – via a single corridor – to the splendours of St George’s Hall, the setting for lavish State banquets. Heading in a straight line along the 237ft length of St George’s Hall, he could then have walked directly into the Castle’s Private Chapel, with the Crimson Drawing Room in the Queen’s private apartments just beyond. Scotland Yard is responsible for security at the site. A police spokesman said: ‘On February 12, 2015, a visitor to Windsor Castle entered an administrative area not open to the public. He was detained by police and Palace staff and released once it was established that he posed no security risk.’ Royal residences are protected sites under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, and trespass is a criminal offence. Visitors must remain within the public area and risk prosecution for straying into private areas. All Royal residences are currently on high alert because of fears of a terrorist attack. The Mail on Sunday revealed in December how security chiefs had taken the dramatic step of withdrawing Royal Guards from their high-profile posts outside palaces in London amid safety fears. The guards at both Clarence House and St James’s Palace have been moved inside the gates, and armed police have been deployed to guard the soldiers at Horse Guards Parade and the sentry boxes in Windsor. Private: The Crimson Drawing Room in the Queen's apartments at Windsor Castle . This newspaper also disclosed last month how security fears had led to the installation at Windsor Castle of the same anti-terrorist bollards used to protect US diplomats in Afghanistan. Last month’s incident is thought to be most serious security alert at Windsor Castle since lorry driver Robert Pennefather scaled a fence and was apprehended by armed Royal protection officers just 20 yards from the Queen’s apartments in 2011. Pennefather, of Co Tipperary, said later he couldn’t remember the alcohol-fuelled intrusion and apologised to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. He was fined £1,000 and given a suspended two-week jail term. Castle security was also famously breached in 2003 when ‘comedy terrorist’ Aaron Barschak scaled the walls and crashed Prince William’s 21st birthday party dressed as Osama Bin Laden in drag.","Royal protection was stepped up after a tourist breached security cordon .

"By the tender age of eight years old, Lachlan De Vries had lost both his parents to their devastating battles with depression. His father John, 21, took his life when Lachlan was just two years old, and five years later his mother Richelle Turpin, 26, tragically did the same on the 9th of March, 2014. Although the young boy has been orphaned by the tragedy mental illness imposed upon his life, he is now under the care of his late mother's loving fiance, Jeremy De Vries - who is in the process of adopting the young boy. Scroll down for video . Lachlan De Vries (centre), 8, lost his mother Richelle Turpin (left) to suicide and is now being cared for by his late mother's fiance Jeremy De Vries (right) Elise Weller, Richelle's best friend, described her as bubbly, bright and infectious to be around . Richelle grew up in Bangor in the Sutherland Shire, about 40 kilometres south of Sydney. Her best friend Elise Weller described her  as someone who would go above and beyond for the people in her life, and said everyone who knew her was shattered by her passing. 'She was always the life of the party, very bubbly, infectious smile, infectious to be around,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'She just wanted the best for everyone; she was a really beautiful person.' Richelle is survived by her son, Lachlan, and the young boy had already taken his mother's fiance's name ahead of their wedding, which was meant to go ahead in December 2014. Now almost a year since her best friend's death, Elise has started a fundraiser 'to raise money for Lachlans future so it can be a bright one'. Jeremy  is like a father to the eight-year-old, and the pair bonded immediately when they first met. 'Lachlan adores Jeremy and vice versa', Elise revealed. This is one of the last photographs taken of Richelle (left) and Elise (right), just weeks before Richelle's death . Richelle, 26, passed away when her son Lachlan was just seven. Lachlan's father also took his own life when he was two years old . 'Lachlan calls Jeremy dad, and honestly he’s such a beautiful person and for him to take on such a commitment and really, he’s not his biological father.' Elise revealed that losing the woman she'd known since she was 14 was 'the hardest thing I've ever had to go through', and is now committed to raising awareness about mental illness in young people. 'Growing up we weren't exposed to mental health,' Elise told Daily Mail Australia. 'You’re not taught about it. 'I think it would be great if it was done in the education system… because there’s such a taboo with it there’s such a stigma,' she continued. The woman said she was 'was always worried about her' and she knew something wasn't right, even when the two were growing up together as teenagers. 'I think that she was misdiagnosed as a teen and that early intervention and help wasn't available,' Elise said. 'When we were about 16 there was an incident with some Panadol… there were a few red flags. Elise said there were some 'red flags' when the pair were growing up together, and she suspected Richelle (pictured) had been battling something for a long time . Jeremy De Vries (left) had brightened up Lachlan (right) and Richelle's lives, after the devastating loss of Lachlan's biological father John, at 21 . 'When you’re growing up and going through those teenage years a lot of people think you’re just attention seeking,' she added. But Elise also said that later in life she thought Richelle never healed from the trauma inflicted when Lachlan's father passed away. 'She found John at their family home at the time, and I don’t think she ever moved on with it. I think the grief hit her later on down the track,' Elise said. 'I think she carried a lot of guilt with her,' she revealed, before adding that the strain on her as a young single mother was immense. Jeremy and Richelle got together in October 2012, news which Elise was delighted to hear. 'I remember her coming to me and telling me that she was speaking to this guy and funnily enough I've actually known Jeremy longer than I've known Richelle,' she revealed. 'I felt at ease because Jeremy is such a beautiful person.' In October 2013 Richelle was diagnosed with PTSD, due to the grief she went through losing the father of her child, but things seemed to be on track for the 26-year-old. Elise said she thought Richelle never healed from the trauma inflicted when Lachlan's father passed away . Now Jeremy (right) is looking after Lachlan full-time, and is in the process of adopting him . Richelle was seeking professional help for her depression, and she and Jeremy were planning their wedding, their family and their future. But her death came as a shock to so many around her. 'Everything seemed to be on track, she had the house, she had the wedding planned,' Elise said. 'It really hurts my heart to know she was suffering as much as she was, and she couldn't say anything. 'I've never been so devastated in my life, it was a month before my wedding. 'Not having her there on my wedding day was really hard,' she continued. The anniversary of Richelle's death is coming up next week, and Elise said she has taken the day off so she can celebrate the life of her best friend. 'I’m just going to go spend some time with her at the cemetery. I’m going to take some flowers, and a cake and I’m going to celebrate her life,' she revealed. 'I wish I could raise awareness not having to have lost my best friend, but I want to help others, even if it helps one more person. 'She would be so proud, she would be happy that other people are happy,' Elise said. Elise Weller has set up a fundraiser to help support Lachlan in years to come.

"An entire log cabin was reported missing in rural Oregon after the homeowner turned up after a year to find his backwoods lot was empty. Ronald Niederbrach called the Klamath County Sherrif's office on Tuesday to report that his 1,500 sq ft cabin - and its deck - had vanished into thin air. Police launched an investigation and by Thursday had discovered the wooden property half a mile away - and with a new owner who was allegedly sold the home by the former husband of Niederbrach's ex-girlfriend. Ronald Niederbrach called the Klamath County Sheriff's office on Tuesday to report that his 1,500 sq ft cabin - and its deck - had vanished into thin air. It was found, 48 hours later, on a different lot in Oregon (pictured) Police launched an investigation and by Thursday had discovered the wooden property half a mile away - and with a new owner who was allegedly sold the home by the former husband of Niederbrach's ex-girlfriend . What, at first, had been the mystery of the missing cabin was suddenly the mystery of who really owned the home - and a more complicated civil dispute. After talking to local residents, officers found the cabin 'in plain view', according to OregonLive. Niederbrach originally purchased land  and lived alongside  in a separate house  with his girlfriend, Paulette Kallo. After Paulette's ex-husband, Miklos Kallo, developed health problems, he moved onto the property so she could take care of him. It was Mr Kallo who built the log cabin and lived there. The Klamath Sheriff's office told Daily Mail Online all three individuals are still titled to the land. After Niederbrach and Paulette split up, he moved away. Miklos Kallo and his former wife then got back together and lived in the home she had formerly shared with Niederbrach. When that home caught on fire and became uninhabitable, the couple decided to move off the land. Last summer, Mr Kallo sold the cabin to a fourth person, who hired a logging company and transported the structure to where it stands now. It is not exactly known when Niederbrach heard his cabin  was missing, but when he called his ex-girlfriend, she claimed not to know anything. The sheriff's office were now trying to figure out who can lay claim to the cabin. They were also determining whether the case is even  criminal at all - or just a civil dispute. Detective Eric Shepherd described the whole incident as 'a mess' but said he believes the man who bought the cabin will be keeping it. 'The person who has the cabin now is completely legal,' Shepherd told Daily Mail Online. 'He did absolutely nothing wrong and did everything he was supposed to do.' Shepherd said although the purchase of the cabin was legal, the sale of the property might not have been. This is because, although Mr Kallo bought the log cabin kit that was used to build the house's exterior frame, Niederbrach claims he put a substantial amount of his own money into the house's development. 'There was a great deal of other money invested to make that a livable home,' Shepherd said. Shepherd said there may be some financial liability, but he doesn't believe it will change who ultimately gets the house. 'As far as who ends up with the cabin it won’t matter,' he said. 'It should be maintained by the person who purchased it.' But for now, the cabin remains in the Sheriff department's care. 'We have in our custody a home,' said Sheriff Frank Skrah at a press conference. 'I don’t know where we’re going to put it or where we’re going to book it, but we have a home.' Ronald Niederbrach originally purchased the land (pictured) and his former girlfriend Paulette Kallo's ex-husband built the cabin. At one point all three of their names were titled to the land .","Ronald Niederbrach reported his 1,500 sq ft home missing to Klamath County Sheriff's office on Tuesday .

"Royal rift: Princes Andrew and Charles look glum at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee service in 2012 . The clinking of cutlery and popping of corks could be heard from the other end of the corridor. Behind the partly closed gilt doors of the grand dining room at Buckingham Palace, the Prince of Wales was holding court with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. The celebration to mark his 66th birthday was in full swing, with the couple’s closest friends charging their crystal glasses to toast the Prince. At the other end of the Palace, Prince Andrew was in his private residence sharing a low-key supper with a friend or two of his own. Sources close to the Duke of York’s circle say he had not been invited to the party and did not want to spend the evening alone. The fact that his elder brother had not extended him an invitation was no surprise to the Duke, his close friends or his courtiers. For the truth is that relations between Charles and Andrew have been strained for some time. And as he battles through the most challenging period of his life, Prince Andrew cannot count on Charles’s support. Accused of having sex with a minor – an allegation he categorically denies – the Duke of York’s reputation is mired in controversy, and a potentially embarrassing and unprecedented court case looms over the Royal Family like a dark cloud. But while Andrew has been cushioned by courtiers and protected by certain relations and trusted friends, the one family member perhaps best versed to help guide him through these uncharted waters appears to have turned his back. Numerous sources close to the Duke have told The Mail on Sunday that he has been ‘cut off’ by Charles who has ‘left Andrew out in the cold’ during his darkest hours. The ‘shutters came down’ according to one source close to a senior member of the Royal Family when Prince Andrew was named in US court papers by Virginia Roberts, who claims she was made to have had sex with him when she was a 17-year-old ‘sex slave’. She had been working for the Prince’s friend and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein – who had already been jailed for sex offences. Charles, no stranger to controversy when it comes to his private life, would certainly be well-placed to counsel Andrew and offer some sage advice, but it is said that the Prince of Wales has so far refused to discuss the scandal with his brother. While they have historically had fall-outs, Andrew’s friends believe this to be the most serious yet. Relations between them are apparently so strained that they barely speak. A friend of a prominent family member says that Charles – a great memo and letter writer to his family, particularly when it comes to matters of importance – has not written to Andrew for months. ‘The froideur is worse than ever,’ the friend said. ‘Charles considers the whole sex scandal degrading, damaging and very embarrassing. ‘He thinks that his brother has made some very bad decisions but he has said nothing to Andrew, he simply hasn’t communicated with him at all. There’s been a very icy silence.’ Charles’s patience with Andrew apparently snapped when he was photographed in New York with Epstein in 2011 after the tycoon had served an 18-month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution. The ‘shutters came down’ according to one source when Prince Andrew was named in US court papers by Virginia Roberts (pictured with the Duke) The damage to Andrew’s reputation began to show when he stepped down as the UK’s Trade Envoy that year, but more damning allegations came in January this year when Ms Roberts, now 31, went to court. While the Prince of Wales’s spokesman denies there has been a fall out, insisting rumours of a rift are ‘categorically untrue’, sources close to Prince Andrew say he feels that he has been deliberately frozen out by his brother. Charles is evidently easily rattled when it comes to his problematic sibling – according to another well-placed source who is an acquaintance of Charles, the Prince will not have Andrew’s name mentioned in his presence. ‘I was told never to mention Andrew’s name in the Prince of Wales’s company,’ the source revealed. The tension between the brothers is a sensitive subject for the Royal Family. ‘This is no brotherly spat,’ said a friend of one senior Windsor. ‘It is a seismic shift downhill in Charles’s relationship with his errant brother which seems terminal. ‘Andrew is having to live with the harsh reality that Charles has cut him off and left him out in the cold.’ Andrew has been relying heavily on the support of his immediate family. His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson was the first to rush to his defence, saying on American television that Andrew is a ‘humongously good man’. But while there have been unprecedented public denials from the Palace, and a calculated show of unity from the Queen, Prince Edward and his wife Sophie Wessex, who all recently attended an engagement with Andrew, there has, tellingly, been no show of public support from Charles, who has refused to be drawn into the scandal. ‘He does not want to become involved in any way. He is very angry that his brother has put the family in this very difficult and embarrassing situation,’ added the friend. But his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson was the first to rush to his defence, saying on television that Andrew is a ‘humongously good man’ ‘Charles has very serious concerns about Andrew. He can see legal fees going through the roof, there’s a serious risk of Andrew becoming involved in a court case, and unanswered questions about his friendship with Epstein and this girl. ‘Then there’s the fact that Andrew is still living with his ex-wife and has just bought a very expensive ski chalet with her. Charles thinks Andrew is making a fool of himself where Sarah is concerned.’ With Andrew’s aides swinging into damage limitation mode in conjunction with the heavyweights at royal lawyers Harbottle and Lewis, a firefighting PR strategy is in motion. Last month Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. The allegations are false and without any foundation.’ And last month in The Mail on Sunday, Andrew’s ex-girlfriend Koo Stark broke her 32-year silence about their friendship in order to defend him, saying: ‘I firmly believe I can help rebut, with authority, the allegations against him.’ The Queen too has shown her loyalty in her own unique and subtle way. She bestowed the honorary title of Vice Admiral of the Royal Navy on her son on his 55th birthday last month, sending a clear and unequivocal message to the country that she was standing by her son both in private and in public. But the source from Charles’s circle said: ‘Charles knows the Queen will always be a staunch defender of her second son almost to the point of lacking objectivity and reason… which has irritated him beyond measure over the years.’ When Andrew celebrated his 55th birthday quietly and deliberately out of the limelight with friends, Charles was not invited to the private dinner. A close confidant of Andrew said: ‘He celebrated with some friends at a restaurant in Central London, but Charles wasn’t there. He wasn’t invited.’ The brothers did spend Christmas together at Sandringham where, by all accounts, they appeared cordial. Charles and Andrew do have a history of fall-outs. Andrew was said to be ‘spitting feathers’ when, in 2011, the decision was made to strip his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie of their personal protection officers. Last month in the Mail on Sunday, Andrew’s ex-girlfriend Koo Stark, left, broke her 32-year silence about their friendship in order to defend him . The cost-cutting measure – endorsed by Charles, who is known to want a more streamlined Royal Family – was tacitly agreed to by the Queen and led to a dispute between the brothers. Andrew argued that his daughters still needed protection but his pleas fell on deaf ears. ‘Andrew was fuming, spitting feathers,’ said a source. ‘He fought and fought but he lost to Charles. ‘Charles is forging a path as the elder statesman and the force of the family and it’s his way or no way at all. In many ways it’s a rather Tudor court. The shutters came down on Andrew and that was it.’ There was further acrimony when neither Andrew, Prince Edward nor the Princess Royal were invited to join the Queen during the closing celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. With the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital suffering from a bladder infection, the Queen was left to carry out a Buckingham Palace balcony appearance accompanied only by Charles’s family of Camilla, William and Kate, and Harry. It was, according to one family friend, Charles’s decision that only the most senior members of the family should accompany the Queen to wave to the masses who had gathered in The Mall. The episode is said to have driven a greater wedge between Charles and Andrew, who resented his brother for the public snub. Moreover, it appeared to suggest that Andrew’s place within the scheme of things was becoming more tenuous. A source close to the family said: ‘Edward took it on the chin, there was no whining sniping or pleading, but Andrew was livid. He never forgave Charles. ‘Interestingly Andrew has become much closer to Edward and relies on him more these days. ‘It’s no accident that Andrew was allowed to put a picture of the Wessexes and the Queen on his Facebook page the other week. ‘It was published with the Queen’s permission and blessing and gave a much needed emphasis of the warm and close brotherly relationship between Edward and Andrew.’ A spokesman for Andrew declined to comment on private family matters, but a senior Royal aide dismissed the idea of a rift as untrue. However, neither would comment on the specific detail of how Charles and Andrew have behaved towards each other in recent months, saying it is a private family matter. A Clarence House spokesman said: 'Family relationships are a private matter but this story, as relayed, is categorically untrue.' Clearly, however, there is a coolness that is causing tension in the family – and it is being openly discussed. While the Queen, understandably, is reluctant to get involved it looks as though she may be required to act as peacekeeper once again.

"Ukips's official General Election candidates have been caught posting racist and offensive material on the internet, revealing disturbing links between Nigel Farage's prospective MPs and far-Right groups. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that at least six Ukip candidates have circulated or endorsed material from the British National Party and other nationalist splinter groups with racist neo-Nazi agendas. Ukip last night launched an investigation into the offensive media found by this newspaper that included a racist BNP cartoon depicting violent stereotypes of black people, Muslims and Sikhs, and online links to extremist groups Britain First, English Defence League and Infidels of Britain. The revelations will provoke uproar on the very weekend that Ukip held its Spring Conference, with leaders disassociating the Eurosceptic party with any hint of extremism within its ranks ahead of the May 7 Election. Pictured is the image which was retweeted by Bill Walker, the Ukip candidate in Aldershot, Hampshire . Bill Walker, 59, left, who is standing for Ukip in Aldershot, Hampshire, retweeted a British National Party cartoon (above). The cartoon, which had been posted to Twitter by Ukip activist David Jones, was drawn by fascist artist Farstar88 who uploaded it to the white nationalist website Stormfront in 2008 . Bill Walker, the party's candidate in Aldershot, Hampshire, reposted a picture of a racist cartoon featuring a black man holding guns with 'Kill Whitey' on his T-shirt, a Sikh man holding a knife with 'Honour Killing Rocks' on his T-shirt and a Muslim man holding a grenade and a Koran in his hands with 'Death to the Infidels' scrawled on the front of his Islamic dress. A man in a suit standing on a 'British Media' soap box gestures towards a white family wearing Union Jacks and St George symbols and says: 'As you can see, THIS is the problem that must be stamped out in our country.' The cartoon, intended to stir up racial tensions, was drawn by a far-Right artist based in South Africa who goes by the name Farstar88. It was originally uploaded by the artist to the white nationalist internet forum Stormfront in 2008 under the heading 'my latest cartoon for the BNP'. Mr Walker, 58, a former soldier from Farnborough, Hampshire, retweeted the cartoon on January 11 from the Twitter account of a Southampton-based Ukip activist called David Jones who had added the comment: 'Brits are treated like second-class citizens in their own country.' The cartoon was branded 'disgusting' by anti-racism groups last night. Simon Cressy, a spokesman for Hope Not Hate, said: 'Nigel Farage attempts to hoodwink the public and insists his party and candidates aren't racist, yet these revelations aren't going away.' Several candidates have 'liked' the pages of the English Defence League and Britain First, an ultra-Right BNP splinter group, on Ukip Facebook profiles which are being used to campaign for votes. Michael Waddington, standing in Pendle, shared a post by Britain First, which is led by the BNP’s former head of publicity. Steve Wood, 54, Ukip’s candidate for Bristol South, lists Britain First and also Infidels of Britain among his Facebook likes. Bexhill and Battle candidate Geoffrey Bastin, 69, ‘liked’ the EDL on Facebook. Steve Emmens, 49, standing in Norwich South, shared a post by Britain First – a far-Right splinter group of the British National Party. There are also 'likes' and posts of material from Infidels of Britain, an “ethno-nationalist” group which calls for the repatriation of 'non-indigenous' people living in the UK. Barry Elliott, who is standing for Ukip in Blyth Valley, shared on his Facebook page an 'Infidels of Britain' picture of the late Tory MP Enoch Powell with the caption 'I tried to warn you' – in reference of Powell's infamous 'Rivers of Blood' 1968 speech against immigration – which Ukip MP Douglas Carswell insisted was 'wrong' in a newspaper article this week. Geoffrey Bastin, the party's candidate in Bexhill and Battle in East Sussex, 'liked' an EDL page on his Facebook page, while Michael Waddington, the Ukip candidate in Pendle, and Steve Emmens, standing in Norwich South, both shared posts by Britain First last May. Steve Wood, who is standing in Bristol South, also lists Infidels of Britain and Britain First among his Facebook likes. Blyth Valley candidate Barry Elliott, 48, shared a Facebook post from far-Right group Infidels of Britain . Ukip has repeatedly distanced itself from Britain First, which has been accused of stirring racial hatred after its activists 'invaded' mosques and handed out Bibles to Muslims. The far-Right party is led by Paul Golding, a former BNP councillor and head of publicity, and describes itself as 'a patriotic political party and street defence organisation'. It pledged its support for Ukip during the recent Rochester and Strood by-election, posting on Facebook: 'Ukip at the ballot box, Britain First on the streets – a winning combination!' A Ukip spokesman denied the party had any links with far-Right groups last night, and said: 'These Facebook likes and other online actions will be investigated and considered at the earliest opportunity by the National Executive Committee as part of an established disciplinary procedure.' All Ukip candidates named in this report were contacted for comment yesterday. Mr Waddington denied knowing Britain First was a far-Right group when he shared one of the party's Facebook posts about memorials for murder victims Stephen Lawrence and Lee Rigby. 'He has never been a member of the BNP, Britain First or National Front and never will be,' said John Stanyer, Ukip's North West chairman, who spoke on Mr Waddington's behalf. Mr Wood said: 'The head office has responded and I'm not going to be making any further comment.'

"Key witness: Anna Duritskaya was with top Russian politician Boris Nemtsov when he was shot dead . A beautiful Ukrainian model may hold the key to identifying the assassins who gunned down top Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. Anna Duritskaya, 23, was with the charismatic pro-Western reformer when he was killed in a drive-by shooting in view of the Kremlin as they walked home from a restaurant in Red Square on Friday evening. Ms Duritskaya, who was not injured, was questioned by police for several hours and only released at 5am yesterday. Last night, friends of the couple said they feared the Russian authorities were trying to implicate Ms Duritskaya in what is believed to be a politically motivated murder. One said: ‘She is the victim of appalling innuendo as she grieves. It looks like a smear.’ Even as world leaders, including Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, condemned the killing of one of President Vladimir Putin’s most vocal critics, pro-Kremlin media organisations were hinting darkly that Ms Duritskaya’s ‘role’ needed to be ‘clarified’. One Putin-supporting online newspaper, Life News, reported that she had recently had an abortion and suggested – with no evidence to back up the claim – that the couple might have had a row. It quoted a ‘high-ranking’ state investigator as saying: ‘The girl who accompanied Boris Nemtsov at the moment of his murder is a citizen of Ukraine. ‘We have found out that not long ago she flew from Moscow to Switzerland to abort a baby fathered by the politician. We do not exclude…a conflict in their private life.’ Mr Nemtsov, 55, died hours after appealing for support for a march today in Moscow against the war in Ukraine. He had openly opposed Russia’s role in the conflict and the annexation of Crimea. Yesterday, flowers were laid at the spot where he died, and today’s rally is to be replaced by a mourning procession. Mr Nemtsov, a father of four, was hit in the back by four bullets fired from an unmarked car, which then sped away. Scroll down for video . Quizzed by authorities: Ms Duritskaya (right), who was not injured, was questioned by police for several hours following the death of Boris Nemtsov (left)  and only released at 5am yesterday . His body lay in falling snow for an hour before it was placed in a black body bag and taken away. Mr Nemtsov’s lawyer, Vadim Prohorov, said he believed the motive for the shooting was Mr Nemtsov’s opposition to Mr Putin and the war in Ukraine. The lawyer said his client had suffered constant harassment. ‘A toilet was thrown at his car, ammonia was poured over it and eggs thrown at it,’ Mr Prohorov said. By Ian Birrell . Boris Nemtsov knew he might one day be silenced. Now the shocking pictures of his body prostrate in the shadow of the Kremlin is a chilling symbol of Vladimir Putin’s gangster style of presidency. It is almost irrelevant whether Putin personally ordered the killing or merely created the circumstances in which critics of his rapacious regime and adventurism in Ukraine are gunned down in cold blood. For Nemtsov’s courageous and consistent criticism of Putin is underscored now in his own blood. I spent time with this charming and charismatic politician during the brief flickering of the ‘Russian Spring’ in 2011 and 2012, protests that rattled Putin. He told me he saw it as his patriotic duty to oppose a regime leading the nation to ruin. ‘People are tired of corruption, tired of criminals, tired of Putin’s brutality and stupid remarks,’ he said. But while impatient for change, he was scared of seeing street unrest turn into another explosive revolution. ‘Peaceful protest is the way to separate Putin from the people,’ he said. I watched as he grew frustrated in chaotic meetings of people leading the protests – then joined him in a television studio as he had to apologise for belittling supporters as ‘scared penguins’ in bugged phone calls leaked to the media. Yet Nemtsov’s own bravery could not be faulted. As other opposition leaders were jailed, exiled or placed under house arrest, he continued to campaign against the former KGB chief who runs his country like a mafia boss. His death came hours after a radio interview denouncing Putin’s ‘mad, aggressive’ policies and on the eve of a rally today against the war in Ukraine. Nemtsov was working on a report highlighting Russia’s involvement in the separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine. These were dangerous activities amid the ugly mood of nationalism inflamed by Putin. Smear lists of ‘traitors’ and ‘fifth columnists’ are bandied around by broadcasters and on the internet, Nemtsov’s name always among them. Few doubt killings such as this bear the hallmarks of the old KGB – just as the mysterious bombings of residential buildings that began three weeks after Putin became prime minister, sparking his savage onslaught in Chechnya, also did. Many admirers of Nemtsov’s articulacy, good looks and liberal reforms expected him to get the top job after Boris Yeltsin appointed him deputy prime minister in 1997. How different Russia might be today if Nemtsov had won the keys to the Kremlin. Instead he is dead, testament to the darkness that has descended on his great nation under Putin. ‘A few months ago, threats started coming in on social media, which prompted us to contact the law enforcement authorities. But I think it’s unlikely that those who did this would have given any warnings.’ Last night, Ms Duritskaya’s mother Inna told how the model called her from the scene. ‘She was crying and saying that Boris had been killed. I was shocked. I think I told her to wait for the police and to answer their questions.’ She confirmed that the model had had an abortion, saying: ‘Yes, I knew about it. But I did not argue with her or with Boris about this.’ Ms Duritskaya was pregnant in December 2013 and Mr Nemtsov paid for her to go to Switzerland for the termination. In 1998, when Mr Putin headed the Russian security service the FSB, Mr Nemtsov was assaulted by a group of leather-jacketed thugs in a Moscow restaurant while dining with his wife Raisa and a Western correspondent. He told his guests that the men were ‘provocateurs’ – but when police arrived, they ejected Mr Nemtsov and his wife from the restaurant and let the attackers go free. As a young man, Mr Nemtsov was praised as a free-market reformer by Margaret Thatcher when she visited Nizhny Novgorod, an industrial town 260 miles from Moscow, where he was regional governor in the 1990s. He had been in a relationship with Ms Duritskaya for several years and the couple divided their time between Moscow and the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. A friend called Yulia said: ‘They met three years ago and fell in love. They began living together almost immediately.’ It is believed that Mr Nemtsov remained married to Raisa, 56. Last night, police claimed to have found the car used in the attack, amid reports that Ms Duritskaya had given them a clear description of the vehicle. It is thought to be a white Ford Focus or Mondeo. The Kremlin said the Russian state had no reason to kill a figure who had lost much of his political influence. ‘With all respect to Boris Nemtsov, he did not pose any threat in the political sphere… for the Russian authorities or for Vladimir Putin,’ said a spokesman. ‘If we compare his popularity ratings with the government’s… Nemtsov was quite an average citizen.’ Yet, the Kremlin condemned the murder as a ‘provocation’ and said Mr Putin had expressed condolences to Mr Nemtsov’s family and friends. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko drew a link between the killing and the conflict in the east of his country between his government troops and pro-Russian separatists. He claimed Mr Nemtsov had been killed because of his role as a ‘bridge’ between Moscow and Kiev. Unlike many prominent Russian politicians, Mr Nemtsov did not employ bodyguards, even though he had predicted his own death. Earlier this month he said: ‘I’m afraid Putin will kill me. I believe he was the one who unleashed the war in Ukraine. ‘I couldn’t dislike him more.’ Hours before he was gunned down he said in a radio interview: ‘The country needs political reform. When power is concentrated in the hands of one person and this person rules for ever, this will lead to absolute catastrophe.’ Mr Nemtsov had four children with Raisa and two other partners, one of whom is Ekaterina Odintsova, 42, a former TV presenter and now editor-in-chief of OK! magazine in Russia. She said: ‘We loved him – he was an example for us. I cannot express my grief.’ Additional reporting: Askold Krushelnycky in Ukraine .

"Racegoers trying to pick a winner at Kempton Park racecourse have a new handicap to consider – an invasion of swans. One jockey has even been unseated during a race thanks to swans wandering on the track, while on other occasions the birds have flown close to riders travelling at almost 30mph. Now the racecourse owners have sought the Queen’s permission to round up the birds. At least 27 swans have taken up residence at Kempton Park racecourse in Surrey where there have been several close calls such as here when the birds crossed the course just yards from the riders . At least 27 swans have taken up residence at the track. And although riders and horses have so far escaped serious injury, there have been several close calls. Last year, amateur jockey Harrison Beswick was thrown from his horse Dark Energy when a swan and her two cygnets wandered on to the course. The horse managed to hurdle the swans – amid a flurry of feathers – but the evasive action meant Mr Beswick was thrown to the ground. Racegoers have so far been unaffected, largely thanks to a new perimeter fence, but the swans continue to wander close to horses and riders travelling at speed. The situation is so serious that talks were held at the Surrey course last week which could lead to the birds being evicted. And as the Queen has a prerogative over all swans in England and Wales, course officials have had to seek permission from Her Majesty’s Swan Marker, David Barber, to deal with the situation. Mr Barber said: ‘Buckingham Palace is well aware of the situation at Kempton Park. We are very keen that the swans are looked after and no harm comes to them or the horses and their riders.’ Now the racecourse owners have sought permission from the Queen, who has a prerogative over all swans in England and Wales, to round up the birds . Clerk of the course Barney Clifford says the behaviour of the birds is unusual. ‘The swan’s normal characteristics are to land on water, then move from water to land to feed,’ he said. ‘Unfortunately the Kempton Park swans land and take off on our turf track because it is so compacted they feel comfortable on it. ‘When airborne, they can go anywhere, and on a couple of occasions a swan has flown very close to a jockey. I can deal with most things but I don’t have an aviation control tower.’ One theory for the growing numbers of swans at Kempton is that it follows the culling of foxes. Mr Barber has made no objection to a transportation licence now being considered by Natural England. Mr Clifford added: ‘I am sure there will be some swans relocated, but we may leave a breeding pair who will fight other swans if they try to come back.’","Kempton Park racecourse in Surrey is being invaded by a bevy of swans .

"Adoption chiefs have ended a ban on young children being placed with e-cigarette users after The Mail on Sunday highlighted the ‘misguided’ policy. Last week, this newspaper told how a professional, middle-aged couple had been barred from adopting after a social worker spotted the would-be father ‘smoking’ an e-cigarette. But last Monday, just 24 hours after we published our story, the British Association of Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) updated to its guidance, saying it had changed its e-cigarette policy. At least a dozen councils in England had imposed a blanket-ban on placing children with parents who smoke, but new advice means some of these bans could be lifted . E-cigarettes do not produce smoke and the passive risk to others from the vapour they emit is‘extremely low’, according to a report last year by Public Health England. Neither is there any evidence to back up claims – widely held by e-cigarette critics – that they encourage children to try real cigarettes. Nonetheless, we revealed that at least a dozen councils across England had imposed blanket-bans on placing under-fives with e-cigarette users. The councils cited guidance from the BAAF, which had recommended ‘that users of e-cigarettes be considered as smokers’ until concerns about the devices were cleared up. But now in the update to its guidance, the BAAF stated: ‘At the next meeting of our Health Group Advisory Committee (HGAC), we will be recommending that [fostering and adoption] agencies now consider e-cigarettes as different to tobacco cigarettes. ‘Agencies should therefore recognise the low risk to children and not see the use of e-cigarettes as a reason to preclude foster carers or adopters purely on this basis. Each circumstance should be risk assessed on an individual basis.’ It continued: ‘E-cigarettes appear to have positive benefits for smokers when providing them with a route to abstinence and the risk to children from passive smoke is lessened. ‘However, this needs to be balanced against the risk of providing a model for the child of smoking now, or in the future. New guidelines say e-cigarettes should be considered as different from traditional tobacco cigarettes, as the danger of passive smoking is greatly reduced . ‘We will continue to monitor research into e-cigarettes and will continue reviewing our recommendations.’ The BAAF said it had changed its guidance ‘in light of the latest Public Health England report’ – which The Mail on Sunday cited in last week’s article. ‘Abigail’ and ‘Brian’, who went through a year-long adoption selection process with Staffordshire County Council only to be turned down after Brian was spotted puffing on an e-cigarette, last night hailed the change as ‘really good news’. Abigail said: ‘It’s a shame for us that it took such lengths for things to change, but at least other couples should be spared what we went through.’ Robert West, professor of health psychology at University College London, who last week described the e-cigarette banning policy as ‘misguided and unethical’, said: ‘This is very welcome news, and demonstrates the importance of ensuring that policy decisions are based on good information.’ Ann McNeil, professor of tobacco addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, said: ‘I welcome the changed recommendation, in particular that e-cigarettes be considered different to tobacco cigarettes. ‘E-cigarettes and cigarettes are indeed very different products in how they work, what they contain, what they emit and their relative harmfulness. ‘By making this change, BAAF will help people to understand that e-cigarettes are a less harmful alternative to deadly tobacco cigarettes.’","Dozen councils in England had bans on foster parents using e-cigarettes .

"Nick Clegg is planning to make the decriminalisation of 'skunk' cannabis a key plank of his Election manifesto, despite shock research showing that the drug triples the risk of mental illness. The Lib Dem leader risks provoking outrage this week when he joins Sir Richard Branson to put the case for removing all criminal sanctions for possessing cannabis – including skunk, its most potent form. The move comes as party sources told The Mail on Sunday that a draft copy of the Lib Dem manifesto includes a pledge to end all prosecutions for possession of soft drugs. Under the proposal, if police decide someone caught with cannabis or skunk was a user rather than a dealer, they would receive medical treatment instead of facing charges. Pledge: Nick Clegg (pictured) is planning to make the decriminalisation of 'skunk' cannabis a key plank of his Election manifesto . The plan was described by one senior Tory MP last night as 'completely and utterly irresponsible', given mounting evidence of the damage cannabis inflicts on teenage brains. A landmark study revealed by this newspaper two weeks ago found that regularly smoking skunk triples the risk of psychosis, with the brightest teenagers among those most at risk. Prof Sir Robin Murray, who led the Institute of Psychiatry study, linked the drug to an astonishing 24 per cent of first episode psychosis cases and said it was leaving some with permanent schizophrenia. Mr Clegg's appearance with Sir Richard at the Chatham House think-tank on Wednesday risks triggering accusations of hypocrisy – as the Deputy Prime Minister is also planning to make a major speech this week calling for more help for people suffering from mental illness. Mr Clegg has previously described the UK's drugs laws as 'utterly senseless' because throwing users in jail only hooked them on harder drugs or turned them into professional criminals. But his party has previously stopped short of making a manifesto promise to decriminalise. Sir Richard, a long-standing campaigner for drugs liberalisation, wrote an internet blog last Thursday where he said he was 'delighted' by recent moves to relax the law in Alaska and Jamaica. Controversial: A landmark study  two weeks ago found that regularly smoking skunk triples the risk of psychosis, with the brightest teenagers among those most at risk . Supporter: Sir Richard, a long-standing campaigner for drugs liberalisation, wrote an internet blog last Thursday where he said he was 'delighted' by recent moves to relax the law in Alaska and Jamaica . 'The new Alaskan law now allows adults to legally consume and grow marijuana for non-medical purposes,' Sir Richard wrote. 'In Jamaica, lawmakers passed an act to decriminalise small amounts of cannabis and establish a licensing agency to regulate a lawful medical cannabis industry on the island. These are important developments and great examples of sensible drug policy.' Chatham House said: 'Richard Branson and Nick Clegg will discuss how the current approach to tackling the international drugs trade is failing... Many countries are approaching societal drug use and addiction as a public health issue rather than one of criminality'. Tory MP Charles Walker said of the Lib Dem plan: 'This is completely and utterly irresponsible. And I speak as someone who has met the devastated parents of the young victims. Celebrities and politicians are basing policy on their own youthful experiences. But the drugs are seven or eight times more powerful now. I admire Nick Clegg for his work on mental health but he cannot have a foot in both camps.' A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'The current system isn't working. We should be treating possession of drugs as a health issue to help addicts deal with their problems. 'Skunk has recently been shown to have a negative impact on many users' mental health, which is why it's so important that users are given treatment, rather than just being constantly recycled through the criminal justice system.'","Liberal Democrat leader planning move as part of his new Election manifesto .

"The USS Zumwalt, the largest stealth destroyer ever built for the U.S. Navy, was launched into the waters of the Kennebec River in Maine for the first time on Monday. The big ship touched water without fanfare after a ceremony scheduled was earlier this month was canceled due to the partial federal . government shutdown. Dozens of local residents gathered to . watch the hours-long process of floating the ship in a dry dock. In the . water for the first time, the ship was a sight to behold. The first-in-class Zumwalt, the largest U.S. Navy destroyer ever built, floats off a submerged dry dock in the Kennebec River, on Monday . The Zumwalt looks like no other U.S. warship, with an angular profile and clean carbon fiber superstructure that hides antennas and radar masts . ‘It's absolutely massive. It's higher . than the tree line on the other side. It's an absolutely huge ship - . very imposing. It's massively dominating the waterfront,’ said Amy Lent, . executive director of the Maine Maritime Museum, who watched the . process from her office down river from the shipyard. The Zumwalt looks like no other U.S. warship, with an angular profile and clean carbon fiber superstructure . that hides antennas and radar masts. ‘The Zumwalt is really in a league of its . own,’ said defense consultant Eric Wertheim, author of the ‘The Naval . Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World.’ Workers at Bath Iron Works, part of General Dynamics, will continue working on the ship throughout the winter. The . shipyard hopes to hold a rescheduled christening in the spring, with . sea trials following in the fall. Bath Iron Works plans to deliver the . ship to the Navy in 2015. Like a giant nose, the forward hull body of the first-in-class Zumwalt, the largest U.S. Navy destroyer ever built, juts out of its dry dock in Bath, Maine . In action: An artist rendering of the USS Zumwalt class destroyer which will be one of the more heavily armed and expensive ships in the U.S Navy . Originally envisioned as a ‘stealth destroyer,’ the Zumwalt has a low-slung appearance and angles that deflect radar. Its wave-piercing hull aims for a smoother ride. The 610-foot ship is a behemoth that's longer and bigger than the current class of destroyers. It was originally designed for shore bombardment and features a 155mm ‘Advanced Gun System’ that fires rocket-propelled warheads that have a range of nearly 100 miles. Thanks to computers and automation, it will have only about half the complement of sailors as the current generation of destroyers. Critics, however, felt the Navy was trying to incorporate too much new technology - a new hull, computer automation, electric propulsion, new radar and new gun - into one package. At one point, the program was nearly scrapped because of growing cost. Eventually, the program was truncated to three ships, the Zumwalt being the first. The first-in-class Zumwalt features an unusual wave-piercing hull, electric drive propulsion, advanced sonar and guided missiles, and a new gun that fires rocket-propelled warheads as far as 100 miles . Bath Iron Works hopes to hold a rescheduled christening in the spring and plans to deliver the ship to the Navy in 2015 . With its fearsome array of weapons, . radar evading silhouette and $7billion price tag, this is one of . America's most deadly - and expensive - warships ever. Equipped . with guns capable of firing warheads 100 miles, stealth features, and . engine able to generate enough power to run 78,000 homes, the U.S. Navy . is hoping it with guarantee its naval supremacy for decades to come. After embarrassing troubles with its latest class of surface warships, the Navy is hoping for a winner from a new destroyer that's ready to go into the water. So far, construction of the . first-in-class Zumwalt, is on time and on budget, something that's a . rarity in new defense programs, officials said. The christening of the ship bearing the name of the late Admiral Elmo 'Bud' Zumwalt was canceled earlier this month because of the federal government shutdown. Fearsome: The $7billion first-in-class Zumwalt rises from the dry docks in Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine . Hulking: First-in-class USS Zumwalt is the largest U.S. Navy destroyer ever built . The public christening ceremony featuring Zumwalt's two daughters will be rescheduled for the spring. Admiral Zumwalt served in destroyers during World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star for valor at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. As . the nation's youngest chief of naval operations, appointed at age 49 by . President Richard Nixon, he fought to end racial discrimination and . allowed women to serve on ships for the first time. Like its namesake, the ship is innovative. It is so big that Bath Iron Works built a 106-foot-tall, $40 million 'Ultra Hall' to accommodate its large hull segments. The ship is 100 feet longer than the existing class of destroyers. It features an unusual wave-piercing . hull, electric drive propulsion, advanced sonar and guided missiles, and . a new gun that fires rocket-propelled warheads as far as 100 miles. Unlike warships with towering radar- and . antenna-laden superstructures, the Zumwalt will ride low to the water to . minimize its radar signature, making it stealthier than others. Deadly force: Armed with up to 80 Tomahawk cruise missiles and designed to back up Marines on amphibious missions the USS Zumwalt is so expensive only three will be built . Resembling a 19th century ironclad warship the USS Zumwalt uses a 21st century version of a 'tumblehome' hull . Displacement: 14,564 long tons (14,798 t) Length: 600 ft (180 m) Beam: 80.7 ft (24.6 m) Draft: 27.6 ft (8.4 m) Propulsion: Two Rolls-Royce Marine Trent-30 gas turbines driving Curtiss-Wright generators and emergency diesel generators, 78 MW (105,000 shp); two propellers driven by electric motors . Speed: Over 30 kn (56 km/h; 35 mph) Weapons: . 20 × MK 57 VLS modules, with a total of 80 launch cells . RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), four per cell . Tactical Tomahawk, one per cell . Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC), one per cell . Two × 155 mm/62 caliber Advanced Gun System . 920 × 155 mm rounds total; 600 in automated store with Auxiliary store room with up to 320 rounds (non-automatic) as of April 2005 . 70–100 LRLAP rounds planned as of 2005 of total . Two × Mk 110 57 mm gun (CIGS) Originally envisioned for shore bombardment, the ship's size and power plant that can produce 78 megawatts of electricity - enough to power 78,000 homes - make it a potential platform for futuristic weapons like the electromagnetic rail gun, which uses a magnetic field and electric current to fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound. There are so many computers and so . much automation that it'll need fewer sailors, operating with a crew of . 158, nearly half the complement aboard the current generation of . destroyers. 'The concept of . the Zumwalt is sort of a bridge between the traditions of the past and . the new world of networked warfare and precision guided munitions,' said . Loren Thompson, defense analyst at the Lexington Institute. 'It's . not so much a radical concept as it is an attempt to pull off a full . range of missions with a ship that has one foot in the present and one . foot in the future.' The . Navy once envisioned building more than 20 of the ships. But the ship . has so many sophisticated features and its cost grew so high that senior . Navy officials tried to kill the program. Instead, it was truncated to . just three ships, the first being Zumwalt. The Zumwalt will cost more than $3.5 billion - about three times that of current destroyers - but the program has not been beset by big cost overruns or delays, officials said. The fact that construction has gone smoothly is a relief for the Navy, which has dealt with embarrassing troubles on its new class of speedy warship, dubbed the 'littoral combat ship.' Those smaller ships, designed to operate close to shore in littoral waters, have been plagued by escalating costs, production delays and mechanical problems. What you get for $7 billion dollars: A guide to the USS Zumwalt's unique features . A model of the Zumwalt Class destroyer to be built by Bath Iron Works and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding is displayed during a contract signing ceremony at the Pentagon . Mission modules that give them the . flexibility to perform roles including anti-submarine warfare and . minesweeping are not ready, even though the first ships have been . commissioned. 'That ship is a total disaster,' said Norman Polmar, a naval historian, analyst and author. Against . that backdrop, shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works have been toiling away . on the Zumwalt, the first entirely new ship built on the banks of the . Kennebec River since the original Arleigh Burke was christened more than . 20 years ago. Dan Dowling, president of Local S6, . which represents 3,200 shipbuilders, said it's been a challenging . project with a new hull design, composite materials and new technology. 'It . is a radical departure from what we've known. Whether the Navy is . satisfied with the design of the ship is up to them. We can only build . what they asked for,' he said, adding, 'I hope they'll be pleased with . it. We'd like to build as many of them as we can.'

"Nigella Lawson's ambition to crack America has suffered a huge setback, with the cancellation of her cookery show The Taste. The 55-year-old initially charmed the States with her saucy double entendres and figure-hugging 'wiggle dresses'. But viewers lost their appetite for her reality TV show – and ratings plunged as dramatically as her cleavage-baring necklines. Now executives at the ABC network are about to announce that the show won't be returning for a fourth season. Scroll down for video . Nigella Lawson's American cookery show The Taste has been cancelled after viewing figures dropped dramatically . A source told The Mail on Sunday. 'Staff have been told to take alternative employment and not to wait for The Taste to go back into production – it's over. It had a good run and Nigella is definitely better known in America now than she was before, but the show was haemorrhaging viewers.' The Taste launched in January 2013, attracting an audience of 5.8 million. But figures for the last series, which ended in January this year, fell to less than half that, with a low of 2.7 million. 'It just kept sliding in the ratings,' the source added. 'People were tuning out in droves.' The Taste involved chefs competing to create a single perfect spoonful. As its star and executive producer, the Domestic Goddess earned a reported £150,000 an episode. The Taste involved chefs Ludo Lefebvre, Anthony Bourdain and Nigella Lawson competing to create a single perfect spoonful . Critics warmed to Nigella's 'polish and humour', but branded the show 'boring'. A source told The Mail on Sunday: 'It's an open secret that The Taste is not coming back for a fourth season. ABC are actively looking for an alternative cookery show. But the fact it lasted three seasons is no disgrace at all.' The UK version suffered a similar fate, surviving for just one series on Channel 4 last year.

"Almost half the German city of Koblenz is under evacuation orders as experts prepare to defuse a two-ton ‘Blockbuster’ RAF bomb in the Rhine. The 10ft bomb, one of the biggest in the wartime arsenal of Bomber Command, was discovered after 65 years when the river level dropped during the driest November on record. The fuse is badly corroded, and the authorities are evacuating 45,000 of Koblenz’s 120,000 population to leave a security zone of a mile around the bomb - which is capable of destroying an entire city block. Construction of a 350-sandbag dam was almost completed by this evening so that the detonation can take place . Evacuation: Bomb experts build a temporary dam around the undetonated explosive as authorities prepare to get people out of Koblenz . The evacuation - the biggest in German . postwar history - will involve fleets of buses and 1,000 volunteers . helping police and firemen. It is due to take place on Sunday so as not to disrupt Saturday Christmas shopping. Some . 700 patients at two hospitals will have to be moved, as well as the . residents of seven old people’s homes and prisoners in a local jail. The city’s main train station will also have to be emptied as well as several hotels. Authorities this week built a temporary dam of some 350 sandbags around the bomb which is covered by just 16 inches of water. The plan is then for bomb disposal . teams to pump the water out and get to the bomb proper to begin the . delicate job of removing the detonator. It . is expected to take several hours to make the bomb safe. Should it show . signs of going off, experts . The low level of the Rhine has already exposed four other unexploded bombs. Police closed a road and a stretch of . railway near Rhein bei Vallendar near Koblenz on Saturday so that three . smoke bombs found in the river could be blown up. An artificial traffic jam was created on a nearby autobahn to slow traffic while the explosion work was underway. Preparations: Divers have been working on a sandbag barrier in Koblenz which will expose and dry the 1.8 ton WW2 bomb . Deadly: 'Blockbuster' bombs were used heavily by the RAF in the war, with 50 per cent of their weight being explosives . Fire department boss Manfred Morschhäuser told the German news agency DAPD said the area will be pumped free of water at the weekend so the bomb can be detonated. 'Blockbuster' bombs, also known as cookies, got their name from the press during the . Second World War through their ability to destroy entire blocks. They typically weighed either 4,000, 8000 or 12,000lbs and usually contained 50 per cent explosive by weight. Their primary was use was in . causing extensive damage to buildings so that smaller 1.8kg incendiary . bombs could reach their interiors. In 1943, 25,000 blockbusters were used. This increased to 38,000 the following year, before returning to 25,000 in 1945. A safe height for unleashing the . 4,000lb blockbuster was said to be around 5,000ft - any lower and the . aircraft risked being caught in the blast. During the Blitz the Germans created improvised blockbuster by attaching naval mines dropped on parachutes. In the meantime, the fire department has established a telephone hotline. Morschhäuser said: 'Several hundred callers are getting in touch each day with their questions and problems. 'Each household included in the evacuation will be notified via flier. 'And on Sunday we'll go ringing from house to house.' A day later and just a few kilometres downriver in Neuwie a 500-kilo aerial bomb was spotted in the river. This required the evacuation of around 1,000 people living in the nearby area. Koblenz was a German operations centre . during the Second World War and was hit repeatedly by air raids carried . out by RAF and U.S. bombers. While . it had heavy industry producing ball bearings and tank parts, it was . also the home of Army Group B which oversaw the conquest of France. Later . in the war the city was the hub for defensive operations for German . forces following D-Day. Eighty-seven per cent of Koblenz was eventually . destroyed in more than two dozen air raids. German . newspaper The National reports 'an estimated 2,000 tonnes of American . and British aerial bombs and other munitions are still found every . year.'

"A self-professed minister and one of America's Most Wanted for allegedly molesting two girls in a 'Maidens Group' has been arrested following a year-long search, according to Brazilian authorities. Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was captured late Friday in an apartment near paradisiacal white-sand Pipa Beach in northeastern Brazil, along with a 33-year-old Brazilian woman, who he was reportedly living with. Authorities were eventually able to determine that Barnard was living in Brazil and coordinated efforts with Brazilian police to arrest him, according to CBS Minnesota. He faces 59 counts of criminal misconduct after two women said they were among ten girls and women, who were chosen to live apart from their families and with him at his River Road Fellowship camp in rural Minnesota. One woman alleged Barnard sexually abused her beginning at age 13 and continued until she was 22, while the other said her abuse occurred between the ages 12 and 20. Self-professed minister and one of America's Most Wanted, Victor Arden Barnard (above), for allegedly molesting two girls in a 'Maidens Group' has been arrested following a year-long search, according to Brazilian authorities . The 53-year-old faces 59 counts of criminal misconduct after two women said they were among ten girls (Barnard above with girls) and women, who were chosen to live apart from their families in a camp that he set up in rural Minnesota . A majority of the criminal counts against him carry maximum sentences of 30 years in prison . A majority of the criminal counts against him carry maximum sentences of 30 years in prison. The U.S. Marshals Service said Barnard initially left Minnesota in 2010, before the women came forward, and his whereabouts were unknown for some time. It was believed he and his followers had moved to Washington state. Brazilian police inspector Paulo Henrique Oliveira said that Barnard entered the South American country legally in 2012, and a nation-wide warrant was issued in April 2014 for his arrest. In 2012, after enduring years of abuse, brave former sect member Lindsay Tornambe (above) alerted authorities to the girls' plight. She was 13 years old when she was first taken to the camp. When she received the news of his arrest, she said she started crying . Another former cult-member, Jess Schweiss (above), who was taken to the camp at age 12, came forward to tell authorities her story too . Schweiss said when she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', according to the criminal complaint notes (Shweiss's parents pictured above) He had been living for at least six months at the apartment where he was arrested in Brazil, about 1,300 miles  from Rio de Janeiro. During the arrest, police confiscated computers, cell phones, flash drives, religious papers and diaries from the condo, according to the Star Tribune. Sexual abuse charges were brought against Barnard in 2014. In 2000, he created a 'Shepherd's Camp' with a group of ten girls and women he selected to live with him at his home, according to Fox 9. In 2000, he (above) created the 'Shepherd's Camp' with a group of ten girls and women he selected to live with him at his home . The Maidens, aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Barnard and 'were forced to have sex with him' anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade (River Road Fellowship above) Barnard allegedly kept the girls isolated and used religious coercion and intimidation to maintain his control over them, calling it cult-like behavior. He  told one victim 'she would remain a virgin because he was a man of God,' according to a criminal complaint. An extradition order has already been signed by the U.S. Supreme Court and Barnard is expected to face charges in the U.S. The Maidens Group, with girls aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Barnard and were 'forced to have sex with him' anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade. He said that Jesus and King Solomon had many women followers, so 'God's word' meant that it was normal for him to have sex with them. In 2012, after enduring years of abuse following her parents leaving her at the camp when she was 13 years old, former sect member Lindsay Tornambe alerted authorities to the girls' plight. When she received the news of his recent arrest, she said she started crying. Tornambe said: 'It feels so surreal. I knew the day would come, but it finally came and it's almost numbing.' Another former cult member, Jess Schweiss, told authorities her story too after she was taken to the camp at 12 years old. She said when she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', according to the criminal complaint notes. Cindi Currie, who said she had visited Barnard's religious camp in Minnesota years ago and tried to persuade a friend to leave the group, spoke out saying that she cannot wait to see Barnard behind bars. 'He has ruined more lives. That man is the devil incarnate,' she said. 'I'm just ready to cry. I'm so glad they found him. Not only will Victor Barnard go to jail, but every adult who knew what was going on up there can start to pay, and maybe these girls can start to heal.' Investigators believe Barnard abused other girls but have been unable to get others to come forward. An extradition order has already been signed by the U.S. Supreme Court and Barnard is expected to stand trial in the U.S. for the charges he faces, according to Globo.","Victor Arden Barnard, 53, was captured late Friday in apartment near Pipa Beach in northeastern Brazil after year-long search .

"The head of a maraschino cherry factory who shot himself dead last Tuesday after police found a secret drug lab on site could have been making up to $10million a year from his illicit venture. Arthur Mondella, 57, president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries factory in Brooklyn, was believed to have been managing a huge marijuana operation on the side of his food business. According to a report in the the New York Post, he could have earned up to $6,500 for a pound of the substance - depending on the quality. Scroll down for video . Arthur Mondella (above) hid his massive marijuana business behind his hugely successful cherry business authorities believe. It has been claimed he could have been making up to $10million a year . The smell of the 400,000 pounds of cherries produced each day in his factory hid the smell of the 1,200 plants he grew . Mondella asked his sister Joanne Capece (right) to 'take care of [his] kids (two daughters Dana and Dominique and ex-wife Elaine left),' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom . If he was growing 100 plants and the drug was 'high quality', it means he would have been making more than $2.5million every three months, a consultant told The Post. It was revealed on Saturday that he was able to keep investigators in the dark  as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of Maraschino cherries his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the marijuana plants. Reports suggest he was capable of growing at least 100 at a time, but could have managed up to 1,200, meaning he could have been making substantially more from the criminal enterprise. Furthermore, the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps - something that was also masked by his large operation. This as many still have questions as to why the president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries, after cooperating with investigators for five hours Tuesday as they looked in to claims that his business was dumping hazardous waste, excused himself, asked his sister Joanne Capece to 'take care of [his] kids,' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom. The New York Daily News reports that investigators then discovered a crawl space that led to a 50-foot-by-50-foot area that was divided into several rooms. Authorities now believe the rooms were for growing the plans. One room contained seeds of 60 different marijuana strains and about $125,000 in cash. Salvatore Capece (left), nephew of Mondella, and Dominique Mondella (right), his daughter, continued the family legacy by working at Dell's Maraschino Cherries . They believe a crop had just been harvested, as only three bags with about 100 pounds of marijuana were discovered during their search. All that, along with 120 expensive grow lamps, were completely hidden, leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company. 'In theory, it could have been him and outsiders,' said the source. 'This is a secreted part of a large factory that was designed so a large number of employees won’t know.' Despite all this, the company, which has contracts with numerous national restaurant chains such as Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick-fil-A and TGI Fridays, is back in business and family lawyer Michael Farkas states managers are cooperating fully with the District Attorney's investigation. Mondella is survived by three children from two marriages.

"The woman who leads the BBC is being paid a staggering £10,000 a day by the scandal-hit bank accused of helping millionaires to avoid paying tax. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Rona Fairhead – chairman of the BBC Trust – was paid more than £500,000 last year by HSBC for non-executive roles carried out working the equivalent of one day a week. Last night MPs said the astonishing payment from the bank raised questions about her priorities, as it dwarfs the £110,000 salary she is paid to work the equivalent of three days a week to oversee the BBC on behalf of licence fee payers. Scroll down for video . Salary: Rona Fairhead (pictured) – chairman of the BBC Trust – was paid more than £500,000 last year by HSBC for non-executive roles carried out working the equivalent of one day a week . And Mrs Fairhead's earnings don't stop there. She also earns £130,000 to be a non-executive director for American soft drinks giant PepsiCo. The 54-year-old businesswoman was last night under pressure to quit one of her high-profile roles because of the competing demands on her time and fears over conflicts of interest. Mrs Fairhead has faced criticism for her role as a non-executive director at HSBC after BBC1's Panorama programme broadcast damaging allegations that the bank's Swiss arm helped wealthy clients dodge millions of pounds in British taxes. HSBC then faced claims that it tried to influence media coverage. Mrs Fairhead has so far declined to answer questions about what she knew about the Swiss bank's activities when she was the chairman of HSBC's audit committee. But she has also faced a grilling from MPs over allegations that HSBC allowed terrorists and Mexican drug cartels to launder millions of pounds, for which the bank was fined a record £1.2 billion in the US in 2012. Last night the BBC insisted she had not taken part in any discussions about its coverage of the bank. But the tax evasion claims have been discussed at board level within HSBC. And if the bank complains about the BBC's reports, the Trust could be asked to adjudicate. Critics said that Mrs Fairhead should choose between working for HSBC or the BBC Trust, which could be scrapped along with the licence fee by MPs. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said last night: 'Mrs Fairhead may claim she can cope with all these responsibilities but I think the licence fee payers will expect her to choose where her loyalties are ahead of the most important BBC charter renewal in its history.' Eclipsed: The massive fee HSBC paid Fairhead dwarfs the £110,000 salary she is paid to work the equivalent of three days a week to oversee the BBC on behalf of licence fee payers . And Labour MP Steve Rotheram, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee that quizzed Mrs Fairhead before her appointment, said: 'It's going to be very difficult for her to have two such high-profile jobs at the moment. 'Both institutions need to have a real focus on scrutiny.' Mrs Fairhead, who was made a CBE in 2012 for 'services to industry', joined the board of HSBC in 2004. The married mother of three was chairman of its audit committee in 2007, when its Swiss subsidiary is alleged to have been involved in a tax-dodging scheme that deprived the British Government of millions of pounds. She was then head of HSBC's risk committee in 2012 when the bank was fined £1.2 billion for breaching US money-laundering laws. This newspaper can reveal that her pay packet from HSBC rocketed last year after she was appointed non-executive chairman of HSBC North America. She received £494,000 in pay and £19,000 in benefits, including travel expenses to fly to chair meetings of the North American arm, despite only working 'maybe 50 days a year' by her own estimate. She attended seven board meetings and four gatherings of the nominations committee last year. Analysis of accounts published last week show the businesswoman also holds shares worth about £441,000 in the bank. Mrs Fairhead took up another American boardroom role with PepsiCo a year ago, which takes up 25 days a year, and will receive annual pay and shares worth about £130,000. Last June she was approached by head-hunters to apply for the vacant position of chairman of the BBC Trust, which is meant to set the broadcaster's strategy and hold TV executives to account, after Lord Patten of Barnes stood down following heart surgery. Mrs Fairhead has taken over at a critical time for the future of the BBC. It must agree with the Government a new Royal Charter setting its size and purposes by the end of 2016. Just last week the cross-party Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the £145.50-a-year licence fee is outdated and that the BBC Trust should be replaced by a tougher external watchdog. When Mrs Fairhead was grilled by MPs last September about where her priorities lay, she insisted the BBC position would not be a 'full-time executive role' but that she would put it ahead of her corporate interests if it came to the crunch. HSBC documents show she intends to keep her role at the bank, and will stand again as a non-executive director at the bank's next annual general meeting next month. A spokesman for Mrs Fairhead said: 'Rona was not at any time involved in any discussions at HSBC specifically about the bank's dealings with the BBC.' The BBC Trust said: 'Rona Fairhead has had absolutely no discussions with the BBC, either the executive or the editorial teams, about the HSBC coverage.' HSBC declined to comment. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, called on Mrs Fairhead to say what she knew about the tax-avoidance claims. 'She's been very silent since the HSBC debacle broke, and I think she has got to answer questions.'","Rona Fairhead paid '£10,000 a day' by  bank accused of helping tax avoiders .

"Flies buzz around the  emaciated body of a lion as it decays in the sun; nearby the mummified corpse baboon  lies on the ground- it's head still tilted up as though looking out of its enclosure, across from it a porcupine's brittle spines protrude from its lifeless body. They are among the dozens of animals which have died at Khan Younis zoo in the impoverished Gaza Strip after they were left without food. Zoo owner Mohammed Awaida has blamed the Palestinian and Israeli conflict for the tragedy- claiming it meant that staff were unable to feed or care properly for the animals at the zoo. Scroll down for video . Dozens of neglected animals have died at a zoo in Gaza City after the facility's owner claimed he was unable to feed or care for them because of the Israeli Palestinian conflict . Mr Awaida said he opened the 'South Forest Park' in 2007, only to lose a number of animals during Israel's military offensive against Hamas that began in December 2008. During the three-week offensive, launched in response to rocket attacks on Israel, Awaida said he could not reach the zoo, and many animals died of neglect and starvation. And it appears that history has repeated itself. The fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants escalated last summer killing more than 1,960 Palestinians and 67 people on the Israeli side. The mummified corpse of this baboon, pictured in its enclosure next to the bodies of several other monkeys, died at Khan Younis zoo . Palestinian workers came back to find many of the zoo's animals had died including this small monkey . This beautiful tiger was one of many that dies from hunger or thirst after the zoo owner said Gaza region's conflict with Israel made it impossible for staff to reach it . Mr Awaida said he opened the 'South Forest Park' in 2007, only to lose a number of animals during Israel's military offensive against Hamas that began in December 2008 . Once again unable to reach the zoo, animals died of neglect and starvation. They include a little monkey, which died in its enclosure-  its teeth still clenched together. In another enclosure, a Palestinian zoo worker inspects the remnants of a crocodile. Khan Younis is one of five zoos in the Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal enclave of 1.7million people ruled by Islamic Hamas militants. With no government body in Gaza that oversees zoos, and no animal rights movement in the region, the Khan Younis facility is virtually unsupervised. Care is basic. There is no zookeeper on the premises and medical treatment is done by consulting over the phone with zoo veterinarians in Egypt. The zoo  has a tradition of stuffing and embalming those that die and return them to their enclosures. The centre had ten embalmed animals on dismay in makeshift exhibits — fashioned from fencing salvaged from Jewish settlements that Israel dismantled in 2005. But after losing dozens of the zoo's 65 live animals, which included ostriches, monkeys, turtles, deer, a llama, a lion and a tiger, the numbers of dead animals may risk outnumbering the living. A palestinian worker is seen inspecting the body of a dead crocodile at the zoo in Khan Younis, in the Gaze strip . This little monkey, which died in its enclosure with its teeth still clenched together, has been dead for some time . With no government body in Gaza that oversees zoos, and no animal rights movement in the region, the Khan Younis facility is virtually unsupervised . This porcupine's brittle spines protrude from its lifeless body, it's eyes pecked out, after being deprived of food . Mr Awaida began using his rudimentary taxidermy skills on deceased animals at the zoo after the Gaza war began. 'The idea to mummify animals started after the Gaza war because a number of animals like the lion, the tiger, monkeys and crocodiles died,' he said previously. So we asked around and we learned from the Web how to start.' Formaldehyde and sawdust provided the basic tools, though Awaida acknowledged he was no expert. A hole in the porcupine's head is impossible not to notice. Gaza's zoos are used to resorting to odd ways to get by amid the territory's multiple woes. In 2009, a zoo in Gaza City exhibited white donkeys painted with black stripes to look like zebras because it was too expensive to replace two zebras who were neglected during the Israeli offensive. In the West Bank city of Qalqilya, zoo veterinarian Sami Khader turned to taxidermy nine years ago when a giraffe named Brownie died during the second Palestinian uprising against Israel. Hassan Azzam, director of the veterinary services department in Gaza's ministry of agriculture, said: 'We have humble capabilities,' but the ministry encourages zoos. When staff do get to the zoo, there care is basic- there is no zookeeper on the premises and medical treatment is done by consulting over the phone with zoo veterinarians in Egypt . The zoo did have 65 live animals, which included ostriches, monkeys, turtles, deer, a llama, a lion and a tiger . The zoo has a tradition of stuffing and embalming those that die and return them to their enclosures which could be the fate of some of the better preserved animals . This baboon's face and eyes have already begun to rot away after it was deprived of water and food by staff at the zoo who claim they were unable to reach them . A few animals have survived the long periods without food or proper care at the Khan Younis zoo- such as this pelican . A deer is also counted amongst the survivors of the tragedy which staff blame on the ongoing Palestinian Israeli conflict . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dozens of animals have wasted away from thirst or hunger at Khan Younis zoo in the impoverished Gaza Strip .

"The Syrian Air Force has destroyed two fighter jets belonging to the Islamic State just days after observers claimed to have witnessed the terror group training fighters to use them. Monitoring groups in the war-ravaged country last week claimed to have seen the fanatics flying three captured warplanes over short distances from an airbase in Aleppo - understood to be the first time ISIS has taken to the sky. This morning Syria's Information Minister Omran Zoabi told state news agency SANA that the air force had already destroyed two of the planes and is continuing to search for the third jet. Scroll down for video . Fighter: This morning Syria's Information Minister Omran Zoabi told state news agency SANA that the country's air force (pictured) had destroyed two of the planes in ISIS' hands, and continues to search for the third jet . On Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ISIS had been flying warplanes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo. Iraqi pilots trained under former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were said to have joined ISIS and were conducting training flights in three fighter jets that had been seized from the Syrian regime. This morning Zoabi said the Syrian air force was searching for the third jet but had destroyed two of them - the first time Damascus has acknowledged that Islamic State have taken to the air. 'Regarding ... that terrorists control three jets in al-Jarrah military air base in Aleppo, there are three old aircraft that the terrorists were testing so the Syrian Arab Army immediately destroyed two of them on the runway as they were landing.' 'It does not worry us and [the planes] cannot be used,' he said, referring to their military capability. Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces . On Friday Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the militants 'have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for Saddam Hussein.' ‘People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,’ he added, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 45 miles south of Turkey. It was not clear if the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances. Witnesses near the base in northern Syria said the jets appeared to be decades old MiG21 or MiG23 models captured from the Syrian military. Twitter accounts linked to ISIS had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats. The group has captured several major military airfields, including the vast Tabqa complex, close to their headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and seized aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons. Leader: Twitter accounts linked to sympathisers of the Islamic State have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria. The terror group is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) The base was reportedly one of the Syrian military’s largest facilities in the region, with several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition. Defence analysts say that it unlikely the group's MiGs could be used conventionally as the US-led coalition of Syrian forces would shoot them down. Instead, they could be deployed for spectacular low-level suicide attacks on western targets in the Kurdish city or Irbil or the Iraqi capital Baghdad where the US and Britain have a major presence. The U.S. military said yesterday it was unaware of any flight operations by the group ‘in Syria or elsewhere’. ‘We’re not aware of ISIL (IS) conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,’ said Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder. ‘We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be,’ he added.","Witnesses said ISIS had been carrying out test flights at airport near Aleppo .

"Tearful: Kellie Maloney delivered an emotional speech at the Ukip conference today . Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney received a standing ovation after delivering an emotional speech at the Ukip conference today. Ms Maloney was close to tears as she read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide at the annual meeting in Margate, Kent. The longtime Ukip supporter was also praised by Nigel Farage as proof that his party was 'open to everyone'. Ms Maloney also said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues and added 'we are human beings too'. She was given a standing ovation after reading a poem from two children to their transsexual parent who had committed suicide. 'This poem I am going to read is a really personal poem for me and my family,' she said. 'Both my daughters and I met this brother and sister and my daughters feared they might have to do this at my funeral but we pulled through all our dark moments.' The audience broke into applause to show their support when Ms Maloney's voice started to crack during the reading. Ms Maloney started her speech by apologising for homophobic comments she made while standing to become London Mayor in 2004.  At the time, the high-profile promoter said she would not campaign in Camden because there were 'too many gays'. Today, Ms Maloney said: 'I have learned to say sorry and apologise if I am wrong. 'I made a terrible mistake in 2004 when I made a derogatory remark about the gay community, and to them I apologise. Kellie Maloney (right) was close to tears as she read a poem about a transsexual who committed suicide  and was praised by leader Nigel Farage (left with Ms Maloney) as proof that the party was 'open to everyone' Ms Maloney was warmly received by Ukip members as she said she hoped to help people understand more about transsexual issues. Above, delegates holding party signs clap during the conference . Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall thanked Ms Maloney on stage after her speech at the conference today . 'I had to come to terms with myself and accept that I was a transsexual. It is something I hid and something I fought. Protesters clashed in Margate as an estimated 250 people rallied against the party. Anti-Ukip demonstrators outnumbered about 50 party supporters who were in the seaside town for the annual two-day conference. One woman was arrested on suspicion of common assault. A Kent Police spokeswoman said all protest groups were co-operating with police. 'There have been some very minor verbal exchanges,' she said. 'No-one has been injured and the protest has generally been conducted peacefully. 'Officers remain in the local area to reassure the public and to respond to any incidents if required.' 'I wanted to transition very quietly, but unfortunately my transition is probably one of the most public events of 2014.' Party leader Nigel Farage praised Ms Maloney's speech, saying it was proof Ukip was 'open to everyone'. Closing conference, Mr Farage said it had shown Ukip was 'far, far from a one-man band'. 'The support that I've had as your leader on a personal basis is touching, but also enduring,' he said. 'This party is open to everyone. Our only pride, our only prejudice is that we are patriotic. 'Over the years we have been underestimated by all the media and all the commentators and let me tell you something, they are underestimating the power of this party. 'We will once again surprise everybody, we will put enough MPs in to Westminster to make a difference and be in a position of power.' Mr Farage went on: 'I know that we are in for a rough tough 67 days, but the prize is very very great. I am determined to lead us to a big success on May 7.'","Kellie Maloney read speech about transsexual who committed suicide .

"Malaysia Airlines rerouted a flight to Kuala Lumpur over Syria after airspace above Ukraine was closed after the downing of MH17. Swedish flight tracking service Flightradar24 AB posted a flight map on its Twitter account showing the change in the route of Malaysian Airlines flight MH4, which flies to London. Flight tracking data showed this flight had previously crossed over eastern Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Rerouted: The map shows flight MH4 flying over Syrian airspace on Sunday . Syria is in the middle of a civil war in which 170,000 people have died since 2011. The controversial move comes after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down Thursday by a ground-to-air missile in eastern Ukraine. All 298 passengers and crew on board the flight were killed. Since then, airlines have been told to avoid the airspace above where the Ukrainian military has been fighting Russian-backed rebels. Fredrik Lindahl, chief executive officer of Flightradar24 AB, said it was relatively unusual for transcontinental flights to cross Syria. ‘With Iraq you always see aircraft flying there. There is no other way to access parts of the Middle East than to use the Iraq corridor,’ he said. ‘But you don't see Syria so often. We saw no other trans-continental flight that went through Syrian airspace yesterday.’ Some . regional traffic uses Syrian airspace including a Middle East Airlines . flight bound for Beirut on Monday, according to the Flightradar24 . website. Aviation experts said governments must take the lead in deciding just where it is safe for airlines to fly. Controversial move: Malaysia Airlines used a route over Syria war zone just days after its jet, pictured, was hit by a missile flying over Ukraine . Airlines have flown, safely, over war zones for many years but the tragic incident involving flight MH17 must lead to a re-assessment of the route decision process, the experts said. Tony Tyler, director-general and chief executive of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) said: ‘Governments will need to take the lead in reviewing how airspace risk assessments are made. ‘And the industry will do all that it can to support governments, through ICAO (the International Civil Aviation Organisation), in the difficult work that lies ahead.’ Norman Shanks, visiting professor in aviation security at Coventry University, said: ‘At the moment the approval process leaves it very much up to the airlines to make the final decision on which routes they fly. ‘The security organisations within governments have all the risk information for areas of conflict. ‘If there is a chance that those fighting in a war zone have sophisticated, long-range weaponry then it should be up to the security organisations to say that that area should be completely avoided by airlines.’ Prof Shanks continued: ‘I think it would be very difficult to have a flying ban put over all areas of conflict. Airlines have been passing over war zones for some time. ‘Planes flying at high, cruising altitudes are just not in danger from most land-based weaponry. But if there is information that aircraft could be at risk then it is essential that information is passed on to aviation authorities, including air traffic control organisations.’ Malaysia Airlines said MH4's flight plan was in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) approved routes. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 taking off from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam before it was shot down . ‘As per the notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Syrian Civil Aviation Authority, the Syrian airspace was not subject to restrictions,’ Malaysia Airlines said in a statement. ‘At all times, MH4 was in airspace approved by ICAO.’ ICAO, which said last week it had no operational role and did not have the authority to open or close routes, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Kenneth Quinn, a former chief counsel at the US Federal Aviation Administration and secretary of the US-based Flight Safety Foundation, questioned the wisdom of flying ‘over hotly contested territory’ but said he was not aware of a credible threat against airliners flying in Syrian airspace. Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, one of the world's largest airlines, said it was difficult to avoid flying over conflict zones on main routes between East and West. Airlines assume that when a flight plan is accepted in controlled airspace, it is safe to fly on that particular route, Clark said. There may have to be changes in the way the industry assesses such risks in light of the MH17 disaster, he added. Hundreds of flights routinely crossed over Ukraine before Thursday's incident, and it is not unusual for international airlines to fly over war zones such as Afghanistan. John Saba, a lecturer at McGill University's Integrated Aviation Management Programme in Montreal, said he did not think the Syrian government would fire missiles at airliners. ‘The question is: who has access to these (missiles) and what is the range?’ he said. The US Federal Aviation Administration, whose regulations are among the world's strictest, ‘strongly discourages’ US operators from flying to, from or over Syria, according to a May 2013 notice on its website.","Airline changed the route from flying above Ukraine after downing of MH17 .

"The last big piece of wreckage of the AirAsia jet that crashed into the Java Sea in December has been brought back to land. Flight QZ8501 went down on December 28 in stormy weather, during what was supposed to be a short trip from Indonesia to Singapore, claiming the lives of 162 passengers. Salvage crews on Friday pulled a huge chunk of the Airbus 320-200's fuselage and wings from the sea and loaded it on to a ship, said national search and rescue chief Bambang Soelistyo. Today it arrived at Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. Scroll down for video . Wreck: Police officers examine the newly-recovered remains of the fuselage of AirAsia Flight 8501 on the deck of rescue ship Crest Onyx at Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta, Indonesia. Authorities say this is the last big piece of the ill-fated passenger jet to be brought to the surface . Recovery: A crane lifts the mangled wreck from the rescue ship and on to the harbour earlier today, after it was pulled from the Java sea on Friday. The plane crashed on December 28 during a short flight from Indonesia to Singapore, claiming the lives of 162 passengers . Big job: The wreckage was securely lashed with metal cables before it was lifted from the deck of the Crest Onyx and lifted to the quayside . Destroyed: The extensive damage to the Airbus 320-200 can be seen as it is laid down on the concrete floor of the quayside . Evidence: Bleached white bones and damaged mobile phones discovered inside the wreck, which was brought to the surface on Friday . Safety first: A safety information card found by wreckage search and rescue teams while examining the fuselage . 'We have retrieved on Friday the last and large part of the AirAsia fuselage with a wing still intact,' Mr Soelistyo told AFP. No bodies were found during the course of the operation, he said, but photographs of the wreckage taken today showed bleached white bones among the debris and personal possessions inside the wreck. As he revealed the salvage milestone on Saturday, Mr Soelistyo said authorities will decide on a date to conclude work after a meeting with the victims' families scheduled for this week. Only 103 of the 162 victims of the air crash have been found so far. The AirAsia jet went down on its way to Singapore from the Indonesian city of Surabaya. One of the bodies already recovered was that of British energy company executive Choi Chi-Man, 48, who was flying with his two-year-old daughter Zoe. His wife Mei-Yi Wee and son Luca survived after catching an earlier flight. Grim task: Security guards stand near the newly-recovered remains of the fuselage on the deck of the Crest Onyx . Search: A search and rescue team member steps carefully around the twisted metal and cables of the fuselage wreck . Securely lashed: An engineer checks that the huge pile of mangled metal is well secured before a crane lifts it to the quayside . Sad: Authorities will decide on a date to conclude salvage work after a meeting with the victims' families scheduled for this week . Tragedy: Moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control, who denied his request to be allowed to climb above a storm . Indonesian authorities have said they expect to release their final report into the crash by August. Officials have been reticent about revealing any more details in advance of that report. The country's National Transportation Safety Committee has confirmed French co-pilot Remi Plesel was flying the plane, not former fighter jet pilot Captain Iriyanto. The plane climbed from 32,000 feet to well above 37,000 feet in 30 seconds, officials said, likely in an attempt to avoid a menacing storm. It is believed that it quickly returned to 32,000 feet before 'gradually' descending towards the sea. Moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control to report a storm ahead and asked to be allowed to climb above it, but was told the airspace was too busy. Under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, the state conducting the investigation should release a final report within a year of the accident.","AirAsia flight QZ8501 crashed on December 28 during a short flight from Indonesia to Singapore .

"It's either the most detailed paint job ever or New Yorkers are the most inattentive people in the world. You decide. A video of a model parading around the streets of Manhattan's Midtown neighborhood completely naked - but her legs covered in paint that had been fashioned to look like jeans, complete with stitching and even on-trend patches - quickly went viral this week. The funny footage was part of a social experiment by Model Pranksters to determine just how observant the people of New York City are. The result? Not very. Getting ready: Model Leah Jung is painted by a team of experts from The Body of Art in preparation for a social experiment about New York . Realistic: Naked from the waist down, the model was given paint-on jeans that looked exceptionally real . Don't give a damn: As the model ventured out on the streets of New York, she was filmed from behind to gauge the reaction of the people who passed her . Just another passenger: Even on a packed subway, no one noticed the model was not wearing pants . Bustling: Even in Times Square, no one gave a second look . Mecca: Walking up and down the famous Times Square steps also failed to turn heads . Lunch rush: Customers at McDonald's were much more interested in burgers than Jung's behind . The model, Leah Jung, was expertly painted by body art company The Body of Art, according to Elite Daily. The video, which garnered close to one million views in one day, shows her venturing on the subway, down the steps of Times Squares and even into McDonald's for lunch. All the while, nobody seems to notice she is essentially naked. The best of the footage shows Jung strolling into popular women's fashion chain Forever 21 and asking a staff member where she can buy the same 'jeans'. The employee looks at her and the 'pants' and tells her to 'check downstairs' of the store. However Jung did not go completely unnoticed. While filling up her Metrocard, a man comes up behind her and takes a photo of her, well, behind. She turns just in time to catch him and laughs raucously. Topping up: Jung topped up her Metrocard ticket beside a family, who were none the wiser . Gotcha: One observant man - perhaps the only one - caught the model out, taking a picture of her derriere to prove it . A very similar experiment took place earlier this year in a much more assuming part of the world - North France. A model walked around the city of Lille with painted-on blue jeans, only this model was wearing a g-string. The French model allowed her her pal, make-up artist Marie 'Marie P' Przybylski to paint on a pair of trustyeveryday denim and then she went outside for a stroll. Paired with a bra and shirt tied at the waist, the model, also named Marie, walked the streets as usual. Only her trip managed to cause quite a stir. That's one way to get attention! A French model walks down the streets of Lille with jeans painted on . Work of art: Makeup artist Marie paints a pair of blue faded jeans onto a model . The first shot of the model wearing a white g-string as Marie begins her makeove . The idea was thought up by students Sarah Baboro and David Lesage, who study PR at a school in Belgium. Their homework assignment was to create a 'Buzz video' for their final exam - that is, one that would generate a lot of views and publicity. And it seems they certainly fulfilled their brief. The pair recruited the make-up artist, who took two hours creating the faded blue jeans on Marie's legs using body paint. And she's off!

"An Indian teenager is worshipped as a god because he has a 7ins ‘tail’. Arshid Ali Khan, 13, has become a divine symbol in the state of Punjab. Locals have hailed him a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god Hanuman - and refer to him as Balaji. Scroll down for video . An Indian boy - Arshid Ali Khan, 13 - is worshipped in the state of Punjab because he has a 7in 'tail' However, Arshid has to use a wheelchair and he is considering having the ‘tail’ removed. He said: ‘This tail has been given to me by God. I am worshipped because I pray to god and the wishes of people come true. ‘I feel neither good nor bad about having a tail.’ Arshid lives with his grandfather, Iqbal Qureshi, and two uncles, after his father died when he was four and his mother remarried. Locals have hailed Arshid a human reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god Hanuman . Some people believe that if they worship Arshid their wishes will come true . Mr . Qureshi, a music instructor, said: ‘When he spoke for the first time at . the age on one all he spoke was the names of Gods from different . religions. ‘It was that day I realised that he had something divine and godly about him.’ Arshid's condition has not been formally diagnosed. But, doctors have suggested his walking problems could be caused by brittle bones. Others believe his tail and partial paralysis could be a sign that he has a form of spina bifida called meningocele. This develops when membranes poke through a hole between the vertebrae in the back. He added: ‘It does not matter whether we are Muslims or Hindus, I think there is just one path for spiritualism.’ Arshid's home has been converted into a temple where his devotees come to visit him to receive his blessings and touch his ‘tail’. ‘A lot of people’s wishes have come true after they have visited,’ claimed Mr Qureshi. ‘Sometimes there are childless couples who come to Balaji for help. He blesses them, and often they are then able to conceive.’ However, Arshid often struggles to balance his time with his faithful devotees and attending school and playing with his friends. He said: . ‘Mostly on weekdays I have to go to school but when I have a school . holiday on Sunday around 20 to 30 people come to see me at my home.’ He added: ‘No one teases me. Everybody wants to see my tail and so they keep asking.’ Arshid struggles to walk and is considering having the 'tail' surgically removed . Arshid said: 'This tail has been given to me by God. I am worshipped because I pray to god and the wishes of people come true. I feel neither good nor bad about having a tail' Despite his supposed powers, Arshid has to use a wheelchair and suffers from an undiagnosed disorder. Some doctors in India have told the family it is down to brittle bones while others have said it is due to the 'tail' growth protruding from his spine. Others have suggested he has a form of spina bifida called meningocele. This develops when membranes poke through a hole between the vertebrae, and it can lead to partial paralysis. This . month he is due to see a doctor who has said he can successfully remove . the appendage - but his family are sceptical and say they would rather . he kept his tail than undertake a risky operation. Arshid (pictured as a child with his grandmother) has not been formally diagnosed but could have spina bifida . But Mr Qureshi said: ‘It is for Balaji to decide. If he wants to get the tail removed, we do not mind. ‘He has trouble walking and so we are asking doctors what can be done.’ As for Arshid, he does not believe the removal of the tail will stop the crowds flocking to his house for blessings. He said: ‘Doctors can remove my tail - but people will continue to believe in me.’","Arshid Ali Khan has been hailed a reincarnation of the Hindu god Hanuman .

"A female Tory Minister made a spoof Commons speech on animal welfare in order to say an obscene word after a dare at a dinner with Navy officer friends. Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt said ‘c**k’ six times, ‘lay’ or ‘laid’ five times and mentioned the names of at least six officers during a debate on poultry welfare.

Ms Mordaunt, who took part in ITV’s diving contest Splash! earlier this year, was accused last night of trivialising Parliament. Former Labour Minister Kate Hoey said: ‘She should realise that the House of Commons is not a TV reality show. ‘The public expects debates in the Chamber to be on matters of serious concern. It is sad that she has misused it in this way – it sets a bad precedent.’ But Ms Mordaunt, 41, remained apparently unconcerned, saying: ‘If I have offended anyone I’m sorry.

The publicity-seeking MP confessed to the stunt while receiving an award last week at The Spectator magazine’s Parliamentarian of the Year Awards at London’s Savoy Hotel. Her prize was for a speech earlier this year during which she uttered the words ‘penis’ and ‘testicles’. Explaining how the ‘c**k’ speech came about, she told the Spectator event: ‘Some of my Marine training officers at Dartmouth thought it would be a good idea to break my ladylike persona by getting me to yell particular rude words during the most gruelling part of our training. Making a splash: Ms Mordaunt, pictured with Tom Daley, also said the words 'penis' and 'testicles' in another speech this year . ‘They failed, but during our mess dinner at the end of the course, I was fined for a misdemeanour. The fine was to say a particular word, an abbreviation of cockerel, several times during a speech on the floor of the Commons, and mention all the names of the officers present.’ Ms Mordaunt, who is divorced, took up the challenge and a few weeks later settled the bet in a debate on Parliament’s Easter Adjournment. ‘The cause of hen and cock welfare is raised with me by many constituents,’ she declared with a straight face as she delivered her Commons speech. ‘One strutting coxcomb will lead to many chicks and what is to become of the male contingent with not a layer among them?’ She could not suppress a grin when she said ‘c**k’ for a third time. She went on to discuss the plight of ‘end-of-lay birds’ and ended with a smutty pun disguised as a genuine call for action: ‘Let us have no more cock-ups on hen welfare.’ Ms Mordaunt’s references included ‘cock crow’, ‘cock welfare’, ‘cock-a-hoop’, ‘cockerel’ and ‘cock-ups’. Her references to ‘lay’ included ‘laying hens of pensionable age’, and ‘end-of-lay bird’. Ms Mordaunt’s Marine pals would have been able to watch the speech, on March 26, 2013, live on the Parliamentary TV channel, where it is still available. The MP was criticised last night by Labour’s Sheila Gilmore, who has genuinely campaigned to improve poultry welfare. ‘It is an issue that many people, including me, take seriously. MPs are entitled to a sense of humour but this kind of thing trivialises Parliament,’ she said. At the Spectator awards, Ms Mordaunt suggested it was obvious her ‘poultry welfare’ speech was a prank, saying her main political interest was the Navy. However, she changed her tune last night, claiming she had ‘done quite a bit on animal welfare’, adding: ‘I didn’t make the speech just to make those remarks.’ The Armed Forces runs in the blood of paratrooper’s daughter Ms Mordaunt, who was named after Navy frigate HMS Penelope. She was given a ministerial post in July after David Cameron called her a ‘parliamentary star’. Ms Mordaunt, pictured arriving at Downing Street, became a Minister in July this year . Penny Mordaunt first tested the boundaries of Commons propriety in June when she became the first woman ever to mention testicles in the Chamber. Ms Mordaunt, who at that stage was still best known for being voted ‘Britain’s sexiest MP’ and taking part in ITV’s celebrity diving contest Splash!, brought the house down with a riotously successful ‘loyal address’ – the thank you motion to the Queen following her speech to open Parliament. MPs roared with laughter as the MP told an anecdote about her naval training which included advice on ‘how to care for your penis and testicles in the field’. The sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, who was elected MP for Portsmouth North in 2010, is the daughter of a paratrooper-turned-teacher. Her mother died of breast cancer when Ms Mordaunt was 15 – the same year her father was also diagnosed with cancer – turning her into a ‘child carer’. She took a job as a magician’s assistant to fund her way through college, which involved her being ‘sawn in half’. In interviews to publicise Splash!, she told of a ‘life-changing’ year working in Romanian orphanages, before going to university to study philosophy, and that she has a gay twin brother. The only mention of her personal life was that she lives with her partner Ian Lyon – a classical singer, Burmese cat breeder and director of an IT firm – and eight cats. A marriage certificate unearthed by The Mail on Sunday this year showed that when she was 26 she had a brief marriage to Paul Murray, whom she met while they were students.","Six 'c**ks', five 'lays' or 'laids' in spoof speech by Minister on poultry .

"A tech tycoon, his wife and their four grandchildren were killed after a devastating blaze ripped through their Annapolis mansion in the early hours of Monday, it has been confirmed. Emergency crews in Annapolis were scrambled to the blaze at the waterfront home of Don Pyle, a former CEO, but were unable to save the couple and the children. Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra. Authorities are yet to confirm the deaths but a local headteacher sent out a letter to staff and students on Tuesday confirming the family had been killed and naming the grandchildren as Lexi Boone, Katie Boone, Charlotte Boone and Wes Boone. Stacey Boone, mother to two daughters Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, also confirmed they had died, according to The Capital. In a message on Facebook Tuesday, she wrote: 'I never knew that I could hurt this badly. It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.' It is believed the other two children are the Pyles' grandchildren through another son. Severn School headmaster Douglas Lagarde announced the school would be closed out of respect for the tragedy . It is assumed but not confirmed that some of the grandchildren were enrolled at the Lower School of the $17,770 a year private prep school. It came as criminal investigators pored over the ruins of the house for any signs the blaze could have been arson. Specialists with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives now say the fire is 'suspicious' - partly because of how quickly it ravaged the home. Scroll down for videos . Town in mourning: Flowers and stuffed toys were left at the front gate of the $9million mansion which was detroyed in the blaze . Ruins: Don Pyle and members of his family died in the blaze, according to a local school leader, who canceled lessons to give space to grieve. Pictured above are the still-smoking ruins of the Annapolis mansion Monday afternoon, hours after the blaze started . Gutted: The house, which still needed water poured on it, was ravaged by the flames. Only some of the stone core remained, along with some twisted metal frames . Aftermath: Firefighters were still spraying water on the smoking ruins after the sun rose . Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am Monday, and was reduced to ruins . Owner: Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren, according to a local headteacher. Authorities are yet to confirm all six died . Sorrow: Three grieving women embrace outside of the home, which still has Christmas decorations hanging on the gate . Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle revealed  that the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house . Sources at the bureau told CNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning. The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack. On Monday, all authorities would say is that six individuals including four children were unaccounted. They could not confirm whether they had died in the blaze, and continue to investigate. Relatives, employers, investigators and reporters have all so far failed to reach either of the Pyles. Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people.' In a press conference Tuesday afternoon, firefighting officials said they are still looking for the six people. They would not speculate on whether the fire was deliberate - but also refused to describe it as an accident. He did, however, reveal that the gate to the property was left open at all times, and that the house had no sprinkler system installed. Intense: Eighty-five firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the early-morning blaze - which still needed attention at midday on Monday . Waterfront home: The blaze, pictured from across the water, was reportedly still being fought at midday on Monday . Before: The 16,000sq ft property boasts two swimming pools and its own courtyard, as well as two outbuildings, one of which is connected to the main house by a covered portion. The image above was taken in 2012 . Inferno: The blaze, pictured from the air, tore through the home. Bottom right, firefighters can be seen standing near the pools as they spray water at the ruins . Wreckage: The home had often been the site of charity gatherings and parties, according to neighbors and local reports . Huge loss: The home, built in 2005 to be a cross between a castle and a beach house, was worth an estimated $9million . Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia. He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted. His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value. Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty. Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement. Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. Though most of the fire appeared to have been extinguished by late Monday morning, some firefighters were still reportedly pouring water on the ruins at midday - almost nine hours after the fire started. Fire chiefs said they were not able to search the house during the blaze, and that it is unlikely they will be able to confirm whether there are any victims until later today. ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic. 'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.' Emergency crews: Because the house was nowhere near a fire hydrant, the Anne Arundel County Fire Department deployed a boat to a nearby jetty .","Picturesque property near Chesapeake Bay engulfed by flames in the early hours of Monday morning .

"A 13-year-old Texas girl who was repeatedly gang-raped by 20 males when she was just 11 broke down in court today as she watched a video of one of the horrific attacks. The girl, who authorities haven't named, is testifying against Eric McGowen, 20, in the first trial stemming from the shocking case, which involved the 'pack of animals' raping her sometimes two at a time, anally and with a beer bottle. McGowen is among 14 adults accused of sexually assaulting the girl in the series of horrendous attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston, over four months in 2010. McGowen, pictured prior to his escape, is among 14 adults accused of raping the girl in the shocking series of attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland . He is charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child and faces up to life in prison if convicted. In court today, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. The girl said she was brought into . what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and . others took turns having sex with her. Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly. But she broke down on the witness stand when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks. She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case. She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.' 'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked. 'Yes sir,' the girl said. The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified. She . mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the . floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding. However, she had difficulty remembering names and exactly how all the assaults occurred, according to the Houston Chronicle. Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 in the town of Cleveland, Texas . Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, where the victim was assaulted by as many as 20 men . She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants . called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that . continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer. Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.' Jurors were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers found inside and outside the house in the November incident. McGowen’s attorney, Matthew Poston, questioned the girl for about six minutes, during which time he asked whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never had sex with McGowen. The girl said she didn’t remember saying that. During opening statements on Wednesday, Warren told jurors he would present them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted to raping the girl. 'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said. The prosecutor added that while the girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things against her best interests,' according to the Chronicle. Authorities say the then 11-year-old was . assaulted at least five times between mid-September and early December . 2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student . to a 28-year-old. The attackers filmed the girl being raped and took cellphone photos. Yesterday, a videotaped police interview in which McGowen admitted he and eight other men took turns having sex with the girl, sometimes two at a time, was shown in court. Accused: Kelvin Rashad King, left, and Devo Shaun Green, right, were among those accused of raping the girl . Gang-rape: Xavier King, left, and Marcus Anthony Porchia, right, are among the 20 men and boys in the case . Alleged attacker: Jared Glenn McPherson, pictured, is one of the men accused of raping the 11-year-old . In the video, which McGowen's lawyers . argued should not be allowed as evidence, the 20-year-old initially . denied ever touching the girl, but he later broke down and told . investigators he engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Houston . Chronicle. He also said one of the others penetrated the girl with a beer bottle. On Tuesday, Poston tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out, arguing that police improperly questioned McGowen. During his opening statement, Poston told jurors that the video evidence in the case doesn’t show McGowen having sex with the girl. 'The truth in this case is not always what it seems,' he said. He also said to jurors, regarding the video 'what you'll see will not be pleasant but the most unsettling parts do not contain McGowen having intercourse with this girl.' Today, Poston questioned how the girl learned McGowen's name since she was only aware of his street nickname 'Clyde.' She told him she believed the first time she heard that name was from school police who were questioning her about the rapes, the Chronicle reported. Two men and all six juveniles have pleaded guilty in the horrific case. A gag order has prevented prosecutors . and defense attorneys from commenting about the case. McGowen's . trial, which is being held in the nearby county of Liberty, is expected . to yield further details about the attacks in coming days. The investigation into the shocking gang-rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11-year-old being raped in an abandoned trailer. Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records. The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents. Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticised those suggestions. Two other adults have previously pleaded guilty, with one receiving a 15-year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing. Six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty. They received 7-year prison terms, but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time. Most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child.","Girl was 11 when gang-raped multiple times over four month period in 2010 in Cleveland, Texas .

"Passengers were delayed for nearly two hours when their allegedly drunk pilot was stopped at an airport before getting onto their flight. The pilot, who was not arrested, was due to fly a Frontier Airlines plane from Omaha, Nebraska, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Thursday. But a hotel shuttle bus driver told police that he thought the pilot may have been drunk and unfit to take control of Flight 1894, due to take off at 6am. Scroll down for video .

The flight was a regional route operated by Chautauqua Airlines with 29 passengers, three crew and two pilots, reported ABC affiliate KETV. Frontier Airlines said it is investigating claims that the pilot was impaired. The flight took off at 8am and landed in Milwaukee at 9:30am. A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said Frontier told the agency about the incident as required, but would not disclose the report. ‘Our police received information alleging that a Frontier crew member was impaired,’ a spokesman for Omaha's Eppley Airfield told ABC News. Investigation: The morning flight was a regional route operated by Chautauqua Airlines with 29 passengers, three crew and two pilots on board . Police questioned the pilot before . turning him over to Frontier Airlines staff due to ‘reasonable suspicion that he . was impaired’, he added. Pilots are not allowed to fly within eight hours of drinking alcohol. This is known in the flight industry as the ‘bottle to throttle’ rule.

"Rethink: Baroness Hale called for a rethink on religious and gay rights six months after she condemned a Christian couple for turning away gay guests from their hotel . A judge who condemned a Christian couple for turning away gay guests from their hotel  yesterday said her decision may have been wrong. Supreme Court deputy president Baroness Hale called for a rethink on religious and gay rights six months after she rejected the B&B owners’ arguments in a key test case. Lady Hale said in a speech that the law has done too little to protect the beliefs of Christians. And she cast doubts over her own judgment in the landmark case in which a gay couple sued Christian hoteliers Peter and Hazelmary Bull. Mr Bull, 74, and his 70-year-old wife refused a double room at their Cornish hotel to Steven Preddy and Martyn Hall in 2008 because they were not a married heterosexual couple. The incident led to a string of court cases, which culminated in defeat for the Bulls at the Supreme Court – where Lady Hale, leading four other judges, ruled that the rights of the gay couple outweighed the conscience of the Christian couple. Lady Hale declared in her Supreme Court ruling that we should be ‘slow to accept’ the right of Christians to discriminate against gay people. But in March she acknowledged that the laws which ignore Christian consciences might not be ‘sustainable’. Last week, in a highly unusual move, Lady Hale and her fellow judges ordered that the Bulls will not be liable for legal costs – a decision which spares them a huge bill which would pay for the lawyers who represented Mr Preddy and Mr Hall. And in a speech to Irish lawyers yesterday she gave an indication that her judgment against the Bulls may have been too harsh, asking whether courts would be better off taking a ‘more nuanced approach’. Lady Hale suggested that the law should develop a ‘conscience clause’ for Christians like the Bulls. Court case: Steven Preddy and Martyn Hall were refused a double room at Chymorvah House in Marazion . Christian beliefs: Peter and Hazelmary Bull were told last week that they will not be liable for legal costs . She said: ‘I am not sure our law has found a reasonable accommodation of all these different strands’, adding: ‘An example of treatment which Christians may feel to be unfair is the recent case of Bull v Hall. Should we be developing an explicit requirement upon providers of employment, goods and services to make reasonable accommodation for the manifestation of religious beliefs?’ Last year the Bulls were on the point of selling their hotel, Chymorvah House in Marazion. However they said they have managed to stay in business thanks to help from supporters. Mrs Bull said: ‘The pendulum has swung too far one way. ‘Why can’t two lifestyles live together? It is too late for us, but we are glad the issue hasn’t gone away. It is being debated so there may be an opportunity for more balance to be brought into this.’ And Colin Hart, from the Christian Institute, said: ‘The penny is beginning to drop among judges that the law is unfair. I hope the Supreme Court will find more room to protect Christian consciences.’ Staying put: Last year the Bulls were on the point of selling their hotel, Chymorvah House in Marazion. However they said they have managed to stay in business thanks to help from supporters .","Baroness Hale calls for a rethink on religious and gay rights .

"This is Baroness Thatcher's deathbed, inside the Ritz suite Britain's greatest post-war prime minister spent the final months of her life. Surrounded by the people who cared for her, the Iron Lady died 'peacefully' here following a stroke at 11.28am on Monday, as she sat up and quietly read. Lady Thatcher, who had suffered a series of mini-strokes over the past decade, recognised the symptoms as she fell ill in the luxurious room, 'but this was the one that killed her', a friend said today. The suite, which would cost up to £3,660 a night, boasts 24 carat gold leaf and antique Louis XVI furnishings, and is the size of a small flat. Room: Lady Thatcher had been staying in this suite at the Ritz in Central London, where she had been living since Christmas as she recovered from an operation . 'She had been having a series of blips and this was just another one. She recognised the symptoms and that she was having a little stroke and this was the one the killed her. The doctor was called but it was very quick,' the friend told The Times. Final days: Baroness Thatcher had spent the last months of her life in the hotel as her health failed . It is still unclear what Lady Thatcher was reading when she died, but insiders say it could have been that morning's newspapers. Lady Thatcher may have been paying for the room at a reduced rate or getting it for free from the Barclay brothers, who own the hotel and the Daily Telegraph. Her body was removed from the hotel by private ambulance almost 13 hours later at 12.20am yesterday, and her funeral was scheduled for next Wednesday. Her twins Mark and Carol were abroad . at the time of her death but there were accusations today that they had been limiting visits to her mother. 'They decided to allow one visitor a week at The Ritz and more often than not they would cancel it,' one critic said. 'I feel sorry for her that I wasn't able to see her. I thought I would have been able to cheer her up. I feel cheated that I didn't get to say goodbye'. Tory MP Conor Burns, who would pop in to see her every week, said: 'We would have a couple of what she called ""proper ones"" - stiff gins - or a bottle of wine.' He also said she may not want to talk so he brought magazines or newspapers or they would recite Kipling  and her favourite childhood poem, the Owl and the Pussycat. He also discussed politics with her, and as he told her Nick Clegg wanted to abolish the House of Lords, she replied: 'Well, we should abolish the Liberal Democrats'. In the late period of her life she . had the occasional lunch at the Ritz, where staff always knew to serve . chicken consomme and a main course of lemon sole . Other diners would often give her a standing ovation as she entered the dining room. Scene: Lady Thatcher died in a suite at the five-star Ritz Hotel in central London, where she had been staying because she was not fit enough to live at home . She was also sighted on a park bench . in London enjoying the sunshine in March last year with her carer Kate. Gone were her high heels, replaced by comfortable sandals and a walking . stick. Then, at Christmas, she went to . hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder. When she . came out she was very uncertain on her feet, and a return home was out . of the question. So she . moved quietly into a suite at the Ritz – one of her favourite places – . and she was invited by its owners the Barclay brothers to stay there for . the foreseeable future. She never left. Her . two carers took it in turns to stay with her and the same group of . friends who took it in turns to see her at her Belgravia home were put . on a rota at the Ritz. Ten staff at the prestigious hotel are said to be on the guest list for Lady Thatcher's funeral. Tributes: Fresh flowers are left outside her father's former grocers in Grantham Lincolnshire . Birthplace: Mrs Thatcher grew up above the shop ran by her father Alfred, who was also a Conservative politician and the town's mayor . Yesterday her body was driven away with three . undertakers in the front and escorted by four diplomatic protection . officers on motorbikes. A . BMW 4x4 followed with two men in the front and blacked-out windows . behind. Security was heightened with more than a dozen police officers . surrounding the hotel as the vehicle pulled away. A . police helicopter circled in the sky above. The ambulance drove through . the wrought iron gates at the rear of the hotel, which had been closely . guarded since news of her death broke. Preparations . for the ceremonial funeral - due to take place at St Paul’s Cathedral . in central London with full military honours - were underway as MPs . began planning tributes to her in Parliament. Leaving: Baroness Thatcher's body was removed from the Ritz Hotel in central London by private ambulance . Police presence: The Ritz Hotel had been closely guarded since news of Lady Thatcher's death broke . Meanwhile, the Queen and the Duke of . Edinburgh will also attend the service at St Paul's Cathedral - the . first political funeral Britain's monarch has attended personally since . Winston Churchill's in 1965. Iron Lady: Margaret Thatcher (pictured in 2010) died on Monday aged 87 at the Ritz in central London . Lady . Thatcher's family was expected to gather in London yesterday, with her . son Mark due to fly in from Spain last night and his twin Carol also now . believed to be in the country. After the official funeral ceremony . there will be a separate private family event as Lady Thatcher is . cremated in Mortlake, South West London. It . is understood that her ashes will then be interred next to her husband . Sir Denis's in the cemetery at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea. The costs of the funeral will be shared by the Government and Lady Thatcher’s estate - thought to be around £8million. Former Soviet leader Mikhail . Gorbachev and Nancy Reagan, wife of her closest ally US President Ronald . Reagan, are expected to lead a list of international mourners. MPs . are being recalled from Easter recess today to let them pay tribute . to her. The House of Lords has also been recalled and will sit at 2.30pm . - the same time as the Commons. But . as tributes poured in for our first and only woman prime minister, many . on the Left condemned the social impacts of her policies encouraging . the free market and stripping power from unions. On Monday night, hundreds of people held . parties to ‘celebrate’ her death in Glasgow and Brixton, south London. But today the Government will put down a motion expected to pay . tribute to her. Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to give a statement to the Commons, followed by Labour leader Ed Miliband. There will also be time for backbench MPs to make their own tributes to her. As Lady Thatcher’s health deteriorated, the issue of whether she should be granted a state funeral - as Churchill was - grew increasingly controversial. However, it has emerged that she rejected the idea herself, and also insisted she did not want her body to lie in state or money to be spent on a fly-past. Instead, the streets will be cleared for a procession from Westminster to St Paul’s, where there will be a televised service attended by dignitaries from around the world.","Lady Thatcher, 87, suffered a stroke at five-star hotel in central London .

The policy - which abolishes the use of apostrophes - says that a road called St Paul’s Court would appear in all documentation and nameplates as 'St Pauls Court'. Borrowed . from Italian printers in the early 16th century, the comma replaced the . virgule - a form of punctuation that looked like a diagonal slash - in the English language. Until then, Tudor writers had used the rhythms of speech to determine their use of punctuation. The comma is typically used to indicate an . specific interpretation of the text - particularly in contexts where . ambiguity might otherwise arise. Its . usage includes - but is not restricted to - singling out items in a . list, separating clauses from one another, highlighting adjectives and setting out adverbs at the beginning of sentences. However, there are several inconsistencies in the use of the punctuation mark - for example, the Oxford comma can be optionally used before the word 'and' at the end of a list. It also bans street names which would be 'difficult to pronounce or awkward to spell' and any which 'could give offence' or would 'encourage defacing of nameplates'. Last month, Kathy Salaman, director of Cambridge-based Good Grammar Company, condemned the the council - saying: 'I know some people think apostrophes are superfluous but we really need them and I think it’s the first step on a slippery slope.' She added: 'If councils are getting rid of them, what kind of message does that give out to students at schools?' Although similar in appearance to apostrophes, the comma is placed on the baseline of text. It is typically used to indicate an specific interpretation of the text - particularly in contexts where ambiguity might otherwise arise. Its usage includes - but is not restricted to - singling out items in a list, separating clauses from one another, highlighting adjectives and setting out adverbs at the beginning of sentences . Simon Horobin, professor of English language and literature at . Magdalen College, Oxford, said a recent surge in technology had had a 'knock-on effect' on the comma - with the punctuation mark rarely featuring in text messages and 140-character Tweets. 'The general tendency, especially online . and in [text messages], is towards lighter punctuation, and this is . clearly having a knock-on effect on the use of the comma,' he told The Times. He added that 'splicing' - where commas are used to bind two grammatically . separate sentences into one - and mistakes in 'bracketing' - where commas separate a subordinate clause from the rest of a . sentence - are among the most common errors made in the use of commas.","Professor John McWhorter says punctuation mark could be abolished .

"Joe Cusker, 59, became the 10th Clutha disaster victim when he died in hospital today . A tenth person has died in hospital nearly two weeks after a helicopter crashed into a pub. Joe Cusker, 59, died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary yesterday as officials grounded nearly half of the UK’s air ambulances when investigators discovered a fault. Mr Cusker, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, is the seventh person to have died from inside the Clutha pub, Glasgow, along with two officers and a pilot in the aircraft. The Police Scotland helicopter that crashed through the roof of the bar on November 29 was a Bond-operated Eurocopter EC135 Type 2 aircraft. Now Bond has grounded 22 EC135 helicopters in the UK as a precaution while the issue is examined. The Association of Air Ambulances (AAA), which represents the majority of the air ambulance network, said 16 of its 36 helicopters in the UK were affected by the grounding and were subject to safety checks yesterday. Other air ambulances still in operation will be used to cover the areas currently affected by the grounding, AAA said. Director Clive Dickin said: 'The safety of the aircrew and general public is of primary importance and we are supporting Bond Air Services and Eurocopter who are working closely together to investigate and resolve the technical problem. 'Aircraft of all types occasionally are grounded for bad weather or routine maintenance. In these circumstances, other air ambulances and ambulance service providers work closely to ensure no patients are affected. 'Obviously, when an extremely rare incident like this happens, stresses can be placed on the services and however these contingencies are planned for.' An air operator has grounded an entire fleet of helicopters - the same model which crashed on a pub, killing nine people - after a defect was discovered on a recent flight . A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'Bond Air Services has taken the decision to ground the EC135 fleet. In the meantime, Police Scotland will have air support emergency cover provided by military colleagues.' An initial report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued this week said there was 'no evidence of major mechanical disruption of either engine' of the Police Scotland helicopter as it returned from an operation in Dalkeith, Midlothian, on the night of the crash. A statement from Bond Air Services . said: 'During normal operations yesterday, one of our EC135 fleet has . experienced an indication defect that requires further technical . investigation. 'Therefore as a precautionary measure we have temporarily suspended service operations whilst we undertake detailed diagnosis. 'We . commenced investigations overnight, are continuing this morning and are . in close liaison with Eurocopter regarding this investigation.' Recovery: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has found both engines 'flamed out' during the  flight . The helicopters are used by air ambulance and police forces throughout the UK. It is understood the defect was found in a helicopter used by the North West Air Ambulance service. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: 'Bond Air Services advised on Wednesday evening that, as a precautionary measure, it was temporarily suspending flights of its fleet of Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, including Scotland's two air ambulance helicopters. 'The safety of patients and air ambulance staff is the number-one priority and Bond has taken the decision following a reported technical fault on one of the company's EC135s operating outside Scotland. 'Until the matter is resolved, the Scottish Ambulance Service is operating normal contingency measures whereby any patient that requires transfer by air will be taken by Coastguard and military helicopters, Scotland's Charity Air Ambulance helicopter or SAS fixed-wing aircraft.' The helicopter that crashed in Glasgow hit the flat roof of the Clutha pub with a high rate of descent and with low or negligible forward speed, the special bulletin from the AAIB revealed. The weather was good and the helicopter still had 95 litres of the 400kg of fuel that it had taken off with from Glasgow City Heliport. Mission: The report added that the cause of problem was not clear - with 76kg (168lb) of fuel left in the helicopter's main fuel tank when it crashed.  Above, rescue workers lift the helicopter wreckage from the bar . The pilot of the helicopter, David Traill, and his two passengers - police officers Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins - were killed in the crash along with six people inside the pub. Lynda Brislin, chief executive of the North West Air Ambulance Charity, said: 'On the advice of our aircraft supplier, all three North West Air Ambulance craft, along with all other air ambulances using the same aircraft in the UK, have been temporarily suspended from service. 'We are in continual dialogue with our provider as to when the service will be resumed and are hoping to be operational again as soon as possible. While the matter is investigated, our paramedics and clinical staff are deployed in rapid response road vehicles within the region continuing their vital work saving lives. 'We are unable to provide further information regarding the nature of the suspension at this time as tests are currently ongoing, but we will keep everyone informed as and when details become available. At this time there is no link to any other incidents and this is a precautionary action. 'NWAS will continue to work with other aircraft fleets, including Yorkshire and Great North Air Ambulances together with Air Sea Rescue and Coastguard, and will deploy the most appropriate service available. Our focus, as ever, remains to increase patient chances of survival through rapid response and treatment.' A statement from the British Airline Pilots' Association said: 'Pilots are looking to the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to take charge and provide the industry with the information that has informed the decision to ground the Bond EC-135 fleet. 'Flight safety is best served when there is transparency and openness and these developments leave everyone asking 'Why?'. 'This grounding confirms our belief that a fundamental review about how helicopter operations are regulated is needed; a point we will be making forcefully to the House of Commons Transport Select Committee in their upcoming helicopter safety inquiry.'","Joe Cusker, 59, was in pub and died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary yesterday .

"The key witness in the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was arrested for lying to cops three years ago and currently has an outstanding arrest warrant. Dorian Johnson, 22, was arrested by police in Jefferson City, Missouri, in June 2011 after he allegedly stole a delivery package off a doorstep in an apartment complex. He was attending college at Lincoln University in the city, which is about 120miles west of Ferguson. When cops asked Johnson for his name, he told them he was Derrick Johnson and that he was 16 - though he gave officer a birth date that would have made him 17, according to an arrest report obtained by MailOnline. Officers later found a student ID in Johnson's sock that gave his real name. He was charged with misdemeanor theft and filing a false police report. He pleaded guilty to the latter charge. When he didn't show up to court to answer the theft charge, a judge issued a warrant for his arrest. Scroll down for video . Hands up: Darren Johnson's interview of Michael Brown's shooting helped fuel national outrage over the unarmed teen's death . Arrested: This Dorian Johnson mugshot from his June 2011 arrest for theft and making a false police report. Officials in Jefferson City, Missouri, say Johnson has an outstanding arrest warrant . Witness: Johnson has told reporters that he watched Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson (right) kill his friend Michael Brown (left), who was unarmed . Johnson was with Brown on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri, when 18-year-old Brown was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson. Shortly after the shooting, Johnson told local TV stations that Brown had been surrendering when Wilson opening fire without cause or warning. The footage played on TV networks across the nation. '(Brown) put his hands in the air and he started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired several more shots and my friend died... He didn't say anything to him, he just stood over him and he was shooting. 'We wasn't committing no crime or bringing no harm to nobody, but my friend was murdered in cold blood.' Johnson's account of the shooting sparked fury in Ferguson and outrage across the nation. Johnson later gave several more interviews, including to CNN and MSNBC. Wilson, seen here with his lawyer, Freeman Bosley, gave several interviews - including to MSNBC - pictured . Ferguson police later released  a police report that named Brown as a suspect in a robbery at a convenience store minutes before he was killed and listed Johnson as being at the scene. Johnson never mentioned the robbery in his TV interviews. Johnson's lawyer, former St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr., told WND-TV that the outstanding warrant had been 'resolved.' He said Johnson had been arrested in St. Louis on the warrant. After 14 days, when the deputies from Cole County never came to extradite him back to Jefferson City, St. Louis police released him without charge. Last week, St. Louis NAACP president Adolphus Pruitt told the Post-Dispatch that Johnson's arrest for lying to police didn't hurt his credibility as a witness. 'He’s been very clear about what occurred, and now we have ... four others stating facts that support the statements he’s been making,' Pruitt told the newspaper. 'Why would that diminish other accounts that are relatively the same?'","Dorian Johnson, 22, was arrested in June 2011 after he allegedly stole a package off a front porch .

"The face of evil: Gary Sherrill killed his son with an axe and then claimed he did because he thought the boy was a demon trying to eat him . A Phoenix man did the unthinkable – he hacked his 13-year-old son to death with an axe. Gary Sherrill, 51, told police he killed his son Tuesday because he ‘believed his son was a demon and was going to eat him,’ police said. The deranged man was arrested and charged with first degree murder for a killing that has shocked even veteran police. The horrific crime was discovered after the boy’s mother called police to check on the young boy after Mr Sherrill (her ex-husband) was late bringing him back from a visit and she was unable to reach them by phone. Phoenix police arrived at the unemployed man’s gritty apartment on the city’s north side and initially met resistance, a neighbor told  ABC 15. The killer told officers the boy was not home, that he was a good guy, said Divina West, adding that he said he was a boy scout leader and that he wouldn’t hurt children. ‘But obviously he did,’ she lamented. Officers pushed their way into the home to make the horrifying discovery. The boy had been killed with an axe. The father immediately went on the offensive. He admitted to killing the boy, but claimed he was afraid of him because he was a ‘demon possessed’ who tried to eat him, according to an arrest report cited by multiple media outlets. House of horrors: Mr Sherrill lived in this seedy apartment on the northern fringe of Phoenix - he's now residing in a jail cell . The bloodbath shook officers to the core. ‘It is difficult, we find it hard to believe that there are people still out in this world who would do this kind of harm to another person, even more so, to their own child,’ Phoenix Police Department Sgt Steve Martos told AZ Central before pausing to compose himself. A depiction of praying hands and a prayer candle could be seen in the disturbed man’s mostly blocked out windows. Ms West told Fox 10 of the moment the boy’s mother was told what had happened. She let out a series of horrified screams, she was shattered knowing she’d never see her son again. ‘The mother of the child was down here and crying and screaming and inconsolable obviously,’ said Ms West. Religious man: Hands clasped in prayer and a prayer candle are displayed in Mr Sherrill's window . A neighbor who spoke to multiple television stations but did not want to be identified painted a picture of a strange man living a bizarre life. ‘I know that all the windows were blacked out with tin foil.  I never saw the child playing whenever he was let out of the house, he had a tight hold on him’ the woman said. ‘In the beginning, I kind of thought he might be kidnapped,’ she added, saying that she called Child Protective Services out of concern but was told nothing could be done unless she actually witnessed the boy being abused. No abuse was ever seen, she said. It is not known how long the boy’s mother and Mr Sherrill were divorced, and if he had any history of mental illness, but divorce papers obtained by Fox 10 hinted at problems. Blocked out windows: Mr Sherrill blacked out his windows with cardboard and tin foil, neighbors said . ‘The father is unemployed and that has likely impacted his mental state,’ said the papers. Multiple neighbors told AZ Central the man had been acting strangely in recent days, and that police had been to the apartment multiple times. He even jumped out of the bushes at one woman and tried to talk to her, but she had no idea what he was saying and stuck around only to make sure he did not follow her home. Neighbors were quick to point out the neighborhood was usually quiet, but that Mr Sherrill and his blacked out, boarded up windows and strange behavior stood out. Joe Harris told AZ Family he’s having a hard time coming to grips with the boy’s violent death. ‘It puts a pit in my stomach,’ he said. ‘It doesn't make me feel good. You don't want to live down the street from where a little kid was killed.’ Mr Sherrill screamed about war and tried to wriggle free from police as he was led away, neighbors told Fox 10. He rang in the new year sitting in a jail cell while the boy’s mother shed tears over the loss of her son.","Gary Sherrill, 51, admitted to cops he killed his 13-year-old son .

Once the Duke and Duchess  of Cambridge had taken their positions on the royal barge, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh . boarded the Britannia launch to reach the barge, which was moored a . quarter of a mile from Chelsea Pier. The Duchess of Cambridge's red Alexander McQueen outfit was a vibrant but safe choice which allowed the Queen to shine on her big day, one fashion expert said today. The 2011 Alexander McQueen fitted dress with pleats in the skirt was a similar shade to the scarlet Marianne coat by Catherine Walker Kate wore on the final day of her tour of Canada. Carly Wood, who set up the katemiddletonstyle.org blog, said: 'It immediately reminded me of Kate's all-red patriotic ensemble from Calgary, on her final day in Canada last year. 'I was assuming she'd go for red, white or blue today. I love that it's bright and vibrant and a nice contrast to the weather. 'It's a little safe in my opinion, but then I expected that - it is after all the Queen's big day and the Queen should take centre stage - not Kate and her outfit.' The dress is 2011 Alexander McQueen and was also worn, without sleeves, by reality TV star Kim Kardashian and Tulisa Contostavlos at the X factor auditions last year. Kate's version today had full length sleeves and a longer hemline than the original. It . would likely have been an emotional moment for the Queen, who wept when . the Britannia was decommissioned in 1997, as the launch had accompanied . her on dozens of voyages across the globe. The Royal Standard was raised as the . Queen's launch arrived alongside the Spirit of Chartwell, where Kate, . William and Harry were waiting for her.

Julia James, 18, and her sisters Vicky, 17, and Tania, 12, from Malvern in Worcestershire, were full of praise. 'That dress is amazing,' said Julia. 'It's stunning and it suits her so well. She was so nice too. 'We shook her hand and she was asking how long we'd been here and talking about the pageant. She was so lovely.'

"When Louis van Gaal took over at Manchester United earlier this summer, the future looked bleak for Ashley Young. There appeared to be no place for the 29-year-old in Van Gaal's favoured 3-5-2 formation and, after a poor campaign under David Moyes last season, Young looked almost certain to be offloaded. Five games later, however, and Young  looks to have saved his United career by reinventing himself as a wing-back in the mold of Dirk Kuyt, who caught the eye at the World Cup with some industrious displays for Holland. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ashley Young's Sportsmail freestyle . Show of strength: Ashley Young (left) goes shoulder to shoulder with Glen Johnson . Catch him if you can: Raheem Sterling bursts away from Ashley Young in United's 3-1 win over Liverpool . Impressed: Louis van Gaal has given Ashley Young plenty of game time during United's pre-season tour . VIDEO Van Gaal demands a lot and the players have responded . But is Young really cut out to play that role week in and week out in the Premier League? Four goals - two of them against Real Madrid - and a series of penetrating crosses and dribbles during United's pre-season tour of America provided a reminder of Young's attacking qualities. But his defensive limitations were exposed against Liverpool on Monday morning. A lapse in concentration allowed Raheem Sterling to run in behind him leading to Phil Jones hacking down the Liverpool midfielder and conceding a penalty - which Steven Gerrard duly dispatched. An isolated lapse may be, but Young has never been known for his defensive qualities. When Sir Alex Ferguson or David Moyes needed an auxiliary right back in the absence of Rafael, they always turned to Antonio Valencia. The Ecuadorian has more physical presence and big-game defensive experience than Young who, after all, has only impressed in his new role in meaningless pre-season friendlies. No Shaw thing: £30m man Luke (left) has been told to improve his fitness by Louis van Gaal . Competition: Antonio Valencia has been preferred at right in the past that Ashley Young . Bulking up: Ashley Young takes part in a opening training sessions before United's victory over Liverpool . Focued: Ashley Young concentrates on his exercises during United's open training session last week . In the Premier League last season Young managed a little over a tackle a game (1.14) compared to Valencia's 2.32. In 20 games, Young managed to block just one shot and make 10 interceptions. Valencia by comparison blocked six shots and made 39 interceptions - although he did play nine more games. Valencia also made more headed clearances and won a higher percentage of tackles than Young, who also fails in comparison to Rafael and Luke Shaw - who will also be challenging for the wing-back spots. In defence of Young, however, Rafael for all his attacking qualities still has a tendency to jump into tackles. Valencia has not been as potent going forward as Young, while Shaw will have to prove he is able to step up to playing for a big club like United. It is clear that none of Van Gaal's options are perfect but he has seen something in Young that Ferguson and Moyes didn't. The Dutchman has been keen to get his players thinking on and off the pitch and it was interesting that Young was chosen to speak alongside the Dutchman at a press conference last week - something which rarely happened under Ferguson and Moyes. Spot on: Dirk Kuyt scores a penalty for Holland against Costa Rica at the World Cup . Making his mark: Dirk Kuyt tackles Pablo Zabaleta (left) and shows his crossing ability during the World Cup . Tight marking: Dirk Kuyt gets to grip with Lucas Biglia of Argentina during the World Cup . Young spoke well and it may be that Van Gaal is hoping he can reinvent and tutor the winger in a similar way to how he used Kuyt at the World Cup. Kuyt, a former striker turned winger, impressed for Holland as a left wing back and the pair share certain similarities. Young too is a good athlete and hard worker able to get up and down the pitch well. Young also prefers to play on the left rather than the right - 'as a right-footed player, you can cut inside, have a shot and link up with the midfielders and forwards' - and with doubts over Shaw's fitness, he may well start United's opening League game against Swansea on August 16. Defensively Young will have to improve if he is to keep his place in the team but he is very much the in-form man. And if Young keeps scoring and proving a threat going forward it will be hard for the Dutchman to ignore him. However this experiment turns out, Young at the moment deserves praise for reigniting his United career and the Old Trafford faithful will be hoping to see a new and improved man wearing the No 19 shirt this season.","Young scored four goals during United's pre-season tour of America .

"Aliens may have sent microorganisms to Earth inside metal balls to create seed life on our planet, an astrobiologist has claimed. Dr Milton Wainwright claims to have found a tiny metal sphere that was oozing a 'gooey' substance in samples gathered by a balloon in the Earth's stratosphere. The University of Sheffield and the University of Buckingham scientist says that the ball, which is about the width of a human hair, could be an example of directed panspermia - where life was deliberately sent to Earth by some unknown extraterrestrial civilisation. Scroll down for video . The metal sphere found by Dr Wainwright and his colleagues (above) appears to be oozing goo from its side . He argues that the strange material coming from the titanium ball is biological and could in fact be a colony of tiny microorganisms. Panspermia is a theory that suggests life spreads across the known physical universe, hitchhiking on comets or meteorites. For example, life such as extremophiles, capable of surviving the inhospitable conditions of space, could become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets. The idea of directed panspermia, however, suggests that lifeforms are deliberately sent out through the universe by intelligent civilizations . Professor Francis Crick, one of the biologists who discovered the structure of DNA, examined the possibility of this in a paper in 1973. However, Professor Crick and his ccolleagues concluded that the scientific evidence was 'inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability'. However, he has conceded it is virtually impossible to prove that the tiny sphere was sent by aliens from outer space. Dr Wainwright said the sphere made a tiny 'impact crater' on the sampler that was attached to the balloon as it collected dust and particles in the atmosphere. He said: 'The sphere made an impact crater on the sampling stub. This proves beyond doubt that the particle was travelling at speed from space when it was sampled.' Dr Wainwright and his team discovered the sphere when examining samples of dust and particulate matter collected by a balloon sent around 16 miles into the atmosphere. Using X-ray analysis to examine the sphere, he concluded that it was made from titanium and traces of vanadium, while the material appearing to come out of the side was biological. They found that it also had a 'fungus-like knitted mat-like covering'. He claims that it could have been carried to Earth on a comet or even sent by an unknown civilisation. Dr Wainwright and his colleagues have published their findings in the Journal of Cosmology but their conclusions have yet to be corroborated by other scientists. The journal often publishes papers on astrobiology but is highly controversial among scientists as it has been criticised for its peer review process and for publishing papers of a fringe variety. The scientists collected the samples from the stratosphere, seen above from a weather balloon . Two years ago it controversially published a paper that claimed to have identified fossils of microbiotic life in a meteorite, sparking a blaze of publicity, but was also met with a great deal of skepticism. In the past Professor Wainwright and his team claimed to have found fragments of single celled algae called diatoms in samples taken from the stratosphere. The idea that life can survive high the Earth's atmosphere, however, is not new. Scientists working with Nasa recently discovered bacteria living up to five miles above the Earth's surface. However, most scientists believe they are likely to have been carried up from Earth rather than having an extraterrestrial origin. Air currents and winds are known to be capable of carrying dust and bacteria for hundreds of miles and high into the atmosphere. But some research has shown that microorganisms can survive the intense heat and pressures of entering the Earth's atmosphere from space, raising the prospect that life may have originally been carried here. Dr Wainwright used balloons similar to this one above to collect samples from the stratsophere . Some astrobiologists believe life started on Earth after being carried here on a comet or asteroid, while others believe it is more likely that the basic chemical building blocks were carried in this way rather than established life. However, the idea of directed panspermia has been proposed by some heavyweight scientists. Professor Francis Crick, one of the team who one a Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA, examined whether it was possible that organisms could have been deliberately transmitted to the Earth by intelligent beings from another planet. However, he concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to support such a claim. Dr Wainwright, however, insists his findings may help to provide some of that evidence. However, he added: 'Unless of course we can find details of the civilisation that is supposed to have sent it in this respect it is probably an unprovable theory.' Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, an astrobiologist at the University of Buckinghamshire and editor of the Journal of Cosmology who also worked with Dr Wainwright on the study, added: 'I think more work needs to be done on this particular structure, for example to study its DNA, if it has any. 'But already there is clear proof from many directions to confirm that we are constantly bombarded by fragments of comets that carry living microorganisms.' However, Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, said the idea that such material were being sent out by aliens attempting to seed other planets was a 'leap of the imagination'. He said: 'This would seem to provide proof that outer space and not just the surface of our planet is teaming with life. 'I'm sceptical about this and we would need to collect more samples like this to have a better idea of where it originates from. 'It is a leap of the imagination that it came from an ET race trying to seed our planet with their biological constructs. ‘Perhaps there are luminous or ‘invisible’ jelly-fish like creatures that inhabit our skies, or microorganisms flooding our planet, I’m not convinced, but they are fascinating ideas that make a change from stories of starships loaded with aliens.’","Dr Milton Wainwright from the University of Sheffield used balloons to collect samples of dust and particles 16 miles up in the Earth's atmosphere .
In one sample he found a tiny metal ball that left impact crater in the device .

"Two firefighters with the Austin Fire Department were pictured saving a dog from flood waters in central Texas yesterday. The department posted the picture of firefighters Matt Harvey and Michael Cooper with the animal to their Facebook page, saying:  'We don't just rescue two-legged victims...we love our four legged friends as well. The animal looks like it's been through a lot, and clings to one of the firefighters as if they're hugging. Scroll down for video . Firefighters' furry friend: Firefighters Matt Harvey and Michael Cooper of the Austin Fire Department are pictured rescuing a dog from a flash flood yesterday in central Texas . Since posting the image, the picture has gathered more than 2,000 likes on Facebook and many animal-lovers expressed their gratitude to the firefighters in the comments section. Overnight rains of up to 15 inches in some areas swelled rivers and washed out low-lying crossings in a swath of more than 100 miles around Austin, Texas, according to Jon Zeitler, meteorologist with the National Weather Service Austin-San Antonio office. 'For certain areas, it looks like this will be in their Top 10 (flood events) of all time,' Zeitler said. Overflowing: More than a foot of rain fell in the central Texas region between Wednesday and Thursday, sparking flash floods through the area . Rescued: Two neighborhoods in Austin were put on mandatory evacuation yesterday. Above, Isabel Rodriguez and her children Christoper, 3 (left), and Rubi, 8 months (right), are carried on a boat on Quicksilver Road after their home was flooded on Thursday . Up: During a new conference yesterday, Austin City Manager Marc Ott said that some people had to cut holes through their rooftops just to have access to the outside. Above, a family is rescued from the top of their home in southeast Austin yesterday . A man died on Thursday in a flooded area southeast of Austin after being caught in high water in his car, officials said. Local media later in the day reported a second body in a creek closer to the city but further information was unavailable. More than 1,000 homes in neighborhoods near rising creeks were evacuated during the height of the floods. 'We saw very significant flooding,' City Manager Marc Ott said at news conference yesterday. 'In some cases people cut holes through rooftops to have access to the outside.' The storm was caused in part by Hurricane Raymond, which dissipated in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday. Its remnants pulled heavy weather across the western United States. That combined with warm, humid, low-lying air from the Gulf of Mexico and cooler air at higher altitudes to produce the floods - conditions expected to return next week with more potential for flooding from a tropical storm brewing in the same region, Zeitler said. The storm system had shifted out of Austin and to the east by Thursday morning. As of Friday, the city was beginning to access the damage.","Two Austin firefighters were pictured yesterday rescuing a dog from flood waters .

"In his book, Dr Ellis Silver points to a number of physiological features to make his case for why humans did not evolve alongside other life on Earth . A U.S. ecologist has claimed that humans are not from Earth but were put on the planet by aliens tens of thousands of years ago. Dr Ellis Silver points to a number of physiological features to make his case for why humans did not evolve alongside other life on Earth, in his new book. They range from humans suffering from bad backs - which he suggests is because we evolved in a world with lower gravity – to getting too easily sunburned and having difficulty giving birth. Dr Ellis says that while the planet meets humans’ needs for the most part, it does not perhaps serve the species’ interests as well as the aliens who dropped us off imagined. In his book, HUMANS ARE NOT FROM EARTH: A SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE, the ecologist writes the human race has defects that mark it of being ‘not of this world’. ‘Mankind is supposedly the most highly developed species on the planet, yet is surprisingly unsuited and ill-equipped for Earth's environment: harmed by sunlight, a strong dislike for naturally occurring foods, ridiculously high rates of chronic disease, and more,’ he told Yahoo. Dr Ellis says that humans might suffer from bad backs because they evolved on a world with lower gravity. He also says that it is strange that babies’ heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth, which can result in fatalities of the mother and infant. Dr Ellis says that humans might suffer from bad backs (illustrated) because they evolved on a world with lower gravity. He also says that it is strange that babies' heads are so large and make it difficult for women to give birth, which resulted in fatalities in earlier times . No other native species on this planet has this problem, he says. He also believes humans are not designed to be as exposed to the sun as they are on Earth, as they cannot sunbathe for more than a week or two – unlike a lizard – and cannot be exposed to the sun every day without problems. Dr Ellis also claims humans are always ill and this might be because our body clocks have evolved to expects a 25 hour day, as proven by sleep researchers. ‘This is not a modern condition; the same factors can be traced all the way back through mankind's history on Earth,’ he says. He suggests that Neanderthals such as homo erectus were crossbred with another species, perhaps from Alpha Centauri, which is the closest star system to our solar system, some 4.37 light years away from the sun. He also believes humans are not designed to be so exposed to the sun as they are on Earth, as they cannot sunbathe for more than a week or two ¿ unlike a lizard ¿ and cannot be exposed to the sun every day . Dr Ellis said many people feel that they don’t belong and feel at home on Earth. ‘This suggests (to me at least) that mankind may have evolved on a different planet, and we may have been brought here as a highly developed species.’ ‘One reason for this … is that the Earth might be a prison planet, since we seem to be a naturally violent species and we're here until we learn to behave ourselves,’ he said. Dr Ellis said the book is intended to create debate, instead of being a scientific study and hopes it will lead to people getting in touch with him with further suggestions of 'evidence'. While other scientists have said some bacteria arrived on Earth from space, Chris McKay, an astrobiologist at NASA, said that to jump to the conclusion that it is alien life is ‘a big jump’. Was this home? Dr Ellis suggests Neanderthals such as homo erectus were crossbred with another species, perhaps from Alpha Centauri. Star Proxima Centauri is pictured in the star system, which is the closest to our solar system some 4.37 light years away from the sun . Professor Wainwright from the University of Sheffield plans to investigate further, and believes that life is constantly arriving from space that did not originate on Earth. Dr Ellis says that while his idea is an extreme evolution of that idea, it is intended to be thought-provoking and he claims to have had a largely positive response to it. He is interested in whether humans came to Earth separately, perhaps by arriving on meteors and comets, before evolving into the species we know today. ‘My thesis proposes that mankind did not evolve from that particular strain of life, but evolved elsewhere and was transported to Earth (as fully evolved Homo sapiens) between 60,000 and 200,000 years ago,’ he says.","A U.S. ecologist says conditions such as bad backs and sunburn suggest humans did not evolve alongside other life on Earth .

"A 45-year-old Portuguese mother was in custody in France last night after her 'secret' baby was found naked, filthy and shivering in the boot of her car. The woman, who is believed to have kept the birth a secret from her husband, left her vehicle at a garage where mechanics discovered the baby, said by some sources to be 12 months old and others 23 months, after hearing her wailing. The child was lying in a basket and suffering from dehydration according to reports. A 45-year-old Portuguese mother was in custody in France last night after her 'secret' baby was found naked, filthy and shivering in the boot of her car in Brignac-la-Plaine . When they opened the boot, they told Police, there was an overpowering stench. Investigators and medics rushed to the scene and took the infant into care. The mother and her husband  -who was reportedly drunk in charge of his scooter -  were arrested. DNA tests on the child were ordered yesterday to establish her exact age and prove she was born to the woman. Neighbours of the couple who lived at Brignac-La -Plaine in the Correze department of SW France were incredulous at news of the discovery. 'They are people like any others and not dirty. 'I went to their house several times and there was never any trace of a baby. 'We never noticed that she was pregnant', said a villager. The couple's three other children had attended the local school and appeared normal. According to Sud Ouest newspaper, the mother told gendarmes that she had kept the birth of the child a secret and her husband was unaware of her existence. She had given birth to the baby in a corridor at the couple's house aided by a neighbour, it was said.","45-year-old Portuguese mother in custody in France .

"Big softie: The TV mogul dotes on his two fur babies . They are the cute ‘fur babies’ who are helping Simon Cowell prepare for impending fatherhood. The X Factor supremo and his girlfriend Lauren Silverman adopted Yorkshire terrier pups Squiddly and Diddly last month – and he says they are helping him ‘road test’ his £22 million Beverly Hills mansion before the arrival of their child early next year. Cradling the puppies in his arms, a clearly smitten Cowell, 54, said: ‘I’m experimenting right now with Squiddly and Diddly. ‘I think dogs are good training for babies. They are still puppies and they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house. ‘This is a bit of a road test for the real thing. Squiddly is the girl and Diddly is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun. I would say to anyone thinking about getting a dog – just do it. They bring so much happiness into your life.’ The Mail on Sunday was given an intimate look inside the life of the pampered pooches in this exclusive set of photographs taken at the music mogul’s sprawling home. The Yorkies have free run of the house and spend most nights curled up at the foot of their master’s king-sized bed. Cowell, who once admitted he was ‘fanatical’ about everything in his house being ‘just so’, has clearly relaxed his rules for the new additions to his family. In one shot, Diddly is seen drinking water from a fine china cup and saucer placed on a designer leather side table while Squiddly – who is virtually identical to her brother except for an ear which flops over – perches on a silk cushion on the custom-made sofa. Life is tweet: Cowell has been posting uncharacteristically soppy messages about the dogs, like the on above which contained a picture of Squiddly . Another picture shows the pair relaxing on top of Cowell’s magnificent grand piano. A source said: ‘Simon is devoted to the dogs. He adores them and they have the run of the place. Rex factor: Cowell seems to be enamoured with Squiddly, who is the female one of the puppies . 'Whenever they go missing they’ve usually raced upstairs to find Simon. Normally there isn’t a pillow out of place but he’s relaxed the rules for the puppies. They are very much his babies but he’s definitely the master. He went away recently and  when he came back he had to have words with Diddly because he was strutting a little. ‘There was a bit of a drama when one of them almost fell into the swimming pool the other day. Obviously the whole house will be properly child–proofed before the baby arrives. But the dogs have been a wonderful addition to the household.  Simon has a dog trainer but it’s pretty obvious they are the ones training him now.’ It is thought Cowell named the pooches after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid called Squiddly Diddly. But during an earlier season of the US X Factor, he referred to his fellow judges Nicole Scherzinger and Paula Abdul by the moniker, dismissing them with the words: ‘I think the audience at home are going to disagree with Squiddly and Diddly here.’ Dog house: The cute pooches seem to be enjoying life in the music mogul's £22m Beverly Hills mansion, above . There has been online speculation that a . private chef cooks for the pups, but it is, in fact, Cowell who is in . charge at meal times. They are being raised on organic canned dog-food, . which their master feeds them twice a day. He and Lauren walk them . together every evening. The puppies are house-trained and have had piles of dog toys lavished upon them, according to insiders. Cowell says he will set up a Twitter account for the Yorkies soon, and has already used his own account to post pictures of the dogs. One was labelled, ‘Happiness is 2 puppies asleep’, another shows a dozing Squiddly with her eyes rolling back with the caption ‘Squiddly has gone mad’ and in another she is lounging on his bed with her tongue poking out, with the message: ‘Squiddly wants an ice cream.’ Puppy's got talent: Squiddly and Diddly perched on top of a piano in Cowell's home . The pups have already had a taste of the spotlight, appearing on TV  in America as their owner filmed segments promoting the latest series of the American X Factor. Cowell has long been a dog-lover and has said: ‘I’m going to leave my money to charity, probably dogs and kids. I don’t believe in passing it on from one generation to another.’ He is also a huge fan of dog acts, backing talented pooch Pudsey to win Britain’s Got Talent last year.","Cowell and girlfriend Lauren Silverman adopted the cute pups last month .

"Sir James Munby, Britain's most senior family judge, condemned his fellow judge's decision to fund the document translation . An absent father in Slovenia was awarded£23,000 in legal aid to have British court documents translated from English, it emerged yesterday. A judge ordered that the man had the right to read 591 pages of reports about the case that will decide the future of his eight-year-old daughter – who lives 1,000 miles away from him in England. The cost of translating the papers, said by a district judge to be ‘essential’, amounted to just over 10p a word or £38 a page. The bill for the father – who speaks no English – was condemned yesterday by the country’s most senior family judge. Sir James Munby said it was ‘impossible to justify’. He warned lawyers who protest about cuts to legal aid that it was ‘no good complaining that public funds are available only for X and not for Y if money available for X is being squandered’. Sir James, president of the High Court’s Family Division, said it was only necessary for the father to be able to read 51 pages of documents. But translating even the slimmed-down bundle of legal and social work papers is still likely to cost taxpayers around £2,000. The case will decide the future of three children of a Warwickshire woman who are in state care. The oldest is the daughter of the Slovenian man, but Sir James said ‘little of the documentation relates to or refers to him’. However, a district judge in Coventry, who was not named in Sir James’s ruling, decided in a hearing in November that the father could not make his views known in court ‘until he has had the opportunity of considering the papers’. The district judge ruled that the father should be able to read more than half of the nearly 1,000 pages. But Sir James said the 591 pages to be translated included 23 pages of Warwickshire council’s legal applications; 16 of court orders; 17 of immigration reports on another person; 32 of transcripts of recordings of the children; 131 of statements by the mother; and an index. ‘I could go on,’ he said, adding: ‘Why are these pages in the bundle at all?’ He criticised lawyers who let files of court documents grow to the length of a novel, and said they should be no longer than 350 pages. The High Court judge warned lawyers who put bigger files before the court that they may have their fees docked, their papers destroyed, or be ordered to start the work again. ‘Public funds, whether those under the control of the Legal Aid Agency or those under the control of other public bodies are limited,’ he said. ‘It is essential that such public funds as are available are carefully husbanded and properly applied.’ Last month, Sir James attacked the failure of the legal aid system to provide a lawyer for two parents with learning difficulties from Swindon trying to stop their three-year-old son being adopted. He said the refusal to grant aid, on grounds of the father’s £800-a-month earnings, was ‘neither compassionate nor even humane’.","£23,000 in legal aid for translated notes agreed for absent Slovenian father .

"A baby girl named Betsey died, having being starved to death while strapped in her car seat as her parents ate a Florida Golden Corral restaurant. The parents of the 22-day-old . baby have been charged with . first-degree murder, police said on Tuesday, accusing them of . neglecting the suffering infant. Ruby Stephens, 23, and Roy Stephens, 48, of Indiana, were . visiting relatives in central Florida on December 23 when they . called 911 after discovering the baby was . unresponsive in their car, according to Lakeland Police. Betsey Kee Stephens was declared dead at the hospital. Ruby Stephens, 23 (left), and her husband, 48-year-old Roy Stephens (right), have been charged with first-degree murder in the starving death of the woman's newborn. Mr Stephens was not the girl's biological father . Neglected to death: Betsey Kee Stephens lost over 2lbs in the three weeks since her birth, weighing only 4lbs 1 ounce at the time of her death inside her parents' car . 'She suffered tremendously over the 22 days that she was . alive,' Mike Link, assistant chief of Lakeland Police, told a . news conference. He called photographs of the baby 'absolutely horrible.' ‘When I saw the photographs…it shook me to my core because in thirty years, I have never seen anything like that,’ Link told MyFox Tampa Bay. Ruby Stephens told authorities that after arriving at their Comfort Inn hotel earlier December 23, she had checked the baby's feet and covered . them with a blanket because they were cold. The family went to a restaurant on US Highway 98 North in Lakeland to eat with relatives. The chain Golden Corral touts an 'endless buffet.' When . the mother went to take the baby out of a car seat just after 6pm, according to . the arrest report, she noticed the baby was 'completely . unresponsive and cold to the touch.' A medical examiner later determined the death was a homicide . resulting from 'starvation due to neglect,' according to an . arrest report. The baby had been dead for more than three hours before the parents took notice and called for help. An autopsy found Betsey weighed only 4lbs 1 ounce at death, having shed about 2lbs since her birth. Normal weight for her age was about 8lbs, the medical examiner's office noted. The baby was also dehydrated and appeared not to have been fed . for six to seven hours prior to her death, according to the . report. Too late: Little Betsey had been dead for three hours before her parents took notice and called for help outside this Golden Corral eatery in Lakeland, Florida . Ruby Stephens told police that she had 'strictly breastfed' the baby every two-three hours on their way to Florida. But after police told . her about the autopsy's findings, she acknowledged that the baby . likely had not been fed for much of their day-long road trip, . with highway traffic making it difficult to exit to feed her. The mother later told police that the infant had shown signs . of health issues, but she had missed a December 18 doctor's appointment to have her . weight checked before the Florida trip. Roy Stephens was not the biological father, the mother told . authorities, and had not paid much attention to her from birth. 'The obvious infidelity and subsequent pregnancy created a strain on the marriage,' the arrest affidavit read. Police said the couple from Tennyson, Indiana, were . traveling with their 1-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter.

"A  finance manager stole more than £240,000 to fund her lavish lifestyle - increasing her own salary 135 times and even using a company credit card to pay a £400 vet's bill for her dog Max. Liza Starling, 45, was trusted as a model employee at family-run corporate tailors Stuncroft Ltd of Bury St Edmunds from 2005 to 2012. Its 36 employees had no idea she was secretly giving herself £4,000 bonuses, taking £11,500 loans she had no intention of repaying and clearing her £6,090 credit card bills. Starling had a company Mazda, company credit card, and regularly took flights to Belgium to oversee its operation there. But secretly she was stealing cash to spend on holidays to France, a designer kitchen, a new bathroom, new carpets and an extension on her £200,000 home in Wickham Market. She spent so much rebuilding walls in the Georgian house she described it as her 'money pit'. High life: Liza Starling, 45, pictured enjoying a cocktail was jailed for four years for stealing £241,000 from her firm. She cooked the books and gave herself unauthorised pay rises and payments . Her salary was £23,000 when she started with Stuncroft as the firm grew to 30 employees in Bury St Edmunds and 34 in Goole with a division in Belgium. She took on extra responsibility and claimed her salary ballooned to £75,000 when it should have been only £30,000 with yearly increases. No one knew she was stealing from 2005 to 2012 until she left and a new finance director found a black hole in the company accounts. However, today a jury at Hull Crown Court convicted her of three charges of theft totalling £241,000. The firm suffered financially and had to close its Bury St Edmonds site in 2012. Jailing her for four years Judge Mark Bury said: 'You have been convicted on overwhelming evidence of the systematic theft of more than £240,000. 'That theft started out with fairly modest sums to see what you could get away with and increased substantially. No one knew she was stealing from 2005 to 2012 until she left and a new finance director found a black hole in the company accounts . 'Your offending was motivated by greed and the desire to live beyond your means. You breached the high level of trust given to you by your employer. 'Over the years you stole significant amounts of money to pay yourself extra wages. One of the aggravating features is you sought to blame loyal members of staff, including the former finance director John Grundy saying that he allowed you to borrow £40,000 over four years. 'Mr Grundy is now dead and cannot defend his good character, but you knew that in your police interview. I have watched you give evidence. 'You have shown no remorse. Your arrogance was breath-taking. You tried to hoodwink the jury, but the saw through your obvious dishonest actions.' The jury found her guilty of three charges of theft after a six-day trial. Her husband of 24 years has supported her in the public gallery and gave her one last hug before she was taken away. Defence barrister David Gordon said: 'She has spent her first night in prison and found it shocking. It will have a detrimental effect on her and her husband. 'She suffers from fibromyalgia which leads to joint pain as well as high cholesterol which won’t make her stay in prison any easier. 'For all her offending she has nothing to show for it. The house she took in Suffolk was sold for £155,000 and of the £70,000 equity very little remains because of the debts she paid off. She described is as a project but it became a bottomless pit. 'She is now living in rented accommodation. No one has suggested her husband was involved. It was a shock to him as it will be to the rest of her family. 'Her parents are in their 70s and they have been kept in the dark. Her husband has the unenviable job of telling them about the court case today and one hopes it won’t have too detrimental an effect on their physical and emotional health.' Stuncroft is a corporate clothing supplier and was founded by tailor Brian Long who died in 2008. Starling sought to hide behind his death and that of John Grundy, the finance director, in her efforts to explain why she was receiving thousands of pounds through the company which was not in her contract of employment. Starling, of Gainsborough, accepted in police interview she regularly ran out of money 'because her Suffolk house was falling down' and asked Mr Grundy for a loan who said 'of course, pay yourself the money.' Liza Starling's dog Max. She stole money from her employers £400 to pay for his vets bill . She said she discussed a loan of £40,000 which she took in instalments of up to £11,500 a time in 2008. But money was never paid back. To hide her tracks from auditors she used false codes in the bookkeeping system. In one example she made it look like a payment to clothing outworkers in Bangalore, India. In another case she paid herself £3,875-a-month mirroring a director’s company pension payment so it was overlooked or thought to be an error. She claimed in January 2008 she was given a pay rise to £75,000, but there was no supporting letter or email. In December 2011 she gave herself an additional £4,000 Christmas bonus. But her world came tumbling down in June 2012 when she handed in her notice to managing director Douglas Bailey claiming she was stressed and could not work for him. New finance manager Elizabeth Hay took over and  was unable to make the books balance. She contacted the bank for breakdowns for the mysterious payments, finding each time money was paid to Liza Starling. It was the tip of a financial iceberg. Starling did not pay the necessary Inland Revenue tax on her thefts. She had the audacity to make a further five separate thefts after she handed in her notice, coding her final additional payment as 'finished goods' to hide it from auditors. Humberside Police are to launch a separate Proceeds of Crime Act Investigation in an effort to claw back her ill-gotten gains. Judge Bury said he did not believe all her assets had gone. Speaking after the hearing Stuncroft managing director David Bailey said: 'I have 36 hard-working employees in Goole and I gathered them together last night to tell them. 'The staff were all shocked. I sat through the court case and was saddened by what I heard. Liza Starling worked hard, but she stole a lot of money and justice has now been done. 'This all happened before I became managing director and was discovered a year ago and in many ways the company is in a different place now to what it was. 'My main priority is to look after the 36 people we have working for us and our customers and move on. 'We are not flying, but we are in a healthy position and that is down to the hard-work of the staff. We have many of them women in their 50s and 60s who let’s be honest are not paid highly but we are proud to work with.'","Liza Starling, 45, faked company records to hide the payments .

"The World Cup is the greatest sporting stage and shop window of all and the footballing feast in Brazil has served up more than its fair share of magical moments. Barclays Premier League clubs will be baying to bag some of the wares on offer, and here are five players Sportsmail want to see in England. Ahmed Musa – Nigeria – CSKA Moscow – 21 – Value: £8.5million . The Nigerian striker excelled against Argentina, demonstrating composure and quality in scoring two goals. The first goal, beautifully curled past Sergio Romero, was only usurped by the brilliance of Lionel Messi. Only 21 years old, CSKA Moscow’s pacy forward has already represented his country on 40 occasions. Wonder strike: Ahmed Musa hit two in the loss to Argentina and can look foward to a showdown with France in the round of 16 . Enner Valencia – Ecuador – Pachuca – 25 – Value: £7m . Three goals in three group games for the Ecuadorian who began his career as a raiding right-back before being transformed into a prolific forward. Valencia, who scored 18 goals in 23 games for Pachuca in  Mexico last season, also struck with a fine header in the friendly against England and may be an affordable target for mid-ranking Premier League sides. Attention getter: Enner Valencia has three goals to his name at this World Cup . Guillermo Ochoa – Mexico – Out of contract - 28 – Value: Free . Perhaps the best in individual performances during this World Cup, the Mexican produced the save of the tournament as he hurled himself to his right to claw away Neymar’s goalbound header in the 0-0 draw with Brazil. Anybody that can keep out Brazil’s golden boy for 90 minutes must be worth a look. A wanted man: Guillermo Ochoa is a free agent after his contract with Ajaccio expired . Marcelo Diaz – Chile – Basel - 27 – Value: £9m . Described by the Spanish press as the ‘Chilean Xavi’,  the authoritative Basel midfielder has patrolled the Sampaoli midfield with his intelligent positioning and sharp anticipation. Metronomic in his passing, Diaz has emerged as one of Chile’s most important players. Boasting Champions League and international experience, he would be a shrewd move for one of England’s leading sides. Influential: Marcelo Diaz (right), who plays for Basel, is one of the bedrocks of Chile's success . Daley Blind  - Holland – Ajax - 24 – Value: £13m . The shaggy-haired full back has been relentless up and down Holland’s left flank for Louis van Gaal, displaying defensive acumen in shackling Alexis Sanchez in the 2-0 victory over Chile. His attacking forays have been the most eye-catching, though, and his remarkable delivery for Robin van Persie’s jaw-dropping header against Spain created one of this tournament’s defining moments. Following in familiar footsteps: Daley Blind is son of Danny, former Ajax captain and now one of Louis van Gaal's assistants .","The World Cup is the biggest shop window of all and many have shone in Brazil .
Players such as Ecuador's Enner Valencia and Ahmed Musa of Nigeria have impressed .
And has there been a better individual performance than Mexico keeper Guillermo Ochoa's display against Brazil?
The 'Chilean Xavi' is plying his trade in Switzerland... would he be a shrewd move for a big gun?
Daley Blind has also impressed in Holland's defence... but is he worth his price tag?"

'Keep going, Martin Place was just the beginning for you dogs': The extremist's tweet to the AFP . ‘What struck me the most was that some of things he said on Twitter were very disturbing and he also commented on the Australian Federal Police’s Twitter account calling them ‘dogs’,’ Mr Mallah said. ‘What I think I have have learned from his conversations on Twitter with me and others is that he is an Australian called Jake who used to live in Melbourne. He’s already tried to make contact on Twitter with a friend of his at the Hume Islam Youth Centre (HIYC) in Melbourne.’ Abdullah tried to get in contact with an old friend believed to be living in Melbourne . On Christmas Day he let his friend know he was in Ramadi in Iraq . On Christmas Eve ‘Abdullah’ tweeted a friend: ‘Remember me? Revert at hiyc, tall, white, skinny, long hair, we used to speak on Facebook.’ When his friend replied that he remembered him, Abdullah said: ‘I finally made hijra in August, I’m in Ramadi now.’ Ramadi is a city in central Iraq. The HIYC is based in Motto Drive Coolaroo, Victoria, but no one could be contacted for a response. Later on Christmas Day Abdullah tweeted: ‘That’s twice now I’ve seriously considered coming back and following Sheikh Adnani’s fatwa in Australia.’ Shaykh Abu Mohammad al-Adnani al-Shami is the official spokesman and a senior leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Abdullah tweets that he would only be too happy to see a fatwa take place in Australia . On Boxing Day he replied to a tweet posted by the Australian Federal Police about two men who had charged by the Joint Terrorism Team in Sydney saying: ‘Keep going, Martin Place was just the beginning for you dogs.’ The police are taunted by Abdullah after they reveal that the Joint Counter Terrorism Squad had made arrests . While in another tweet he admitted to a friend he had been banned from Facebook for things he had written. ‘This guy is serious enough to leave Australia and join ISIS so all the signs are there. It’s a new Twitter account. We don’t know what he’s up to but through Twitter he’s clearly creating a network of people he knows in Australia,’ Mr Mallah said. Security in Australia has been raised as the threat of ISIS attacks becomes more worrying . In response to the revelations a spokesperson for the Attorney-General’s Department said they would continue to do all they can to support community leaders, who play 'a critical role in dissuading young Australians from becoming radicalised and travelling to the conflict zones to fight.' 'The government is committed to working with our communities to combat the radicalisation of young Australians and violent extremism. We have consulted with experts and with representatives of the community on the best way to keep the Australian community safe,' the spokesperson said. Mr Mallah, 30, from Westmead in Sydney was jailed in maximum security for two years before being acquitted of terrorism charges . In 2003 Mr Mallah was the first person to be charged with terrorism back after he made a video which Federal Police and ASIO said contained a planned suicide attack on federal government offices in Sydney. A Lebanese Australian, Mr Mallah was charged under Australia's then new anti-terrorism laws after he made the video. He spent two years in the high maximum security Multi Purpose Unit at Goulburn prison awaiting trial, before being acquitted. Since the rise of ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra he has become very outspoken against them. Today he sees them only as 'a barbaric cult' . Just four hours into the Sydney siege counter terrorism police contacted Mr Mallah and asked him for an ISIS flag to help with their investigations .","Australian man claiming to have joined ISIS has contacted a Sydney activist on Twitter .

"Created: . 09:19 EST, 6 February 2012 . A martial arts expert known as the Norwich Ninja has displayed his superhuman abilities by sitting in the snow wearing only a pair of shorts in a state of deep meditation for 30 minutes. Martin Faulks, 34, endures temperatures of -4C while sat completely still outside - with only a video camera recording his feat for company. The married father-of-one, from Norwich, recorded the short film yesterday as Norfolk was blanketed in three inches of snow. Scroll down for video . Ninja: Martin Faulks, 34, tests his endurance by sitting in the snow wearing only his underpants in -4C temperatures. Scroll down to see the video . Martin uses the powers of his mind to survive the freezing temperatures after dedicating his life to following the ancient art of Ninjutsu. The 34-year-old, who claims to be as 'silent as a jaguar', can pick locks and walk through fire after years of training. He claims his stalking skills are so honed that he can creep up quietly and touch a deer - although he admits he used to do the same with foxes until one bit him. Martin, a publisher by day, has dedicated his life to following the ancient art of Ninjutsu and the stunning act of endurance is just part of his continuing training. Martin needs total tranquility in order . to focus his mind and hides out in the woods of Norfolk at 6am to . perfect his meditative feat. He said: 'I wouldn't recommend anyone try this if they have not had the appropriate training. 'I have spent the last 17 years studying the meditative arts morning and evening and under guidance I have built up my body bit by bit. 'Superhuman powers': The married father-of-one claims his stalking skills are so honed that he can creep up quietly and touch a deer - although he admits he used to do the same with foxes until one bit him . 'I've been practicing meditating outdoors for years and as the months get colder I enjoy finding out how much I can stand.' Martin says that while he is sat in freezing temperatures he is able to control his internal thermostat so that he feels like he is sitting on a beach in scorching sunshine. The practice is called Tummo in Tibet - a form of yoga which means Inner Fire. A fall in core temperature of only 1C can lead to hypothermia but practitioners of Tummo claim to be able to generate their own body heat. Dutchman Wim Hof currently holds 18 world records for enduring extreme cold and claims to use the tantric practice to control his body temperature. Martin said: 'It's not actually that . bad once you get the hang of it. When you have a fever your inner . thermostat can generate large amounts of heat so through meditation I am . able to tell my body to heat up. 'In this case, I'm completely warm and comfortable like you would be when you are sat in the sun on holiday. 'I'm . not imagining myself anywhere in particular, I'm just completely in . touch with my body and telling it to increase its temperature. 'Just like you might turn up the heat in your house, I can do it with my body as long I can retain focus.' The . technique, which Martin has perfected by training with Taoist martial . artists in China and the bodyguard to the Dalai Lama, is extremely . advanced and must only be practiced by those who have received proper . training. He said: 'I have to find somewhere where I won't be disturbed so I normally do it just before sunrise. 'It was very windy on Saturday which obviously makes it a bit more difficult. 'In cold running water I can withstand about 10 to 15 minutes and in snow like that I do about half an hour.' In the past, Martin has filmed himself . standing under a freezing cold waterfall in order to toughen up his . body for the rigours of ninja life. He has also travelled the world to train with ninja masters, test his stealth and endurance and learn the necessary skills. However, . his work often takes him to dangerous places and he once hurt his . shoulder falling out of a tree and dislocated a finger as he practised . acrobatics. In 2009, Martin . put his ninja skills into practice when he single-handedly fended off a . gang of would-be muggers in London and came to a woman's rescue in . Norwich when she was attacked by a man. Ninjas, also known as shinobi, have been feared and revered throughout history for their talents as assassins, scouts and spies. They are mainly noted for their use of stealth and deception but also for their amazing powers of endurance. Ninjutsu can be translated as ‘Art of Stealth' but also means ‘Art of Enduring' and the ninjas themselves were noted for being able to walk long distances without stopping, jump over seven feet and dislocate their joints to escape from small spaces. Martin filmed his latest physical feat to show how the mind can hold the answer to the body's external problems. His abilities are due to be studied by the Applied Physiology department at Portsmouth University who have been conducting studies into people cold responses for many years. He said: 'I believe that we have far more potential as human beings than we are led to believe. 'The mind can bring healing and help us to recover from illness. I believe it can also help to promote well-being and provide us with the solutions to many of our problems. 'At a time when the use of anti-depressants is at an all-time high and people are turning more and more to medicine for solutions to their external problems, I hope to inspire people and teach them that the solutions can be found within themselves. 'People are a lot stronger than they think they are.'

"The Islamic State group has released at least 200 Yazidis after five months of captivity in Iraq, mostly elderly prisoners who may have been slowing the extremists down. General Shirko Fatih, commander of Kurdish forces in Kirkuk, said almost all of the freed prisoners are in poor health and bore signs of abuse and neglect. Three young children are among them. The militants transported the captives from the northern town of Tal Afar, where they were being held for the past five months after the militants raided their towns last summer. They dropped them off at the Khazer Bridge, near the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil.

Gen Fatih said they are now being held by Kurdish authorities for questioning. He said it appears the militants released the prisoners because they were too much of a burden. 'It probably became too expensive to feed them and care for them,' he said. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled in August when the Islamic State group captured the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar, near the Syrian border. But hundreds were taken captive by the group, particularly women. Iraqi and international authorities later said that some Yazidi women were sold into slavery. Hersh Hussein, a representative from the Irbil governor's office who was in Alton Kupri, said the condition of the released captives was 'very bad, especially the psychological condition.' 'Regarding other diseases we provide first aid and the most important medical treatment,' he said. Maha Faris Qassem, 35, was released with her two young sons, both of whom were covered from head to toe in inect bites which appeared to be infected.

"Around 2.6 million years ago, the first stone tools began appearing in the archaeological record. But now researchers have found that our early ancestors may have had the ability to use stone tools around half a million years earlier. Far from being the fumbling creatures we believed, a look at fossils of Australopithecus africanus reveals the species had human-like hands capable of 'squeeze' gripping. Top row from left to right is the thumb of a chimpanzee, a thumb fossil hominins Australopithecus africanus and two speices of early humans. The bottom row shows 3D renderings from the scans of the same specimens, showing a cross-section of thetrabecular structure inside . Dr Matthew Skinner and Dr Tracy Kivell from Kent University analysed on the internal spongy structure of bone called trabeculae. This remodels quickly during a lifetime and can reflect the behaviour of individuals, as well as how they use their hands. The researchers compared scans of Australopithecus africanus and modern ape hand bones with scans of hand bones from modern species. This included a 90,000-year-old Homo sapiens, two roughly 60,000-year-old Neandertals, Romans and Egyptian Nubians who lived between about 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. Researchers have found that our early ancestors may have had the ability to use stone tools more than half a million years earlier. Pictured is an example of a human precision grip, grasping an Australopithecus africanus thumb fossil which is thought to be two to three million-years-old . Far from being the fumbling creatures, a look at fossils of Australopithecus africanus reveals the species had human-like hands capable of 'squeeze' gripping. Pictured is a pattern of trabecular bone distribution - the spongy part of the hand - in Australopithecus africanus (left), Neanderthals (centre) and Homo sapiens (right) Australopithecus africanus was one of the longest-lived early human species. So far, paleoanthropologists have uncovered remains from more than 300 individuals in Eastern Africa. Pictured is an artist's impression . They found humans and Neanderthals had hands capable of holding items between the thumb and fingertips. The researchers found that Australopithecus africanus had human-like hands that were capable of precision grips. This would have helped them squeeze small objects, such a stone tools. These early members of the human family tree also had an opposable thumb. These hand features may have evolved from earlier human ancestors that hadlong fingers and short thumbs, which climbing trees. The researchers said it is possible the patterns in the bone were created by handling stone flakes and cutting meat. It is equally plausible that they could be using it to access various vegetable materials like potatoes, yams, they said. The Australopithecus africanus fossils, excavated at South Africa’s Swartkrans Cave, had concentrations of spongy bone at the base of the thumb and in the knuckles of the third and fifth fingers - similar to homo sapiens. Meanwhile, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons show a different pattern of spongy bone distribution in their hands, caused by tree climbing. This means that even if Australopithecus africanus had not been considered as toolmakers before, they were at least prepared to handle stone tools with a precision grip. The researchers said it is possible the patterns in the bone were created by handling stone flakes and cutting meat. It is equally plausible that they could be using it to access various vegetable materials like potatoes, yams, they said. Their findings cast doubt on the long-standing assumption that Homo habilis was the first hominin toolmaker. It follows research that emerged last week he first conversation between our ancestors was about DIY and likely took place between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago. This study found stone tool-making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the African savannah. Researchers found clear differences between humans, who have the ability for precision gripping between thumb and fingers, and chimpanzees, who are unable to do this. Fossils analysis revealed Australopithecus africanus (second left), also had a human-like trabecular bone pattern . Australopithecus africanus had ape-like face proportions, including a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw . Fossil bones of Australopithecus africanus were  previously excavated at South Africa’s Swartkrans Cave . It suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought, and that tool-making helped drive evolution. Australopithecus africanus was one of the longest-lived early human species. So far, paleoanthropologists have uncovered remains from more than 300 individuals in Eastern Africa. The species survived for more than 900,000 years, which is over four times as humans. Previous studies into Australopithecus africanus has found that they had a mixture of primitive features and of more advanced features typical of later human species. Their children grew rapidly after birth and reached adulthood earlier than modern humans. They had ape-like face proportions, including a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw. They are believed to have had small brains, which were a third of the size of a human brain. Marks (shown in the green boxes) suggest the use of the bone fragment for carved sharpening the cutting edges of stone tools . Neanderthals have a reputation for being lumbering, cavemen with low IQs, but a new discovery suggests they may have been more intelligent than we think. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices. This skill was previously attributed to our species, Homo sapiens, and casts a new light on evolution 250,000 to 28,000 years ago. 'This is the first time a multi-purpose bone tool from this period has been discovered,' said Luc Doyon from the University of Montreal. 'It was long thought that before Homo sapiens, other species did not have the cognitive ability to produce this type of artefact. 'This discovery reduces the presumed gap between the two species and prevents us from saying that one was technically superior to the other.' The tool was uncovered during annual digs at the Grotte du Bison at Arcy-sur-Cure in Burgundy, France. Extremely well preserved, the tool comes from the left femur of an adult reindeer and its age is estimated between 55,000 and 60,000 years old.","Discovery was made by analysing Australopithecus africanus fossils .

"A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence after a young soccer star was so badly abused by the crowd in an FA Cup match that he broke down in tears. Oldham defender Tom Adeyemi became upset after becoming the target of a section of the crowd at the famous Kop end at Anfield during Liverpool's tie with Oldham. Police are investigating after fans allegedly called the youngster 'a f****** black b******' during their team's 5-1 victory over their lower league opposition. The man, from Aintree, was arrested yesterday by Merseyside Police, who are investigating the incident, but he has since been released on bail. Adeyemi, left, is consoled by a team-mate after being racially abused by fans . It is understood that Adeyemi, 20, has given a . statement to police in which he claimed he was the victim of a racist . attack. The event will undoubtedly mar the . club's reputation following the recent suspension handed out to striker . Luis Suarez for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice . Evra. And football is still reeling from the . fact that England captain John Terry, meanwhile, is to face trial . accused of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers' defender Anton . Ferdinand during Chelsea's defeat at Loftus Road earlier in the season. Race is also high on the political agenda, with this week seeing the jailing of two thugs, Gary Dobson and David Norris, for the murder of young black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993 in Eltham, South-East London. It was near the end of the FA Cup 3rd round match at Anfield that last night's ugly incident took place. Abuse seemed to emanate from the famous Kop end of the ground where, according to witnesses, fans were seen wearing Luis Suárez T-shirts and brandishing scarves bearing the player's name. Adeyemi turned to confront his abuser, becoming visibly upset. Players from both sides intervened with Liverpool . captain Steven Gerrard and striker Dirk Kuyt among those attempting to . reassure the Oldham player. As players from both teams tried to calm down Adeyemi, fans in Liverpool's stands then began singing the name of Suárez, upsetting the young player even more. He appeared to be in tears as he lifted his shirt to wipe his face. A witness who gave evidence to . Liverpool officials and the police was quoted by the Guardian as saying: . 'I was to the right of the Kop and the No11 turned to walk away after a . tackle. 'I heard a single voice shout, ""You . f****** black *******."" He spun round with shock on his face and started . pointing at the crowd, from where the shout had come.' Adeyemi, centre, is restrained by Dirk Kuyt, left and match referee after receiving a tirade of racial abuse from the Anfield crowd . Adeyemi is surrounded by players from both teams and the referee as they try to calm him down after the incident . Liverpool today said it had passed on CCTV footage, photographs and statements from stewards to the police as well as giving officers access to video filmed for its in-house TV channel. A statement said: 'Liverpool Football Club continue to work closely with Merseyside Police to establish all the facts surrounding the incident that occurred during last night's game. 'We take this matter extremely seriously and have today provided the police with the evidence we currently have available to us. 'In addition, we have examined records of the tickets purchased in that part of the ground to see if they provide any additional information and have passed that on to the police. The abuse comes just days after the jailing of two men for the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 . 'Finally, we would also urge any of . our supporters who witnessed this incident or saw the individual . involved and who have not already done so, to contact either the club or . the police.' Local . police have released a statement, adding: ‘Merseyside Police can . confirm that no one has been arrested this evening (Friday, 6 January) on suspicion of racially aggravated behaviour during tonight's FA Cup . fixture at Anfield. ‘However, . the Force and Liverpool Football Club are investigating following an . incident that occurred during the second half of the game. ‘The . aim of the investigation is to establish the full circumstances . surrounding the incident to ascertain if any action needs to be taken.’ Today football fans around the world were expressing their disgust with the events at the match on Twitter. Sai Adithya wrote: 'The way the #LFC fans started singing Luis Suarez after abusing Adeyemi is plain disgraceful!' Meanwhile, . Paul Dunn was able to turn the abuse into a dark joke that reflected . the bad feelings over Liverpool's handling of the case involving Suarez. He . wrote: 'Liverpool FC officials are desperate to identify the fans who . racially abused Tom Adeyemi, so they know which names to print on the . t-shirts.' Others took the abuse, coming so soon after the Suarez scandal, as evidence that Liverpool was a 'racist football team'. South . African football fan Kabelo MKhonto wrote: 'Liverpool is a racist . football team fi[r]st they abused Patrice Evra now Tom Adeyemi who was . visibly upset and tearful...' And . back in the UK Patrick McCafferty from Doncaster tweeted: 'Shocking . abuse aimed at Tom Adeyemi last night. LFC should be embarrassed and . ashamed. Racists WILL WALK ALONE. Horrible club and fans.' Indignation: Adeyemi points into the crowd at where he believed he heard the racist abuse . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, 2nd left, offers Adeyemi, right, his reassurance after the Oldham players was abused by the home crowd . Oldham manager Paul Dickov said he had not spoken to the player about the incident, but accepted something had upset him. Police have arrested a man after former Liverpool star Stan Collymore was racially abused on Twitter. Northumbria Police said the man, 21, was being held on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment and was being held in custody. The investigation began after Staffordshire Police passed on an allegation to Northumbria colleagues in the early hours. Collymore, 40, originally from Cannock, Staffordshire, played for a string of top clubs, including  Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest. He works as a radio pundit for talkSPORT, campaigns against racism and is a supporter of the charity Depression Alliance. Collymore was sent a series of tweets from someone believed to be in the Tyneside area. 'From my point of view I have not spoken to Tom about it but I know the kid and something has been said,' he said. The Scot continued: 'He is a placid . boy, a kid who has been well-educated with a fantastic temperament and . has been with us since the end of August and I've never seen him raise . his voice. 'For him to . react like that it is obvious something has been said but what has been . said I don't know because I've not had a chance [to ask] - I was too . busy praising my players. 'He is fine now. He has calmed down. He is a laid-back kid who just gets on with business. 'Our . players went and calmed him down and the Liverpool players did as well, . which was fantastic and is why they are top professionals. 'I . have been told the police are investigating it but that is all I know.' Born and raised in Norwich, Adeyemi is on loan to Oldham Athletic from . Norwich City, who he signed for in 2008, aged 17. He . made his debut for Norwich in 2009, and in 2010 was named Championship . Manager Apprentice Of The Year at the Football League Awards. All eyes will be on the reaction of Liverpool, especially after the Suarez saga. The Uruguayan was accused of calling the . French international 'negrita' - literally translated as 'black' more . than ten times during their 1-1 draw at Anfield. He has since been banned for eight . weeks and eventually apologised, but did not say sorry to the player . himself. Distastefully, Liverpool players showed solidarity for their . team-mate by wearing Luis Suarez T-shirts after he was charged. Oldham boss Paul Dickov, left, is flanked by police and the fourth official during the clash . Racism is high on the political and social agenda at the moment after Labour MP Diane Abbott found herself enmired in a race row over comments on Twitter suggesting white people like to play 'divide and rule', apparently referring to colonialism. Criticism of the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP deepened after she yesterday suggested that taxi drivers were racist and would not stop for black people.

"Drummer Lee Rigby, of the Royal Fusiliers, was brutally murdered by extremists as he walked along a street in Woolwich, south-east London last May . Work has begun to engrave the name of Lee Rigby and 16 other forces heroes killed on duty in 2013 on Britain's largest military memorial. The Fusilier, killed by Islamic extremists in a street in Woolwich, south-east London last year, will be immortalised alongside 16,000 other military personnel at the Armed Forces Memorial in the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire. Stonemason Nick Hindle began producing the tribute yesterday morning and is expected to take several weeks to chisel the name of the murdered soldier, and 16 others killed last year, into the Portland stone walls. The 17 armed forces personnel killed on duty in 2013 is the lowest annual total since 1946. Mr Hindle said: 'It's painstaking work, but given the scale of sacrifice it represents, it's a job I'm hugely honoured to do. 'Carving around ten letters per hour, I expect to be working on the memorial for several weeks. 'Visitors are always moved at seeing me add so many names and I'll regularly stop and answer their questions about the process. 'I have done some military work before, but this is one of the biggest monuments in the country. 'You really are concentrating on what you are doing, but at the same time you cannot help but think of the stories behind each and every name. 'Everything has been double checked, cross checked and signed off to make sure there are no mistakes and it is all measured out very carefully.' Father-of-one Lee Rigby was just 25 when he was brutally murdered outside Woolwich Barracks on May 22 last year. In February this year, Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, were jailed for life for hitting the dad-of-one with a car before attacking him with knives and a meat cleaver. Lee Rigby's name is now being etched into the Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire by engraver Nick Hindle . His name will appear alongside those of 16 other servicemen and women killed on duty in 2013 and 16,000 other armed forces personnel whose names are already on the memorial . The names of three army reservists who died from overheating on an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons are also due to be engraved. L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, L/Cpl Edward Maher, 31, and Cpl James Dunsby, 31, collapsed on July 13 after a 40-mile hike in 29.5C temperatures. Andrew Baud, spokesperson for The Royal British Legion, added: 'The Armed Forces Memorial has got the names of 16,000 men and women killed since the end of World War Two. 'The names will be dedicated in a special services of commemoration later in the year. 'Many families tell us that they feel great pride that their loved one's name is etched forever on the memorial's Portland Stone walls.'

"A woman murdered her  parents and buried them in  their back garden with the help of her husband – then told their neighbours and relatives they had moved to Ireland for the ‘good air’, a court heard. William and Patricia Wycherley were each shot twice before being wrapped in bedding and ‘stacked’ one on top of the other under the lawn. Their debt-laden daughter Susan Edwards, 55, and her husband Christopher, 57, buried them after watching the Eurovision song contest on a bank holiday weekend in 1998, the court heard. Scroll down for video . Accused: Susan Edwards, 56, (left) and her husband Christopher, 57, (right) are accused of shooting dead her parents Patricia and William Wycherley, burying them and stealing from their bank account, while tricking relatives into thinking the couple were still alive . They then covered the grave with . plants and spent the next 15 years tricking family members, neighbours, . doctors and financial institutions into believing the Wycherleys were . still alive. Meanwhile they . ‘cleaned out’ the Wycherleys’ bank accounts and continued to steal . their pension and benefit payments, the court was told. When they realised the net was closing in, the pair relayed a ‘carefully hatched and rehearsed story’. Christopher . Edwards claimed his wife shot her mother after Mrs Wycherley, 63, . boasted about sleeping with him. Mrs Edwards told police her 85-year-old . father had abused her as a child. Prosecutor . Peter Joyce QC said the defendants kept up the deception that the . Wycherleys were still alive by writing ‘jocular’ letters purporting to . be from the dead couple in response to cards or correspondence. Shallow grave: The bodies of Mr and Mrs Wycherley were discovered wrapped in bedding in a makeshift grave in their back garden last October . They . even managed to trick solicitors into allowing the sale of the . Wycherleys’ home. Mr Joyce said: ‘They deceived and tricked everyone . into believing that Susan Edwards’ parents, William and Patricia, were . still alive. ‘They could . then cover up the killings and continue to fund their own lifestyle and . help to solve their financial difficulties out of monies that were . continuing to be paid to the Wycherleys.’ The . money – £66,000 from the sale of the house, along with £173,767.40 in . pension and benefit payments – was ‘diverted’ into a joint account . opened in the names of Susan Edwards and her mother after the May Day . bank holiday in 1998, when the  murders are alleged to have taken place. Applications for bank loans and credit cards were also made in Mrs . Wycherley’s name. The . ‘reserved and reclusive’ Mr and Mrs Wycherley had two joint accounts . holding £40,000 which were ‘cleaned out’ days after the murders. Nottingham Crown Court heard the defendants regularly travelled to the . house in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, from their London home following . the murders to maintain the garden. Edwards posed as a nephew, telling neighbours the Wycherleys had moved to the seaside. The . court heard the defendants married in 1983 and had been in ‘severe . financial difficulties’. They owed £160,000 to creditors when arrested . last October. Victim: William Wycherley prior to his death (left) and as a younger man (right). Christmas cards sent after his death said that he and Mrs Wycherley had moved to Ireland and he was enjoying a 'second youth' Christopher Edwards repeatedly denied that the couple's actions had anything to do with money . The couple . fled to France after receiving a letter from the ‘authorities’ requesting to interview Mr Wycherley as his 100th birthday approached, . the jury was told. When their money ran out, Edwards contacted his own . elderly stepmother to ask her for money and relayed a ‘carefully hatched . and rehearsed story’. He claimed his wife had been staying with her parents when she woke up to discover her mother had shot her father. He said Mrs Wycherley then boasted she had slept with him, her own son-in-law – and her daughter shot her in anger. But instead of going along with their story, the horrified stepmother contacted police. The . defendants were arrested after returning to the UK later that month and . stuck to their ‘fatally flawed’ story, Mr Joyce said. Susan Edwards . told police she shot her mother after severe provocation. She claimed her father had abused her between the ages of seven and 11. A . post-mortem examination found the Wycherleys had been shot twice with a . revolver, like one Christopher Edwards was known to have owned, Mr . Joyce said. Susan Edwards . admits the manslaughter of her mother and both defendants admit . obstructing a coroner in his duty by burying the bodies. They also admit . stealing a credit balance but each denies murder. The case continues. The jury heard extracts from letters and cards purporting to be from the Wycherleys. Oct 2005: Posing as Mr Wycherley declining an appointment at a chest clinic: ‘(I’m) feeling better, and I will be visiting with relatives over the next months: for that reason it is not convenient to make an appointment.’ Dec 2006: Declining a free pneumonia vaccine: ‘As I will be staying with relatives…I would prefer not to be sent letters offering me vaccines I will not want.’ Christmas 2007: Cards or letters sent by Susan Edwards to relatives claimed her parents had decided to tour Ireland ‘because of the good air’. 2009: Describing breaking the news to her father of his sister’s death, she wrote: ‘He can get quite confused and upset...he has never mentioned it again because it upsets him too much I think.’ 2011: In a Christmas card to relatives about her parents travelling in Ireland, she said her father was ‘having his second youth’, adding: ‘It is good to see them with such zest.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Susan and Christopher Edwards deny murdering her parents .

"The eating habits of a pregnant mother may influence her unborn child's chances of developing Alzheimer's later in life, according to new research. Scientists at the University of Southampton found that the offspring of mice who were fed a high-fat diet were more likely to experience impaired blood flow in the brain, a symptom that is linked to the disease. A high fat diet meant that the offspring were less able to rid themselves of harmful sticky beta amyloid proteins, the accumulation of which is a key feature of Alzheimer's. The new research suggests that eating fatty foods while pregnant can lead to an increased chance of Alzheimer's disease afflicting the unborn child in later life . As the study was originally performed on mice, it will need much more work to make a fuller picture of how diet effects unborn children, researchers say. However, the researchers believe that they are close to developing important theories on the implications of diet on children in the womb and their future health. Lead scientist Dr Cheryl Hawkes, from the University of Southampton, said: 'Our preliminary findings suggest that mothers' diets during pregnancy may have long-term effects on their children's brains and vascular health. 'We still need to do more work to understand how our findings translate to humans, but we have known for some time that protecting mothers' health during pregnancy can help lower the risk of health problems for their children. 'Our next step will be to investigate how our findings could relate to Alzheimer's disease in people. 'We hope these results could provide a new lead for research to understand how to prevent the disease.' Research found that the more fatty foods a person eats the more likely it is that there will be a build up of sticky amyloid proteins, a common biological feature associated with Alzheimer's . The research was presented at the Alzheimer's Research UK conference taking place in Oxford this week. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at the charity, which funded the study, said: 'It's important to remember that this research is in mice, but these results add to existing evidence suggesting that the risk of Alzheimer's disease in later life is affected by our health earlier in life. 'This study goes one step further by suggesting that what happens in the womb may also be important. 'We're pleased to have funded this research, which has shed new light on the complex picture of Alzheimer's risk. 'Alzheimer's is a complicated disease and it's likely that our risk is affected by a number of different genetic and environmental factors. 'Research to understand these factors can help equip us to take steps to prevent the disease, but in the meantime, evidence suggests we can lower our risk by eating a healthy, balanced diet, doing regular exercise, not smoking and keeping our blood pressure and weight in check.'","New research from University of Southampton suggests correlation between Alzheimer's and bad diet during pregnancy .

"Most people can detect the distinctive fresh, earthy aroma of an approaching rain storm, but now scientists have worked out why. Researchers using high speed cameras have found that drops of water release clouds of tiny particles when they hit surfaces like soil and leaves. Their study showed that a raindrop hitting an uneven surface, they trap bubbles of air that shoot upwards and burst from the top of the water droplet like fizz in a champagne glass. The researchers captured the moment water droplets impact different surfaces using high speed cameras and saw that tiny clouds of aerosols were produced, as seen above, as the droplets flattened on the surface . These tiny bubbles carry minute amounts of aromatic particles of oil and dust from the surface that can then be blown for miles by gusts of wind ahead of rain storms. This, the scientists say, explains why it is possible to smell a rain storm long before it arrives, even when it has been dry for several days. Scientists have been using slow motion videos of raindrops hitting the ground to help them understand what happens to debris when a meteorite hits the Earth. Studying real asteroid impacts as they happen is almost impossible, so researchers came up with a way to recreate the impact of a far smaller scale. Using high-precision laser profilometry with high speed photographs, they were able to see how the liquid 'debris' created by the impact spread out in sandy soil and study the morphology that was created by the 'crater'. Rain drops hitting soft sand is similar to what happens when asteroids smash into the Earth . The effect, known as Petrichor, is often most pronounced during the summer, accompanying the first rain after a long dry smell when more dust and oils have accumulated on plants and on the ground. The new research, which was conducted by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that different types of rainfall could alter the smell. The scientists found that light showers and moderate seemed to trigger more aerosols compared with heavy rain that might accompany thunder storms. They also found that the type of soil could also influence how many aerosols were released and was particularly pronounced on clay or sandy soil. Dr Youngsoo Joung, one of the scientists at MIT's department of engineering who conducted the research, said the findings could also help to explain how some soil-based bacteria can spread disease. He said: 'Until now, people didn’t know that aerosols could be generated from raindrops on soil. 'When moderate or light rain hits sandy or clay soils, you can observe lots of aerosols, because sandy clay has medium wetting properties. 'Heavy rain (which has a high) impact speed, means there’s not enough time to make bubbles inside the droplet. The scent of an approaching rain storm, like the one above in Kingston upon Hull,  is known as Petrichor . 'This finding should be a good reference for future work, illuminating microbes and chemicals existing inside soil and other natural materials, and how they can be delivered in the environment, and possibly to humans. 'To prevent transmission of microorganisms from nature to humans, we need to know the exact mechanism. In this work, we provide one possible way of transmission.' Scientists in Australia were the first to coin the word 'petrichor' for the smell of approaching rain and characterised it as the release of plant oils along with a compound called geosmin, which is produced by soil dwelling bacteria. However, the new research is the first to explain the mechanism that causes these compounds to become airborne. The scientists, whose work is published in the journal Nature Communications, conducted 600 experiments on 28 different types of surfaces - 12 man made surfaces, like aluminium, and 16 soil surfaces. These included soil collected from alongside the Charles River and sandy soil from Nahant Beach in Nahant, Massachusetts. Plants produce aromatic oils that can build up on leaves (above) and in soil during dry periods. These are then carried inside clouds of aerosols caused by light rain hitting these surfaces, according to the new research . The researchers measured the permeability of each soil by adding water to the bottom of a sample within a test tube and measuring how long it took the water to rise upwards. They then dropped single droplets of water from different heights to simulate varying intensities of rainwater. They used high speed cameras to capture what happened to the raindrops on impact. They found that as a raindrop hits a surface, it flattens and tiny bubbles trapped in pores in the surface rise up through the droplet and burst into the air. With light droplets of rain, more of these bubbles become aerosols, producing a cloud of tiny 'frenzied' droplets within a few microseconds, particularly in porous material like sandy and clay based soil. When a light breeze was simulated by blowing air across the top of the soil, the scientists found the aerosols were carried away. Aerosol release by rain has only previously been studied when drops land on the surface of water (above) They believe that along with the air and water that form the aerosols, tiny amounts of oil and dust from the surface are also trapped inside. The researchers also found the impact speed of a droplet and the surface 'wetability' were crucial in determining how much aerosols were produced. Dr Cullen Buie, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering who led the work, said: . 'Rain happens every day - it's raining now, somewhere in the world. 'It's a very common phenomenon, and it was intriguing to us that no one had observed this mechanism before.' He said that while the Australian researchers had first identified the phenomenon of Petrichor in 1964, they had not explained what might cause it to occur. The high speed cameras made it possible to see the number of aerosols produced on different surfaces. As can be seen in the image above, an aluminum surface produces more aerosols than sandy clay soil . He added: 'They talked about oils emitted by plants, and certain chemicals from bacteria, that lead to this smell you get after a rain following a long dry spell. 'Interestingly, they don't discuss the mechanism for how that smell gets into the air. One hypothesis we have is that that smell comes from this mechanism we've discovered.' James Bird, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Boston University who also studies the behaviour of fluids when they drop onto surfaces and was not involved in the latest study, said the work could explain how microbes end up high in the atmosphere. He said: Microbes from soil have been observed high in the atmosphere. 'This paper provides an elegant mechanism by which these microbes can be propelled past the stagnant layer of air around them to a place where the breeze can take them elsewhere.'","MIT scientists used high speed cameras to study water drops hitting soil .

"Choreographer Wade Robson has approached Michael Jackson's former housekeeper, who claims she witnessed the star showering with him as an eight-year-old boy, to testify at his abuse civil lawsuit, according to reports. Lawyers for the Australian, whose family was helped to move to America by Jackson when he was a dancer at age five, are approaching Blanca Francia to appear as a witness, according to TMZ. Robson, 30, claims he was abused by Jackson for seven years and that the King of Pop told him he'd go . to jail for the rest of his life if he told anyone about it. Lawsuit: Wade Robson, pictured yesterday with his family, has launched a civil lawsuit against Jackson's estate claiming he was abused and staff from the pop singer's company should have protected him . Support? Robson's lawyers are approaching Jackson's former maid Blanca Francia, left, to back him, according to reports. Robson denied her claims Jackson showered with him in the star's 2005 trial, right, . He has now launched a civil lawsuit against the pop star's estate. It is a change of tune for Robson who . took to the stand as the first defense witness at a trial in 2005, where . Jackson was accused of molesting 13-year-old cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo. It was the same court case where Francia spoke out about seeing a young Robson in the shower with the singer. 'I walked in and they were in the shower,' Ms Francia told the court, according to a report from the time. 'When I saw it I saw clothes on the floor by the shower...underwear,' she said, adding that she recognized Jackson's and Robson's underclothes. According to TMZ in the maid's full written testimony she said she couldn't see what was happening in the shower but could hear Jackson laughing. Ms Francia's own son spoke at the court case in which Jackson was cleared of all 14 counts. Robson is planning to argue that Michael Jackson's companies -- MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures -- had a duty to protect him. However, his claims have been ridiculed by those close to the now deceased pop star. Debbie Rowe, 54, the ex-wife and mother of two of Jackson's children, criticized Robson on Thursday. She called the choreographer 'opportunistic' and said he was seeking publicity. She told TMZ on Thursday: 'It will be quickly forgotten, and will do nothing, nothing to tarnish Michael's extraordinary legacy.' Jackson's estate has called the claims 'outrageous and pathetic' while Jermaine Jackson has said that Robson is 'full of s***'. But Robson has been making his case too. He appeared on the Today program this week for a lengthy interview on why he is coming forward now and to outline his claims. He says from the age of seven to around 14, Jackson 'performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him'. Robson told Today Jackson convinced him that 'both of us would go to jail for the rest of our lives' if he told anyone about what they had done together. During the Arvizo case he adamantly denied that he had ever been molested or inappropriately . touched by the singer. Seven years of alleged abuse: Robson, pictured right with Jackson as a kid, said from the age of seven to around 14 Jackson 'performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him' Breaking his silence: Robson, right, told Matt Lauer, left, that he decided to break his silence about the alleged molestation after having his own son two years ago . Robson, now a top music choreographer . who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, said he hadn't yet come to terms with . what had happened to him. 'I said what I understood and I said what I was able to say,' he explained. 'From . seven years old, from day one of the abuse, Michael told me that we . loved each other and this was love, this was an expression of our love. And then he would follow it up with 'but if you ever tell anyone what we . are doing both of our lives and careers would be over'.' 'This is not a case of repressed . memory. I have never forgotten one moment of what . Michael did to me, but I was psychologically and emotionally completely . unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse.' He said having his own child two . years ago made him face up to the truth, as he said he couldn't help . thinking about how he'd feel if a stranger molested his little boy. 'I'm a father and I became a father . two and a half years ago to this beautiful baby boy and during the first . 18 months of his life I collapsed into two nervous breakdowns, . terrifying nervous breakdowns,' he said. 'At that point, I had no idea what . was going on. And for the first time in my life, I began to realize that . my completely numb and unexplored feelings about what Michael did to me . might be a problem and maybe I need to speak to somebody about it.' He has asked a . probate court to allow him to file a late creditor's claim against Jackson's . estate, even though the deadline has passed for creditors to file such . claims. The estate's lawyer, Howard Weitzman, has dismissed Robson's claims. In a statement Weitzman said: . 'This is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over . the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that Michael Jackson . never did anything inappropriate to him or with him. 'Now, nearly four years after Michael has passed, this sad and less-than-credible claim has been made.'. Robson said the ordeal of launching such a public case was too great for it to be about money. 'The idea that I would make all of this up and put myself, . my wife, my son, my entire family through this extremely stressful and . painful experience all for money is incomprehensible,' he said. 'I've lived in silence and denial for 22 . years and I can't spend another moment in that... I'm never going to go . away with this for the sake of money. I'm never going to be silenced for . money. That's not going to happen.' Robson's lawsuit comes as the high . profile trial of Michael Jackson's tour promoter, AEG, continues. The trial . is brought by the singer's mother and children who claim AEG shares . blame in his death for neglecting to vet and supervise Jackson's doctor, . Dr Conrad Murray. Evidence: Jackson's case was backed by Robson at the star's 2005 trial, pictured entering court, over molestation claims . Idol: Robson, pictured as a young boy, was supported by Jackson who had him appear in numerous videos . THEN . Wade Robson, who was then 22, testified in the Santa Maria courtroom that he was five when he met Jackson for the first time in his hometown, Brisbane, Australia. Two years later, he was a guest at Jackson's Neverland ranch for the first of some 20-plus overnight visits. He told jurors he shared a bed with Jackson on numerous occasions from the ages of seven to 14, at Neverland, as well as apartments in Los Angeles and at hotels in Las Vegas and LA. When asked by Jackson's lead lawyer, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., whether he'd ever been molested by the singer Robson replied: 'Absolutely not,' before also denying strongly that Jackson had ever touched him in a sexually explicit way. When senior deputy district attorney, Ronald J. Zonen, questioned Robson's account, he replied: 'I'm telling you, nothing ever happened.' Zonen then said, according to a New York Times article at the time: 'You're saying nothing ever happened when you were awake,' to which Robson responded: 'I think something like that would wake me up.' However, a former maid at Neverland who testified at the trial as a witness for the prosecution, said she had seen Jackson groping Robson in the shower at the ranch. But Robson denied ever having a shower with the star. NOW . But now Robson is claiming Michael Jackson did in fact molest him, over a period of seven years. In an interview with Today, Robson, . now 30, labelled Jackson 'a pedophile and a child sexual abuser' who from the ages of seven to around 14 'performed sexual . acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him.' He said that Jackson told him the alleged abuse was . 'an expression of our love.' Robson added, explaining why he gave what he claims now was a false testimony: 'This is not a case of repressed . memory. I have never forgotten one moment of what . Michael did to me, but I was psychologically and emotionally completely . unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse.' But he said he was never offered money to deny the abuse during the trial. 'There was no money, there was no ""you must lie."" Michael, when he would talk to me before these things were going on, and he would call me everyday... it was complete manipulation and brainwashing. It wasn't any sense of the truth on the phone, he would role play with me and train me for these scenarios.'","Wade Robson, 30, is mounting a civil lawsuit against the dead star's estate claiming he suffered years of abuse .

"The New York City Police Department is reviewing a video in which a man is seen being choked and punched by a police officer at a subway station in Harlem as the officer is trying to take him into custody. The video, which was recorded during the unidentified man's July 14, arrest, comes nearly a week after a Staten Island man died after he was put in a similar choke hold by an NYPD officer, and the city's police commissioner ordered that all of the NYPD's 35,000 officers be retrained in use of force policies and techniques. In the video, two officers can be seen wrestling the man to the ground, at which point one of the officers put him in a choke on two separate occasions, all while repeatedly punching him in the face. Scroll down for video . Choked: Video shows the unidentified officer choking a suspect in a subway station as he was trying to take him into custody . Stop resisting: The officer repeatedly tells the suspect to 'stop resisting,' as is often the case when police know they are being recorded . Punches: As the officer was choking the man, he repeatedly punched him in the face . Blood: Bystanders were screaming 'you busted his nose' as blood began to splash on the ground beneath the man being taken into custody . 'You busted his nose!' bystanders on the video are heard yelling. According to DNAinfo.com, the video was anonymously sent to East Harlem community activist Rev. Kelmy Rodriguez. 'I was appalled when I saw this video, . especially after the Eric Garner situation,' Rodriquez told the publication. 'Something . like this adds more gas to the fire.' Disturbing video footage shows Garner, who was accused of selling illegal cigarettes, struggling on the pavement saying 'I can't breath' before passing out. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said Garner's death was 'very tragic' and ordered Deputy Commissioner of Training Benjamin Tucker to conduct a 'top-to-bottom' review of officers' training. Victim: Eric Garner, 43, died after being held in a 'chokehold' by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in Staten Island. An initial report into his death has said he was 'not in great distress . According to the New York Daily News, Bratton is looking for inspiration from the Los Angeles Police Department's 'state of the art' training which was set up after the immigration rallies in 2007. The commissioner, who met with FBI officials following Garner's death, said he anticipated a civil suit by the family and 'would not be surprised if the U.S. attorney 'decides to open a civil rights violation investigation.' An initial report into Garner's death released earlier this week did not mention a chokehold, claiming he 'was not in great distress' and his health 'did not  get worse' as he was held down. The omission has sparked an angry reaction from City Hall, with state senator Bill Perkins shouting: 'This is murder' during a rally. In the video of Garner's death, veteran officer Pantaleo waved to the camera as the father was taken away on a stretcher. One of the witnesses asked, 'Why is nobody doing CPR?' an officer responded, 'Because he's breathing.' Demanding action: NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, pictured left with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio during a press conference this week, wants a 'top-to-bottom' review of how officers use force . Sergeant Dhanan Saminath said Garner was in handcuffs with officers 'maintaining control of him' according to the report. It also suggests that he 'resisted arrest' and failed to 'obey instructions' as police tried to handcuff him. However Sergeant Kizzy Adonis said she 'believed she heard the perpetrator state that he was having difficulty breathing'. The New York City Medical Examiner's office has not yet been able to determine what killed Garner - whether he died from a chokehold or an underlying health issue. Pantaleo, a plainclothes cop, has been forced to surrender his gun and badge and put on desk duty while the NYPD investigates the case. Disturbing footage: The father passed out after being held down by police. Minutes later, Officer Pantaleo was caught waving to a woman recording the incident (right) Treatment: A witness asked why no one was giving him CPR, to which officers respond 'because he is breathing' It has also . been revealed that he has seven civil rights lawsuit against him - . including allegations of illegal strip searches and arresting men who . were 'committing no crimes' at the time. One . resulted in the city paying $30,000 to two men who were unlawfully . strip-searched. The other lawsuit, which is still pending, alleges an . unlawful arrest. Garner's grieving son, meanwhile, has called for the New York Police Department officer who was filmed putting his father in a chokehold to be arrested and thrown in jail. This isn't the first time Pantaleo has been accused of abusing his police powers, the Staten Island Advance reports. The eight-year veteran officer has had two civil rights lawsuits filed against him. The first was the result of a March 2012 traffic stop in which Darren Collins and Tommy Rice were arrested and then strip-searched in broad daylight on a Staten Island street. Gwen, Mr Garner's mother, said she was glad the incident was recorded so police could not shy away from what happened.

"A four-month-old baby is fighting for his life after his drug addict parents fed him crystal meth to stop him from crying . Silvia Strnadova, 26, and husband Miroslav, 30, took the unconscious child to hospital but he was left brain dead and is only being kept alive by a life support machine. The parents from the town of Prievidza in the north-western Slovak region of Horna Nitrawere were arrested after police discovered that they had given the infant a strong dose of the potent drug. Silvia Strnadova and her husband were arrested after it was discovered that they fed their four-month-old baby crystal meth to stop the infant from crying . A hospital spokesman said: 'They came into the waiting room with the unconscious baby in a pram and demanded to see a doctor. 'When we carried out checks it became apparent the child was in a critical state and had been given a strong dosage of drugs.' Head doctor Anna Moracikova added: 'The child's brain is severely damaged and he is clinically dead. His chances of survival are minimal and he is being kept alive by a life support machine.' The drug crystal meth - made notorious by the popular US drama Breaking Bad - is a powerful stimulant known for its fast and long-lasting effects. It delivers a euphoric high, but has deeply unpleasant side effects and is dangerously addictive. It can keep users awake for days, followed by a severe come-down. Referred to as ‘ice’ or ‘glass’, crystal meth - a form of methylamphetamine - can be consumed orally, sniffed, smoked or injected. Silvia Strnadova (right), 26, and husband Miroslav (left), 30, took the unconscious child to hospital but he was left brain dead and is only being kept alive by a life support machine . In its most popular crystalline form it resembles glass shavings or a crystal rock but is also available in pills and powder. Across the US, where there are thought to be a million users, before and after pictures of users are often used to emphasise its ravaging effects, such as tooth decay. Across Europe, seizures of methamphetamine have increased from 30kg in 2000 to 1,582kg in 2011. Neighbours reacted with shock at the news but say the pair were well-known for their drug abuse. Jana Trznikova, 36, said: 'Really weird people kept going to their apartment. I always worried about letting my children play outside because you never knew what would happen. 'She's well-known for not settling down and already has two other children with different men. Ms Strnadova and her husband were well-known in the local area for their drug abuse . 'He was known locally as the Crocodile on the drug scene, with a reputation for being the best crystal meth cooker, and because of his bad temper and the fact that he was dangerous.' Social workers have also come under fire over their failure to take the child away from the pair. Ms Trznikova said: 'They should never have been allowed to keep that poor baby.' A police spokesman said: 'The man admitted giving the baby the meths in order to stop him crying. He has been arrested for neglect and for causing harm to a minor. That may change if the child dies. He is in custody, while the woman has for the time being been released. We are still investigating her for failing to stop her partner giving the child the drug.'","Baby is being kept alive by a life support machine after being fed potent drug .

"Claims that large numbers of Muslims were attacked in the aftermath of the  Woolwich murder were questioned yesterday. A Government-funded project warned it had received more than 200 reports of Islamophobia following Drummer Lee Rigby’s murder, including attacks on mosques and Muslim women. Project director Fiyaz Mughal said the figure represented a ‘substantial spike’ in hate crimes and warned of ‘a sustained wave of attacks and intimidation’ against Muslim communities across Britain. Two men, both reportedly soldiers, have been arrested in connection with a petrol bomb attack on the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre since the killing of Lee Rigby . But more than half of the incidents reported to the Tell Mama (Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks) hotline related to offensive messages on Twitter, Facebook or online blogs, and only a tiny minority were physical attacks, it has emerged. The claims raised questions  about the way Tell Mama presented its figures in the days after  Drummer Rigby’s murder, amid repeated calls for calm to avoid reprisal attacks. Mr Mughal said Tell Mama had received 162 reports of anti-Muslim prejudice in a 48-hour period. Between four and eight incidents are normally reported daily to the charity, which receives £214,000 a year in funding from the Department for Communities and Local Government to provide data and reports on attacks against Muslims to combat hate crime. A total of 212 incidents were reported between the Woolwich murder on May 22 and the end of last week. The attacks received widespread coverage alongside warnings from Mr Mughal of a ‘cycle of violence’ against Muslims which had led to ‘a sense of endemic fear’. But while they included a petrol bomb attack on a mosque in Grimsby and in another incident in Essex where a man entered a mosque armed with a knife, only 17 cases involved individuals being physically targeted, a Sunday newspaper reported. Target: Charities said there had been a 'substantial spike' in hate crimes against Muslims since the Woolwich killing. This Bolton mosque was vandalised on the evening of Lee Rigby's death . Criminal damage: This mosque in Gillingham, Kent, was the target of vandals on the night after Lee Rigby's death. But figures show a tiny minority of reported incidents were physical attacks . Six people had things thrown at them and most of the other 11 incidents related to attempts to rip off women’s headscarves or other items of Islamic dress. More than half – 120 – related to offensive or abusive messages on social networking sites including Facebook and Twitter. Contacted by the Daily Mail, Mr Mughal refused to discuss the figures, which he said would be independently checked by Birmingham University for a report next month. Any attempt to downplay the significance of verbal or online abuse was ‘an affront to hate crime reporting’, he said. He was also challenged on the figures during an interview on Radio 4’s Sunday programme, when he conceded that the number of physical attacks was ‘quite small’. Tensions: Although there have been angry booze-fuelled EDL marches since Drummer Rigby's death, figures show most reported anti-Muslim 'attacks' have been comments on the internet . He said: ‘We are talking mainly about generalised abuse, targeted comments said at a street level as well as targeted comments online. ‘So most of it is generalised abuse, thankfully it is not extreme violence. ‘This is not just an issue of attacks, physical attacks against individuals, this is about looking at the whole picture.’ In a statement on the Tell Mama website, the project said verbal and online abuse were ‘recordable hate incidents’ along with violent assaults and attacks on mosques. It said it was working with the Metropolitan Police to ensure that hate crimes against Muslims were reported correctly. David Green, director of the think-tank Civitas, said it was vital that such cases were not exaggerated or reported carelessly.","More than half of incidents reported to hotline were internet comments .

"Roald Dahl has been voted as the favourite author of parents and children in a survey to mark International Children's Book Day . Roald Dahl has beaten Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling to be named best children’s author of all time by parents and their children. The much-loved writer remains a firm favourite of children today, more than 50 years since the publication of James and The Giant Peach - Dahl’s first major children’s book. Parents and children were asked to list their top three children’s authors and top three characters for a survey to mark International Children’s Book Day today. Children listed Dahl first, followed by J.K. Rowling and Beatrix Potter. Their parents also picked Dahl as first choice, with Enid Blyton second and Rowling third. Harry Potter was named by both parents and children as their favourite book character. The . Gruffalo and The Cat in the Hat were second and third choice for . children, while their parents picked Blyton’s Famous Five and Dahl’s . BFG. Mother Joanna Spencer, . 39, from London, said her five-year-old daughter Jessica enjoyed her . favourite Dahl books as much as she had as a child. She added: ‘My daughter loves reading the BFG, Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. ‘She likes Harry Potter, but he doesn’t come close to books by Roald Dahl. ‘He was my childhood favourite and he’s now my daughter’s favourite as well.’ Nearly a third of parents said their . children owned an e-reader and 12 per cent said their children did not . read paper books, according to the survey by book retailer The Works. Kevin . Keaney, the chief executive of The Works, said: ‘It’s great to see . classic children’s books and characters are still holding favour with . kids throughout Britain, with parents’ own preferences presumably . swaying their little ones’ reading habits. Beatrix Potter, left, and J.K. Rowling were also in children's top three favourite authors in the poll . Parents and children alike named Rowling's Harry Potter as their favourite book character while children plumped for The Gruffalo as their second favourite. ‘More than half of the parents polled said their children read the same books as they did, showing tastes haven’t changed and classics remain popular.’ Dahl, who died aged 74 in 1990, wrote around 40 novels, short story collections and poetry books for children and adults. His most loved children’s books include Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The Witches and Fantastic Mr Fox. Many of his books have been made into feature films or television adaptions. He also wrote several film and television scripts, including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and the Bond film You Only Live Twice, as well as the popular 1980s television series Tales of the Unexpected.

"Just two days after an investigation revealed how much personal information public Wi-Fi networks can ‘suck’ from phones, a child has shown how easy the hotspots are to hack. A seven-year-old broke into a Wi-Fi hotspot in just 10 minutes and 54 seconds after watching an online video tutorial. The ethical hacking demo was carried out under the supervision of an online security expert to highlight just how vulnerable the networks are. Scroll down for video . Betsy Davies (pictured) watched an online video tutorial before being asked to hack into a Wi-Fi hotspot. It took the seven-year-old 11 minutes to infiltrate the network by setting up a rogue access point - frequently used by attackers to activate a ‘man in the middle’ attack, and begin eavesdropping on - or ‘sniffing’ - traffic . Experts predict that attacks on free, public Wi-Fi networks will rise in 2015. An investigation by 5 News earlier this week found that hackers can force customers in a café to switch their phones from a legitimate Wi-Fi network to a fake one, without them knowing. This made it possible for thieves to access phones, hack email accounts, steal login details, track people's movements and access online bank accounts. To put these dangers into perspective, virtual private network (VPN) provider Hidemyass.com (HMA) recruited a child to attack a public network. Betsy Davies from Dulwich in South London hacked a willing participant’s laptop while they were connected to an open Wi-Fi network. Sniffing/eavesdropping: The method of passively listening to data on the network without the users knowledge by tricking the network into passing all data through the hacker’s computer first. Man in the middle attack: A method used to intercept traffic between a user’s device and the destination system, such as the café offering the Wi-Fi, making a victim’s machine think the hacker’s machine is the access point to the Internet. DNS cache poisoning: A method of attack whereby ‘updated’ data is used to enable the hacker to divert the traffic to the hacker’s destination of choice. Rogue Access Points/Rogue APs: Wireless access points installed on a company’s network without the company’s knowledge. These access points override the legitimate network thereby allowing the hacker to perform a man in the middle attack and intercept data. Unsecured Wi-Fi network: An unsecured Wi-Fi network is a wireless network that doesn’t request the user to log into it via the use of a username and password. These are usually displayed as OPEN networks. WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy: The first wireless security scheme developed, it was designed to provide security that was essentially equivalent to the privacy that was enjoyed in a wired environment. This is the least secure type of wireless network available. WPA - Used Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP): This protocol further improves the security of WEP without the need to buy new hardware. It still uses WEP for encryption, but it makes the attacks used to crack WEP a bit more difficult and time-consuming. WPA2-PSK: This is the next level up from WPA and was designed for the home and small businesses . As the name implies, the new version uses a pre-shared key (PSK). This has become standard that is now used by most households today. WPA2-AES: This is a version of WPA2 used by businesses. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, to encrypt data and is the most secure. It's often coupled with a RADIUS server that is dedicated for authentication. RADIUS - Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS): A networking protocol that provides centralised Authentication, Authorisation, and Accounting management for users who connect and use a network service within a business. These users are authenticated against the company systems for added protection. Channels: Wireless networks use Channels which are separated out so that various communication streams don't interfere with each other. The 802.11 wireless standard allows for channels ranging from 1 thru 14. Brute-force attack: A method in which a hacker will try and break the password by continuously attempting to log in with different credentials until they find one that works. It could take hours, days or months depending upon the complexity of the password being used. Dictionary attack: A method used to ry and break the password of a user or wireless device by going through all the words in a dictionary, trying each one in turn until it finds a password which works. Virtual private network (VPN): A VPN is a way of using the public internet like a secure private network. It encrypts data and routes it through remote servers, keeping the activity and location private and secure. Rogue Access Points are wireless access points, installed on a company’s network without the company’s knowledge. Ms Davies began by searching for, and watching, a freely available video tutorial detailing how to hack a network - a Google search returns over 11 million results, and YouTube lists 14,000 tutorials (pictured) She began by searching for, and watching, a freely available video tutorial detailing how to hack a network - a Google search returns over 11 million results, and YouTube lists almost 14,000 tutorials. The schoolgirl then set up a Rogue Access Point - frequently used by attackers to activate what is known as a ‘man in the middle’ attack, and began eavesdropping on, or ‘sniffing’ traffic. Rogue Access Points are wireless access points, installed on a company’s network without the company’s knowledge. According to follow-up research, nearly two thirds (59 per cent) of people regularly use unsecure, or ‘open’ Wi-Fi hotspots with one in five (20 per cent) doing so weekly or more. Among those who use these unsecured networks, 19 per cent log on to online banking and 31 per cent send emails and personal documents . These access points override the legitimate network, allowing the hacker to launch an attack and intercept data. During this hack, Ms Davies was effectively sitting between the legitimate Wi-Fi network and the customer’s laptop, which is why it is dubbed a ‘man in the middle’ attack. Ensure a network is genuine: Check the name of the network with a shop worker. Check the lock: Secure  websites display a green padlock symbol, also known as Https. Make sure this is present when using a site that handles personal data and avoid accessing sensitive documents or pages using public Wi-Fi. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN): Not all sites display the Https lock symbol, but a VPN will act as an intermediary between the device and the internet server. Downloading an app? Check permissions: Before installing, make sure apps can't access unnecessary information. For example, a drawing app shouldn't need a contacts list. Forget the network: When leaving a publich network, don’t just log off, ask the device to forget the network so it doesn’t automatically log on when in range later. The experiment was overseen by independent online security expert Marcus Dempsey. He is hired by companies to check the robustness of their network systems. ‘The results of this experiment are worrying but not entirely surprising,’ said Mr Dempsey. ‘I know just how easily a layman can gain access to a stranger’s device, and in an age where children are often more tech-literate than adults, hacking can literally be child’s play.’ ‘Adults need to get their heads around online security basics - and stick to them whenever they connect to an unsecure network. ‘As for children, while it’s admirable educators are focusing on skills like coding, it’s important to teach them about the dangers that lurk online, as well instilling a clear sense of the ethics – just as we did with the child that participated in this experiment. ‘After all, as easily as one can now code a computer game, so one can fall into the dark world of hacking.’ A recent Cabinet Office report revealed more than half of people in the UK have fallen victim to cybercriminals. According to follow-up research by HMA, nearly two thirds (59 per cent) of people regularly use unsecure, or ‘open’ Wi-Fi hotspots with one in five (20 per cent) doing so weekly or more.

Among those who use these unsecured networks, 19 per cent log on to online banking and 31 per cent send emails and personal documents. Cian McKenna-Charley, marketing director at HMA added: ‘The image of cyber criminals hiding in a dark room in some far-flung part of the world is antiquated - they are just as likely to be sitting next to you in a coffee shop or public library. ‘And if a child can perform a basic hack on a Wi-Fi network in minutes, imagine the damage a professional criminal hacker could do.’","Experts predict a rise in criminals hacking ‘free Wi-Fi’ in 2015 .

So far there are 170 AFP officers in Ukraine with more on the way, Mr Abbott said . 'Our objective is to get in, get cracking and to get out,' Mr Abbott said in Canberra on Sunday. The 11 officers already at the site have largely been involved in observing and taking photographs. The latest deployment will involve recovering human remains and having them repatriated. The mission is to stay as long as possible to do a professional job but it should take no longer than two to three weeks, Mr Abbott said. 'We don't want to be there any longer than is absolutely necessary,' he said. The prime minister stressed the mission had 'absolutely nothing' to do with the politics of eastern Europe. 'Others can get involved if they wish ... our whole and sole purpose is to claim our dead and bring them home,' he said. There had been a 'full and frank' discussion with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Donetsk on Saturday about allowing the team to conduct its work, Mr Abbott said. While 'local people' had guaranteed the team's security, it did not mean they were safe under all circumstances. 'Frankly, we need to be prepared to take some risks in order to do the right thing by our dead and by their grieving families,' Mr Abbott said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, speaking from Amsterdam, stressed the mission would be a non-threatening operation. 'All we want to do is secure the site so that we can inspect it thoroughly and bring back any remains,' she said. Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17.

"Neymar will be looking to prove he is up there with all the great Brazil No 10s down the years - even Pele - by inspiring his side again over dangerous Mexico. How better to weave his name into the pantheon of greats than with a special ‘Brazilian’ free kick? Many of the most enduring memories of World Cups have been stunning goals from free kicks, not least by Brazilians. But so far we’ve not seen a direct set piece fly in from 20 taken, whereas in last season’s Premier League one in 12 hit the back of the net. The time is now: Neymar has the opportunity to put himself up there as one of Brazil's greatest ever No 10s .

Click here to place your bet with Coral. Former England boss Fabio Capello leads Russia into their campaign against South Korea as the only nation at the finals who don’t have any players playing outside their country. Meanwhile, Belgium kick off their tournament against Algeria as dark horse contenders for many. So many of their team are familiar faces to an English audience, with Chelsea’s Eden Hazard very much the jewel in the crown; but how has this happened? After crashing out of the 1998 finals at the group stages, the Belgium federation came up with a blueprint for the future, written by coach Michel Sablon. Those at the FA who strive to improve the standard of the English football ought to read it. A significant section is how to nurture young players. Key Stage 1 is for five-seven year olds based on making football fun, learning step then encouraging dribbling and passing through progressive small-sided games up until eleven-a-side. It’s when they approach 11 that players learn to operate in a 4-3-3 system. Premier League class: Chelsea's Eden Hazard is Belgium's talisman figure as they face Algeria on Tuesday . To be feared! Big targetman Romelu Lukaku is likely to lead the line for Marc Wilmots' side . Algeria striker Islam Slimani could well test the credentials of Belgium. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will be watching with interest. Having been rejected again by Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku in an attempt to take him on loan from Chelsea, the Hammers could make another attempt to lure Slimani from Sporting Lisbon. The Golden Boot at the last two World Cups has been won with five goals. But with Thomas Muller, who claimed the prize in 2010, upping the ante to two-goal Neymar, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben with his opening game hat-trick it looks like the eight Brazil’s Ronaldo hit at the 2002 finals could be challenged. And with such a good start, the 10 hit by Gerd Muller in 1970 is not impossible. The record 13, which France’s Just Fontaine struck in 1958, still looks safe. It’s always hard to measure the star quality of a tournament, but there is a strong case that this has been the best start to a World Cup ever. Certainly this is on a different planet to the drab opening of South Africa 2010 where after 12 games there had been just 20 goals. So far there have been 41 from 12 games - a ratio of 3.4 per game. That’s the highest since 1958. Laying down the gauntlet: Thomas Muller netted a hat-trick for Germany in their win against Portugal . Fish out of water? Robin van Persie netted twice for Holland and is one behind Germany's Muller . Pick that out! Gerd Muller scored 10 goals for Germany in Mexico at the 1970 World Cup finals (pictured celebrating during the quarter-final win against defending champions England) So far the games have been so absorbing and entertaining - even the first goalless draw between Nigeria and Iran - that there have been few sightings of the Mexican Wave. That’s always a sure sign when fans have started to get bored with events on the pitch. The ripple effect ovations are credited to have started at the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico, although apparently it had appeared at American football games for a few years before that. It first got a run out at a University of Washington Homecoming Game in 1981, led by UW Husky ‘Yell Leader’ Rob Weller and UW Marching Band director Bill Bissell. World Cup Memory . Just as it seemed Belgium would take England to penalties at the 1990 World Cup, Paul Gascoigne sent over a cross which David Platt converted with a stunning volley on the turn.

"Malaysian Airlines is set for a brand overhaul after two major tragedies in the last six months, it emerged today. The airline said it is looking at a number of options to restructure the business which could include changing its name. Among the other changes the Malaysian flag carrier is considering are new routes and expanding out-sourcing to increase profitability. In the spotlight: Malaysia Airlines' commercial director Hugh Dunleavy (centre) speaks to journalists about information on flight MH370 in Beijing, China, the day after it disappeared . It follows the death of 298 passengers after flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine on July 17 and the disappearance of flight MH370 on March 8, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew. The Malaysian flag carrier will also seek new investors to rebuild its business after two major tragedies within six months. The review process is being led by the Malaysian government which has a majority share in the business which employs 20,000 staff and carries 50,000 passengers a day. Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines has called for a single global body to monitor threats and decide where civilian aircraft are allowed to fly. Rebranding: Passenger planes with the Malaysian Airlines logos are seen at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang . The crash site of MH17 in a field near the village of Grabove, in the Donetsk region . MH370 was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it lost touch with air traffic control  an hour after take-off. The wreckage has never been found in spite of a massive international search. The airline's commercial director, told The Sunday Telegraph:  'Our majority shareholder, the Malaysian government, has already started a process of assessing the future shape of our business and that process will now be speeded up as a result of MH17. 'There are several options on the table but all involve creating an airline fit for purpose in what is a new era for us, and other airlines.' Mr Dunleavy also issued a call for action to ensure what happened to MH17, which appears to have been hit by a missile in airspace approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, does not happen again. 'This tragedy has taught us that despite following the guidelines and advice set out by the governing bodies, the skies above certain territories are simply not safe. MH17 has shown us that airlines can no longer rely on existing industry bodies for this information.' Mr Dunleavy called for the industry to form 'one body to be the arbiter of where we can fly'.","Airline is looking at a number of options to restructure business .

"The shape, evolution and lifespan of comet 67P-Churyumov/Gerasimenko have been revealed in a series of groundbreaking papers. Using data from the Rosetta spacecraft, which is in orbit around the comet, scientists have revealed that the comet’s interior is ‘fluffy’. Among the other discoveries they found that the comet's neck may have been 'eaten away' over time, rather than being the result of two smaller bodies merging together. Papers on Rosetta's comet (pictured) are to be published in the journal science tomorrow. They were co-authored by scientists from the University of Maryland, US. A new theory suggests its 'neck' may have been eaten away like the core of an apple (outgassing shown here) to give it its odd shape . Several papers detailing the latest findings, and co-authored by University of Maryland scientists, will appear in a special issue of the journal Science tomorrow. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) is showing signs of waking up early as it streaks towards the Sun at almost 47,800 mph (76,900 km/h). As it approaches the sun, the rubber duck-shaped lump of ice, dust and rock is expected to heat up and release more gas and water vapour from its interior. Comets are most active when they reach perihelion, the point in their orbit when they are closest to the Sun. But even at a distance of more than 200 million miles (320 million km), comet 67P is beginning to stir in dramatic fashion. Dr Dennis Bodewits, from the University of Maryland, US, who led one of several teams reporting latest findings from the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission in the journal Science, said: 'We are already seeing more activity. 'Jets are sprouting up everywhere. We've been surprised to see how active it is. It already has more jets than many other comets do at perihelion.' From the data, Dr Holger Sierks from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research told MailOnline that they now had a greater understanding of the comet's interior. He said the interior is now thought to be analogous to 'ash, cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow.' One of the papers used images from Rosetta’s Osiris (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System) camera to analyse the structure of the comet. They found that most of the ‘outgassing’ activity of the comet was occurring at the neck, which connects the two larger lobes and gives it its ‘rubber duck’ appearance. It raises questions as to whether the comet is a combination of two smaller bodies, or began as one larger one that shrank around the middle, like an apple beating eaten around its core. 'With the different instruments on Rosetta we hope to find out how much ice the nucleus of 67P contains, how deep below the surface it is buried, and what the composition of this ice is,' Dr Dennis Bodewits from the University of Maryland, who was involved in the research, told MailOnline. 'This then will help us understand the comet's aging. 'This ties directly into one of the main questions we're looking at now: was the comet formed in this strange shape, or is erosion responsible for ""eating away"" the comet's middle?' Rosetta (illustratino shown) entered orbit around the comet on 6 August 2014 and, in November, it released the Philae lander towards the comet to return data from the surface. Rosetta is continuing to follow the comet, with closest approach to the sun scheduled for 13 August this year . A second paper has detailed the surface of the comet that is currently visible to Rosetta, raising textures and features on its surface. This could help the team work out how the shape of the comet has evolved over time, and where also the largest deposits of water and ice might reside. Currently only one side of the comet is visible, the 'northern' side, as the other is facing away from the sun and is thus shrouded in darkness. The makes up more than half the comet's total surface and is divided into 19 distinct regions, all named after ancient Egyptian deities. A third paper combines data from OSIRIS and another instrument, the Grain Impact Analyzer and Dust Accumulator (Giada). This study looks at the comet's coma - the thick cloud of dust and gas that envelops the nucleus. As the comet gets closer to the sun, the coma grows more massive as the nucleus heats up and loses more material. The comet has also been found to be darker than coal in images taken by Rosetta, making other objects like the moon and Earth (shown in composite image) considerably brighter . By measuring the activity in the coma, including changes in the ratio of dust to gas, the team should be able to estimate how quickly the comet is outgassing and losing mass. In so doing, the team hopes to learn more about how comets evolve. ‘Because comets have very little gravity, dust and gas flow freely into space,’ said Dr Bodewits. ‘But we were surprised to find a cloud of particles orbiting the comet that are large and heavy enough to defy the sun's radiation pressure.’ The team was able to make this discovery thanks to Osiris' very sensitive cameras. ‘Each pixel is about 30 centimeters [11.2 inches],’ he continued. ‘You couldn't see a coffee cup, but you could see a large lunchbox. The resolution is about 10 times higher than Google Earth.’ Currently only one side of the comet is visible, the 'northern' side, as the other is facing away from the sun and is thus shrouded in darkness. The makes up more than half the comet's total surface and is divided into 19 distinct regions, all named after ancient Egyptian deities (shown) A fourth paper described evidence for carbon-based molecules on the comet’s surface, gathered by Rosetta's Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (Virtis) instrument. Based on past comet studies, the team expected to see signatures of slightly more complex molecules such as alcohols, carboxylic acids and nitrogen-containing amines. However, the evidence from Virtis suggests that the comet's surface is instead dominated by simpler hydrocarbons. The discovery could have implications for our understanding of how carbon-based molecules first developed and spread through our solar system. Scientists will be increasingly excited later this year, when the comet reaches its closest point to the sun on 13 August. At this point it will be most active, with new features and increased outgassing expected to be visible.","Papers on Rosetta's comet are to be published in the journal Science .

"Essex chef Jamie Oliver could have competition on his hands. Two of TOWIE's hottest stars have taken to the kitchen in an attempt to impress mystery dates by cooking them dinner. Reality TV's Tom Pearce and James ‘Diags’ Bennewith grapple with knives and flip pans with ease in the footage, getting hot and bothered as they cook up a storm. Messy attempt: Diags starts to layer his tortillas with the mince and vegetable mixture . Armed with a recipe for lamb keema tortilla stacks, the lads, who left The Only Way Is Essex last year, competed against each other to make the best version of the dish. In the video filmed for a campaign for LambSoc, the online community for English Beef and Lamb, 23-year-old Tom is clearly the more experienced chef of the two as his pal Diags seems to struggle with the simple task of dicing an onion. But both lads can't stop the tears streaming from their eyes as they take their knives to the allium. 'Hahaha, you're crying,' Diags, 23, cheekily points out as Tom's eyes start streaming. Diags and Tom filming TOWIE before their departure from the ITVBe programme last year . Cook-off: Tom Pearce (left) and James ‘Diags’ Bennewith (right) start by dicing onions for lamb tortilla stacks . Blinded by tears, the pair continue to gamely dice onion, chop chilli and peel garlic. A one point it looks as though Diags is in danger of losing a finger after a particularly risky knife move by Tom. 'What are you doing?' he exclaims as Tom narrowly misses his digits. 'My fingers are there mate.' The dynamic kitchen duo then gently fry the raw ingredients in the pan, with Tom tossing the cooked ingredients as Diags adds generous spoonfuls of cumin and garam masala to the mixture. 'Mate, that's too much', Tom reprimands but Diags insists that he's following the recipe to the letter. Adding lamb mince to the pan, the boys take it in turns to stir, mixing in fresh herbs and tomatoes to the mixture. 'Look how juicy it's got all of a sudden,' Tom says as he stirs the mixture in the pan. It's good,' he says, as he tastes the mixture while Diags complains that it could be too spicy. Chefs in the making: Tom tosses the raw ingredients in the frying pan as Diags watches . Diags and Tom dish up their respective tortilla stacks to their mystery dates . The competition kicks up a notch when it's time to assemble the tortilla stacks. Tom's precise stacking skills come to the fore as he carefully spreads his keema on the tortilla before sprinkling on the cheese. 'Tortilla down,' he says, placing it on the baking tray. He then spreads the mince before laying another pancake on the top. 'The trick to this is not to put too much filling,' Diags advises as Tom carefully lays another pancake on his pile before starting the the process again. But he then proceeds to ignore his own advice and starts piling the mince onto his tortilla . Bits of meat spill out of the sides and he has to use his fingers to pat them back into their floury casing. 'You have to massage the meat like you massage a lady,' Tom says, as he shows off his perfect tortilla stack. When it comes to garnishes and decoration, Tom opts for peas while Diags places a whole de-seeded chilli on his stack. They then put their creation in the oven, just in the nick of time as the mystery girls arrive for dinner. Presenting their respective offerings to their dates, Tom's presentation gets the thumbs up from both women, with special mention given to the peas. 'The peas look great; they're a bit more creative,' they say. Tasting their dinner, the women, who seem visibly surprised give it thumbs up, praising the 'rustic' taste and look of the meal. Lamb tortilla stacks . To make the lamb keema . Ingredients: 450G lean lamb mince; two teaspoons sunflower or vegetable oil; one large onion, peeled and finely chopped; two garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or crushed; one inch piece fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped; one or two 1-2 green chillies, deseeded (if preferred) and finely chopped; two teaspoons ground cumin; three tablespoons garam masala or medium curry powder; four medium tomatoes, chopped; one or two teaspoons white sugar; two tablespoons tomato purée; salt and freshly milled black pepper; 100g fresh or frozen peas; large handful freshly chopped coriander, to garnish . Method: Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and cook the onion and garlic over a low heat for 10 minutes or until soft and lightly golden. Add the ginger, chillies, cumin and garam masala or curry powder. Cook over a moderate heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the lamb and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, then add the tomatoes, sugar, tomato purée and bring to the boil. Season, reduce the heat and gently simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a little water, if needed. 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time add the peas. To make the stacks . Ingredients: Four to six corn or flour tortillas;100g grated mild hard cheese such as cheddar . Method: Preheat the oven to Gas mark 6/200°C/400°F. Place a tortilla on a large non-stick baking tray and spoon over a portion of the mince mixture evenly and a handful of cheese. Repeat with the remaining ingredients finishing with the cheese. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Cut into equal portions and serve with salad. Tip: If preferred scatter some baby spinach on top of each keema layer.","Tom Pearce and James 'Diags' Bennewith make lamb tortilla stacks .

"Poppy the cat who was officially recognised as the world’s oldest after making it to the age of 24 has died – just weeks after clinching the title. The tortoiseshell was born in February 1990, the same month Nelson Mandela was released from prison. She lived through five British Prime Ministers and was officially recognised by Guinness World Records on May 19. Happy birthday to you: Poppy the world's oldest cat celebrates her 24th and last birthday . But she died last Friday following a problem with her hind legs and a water infection. Her owner Jacqui West, 43, said that although the family knew this day would come they are devastated at their loss. She said: ‘We knew she was old but it’s still very upsetting. ‘She had a bad week last week. She was on antibiotics on the Wednesday because of a water infection and her back legs just seemed to let her down. She wasn’t herself at all. ‘She passed away on Friday at 3.30pm. I had spent the whole day with her as she was particularly poorly. Poppy officially recognised as the world's oldest cat after making it to the age of 24 has died - just weeks after clenching the title . ‘We knew it was going to happen but we’re all still completely devastated. It’s only just starting to sink in. ‘It’s great she managed to get the world record beforehand, it’s almost like she was purposely hanging in there because the process took months. ‘We’ve buried her in the garden now, alongside all of the other pets we’ve had that have passed away.‘ . Poppy picked up the title following the death of Pinky, a cat from Kansas who passed away at the age of 23 last year. The pet, who lived in Bournemouth, Dorset, was originally called Popsy and had two owners in her early days. At the age of five she was adopted by Marguerite Corner and her daughter Jacqui. When she was ten she went with Jacqui who had moved in with future husband Andy West. The couple now have two sons – Joe,11 and Toby, eight - and Poppy shared their home with four other cats, two rabbits and a hamster. She's a record breaker: Poppy, the 24-year-old cat from Bournemouth with owner Jacqui West and her two sons Joe, 12 (left) and Toby, 8 (right) with her certificate from Guinness World Records . Mrs West, an accountant, added that her fellow feline pals were also missing her presence. She said: ‘We’ve got got four other cats at the moment. ‘We’ve all taken the news very strangely - including the other cats. ‘All of us are off food, the other cats didn’t eat all day on Friday and they all seem to be loitering around waiting for Poppy to come home. ‘I think it is going to take us a little while to come to terms with it - it’s very said.’ The oldest cat in history was a feline called Creme Puff who lived in Austin, Texas and who survived for an astonishing 38 years and three days. It is not yet known who will take the crown from Poppy. News of Poppy’s death comes just a day after the world’s oldest man, Alexander Imich, passed away aged 111.","Poppy was born in same month Nelson Mandela was released from prison .

"Alex Pritchard ended Leeds' four-match unbeaten run as his goal handed Brentford a 1-0 win at Elland Road. Referee Graham Salisbury made himself unpopular with the Leeds crowd by rejecting three penalty claims before midfielder Pritchard pounced beyond the far post, finishing off clever approach play down the right by substitute Jon Toral and Toumani Diagouraga. Salisbury quickly imposed his authority on a keenly contested affair, showing Brentford defender Harlee Dean a yellow card for impeding Billy Sharp, who was recalled to Leeds' attack after his late winner against Huddersfield a week earlier. Alex Pritchard of Brentford celebrates scoring his side's first goal against Leeds . Luke Murphy's 25-yard free-kick was deflected over the bar and from Murphy's in-swinging corner Liam Cooper and Sol Bamba narrowly failed to connect. Andre Gray should have seized an 18th-minute lead for Brentford but after giving Bamba the slip and sprinting through the middle into the penalty box, the Bees' leading scorer had his shot blocked by alert goalkeeper Marco Silvestri. Cooper was then fortunate to escape with a yellow card for impeding Pritchard when clean through. Pritchard's free-kick caused Silvestri no anxiety, but the Leeds keeper needed to be quick to close down Jota as the home defence was exposed once more. Rodolph Austin of Leeds United and Moses Odubajo of Brentford clash at Elland Road . Keen to impress after knocking at the first team door, Sharp fashioned an immaculate cross from the right, which caused Dean to slice just outside his own post, . Leeds' first penalty appeal came after 42 minutes as midfielder Rudi Austin stumbled after a shove from Moses Odubajo. The official was loudly booed by angry Leeds fans as he left the field at half-time and on his return for the second half but, when Austin again went down in the box under a 49th-minute challenge from Odubajo, he again refused to point to the spot. Odubajo closes down Leeds' Steve Morison during the Championship game at Elland Road on Saturday . Nor was he inclined to change his stance when Sharp became the latest Leeds player to make an unsuccessful penalty claim just before the hour mark. Pritchard's 64th-minute goal had Leeds fans chanting ""one, nil to the referee"" and the Bees' advantage almost doubled with 15 minutes left when Toral smacked a rasping shot against a post. Leeds' best chance of the second half fell to Sharp who hooked his shot wide when Austin's cross was cleared to him.

The three points will come as a blessed relief for manager Neil Redfearn and his team, who have been sucked into the relegation dogfight amid their off-field troubles. They started the night just five points above the drop zone and knew defeat wasn’t really an option against Steve Clarke’s men, who saw their play-off hopes all but killed off by this result. The hosts made two changes from the team that won 2-1 at Wolves on Saturday, a result that extended their recent run to just one loss in nine games in all competitions. Hal Robson-Kanu and Simon Cox made way for Oliver Norwood and Nick Blackman, while Deadline Day arrival Yakubu once again started on the bench.

On-loan Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah (centre) is closed down by Alex Mowatt . The visitors made three changes from the side that lost 1-0 to Brentford at Elland Road, with Giuseppe Bellusci, Tomasso Bianchi and Alex Mowatt replacing Liam Cooper, Rudy Austin and Billy Sharp. The opening was disjointed, neither side finding any rhythm or looking capable of carving out a threatening opportunity. It took 18 minutes for either to even have a sniff of goal, when Reading captain Alex Pearce hacked clear after Steve Morison tried to find Alex Mowatt with a cut-back. Reading slowly roused from their slumber, with Blackman bursting down the left only to be denied by a last-ditch tackle from Giuseppe Bellusci. From the resulting Norwood corner, Pearce headed well over. Nick Blackman started for Reading tonight but was unable to break through the Leeds defence . Reading starting XI: Federici, Kelly, Pearce, Hector, Obita, Williams, Chalobah, Norwood (Mackie - 63), McCleary, Blackman (Yakubu - 71), Pogrebnyak (Cox - 71) Subs not used: Andersen, Cooper, Akpan, Robson-Kanu . Leeds starting XI: Silvestri, Wootton, Bamba, Bellusci, C Taylor, Byram, Murphy, Cook, Bianchi (Sloth - 30), Mowatt, Morison . Subs: S Taylor, Del Fabro, Doukara, Antenucci, Cani, Sharp . Yellow cards: Byram, Wootton . Scorers: Murphy 63, Byram 90 . The best chance of the half fell to Leeds on 36 minutes. After Norwood sloppily gave the ball away in midfield, Casper Sloth, a replacement for the injured Tomasso Bianchi, led a counter-thrust. He shifted the ball wide right to the eager Lewis Cook, who had the presence of mind to square to Morison. Cutting inside, the forward curled his effort onto the post with goalkeeper Adam Federici beaten. Reading came close shortly after the break when Michael Hector forced Marco Silvestri into a save with his legs at the near post from a Jordan Obita corner. Having fallen behind to Murphy’s strike, which Federici will be disappointed not to have kept out, Reading threw on Yakubu and Cox as they chased an equaliser. It nearly arrived with a quarter-hour to play. Danny Williams was played through on the right-hand side of the box but Silvestri did well to block with his legs. But they didn’t threaten again and it was left to Byram to round off a Leeds break and make sure of the points.

"A UKIP councillor has insisted he is not racist – because he has been on holiday to the Carribean. Viv Lewis, 83, repeatedly insisted ‘I like coloured people’ as the party again faced claims it was out of touch with modern Britain. To add further to UKIP’s woes, outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom announced he was quitting after a string of controversies including branding party members ‘sluts’. Apology: UKIP councillor Viv Lewis, from Cornwall, repeatedly referred to 'coloured people' during a TV interview but denied being racist . UKIP leader Nigel Farage has tried to repair the party’s reputation in recent weeks, insisting it had ‘grown up’ and was ready to win seats in the Commons. But it suffered a setback last week when Mr Bloom told an event to promote women in politics: ‘This place is full of sluts’. He then went outside and launched into a rant on race, before hitting a TV reporter over the head. Mr Farage has previously been criticised for referring to ‘coloured people’. Now Mr Lewis, from Cornwall, has been forced to apologise for a BBC TV interview where he denied being a racist - while also referring to ‘coloured people’. Asked about UKIP’s immigration policy, he said: ‘I have already had heated arguments about that. Racist I am not. I like coloured people. ‘I have been to the West Indies. I have sampled their hospitality. I like coloured people. ‘But what I don’t like is people who walk into this country and immediately get given money when there’s a lot more deserving cases among English, British people,’ said the retired coach driver who represents Cornwall’s Camborne Treswithian. UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left) said Godfrey Bloom had made the right decision to quit as a UKIP MEP . Rob Berkeley, director of race equality think tank The Runnymede Trust, added: ‘The term coloured has largely been rejected by people from visible ethnic minorities. ‘By using the term the councillor appears to be out of touch with modern Britain.’ Meanwhile Mr Bloom has announced he will sit as an independent MEP until next year's European election. Mr Bloom, an MEP for Yorkshire and . Humber, was stripped of the party whip last week following his offensive . remarks about women at a party event which over-shadowed the UKIP . conference. In a swipe at Mr . Farage’s attempts to pmake the party more professional, Mr Bloom said . the ‘New UKIP’ was ‘not really right for me any more’. His spokeswoman said it was not clear whether he would seek re-election for a third term next May.

Our wonderful and loyal membership will win through with their dedication and hard work. It has been a pleasure to work with them for 15 years. ‘I shall sit out my term as an independent and give my wholehearted support to Jane Collins who is almost certainly going to be the next UKIP MEP and probably a second seat yet to be decided. ‘I shall of course retain my membership.’","Viv Lewis, 83, denied being racist but referred to 'coloured people' on TV .

"Two Italian music producers conspired to claim authorship of hundreds of songs and received hundreds of thousands of euros from Italian radio and television networks.

Athos Poma, and his accomplice Giuseppe Fedi, claimed rights to more than 200 tracks over a period of three years . The pair took advantage of an error at the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers, the Italian body responsible for copyright protection, that meant composers of many popular songs were not properly registered in the system. While the problem was fixed, the organisation created a holding fund for royalties until they could be returned to the rightful recipient. Poma, under the guidance of Fedi, an employee of the society, told the authority that he was the composer of many of the unregistered tracks. Between the start of 2006 and the end of 2008, Poma claimed rights to 220 songs. The pair made a total of 250,000 euros from the scam. Between the start of 2006 and the end of 2008, Poma claimed rights to 220 songs. Poma has been sentenced to a year and six months in jail for fraud, while Fedi, who also appeared in court on fraud charges, was given a sentence of a year and eight months on Saturday. Poma was acquitted on charges of plagiarism. Giuseppe Vaciago and Giovanni d'Ammassa defending Poma, said their client would appeal. ‘Athos Poma is one of the most important music producers in Italy and over the last 25 years, he has always carried out his work in a professional manner,’ they said.","Athos Poma and Giuseppe Fedi claimed rights to more than 200 tracks .

"Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 World Cup as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine . Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to lose the right to host the 2018 World Cup as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. The Deputy Prime Minister has said it was 'unthinkable' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the West for supplying arms to separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board the Malaysia Airlines flight. World football governing body Fifa has this week rejected calls from some German politicians for Russia to be boycotted. The organisation has insisted the tournament could be 'a force for good.' But Mr Clegg told The Sunday Times that allowing the tournament to go ahead in Russia without a change of course by president Vladimir Putin would make the world look 'so weak and so insincere' in its condemnation of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for the rebels. The EU has added another 15 individuals and 18 entities to the list of those subject to asset freezes and ambassadors in Brussels are expected to extend the punitive actions to state-owned banks' access to capital markets and to the arms and energy sectors. Mr Clegg said however that sporting events should also be part of the package of measures - including the cancellation of Russia's first F1 Grand Prix, which is due to take place in Sochi in October. Mr Clegg said the threat of withdrawing the World Cup would be 'a very potent political and symbolic sanction'. 'If there's one thing that Vladimir Putin cares about, as far as I can see, it's his sense of status. 'Maybe reminding him that you can't retain the same status in the world if you ignore the rest of the world, maybe that will have some effect on his thinking.' He did not rule out the UK as an alternative host given its recent history of putting on successful global sporting events. 'We've got the stadiums, we've got the infrastructure, and we've got the public backing and enthusiasm to host it,' he said. 'That's a decision for other people. But I'm not saying this just as a, sort of, British land grab to snatch the World Cup from under Vladimir Putin's nose.' Football's world governing body Fifa this week ruled out calls from some German politicians for Russia to be boycotted, insisting the tournament could be 'a force for good . He backed David Cameron's criticism of a French deal to supply warships to Russia, saying it would be 'wholly inappropriate' for it to proceed in the present circumstances. Paris has accused the Prime Minister of hypocrisy, with MPs questioning continued British military exports despite an embargo and donations to the Conservatives by wealthy Russians. 'Whilst I can entirely understand that the French may have entered into that contract with the Russians in entirely different circumstances, it is wholly inappropriate to go ahead with that now,' he said. Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman said it was 'beyond belief' that Russia should be allowed to host the 2018 World Cup . 'And as you know, the Prime Minister has reviewed the outstanding licenses that we have got to make sure that we deliver what we unilaterally announced back in March, which was that there would be no exports from Britain of arms products which could in any way fuel or fan the flames of the conflict in Ukraine.' He said he had been assured by Business Secretary Vince Cable that 'great care' was taken to check the remaining licences. Half of voters polled by YouGov for the Sunday Times supported the idea of stripping Russia of the high-profile football (50 per cent) and motor-racing (51 per cent) events, with only 22 per cent opposed. The call was also joined by former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman, who said it was 'beyond belief' that Mr Putin should be allowed to host the World Cup. He said: 'When you look at the way he milked the Winter Olympics for all it was worth, there's no question he sees it for himself, and for his prestige, as a huge gain. 'The idea that the world should afford Russia that prestige is beyond belief. 'I don't know how many people have to get shot out of the skies before people say enough is enough.' Pressure on Mr Cameron over Russian donations was added to by the widow of murdered spy Alexander Litvinenko, who said he should return the tennis cash. Britain has denied that the announcement of a public inquiry into his death and possible Russian involvement - in a reversal of previous policy - was linked to efforts to turn the screw on Moscow. Mrs Litvinenko told the newspaper: 'If David Cameron doesn't want to appear like he is being bought, I think he should return this money.'","Clegg: 'Unthinkable' at present that tournament could be held in Russia .

"An amazing video has captured rare footage of giant Humboldt squid making their bodies ‘flash’ different colours. The footage also reveals the aggressive mating rituals carried out by the deep sea creatures. It is one of the only videos ever captured showing how these squid communicate and interact with each other underwater. Scientists at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California have revealed remarkable footage of giant Humboldt squid. In a video the creatures are seen 'flashing' each other to communicate (seen here). They are also seen performing an aggressive mating ritual . Giant Humboldt squid can grow to the size of a man, up to six feet (1.8 metres) long, and are incredibly dangerous, according to National Geographic. Previous attempts to observe them have seen them rip the masks off divers and attack lighting and camera equipment. According to the researchers, the ability of the squid to flash is not due to bioluminescence, but the use of muscle fibres. ‘A unique feature of all coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish and octopus) is the ability to change skin color through the use of neuromuscular chromatophores,’ the researchers write in their paper. ‘These small organs are composed of an elastic pigment sac that can be expanded, and thereby made visible to an observer, through the action of a ring of radial muscle fibres. ‘These muscle fibres are directly innervated [supplied by nerves] by motor neurons with cell bodies in the chromatophore lobes of the brain.' But in the latest research, carried out by scientists from Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, scientists were able to mount cameras on three of the animals - known as Crittercams. They did this by cutting ‘sweaters’ from child-size swim shirts and slipping them over the body of the animals with a tube, leaving their arms, fins and tentacles free. This allowed them to observe some of the interactions taking place underwater. Of most interest, seen in the latter half of the video, is how the squid flash from red to white to red again in order to communicate. According to lead author of the study Hannah Rosen, this could be an attempt to communicate or a way to petition prospective mates. They can also flash quickly in order to camouflage themselves in the water, matching the pattern of sunlight undulating through the water. The squid were fitted with cameras attached to child-sized shirts to capture the extremely rare footage. But researchers aren't quite sure what the purpose of the flashing is. And the aggressive mating ritual, seen here, was also a bit of a mystery to the scientists . According to lead author of the study Hannah Rosen, the flashing could be an attempt to communicate or a way to petition prospective mates. They can also flash quickly in order to camouflage themselves in the water, matching the pattern of sunlight undulating through the water . In the first half of the video the researchers noted ‘arms-to-arms’ contact between squid, which they took to be mating attempts - although they were unclear if they were successful. The sex of the squid fitted with cameras was unknown, while it was not clear which arms or tentacles were used in the interactions. ‘Splaying of arms was also observed in several instances during interactions that did not appear to be directly related to mating,’ the researchers noted. ‘In one case, a pair of secondary squid were interacting and as the primary squid approached, they both turned to face the oncoming squid and opened their arms as far as possible for several seconds and then jetted backward, away from the camera.’ The scientists hope to employ more Crittercams in future to further study the odd and aggressive behaviour of the squid. The footage is extremely rare because the squid are very dangerous. Previous attempts to observe them have seen them rip the masks off divers and attack lighting and camera equipment .

"Campbell Dalziel, the brother of helicopter pilot Cameron, spoke of his family's anger over the treatment of the victim' s bodies by rebels in Ukraine . The brother of a British victim of the flight MH17 disaster has spoken of his family's pain as they endure 'a waiting game' ahead of the formal identification of his body. Cameron Dalziel, a father-of-two who had dual British and South African nationality, was one of 10 British nationals on the Malaysian Air jet that was shot down over Ukraine. In an interview published today his brother Campbell said Cameron's wife Reine is 'absolutely distraught' since the crash on July 17. He told the Sunday Times: 'We need closure. I know Cameron is gone. It's getting the death certificate. At the moment it's a waiting game.' Meanwhile, it was reported today that unreleased data from the plane's black box retrieved show findings consistent with the plane's fuselage being hit multiple times by shrapnel from a missile explosion. 'It did what it was designed to do,' a European air safety official told CBS News, 'bring down airplanes.' The official described the finding as 'massive explosive decompression.' Mr Dalziel, who had emailed his brother on the day of the crash to make plans for a visit to South Africa, described the agony of relatives of the 298 victims who had to wait days for news as their loved ones lay in a field near the wreckage. He contrasted the treatment of the bodies as they were brought back to the Netherlands, from where the plane had taken off. 'They had been lying in a strange field in a conflict zone, abandoned for four days while investigators were prevented from going to retrieve their dead,' he said. 'So the professionalism and dignity of how they were honoured as fallen soldiers was such a stark contrast to the days after the crash.' Mr Dalziel said his mother had been moved to tears on seeing the poignant images of the coffins and a guard of honour for the victims. Mr Dalziel, who had just moved to Malaysia with his family, was killed while on his way home after taking a training course. He had moved his family to Malaysia for 'an adventure' but also so he could work normal hours and spend time with his sons Sheldon, 14, and Cruz, 4. Helicopter pilot Cameron Dalziel and his wife Reine recently moved to Malaysia with their two children . Cameron Dalziel, 43, was travelling on a  British passport when he  was a victim of the Malaysia Airlines flight . Mr Dalziel's wife Reine was forced to cancel his credit cards to stop them being used after they were scavenged from the site of the plane crash, pictured, by pro-Russian rebels who looted the site . Last week it emerged his wife had been forced to cancel her husband's credit cards to stop their fraudulent use. Mrs Dalziel was 'stunned' by the shameful abuse of her dead husband’s belongings. Her brother Shane Hattingh said: 'People are abusing it in the Ukraine. They have no respect for each other, look what they’re doing. It made me angry beyond words.' Yesterday two cargo planes flew 38 more coffins to a forensic centre in the Netherlands for identification and investigation. There are still remains at the site, international observers have said.","Cameron Dalziel was one of 10 British nationals on Flight MH17 .

"An extraordinary email exchange demonstrates the efforts made by former Leeds owners GFH Capital in trying to prove two well-known club officials committed gross misconduct. The messages, leaked to Sports Agenda, implicate Gulf Finance House chief Hisham Alrayes and colleague Salem Patel, a Leeds director, in attempting to find enough evidence against Shaun Harvey and Gwyn Williams to prevent them from getting a pay-off. Harvey, now chief executive of the Football League, had his contract honoured in full when he left Leeds, but former technical director Williams started his £250,000 case for unfair dismissal this week. Former Leeds United owners GFH sought to gather evidence that two officials committed gross misconduct . Williams was dismissed for using a club email account to send a ‘lewd and obscene’ picture to former Leeds colleague Dennis Wise. The picture of a naked woman in a shower was part of a ‘dirty Leeds’ joke email doing the rounds. Alrayes wrote to a GFH employee at Leeds on July 23, 2013: ‘I believe we should continue to find ways to dismiss Shaun and Gwyn for gross misconduct. We should also let the investigation firm find more information on them so we can use it against them.’ Patel emailed a Leeds colleague on the same day, writing: ‘As per Hisham instruction, please can you provide a list of breaches of Gwyn and Shaun.’ Patel to Alrayes: ‘We talked through the items we have but still need specific proof for Shaun and Gwyn.’ Salem Patel (above) was involved in email exchanges with GFH chief Hisham Alrayes seen by Sports Agenda . Again from Patel to Alrayes: ‘Even still, we need to pay them as regular until we have something concrete which can prove gross misconduct. By not paying, we trigger a process which can be very damaging to the club.’ Another email between the GFH pair read: ‘Gwyn — we should pay him tomorrow otherwise we leave ourselves open for constructive dismissal and breach of contract. Before next pay date we need to find strong evidence of gross misconduct, otherwise we have to pay him as per redundancy process. ‘Shaun — we should pay him tomorrow. However if we can prove gross misconduct, we may be able to claw back some of the change of control provision. Suggest investigating all his bank accounts to see if he was receiving bribes.’ Harvey declined to comment, as did GFH. Former Leeds CEO Shaun Harvey was one of the officials, along with Gwyn Williams GFH wanted to sack . ITV Sport, impressed with the way BT Sport cover rugby, are intending to borrow their pundits Lawrence Dallaglio, Martin Bayfield and Ben Kay for this year’s World Cup. There are now more than five billion reasons why Premier League clubs have moved on from the sexist email exchanges last May between chief executive Richard Scudamore and DLA Piper lawyer Nick West. The TV rights package structure that proved so astonishingly lucrative was mainly devised by Scudamore and West. Richard Scudamore secured a £5bn TV deal after selling Premier League's domestic rights to Sky and BT . Warrington Wolves owner Simon Moran is a wealthy concert promoter. Yet even the most generous estimate of Roger Draper’s salary as the rugby league club’s new chief executive means the former Lawn Tennis Association boss has taken a two-thirds pay-cut on his old £640,000 annual package. BT ramp up Sky feud . The latest division of Premier League rights between Sky and BT Sport has done nothing to improve relations between the warring pay-TV networks. BT believe their bidding tactics resulted in Sky paying hugely over the odds for five packages, while BT got their 42 games for a sensible price. Sky claim BT put massive money on the table for the main packages but were outmanoeuvred in the second round. Certainly the importance both sides attached to the match-pick categories — including second and third choices — in the new contract only emphasises that BT’s current deal allows Sky to dominate the selection of games to a far greater extent than BT imagined when their PL coverage started. The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal . Graphic charts the significant rise of domestic Premier League TV revenue . Iray Whelan, the English director of FIFA’s ticket and hospitality partners Match who was arrested on suspicion of ticket touting during the World Cup, has been cleared seven months later.

"That a game for Brazil in their own World Cup should end with the opposition goalkeeper emerging as the runaway man of the match should perhaps surprise nobody. This was certainly some night for a curly-hurled guy from Mexico called Guillermo Ochoa. Nevertheless, this was a night that told us something more about the host nation as they look to seek a coronation in front of their own people this summer. This is a Brazil team that will need to improve significantly if it is not to stumble when the stakes grow higher later in the tournament. Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team should certainly reach phase two now. This was a draw that actually suited both teams pretty well, even if the 55,000 Brazilians packed in to the Estadio Castelao went home feeling less than sated. VIDEO Ochoa brilliance denies Brazil . No way past: Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa makes a superb instinctive save from Thiago Silva (centre) Beaten to the punch: Ochoa clears the ball under pressure from Paulinho . Rising to the occasion: Neymar gets above Rafael Marquez and sends a header towards goal . Saving the day: Mexico goalkeeper  Ochoa keeps the ball out, Banks style, as Brazil come close . Comparison: Some people remarked that Ochoa's save from Neymar was like Gordon Banks' from Pele . Super saver: Ochoa gets in the way on the stroke of half-time as David Luiz (left) and Paulinho lurk . Brazil: (4-2-3-1): J Cesar 6; Alves 6.5, T.Silva 6, Luiz 6.5, Marcelo 5.5; Paulinho 6, Gustavo 6; Ramires 6 (Bernard 45min, 6), Neymar 7, Oscar 6.5 (Willian 84); Fred 5 (Jo 67, 5) Subs: Jefferson, Fernandinho, Hulk, Dante, Maxwell, Henrique, Hernanes, Maicon, Victor. Booked: Ramires, Silva. Mexico (3-2-3-2): Ochoa 8; Rodriguez 6.5, Marquez 6, Moreno 5.5; Aguilar 6, Layun 6.5;  Vasquez 5.5, Herrera 6 (Fabian 76), Guardado 6; Dos Santos 6.5 (Jiminez 74min, 6), Peralta 6  (Hernandez 74min, 6). Subs: Corona, Salcido, Reyes, Pulido, Ponce, Brizuela, Aquino, Pena, Talavera. Booked: Aguilar, Vasquez. Man of the match: Guillermo Ochoa. Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey). Unquestionably, though, this Brazilian team is deficient. For all the impish genius of the new golden child Neymar, Brazil still lack a through the middle goal scorer. In defenders David Luiz and Marcelo, meanwhile, they have footballers born to play in opposition territory. Sadly that is only half of their job. They created chances last night and they should have taken at least a couple. Ochoa, released by the little known Corsican club AC Ajaccio, who play in France's Ligue 2, had one of those nights he will talk about forever. Conversely, though, Brazil continued to look wide open once the centre of their midfield was punctured and, from that perspective, it still looks as though Scolari has some tinkering to do. Do not, for example, be surprised if Manchester City’s centre player Fernandinho comes in to the reckoning before long as Brazil seek a way to become more resolute. On a wonderful, humid South American night, this was some occasion, some atmosphere and, given the lack of goals, some game. It began at a gallop, with tackles being exchanged with the ferocious abandon of a Hackney Marshes grudge match, and grew in to a night of punch and counter punch. Floored genius: Neymar lies prone on the turf after some rough treatment from the Mexicans . Crowded out: Neymar tries to escape three Mexico defenders on a frustrating night for Brazil . Having a go: Neymar takes a free-kick but the ball arcs just wide of the Mexico goal (below) Back of the net: Neymar found his way into the goal but the ball stayed out . Putting it in: Bernard (No 20) tries to make something happen for Brazil under pressure from Oribe Peralta . At full stretch: Julio Cesar in the Brazil goal dives for the ball . Brazil were the better team and they should have won. Without the help of a referee this time, though, they lacked cohesion at times. For long periods, their rhythm deserted them and there was not a single passage of play that made you think that Mexico were not capable of doing something to spoil the party completely. After the initial frantic exchanges, with the crowd at fever pitch, Brazil settled down to play and the peculiar looking Ochoa was asked to make his two decisive contributions of the first half. First it was Neymar – Brazil’s stand-out player – who was denied. Having almost worked a one-two with Paulinho, Neymar was on the six yard line when a cross from Dani Alves delivered the ball back in to the penalty area. The Barcelona player seemed second best to reach the ball but he leaped well and his downward header seemed destined for the corner until Ochoa pawed it away with his right hand. No pain, no gain: Neymar is left on the floor as Luiz Felipe Scolari shouts at the officials . Showboating: Home favourite Neymar keeps the ball in the air despite the attentions of Andres Guardado . Sent flying: Former Tottenham forward Giovani dos Santos trips over Dani Alves . It was a great save – perhaps the best of the World Cup so far – and he followed it with another just before the interval, this time advancing from his line quickly to smother Paulinho’s effort after Thiago Silva had chested a cross down cleverly in to the Tottenham midfielder’s path. Mexico didn’t create such clear chances early on but they did carry a threat and an ambitious intent that was to manifest itself much later in the piece. In to the second half, though, and once again Ochoa was asked to come to the fore. Not for a while, though. For the first 20 minutes of the second period, Brazil got stuck in one of their feet of clay periods and it was Mexico who pressed, with Andres Guardado and Hector Herrera advancing to clobber drives narrowly off target  from distance. Ultimately, though, enlivened by well-times Scolari substitutes, Brazil did come again. Neymar may have done better than drive a shot against the goalkeeper’s knees from an angle before Luiz got his flat feet in a tangle when a chance presented itself courtesy of an Alves pass soon after. Striding out: David Luis attempts to make something happen as Brazil are frustrated . Battling it out: Oscar (left) and Hector Moreno fight for the ball during a tight first half . Getting stuck in: Andres Guardado feels the full force of a challenge by Dani Alves . Chopped down: Mexico full back Miguel Layun is fouled by Dani Alves . Tussle: Ramires (left) tries to get the better of Mexico's defender Andres Guardado . It was, however, the Brazilian captain who went back to the team base cursing himself after spurning the chance of the night with five minutes left. Lucky to still be on the field after almost cutting Javier Hernandez in two moments earlier, the big central defender Silva was completely unmarked when a free-kick from the left dropped on his forehead six yards from goal. At first sight it looked as though Ochoa had saved unbelievably but the replays showed that Silva had the whole goal at his mercy and somehow managed to head the ball towards the only place where it wasn’t going to go in. At that point, Brazil knew they wouldn’t win. It summed up the night, though, that they then almost lost. Twice in injury time, Julio Cesar was troubled from distance, the second shot, from substitute Raul Jimenez a spectacular effort from wide on the right. Two games in and Brazil will not complain. Better opposition may unmask them more revealingly, though. Passion: Former Chelsea defender David Luiz leads an emotional Brazilian national anthem . Emotion: World Cup poster boy Neymar was reduced to tears by the national anthem . All smiles: Brazil supporters watching the Mexico match in a 'Fan Fest' in Manaus . Dressed to impress: Brazilian fans in Fortaleza ahead of the game against Mexico . Contingent: There were plenty of Mexico fans in attendance for the Group A game . Alves dyes for the cause . Twitter was abuzz with a contentious issue from this game — Dani Alves’ new hairstyle. The Barca right back chose to dye his normal dark colour an unusual hue and the decision was trending, with Liverpool defender Jon Flanagan posting: ‘Mexico looking good here, think they will get something out the game. Fred is terrible also Dani Alves haircut is a disaster’. There were many fine displays for Mexico but nobody outperformed Rafael Marquez. Now 35, Marquez is Mexico’s most decorated footballer. This was a record fourth time he has captained them at the World Cup — and it comes after a 15-month spell out of the side. He was recalled for the play-off win over New Zealand. We can sometimes get dewy-eyed about Brazil and World Cups but the reason they set the standard at these tournaments has nothing to do with nostalgia — it is down to achievement. Qualification for the knockout stages would be their 18th in a row.","Brazil and Mexico play out second goalless draw of the World Cup .

The total sales in the UK for his books has just gone over £13 million and as of this week stands at £13,198,871.97, according to experts Nielsen Bookscan. He will share the money with his publisher Harper Collins, but takes a substantial cut to add to his already formidable fortune. Walliams only wrote his first children's book Mr Stink in October 2009. It has since sold more than half a million copies in the UK. Next was Billionaire Boy in June 2011 which sold around 550,000 copies, then Ratburger in September last year which sold 300,000.

The sales are set to continue in the Autumn with the third release of the year Demon Dentist, which is due out later this month. The sales put Walliams in the same bracket as JK Rowling and Roald Dahl as superstar children's book writers. One publisher said: 'He is a phenomenon, people who think of him as a comedian are wrong. He is by far and away the most successful children's book writer for years. He's the Roald Dahl of his generation.' It's an amazing second career for Walliams who is one of the country's leading comedians. He shot to fame as Matt Lucas's comedy partner in Little Britain, which established itself as the country's most popular funny show. He has homes in London and Brighton and married model Lara Stone, with whom he recently had a baby son called Alfred.","Sold 2.2 million books in the UK and a further 200,000 around the world .

"Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 World Cup as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was 'unthinkable' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the West for supplying arms to the separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board. FIFA this week ruled out calls from some German politicians for Russia to be boycotted, insisting the tournament could be 'a force for good'. Demand: Nick Clegg has called for Russia to be stripped of the right to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup . Call: Nick Clegg has demanded that Russia be stripped of the right to host the 2018 World Cup as the West continue to blame at Russia for causing the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, killing 298 people . Axe: Deputy Prime Minister Clegg says it is 'unthinkable' that Russia could be allowed to host the World Cup . But Mr Clegg told The Sunday Times that allowing it to go ahead without a change of course by president Vladimir Putin would make the world look 'so weak and so insincere' in its condemnation of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for the rebels. The EU has added another 15 individuals and 18 entities to the list of those subject to asset freezes and ambassadors in Brussels are expected to extend the punitive actions to state-owned banks' access to capital markets and to the arms and energy sectors. Mr Clegg said however that sporting events should also be part of the package of measures - including the cancellation of Russia's first Formula One Grand Prix, which is due to take place in Sochi in October. 'Vladimir Putin himself has to understand that he can't have his cake and eat it,' he said. Hosts: Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) with FIFA President Sepp Blatter (centre) at 2014 World Cup final . 'He can't constantly, you know, push the patience of the international community beyond breaking point, destabilise a neighbouring country, protect these armed separatists in the east of Ukraine and still have the privilege and honour of receiving all the accolades in 2018 for being the host nation of the World Cup. 'That's why I've come to the view that if he doesn't change course it's just not on, the idea that Russia will host the World Cup in 2018. 'You can't have this - the beautiful game marred by the ugly aggression of Russia on the Russian Ukrainian border. 'Not only would Vladimir Putin exploit it, I think it would make the rest of the world look so weak and so insincere about our protestations about Vladimir Putin's behaviour if we're not prepared to pull the plug.' Bid: Russia won the right to host the 2018 World Cup and Qatar was given the 2022 edition of the tournament . He said that despite F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone's insistence that there was no case for abandoning the Grand Prix, 'the question marks I'm raising will only increase over the next coming weeks and months, over the summer and up to the Grand Prix, about Russia's entitlement to host these major events. 'Vladimir Putin is a past master at attending these sporting events and, sort of, pretending almost as if everything's utterly normal and nothing untoward is happening around him. 'And if anyone needed any reminding of how dangerous this conflict is in the heart of Europe, just ask any of the family and relatives of those loved ones they lost in that plane incident last week.' Mr Clegg said the threat of withdrawing the World Cup would be 'a very potent political and symbolic sanction'. Dedicated: John Alder and Liam Sweeney were on their way to support Newcastle United in New Zealand . Commemoration: Newcastle manager Alan Pardew (left) and captain Fabricio Coloccini (right) lay wreaths in memory of supports John Alder and Liam Sweeney who lost their lives on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 . Tributes: Flowers and shirts have been left at St James' Park in remembrance of the Newcastle fans . 'If there's one thing that Vladimir Putin cares about, as far as I can see, it's his sense of status. 'Maybe reminding him that you can't retain the same status in the world if you ignore the rest of the world, maybe that will have some effect on his thinking.' He did not rule out the United Kingdom as an alternative host given its recent history of putting on successful global sporting events. 'We've got the stadiums, we've got the infrastructure, and we've got the public backing and enthusiasm to host it,' he said. 'That's a decision for other people. But I'm not saying this just as a, sort of, British land grab to snatch the World Cup from under Vladimir Putin's nose.'

Daughter: Blair's daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, is seen with her father Alexander Dorsey. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive.

Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry . An attorney hasn't been assigned. The Michigan Department of Human Services is taking steps to end Blair's rights to two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. In a court filing, the state said the teen described a house of horror, where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood, hit with a hot curling iron and burned with a clothing iron. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old.

Nine months later, Blair became 'enraged' when Stoni said she didn't like her surviving siblings and strangled the girl with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag, the department said. Blair then made the teen 'put Stoni in the deep freezer following her death,' the agency said. The 8-year-old boy also was aware that his sister and brother were killed and subsequently placed in the freezer, the department said. Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the children. Toni Williams, 28, left, and Natasha Bell, 30, leave balloons at the house on Wednesday . The teenager said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years. Earlier Thursday, Blair appeared in court on child abuse charges via a video feed from a police lockup. Magistrate Renee McDuffee entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf. 'The charges in this matter are so heinous,' McDuffee said in explaining the $1 million bond. The state said it investigated allegations of abuse in 2002 and 2005. Blair was referred to counseling. The state said the two fathers of Blair's surviving children are unfit to care for them. Together they owe $50,000 in child support and haven't seen the kids in two to three years. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. 'While we all understand the desire to know what happened in that home is strong, I will ask you to be mindful of the two children who were also in that home and are still living,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters Wednesday.

"What started out as a joke may have now become part of the UK's food landscape as childhood favourite the crisp sandwich looks set to take over restaurant menus. Following in the footsteps of Belfast's Simply Crispy - which opened earlier this month - Stock Exchange Bakery in Bristol has now introduced the classic snack to its punters. The crunchy sandwiches, which come in freshly made buns or sliced multi-granary bread, are being sold for £2.50. George Turner, 40, owner of the Stock Exchange Bakery in Bristol, eats a crisp sandwich at the new cafe . Punters get to choose from 20 different crisp flavours includes McCoy's flame grilled steak and Quavers to Monster Munch and Walkers Sensations Thai sweet chilli . For an extra 50p, the more adventurous can add either ham, cheese or onions, while an extra 20p will add either sweet chilli sauce or chutney. Owner Georgina Turner is offering crisp fanatics a choice of 20 different flavours to tackle, from traditional cheese and onion or ready salted, to the slightly more unusual Monster Munch or Sensations Thai sweet chilli. The bakery, which opened three months ago, launched the crisp sandwich scheme as a way to cheer up their punters. Ms Turner said to The Bristol Post: 'It's just a bit of fun, really. We know that money is tight for a lot of people these days and we thought we would offer something a bit different.' Stock Exchange bakery's crisp sandwiches are served in sliced bread or in a bun . The bakery, which opened three months ago, offers sandwich filings for an additional 50p and sauces for an extra 20p. Customers can also choose to add a serving of soup for £1.50 . If the snacks prove to be as popular as as Simply Crispy, the bakery may have to keep them on the menu. Businessman Andrew McMenamin had planned to keep his Simply Crispy pop-up in Belfast going for just four weeks. But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open until at least March, and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or even London. 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said.

But PSG's Brazilian midfielder insisted that the French champions can still gain revenge on the Premier League giants in the last 16 of the Champions League.

"An 18-year-old child care student only realised she was pregnant when she gave birth on her parents' bathroom floor, it was revealed today. Jessica Elikowski, of Blurton, Staffordshire, even underwent keyhole surgery six months into her pregnancy after suffering back and knee pain - caused by her unborn child growing near her spine. She had been off sick with back trouble from college - where she is studying to become a nursery nurse - but woke up to go to the toilet and, after feeling an urge to push, gave birth to 7lb 6oz Lexi. Happy family: Jessica Elikowski (left), her baby Lexi and mother Barbara Elikowski at home in Staffordshire . Miss Elikowski said: ‘I had no idea I was pregnant - which is amazing considering I'm actually studying child care and pregnancy at college. ‘I had really bad knee and back pain which I thought was a result of an injury I suffered in 2012. The doctors said I needed key-hole surgery to realign my knee cap. ‘But the pain didn't go away until I suddenly gave birth three months later. Everything happened really quickly. I had a couple of days off college because I was having really bad pains in my back. ‘I went to the toilet a few times and I had a bit of pain but I thought it was period pain. My mum came in to check I was okay and realised something was wrong.

"Lazar Markovic hit Behrang Safari in the face and deserved to be sent off by top referee Bjorn Kuipers. Striking or attempting to strike an opponent is viewed as violent conduct. Of course, Safari ‘made a meal of it’ but that is the modern game. Kuipers had a clear view of Markovic looking for his man before throwing his arm out at him in a violent way and was right to send him off. Kuipers is rated very highly by UEFA. You could see why. His other key decision, turning down Gerrard’s penalty appeal, was also spot on as the Basle goalkeeper got the ball at Gerrard’s feet. Lazar Markovic makes contact with the face of Behrang Safari during Liverpool's 1-1 draw with Basle . Steven Gerrard goes tumbling under a challenge from goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik in the second half . Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's take on the decision in his match report, reads: '[Markovic was] a victim of that fatal combination – his own stupidity and the spiteful cunning of an opponent. 'Markovic, who had looked lively out wide with Raheem Sterling moved to Lambert’s role, was speeding away from Behrang Safari when, for reasons best known to himself, he decided to flick out an arm to keep him back. 'If he touched the Basle man it was little more than a fingertip but he fell as if struck by sniper fire. Kuipers bought it, and Markovic was shown a straight red card. He had local sympathy but, let’s face it, if Mario Balotelli had done that he would have been castigated for impetuous foolishness.' Markovic is given his marching orders by Ducth referee Bjorn Kuipers as Dejan Lovren protests . Liverpool continue to protest the decision as Swedish defender Safari rolls around on the turf . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and Basle boss Paulo Sousa, unsurprisingly, offered contrasting views on the decision to send Markovic off. 'I thought the sending off was really disappointing decision by the referee,' said Rodgers. 'Lazar Markovic gets sent off for that, his fingernail barely touches the nose of the defender and the defender is the guy who should be looked at for his reaction.' Sousa said: 'It is not for me to contest these decisions. I will not contest what Rodgers says. 'From what I hear from my players he (Safari) is not that sort of player.'

"A retired highway patrolman believes he has found the infamous Zodiac killer that is responsible for at least five deaths that haunted California in the 1960s. Lyndon Lafferty - a childhood friend of the police's main suspect - penned a book on his decades-long hunt for the Zodiac called 'The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up' in which he adds an intriguing new theory as to who the killer is and why he was never caught. Mr Lafferty believes that the killer is a 91-year-old man living in Solano County, California, and that he was protected from investigators by 'power brokers' that refused to stop him. Wanted: A retired highway patrolman believes he has found the infamous Zodiac Killer, pictured here in a police poster from October 1969, the period when he was on the loose in the Bay Area . Code: The Zodiac Killer terrorized the San Fransisco Bay Area from 1968 to 1969 when he killed at least five people. He would routinely send newspapers letters and cryptograms that were so complicated that some have still not been solved to this day . 'Official corruption and political intervention forced the investigation into a top-secret, covert status, giving the insane ZODIAC killer immunity and a license to kill,' said Mr Lafferty in his new book, published on February 8 of this year. The Zodiac Killer terrorized the San Fransisco Bay Area from 1968 to 1969 when he killed at least five people. There was never an arrest, though law enforcement officials followed dozens of clues that all went cold. The killer would routinely send newspapers letters that taunted police and cryptograms that were so complicated that some have still not been solved to this day. Victims: Paul Stine, Cecilia Shepard and Bryan Hartnell were three of those killed or injured by the killer . In the letters, he claimed that he killed 37 people. 'The police shall never catch me, because I have been too clever for them,' the Zodiac wrote in a letter sent to the San Francisco Chronicle. His young victims were either stabbed or shot to death in Northern California and were between the ages of 16 and 29. The San Francisco Police Department closed the case in 2004, but reopened it in 2007. Numerous people have claimed they have identified the killer, but none have ever been confirmed by the police department. The main suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen, was cleared after DNA evidence taken from the saliva of the Zodiac's sealed letters exonerated him. The Hunt: Lyndon Lafferty penned a book on his decades long hunt for the Zodiac called 'The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up' in which he adds an intriguing new theory as to who the killer was and why he was never caught . Adaptation: Robert Downey Jr and Jake Gyllenhaal starred in Zodiac, a 2007 film about the famous case . Mr Lafferty, who went to High School with Mr Allen, claims that the identity of the Zodiac killer has been known since March 15, 1971. The 'Mandamus Seven,' a group of retired law enforcement officers, federal agents, a minister and a District Attorney banded together to prove, once and for all, who the Zodiac really is. The motive for the killings, Mr Lafferty says, was adultery. 'Mind and body ravaged by years of severe alcoholism, his blood-lusting revenge turned him into the most shocking and vicious killer in our 20th century,' Mr Lafferty writes. 'Through his tauntings of the police, his codes, ciphers, and letters, he was on a mission to redeem his shattered ego, to prove that he is better, smarter, and more clever than all the judges and police put together.' Mr Lafferty says that the Zodiac started his killing spree after his wife had an affair with a Solano County Superior Court Judge, according to the Daily Republic. Suspect: After an artist's impression of the killer (left) was released, Arthur Leigh Allen (right) was arrested and question but later released without charge . Mr Lafferty locked onto the Zodiac case in 1970 when he became suspicious of a man he saw parking at Vallejo highway rest stops, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. He tracked the man, who drove a white Chevrolet sedan and looked just like the wanted posters, and decided he had to be the one. One time, Mr Lafferty said, he even confronted the killer. 'I looked into a quivering, snarling face like I was looking to the face of death,' Mr Lafferty said to the Daily Republic. 'It scared the hell out of me.' Mr Lafferty, who said he worked as a code breaker during the Korean War, even claims that the name of his suspect appears in the Zodiac's codes. Chase: Law enforcement officers meeting in 1969 in an attempt to hunt down the Zodiac Killer . Single-minded: San Francisco detective Dave Toschi spent years hunting the murderer . Some have questioned Mr Lafferty's zest for the Zodiac, as so many before him have claimed to have solved the case. Reviews of his book on Amazon.com complain of numerous research inaccuracies and question Mr Lafferty's use of an alias to hide the name of his person of interest. But Mr Lafferty is so convinced that he knows who the killer is that he thinks the killer has his eye on him. Mr Lafferty says he may have been threatened by the Zodiac himself in his own cryptic letter, out of retaliation for publishing his book. 'Many innocent people could spend the rest of their lives in prison if the truth were told,' a letter addressed to Mr Lafferty reportedly said. 'I had to wait until some people, including the suspect's wife, finally died. But that has finally happened recently, and now it's time to tell the story.' Lyndon Lafferty . The letter contained 'evidence' that it was indeed from the Zodiac and was signed 'A Concerned Citizen.' Undaunted, he decided that it was time to blow the whistle. 'I had to wait until some people, including the suspect's wife, finally died,' Mr Lafferty said to the San Francisco Chronicle. 'But that has finally happened recently, and now it's time to tell the story.' Mr Lafferty does have one prominent believer of his theories: Pam Huckaby, the sister of the Zodiac's third victim. 'I am sure Lyndon has the right guy,' Mrs Huckaby said to the San Francisco Chronicle. She claimed that her sister, Darlene Ferrin, was being stalked by a man that resembled the sketches of the Zodiac killer for months before her death. When Mr Lafferty showed her a photo of his suspect, she recognized him instantly. 'It's him,' she said.","Serial killer from San Francisco has never been found despite 40-year hunt .

"A strong smell of explosives hung in the air and the streets of Donetsk were eerily quiet as darkness fell tonight. Gone were the normal sounds of traffic and of the city’s one million residents going about their daily lives - the only noise was the distant rumble of war. For two days that ominous sound - of heavy shelling and gunfire - has been getting closer as the Ukrainian military try to reclaim the key city from pro-Russian separatists. Scroll down for video . Reporter Rebecca Evans, pictured at the crash site of MH17, does not know when she will be able to leave Donetsk as the distant rumble of war gets closer . The government, embarrassed by its inability to secure the MH17 crash site, is coming down hard on the rebels who formed the Donetsk People’s Republic five months ago. During the day, a crucial railway bridge leaving the city was blown up, meaning thousands of people who flocked to the train station had to leave and return to their homes. As the airport has been destroyed by the Ukrainian military, the only other option is by road - a highly dangerous route. Today, journalists trying to leave were fired upon at military check points by drunken, Kalashnikov-wielding, inexperienced rebels. Like many others, myself and my colleague, photographer Jamie Wiseman, were trying to leave the city by train after reporting on the horrendous scenes at the MH17 crash site and the shocking fact that the bodies of many victims have yet to be removed. At the station, one local woman told me: ‘That would have been the last train out of here. I do not know what we will do now.

A curfew operates from 11pm to 6am and anyone caught breaching it carries the risk of arrest or worse. As I write, the fighting has moved closer into the city, on the roads by the airport and everyone has been told to stay inside and close their windows. But even with the doors and windows shut, the terrifying, booming sound of artillery can be clearly heard as the city of Donetsk comes closer each minute to descending into a state of full-blown war. Ukrainian servicemen in the village of Verhnyokamyanske, not far Artemovsk, in the Donetsk region, on Friday . The government, embarrassed by its inability to secure the MH17 crash site, is coming down hard on the rebels who formed the Donetsk People's Republic five months ago. Pictured are Ukrainian servicemen in the village of Verhnyokamyanske, not far Artemovsk, in the Donetsk region . Ukrainian officials have today said their forces advanced to the outskirts of a key town north of the city as they try to retake the stronghold. The move comes as Ukrainian forces appear to have gained some momentum recently by retaking control of territory from the rebels. Russia however also appears to becoming more involved in the fighting. The U.S. and Ukraine have accused Moscow of moving heavy artillery across the border to the rebels. Ukrainian national security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces were outside Horlikva, just north of the regional centre of Donetsk. Once they can take Horlivka, 'the direct route is open for the forces of the anti-terrorist operation to the capital of the Donbass region - the city of Donetsk,' Lysenko said. Two military cargo planes, one Dutch and the other Australian, today flew 38 more coffins carrying victims to the Netherlands for identification and investigation . Soldiers could be seen carrying coffins with the remains of the victims of MH17 from a plane and into a waiting hearse at Eindhoven military airport today . 'The approaches to Donetsk are being blocked so that the terrorists do not get the chance to receive ammunition, reinforcements or equipment.' Donetsk, a city of about 1 million . people, is a major centre of the separatist uprising that has battled . Ukrainian government forces for five months. Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 World Cup as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was 'unthinkable' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the West for supplying arms to the separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board. Football's world governing body Fifa this week ruled out calls from some German politicians for Russia to be boycotted, insisting the tournament could be 'a force for good'. But Mr Clegg told The Sunday Times that allowing it to go ahead without a change of course by president Vladimir Putin would make the world look 'so weak and so insincere' in its condemnation of Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for the rebels. Meanwhile, a full-fledged investigation into the shooting down of MH17 still hasn't started because of the security risks posed by the nearby fighting. U.S. and Ukrainian officials say flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from rebel territory, most likely by mistake. Two military cargo planes, one Dutch and the other Australian, also today flew 38 more coffins carrying victims to the Netherlands for identification and investigation. Later, the Dutch government said the first formal identification of a victim had taken place. The name and sex of the victim, a Dutch national, weren't released. The planes took off from Kharkiv, a government-controlled city where the bodies have been brought from the wreckage site in territory held by pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian government. They landed later in the afternoon in Eindhoven, where the coffins were transferred to a fleet of hearses in a solemn ceremony. Officials said the flights took the last of the 227 coffins containing victims that had been brought to Kharkiv by refrigerated train. Officials say the exact number of people held in the coffins is still to be determined by forensic experts in the Netherlands, where Ukraine agreed to send the bodies. International observers have said there are still remains at the wreckage site. Access however has been limited due to rebel interference and security concerns.","For two days, the ominous sound of heavy shelling and gunfire has been getting closer to Donetsk as Ukrainian military try to reclaim city from rebels .

"An outbreak of a rare form of meningitis has left two people dead and a dozen fighting for their lives  in Tennessee - after they all received steroid injections for back pain. All but one of the victims - in their late 40s to their early 80s -  are known to have visited the same health clinic in Nashville to get the lumbar epidural jabs. But more than 700 patients who had similar procedures at Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, in Nashville, could be at risk on top of up to 200 at another clinic where the same batch of drugs was administered, government experts warned. Closed: Nashville's Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center has voluntarily shut down in a bid to contain the outbreak . There are also fears that the deadly . brain bug may be spreading into other states after a 14th fell ill in . North Carolina having undergone similar treatment. Now government health chiefs are probing an . unidentified drug-manufacturing firm as they desperately try to recall . hundreds of samples from hospitals across the state amid fears more may be . infected. 'This is a serious . disease,' said Marion Kainer, an infectious disease expert with the . state health department. 'There is not a lot of experience in treating . this, but we are getting the best experts together.' The outbreak is a rare type caused by a fungus and is not spread from person to person. Doctors think the infections were caused by contamination of the steroid with the fungus, known as aspergillus. Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center has voluntarily shut down in a bid to contain the outbreak. Fears: Dr. David Reagan, chief medical officer for the Tennessee Department of Health, said two more confirmed cases in the past 24 hours brought the total to 14 . The clinic contacted 737 . patients who had lumbar epidural steroid injections between July 30 and . September 20, officials said. But between 100 and 200 patients at Specialty Surgery Center in Crossville, . Tennessee, may have been exposed or at risk because of injections at the same time. Dr. David Reagan, chief medical . officer for the Tennessee Department of Health, said two more confirmed . cases in the past 24 hours brought the total to 14. Fungal meningitis is rare but can be deadly. Although anyone can get fungal meningitis, people at higher risk include those who have AIDS, leukemia, or other forms of immunodeficiency. It is not contagious between people but can be caught by inhaling fungal spores from the environment, often found in bat or bird droppings. In the case in Tennessee, it is believed steroid injections may have been contaminated by the aspergillus fungus. The infection causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the spinal cord and brain. Symptoms include a severe headache, vomiting, a rash, sensitivity to light and a stiff neck. If untreated, it can result in death. While 13 of those who contracted the infection had received steroid injections for back pain at the Nashville clinic, the other case was reported in North Carolina in a patient who had received the same type of injection. Marion . Kainer, an infectious diseases physician and epidemiologist with the . Tennessee Health Department, said it's still too early to pinpoint the . source. But Kainer . said three lots of injectable steroid used at a Nashville clinic between . July 30 and Sept. 20 have been recalled by the manufacturer. The clinic, the Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, voluntarily shut its doors Sept. 20. Officials haven't identified the drug manufacturer or the city in North Carolina where one of the cases was reported. Reagan said that publicizing too much information at this time could negatively affect the investigation. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Curtis Allen said the agency is working with health departments in other states to determine whether other patients might be affected. He could not say how many people or clinics could potentially be affected nationally. In Tennessee there are about 900 people who received the injections at two clinics during the timeframe under investigation. No one from the second clinic has at this time been found to have contracted the disease, officials said. Allen cautioned that while the injectable steroids were one thing the sickened patients had in common, there could also be other things in common, such as the anesthetic or the antiseptic, and the search for a cause is ongoing. Of the 11 surviving patients in Tennessee, some are in critical condition while others are improving, Reagan said. Health Department spokesman Woody McMillin said so far it has taken patients between seven days and 28 days to develop symptoms. Officials say new cases could yet be identified in coming days.","All but one of the victims visited the same Nashville health clinic while another fell ill in North Carolina .

"Scientists in Alaska are investigating whether seals are being killed by radiation from Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. Scores of ring seals have washed up on Alaska's arctic coastline since July either injured or killed by a mysterious disease which biologists first thought was a virus. But the bleeding lesions on the hind flippers, irritated skin around the nose and eyes and patchy hair loss on the seals' fur coats may have been caused by radiation from the stricken nuclear plant. Harmed: Seals like this one in Barrow, Alaska, have been found with bleeding lesions, damaged fur and flippers thought to have been caused by radiation from Fukushima, Japan. Three reactors at the nuclear plant went into meltdown following the catastrophic tsunami caused by an 9.0-magnitude earthquake off Japan's north-east coast in March. Now animals several thousands miles away in Barrow, Alaska, are washing up with injuries thought to have been caused by the fallout from the nuclear meltdown. John Kelley, Professor Emeritus at the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said: 'We recently received samples of seal tissue from diseased animals captured near St. Lawrence Island with a request to examine the material for radioactivity. Chaos: Three reactors at the Fukushima plant went into meltdown after the tsunami in March which battered Japan's north-east coast . 'There is concern expressed by some members of the local communities that there may be some relationship to the Fukushima nuclear reactor's damage.' The results of the tests would not be available for 'several weeks,' Kelley said. Water tests have not picked up any evidence of elevated radiation in U.S. Pacific waters since the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which caused multiple fuel meltdowns at the Fukushima plant and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate the surrounding area. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have been seeking the cause of the diseased seals for weeks, but have so far found no answers.","Seals washed up with hair loss and bleeding lesions .

"A murder trial began on Tuesday of a man accused of brutally sexually assaulting and strangling his girlfriend's four-month-old baby girl. Jordan Lafayette Prince, 26, has been charged with first-degree murder, abuse of a child and forcible sodomy in St Charles, Missouri for the sickening assaults. During the December 2012 assault, Ashlynn Lillith Peters was beaten and strangled, apparently to quiet her crying. The child's mother, Jessica Lynn Howell, 27, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in January for encouraging Prince to sexually assault her four-month-old daughter in an attack that later killed the child. Jordan Lafayette Prince, 26, is facing life in prison for  first-degree murder, abuse of a child and forcible sodomy in St Charles, Missouri . Howell, of O'Fallon, was sentenced after pleading guilty Friday to felony abuse of a child and felony murder in January. Court documents said she sent a series of text messages to her boyfriend - when Ashlynn was just one month old - encouraging him to have sexual contact with her daughter. Howell knew that Prince had sexually assaulted a child in Idaho, according to STLToday.com. The accused killer was not the child's father. The mother reportedly sent a text to Prince which read 'no man loves a girl as much as her father', adding that it would be 'hot' if he had sex with her baby, STL Today reported. The baby's cause of death was ruled as asphyxiation. The prosecution said that the sexual assault, which was carried out with an unknown object, had caused such serious internal bleeding that she would have died without being strangled. The baby also had bruises all over her body. In his opening statement on Tuesday, Assistant Prosecutor Phil Groenweghe described the last moments of the baby's life as 'sheer hell'. The child was rushed to hospital on the morning of her death, with doctors making multiple attempts to save her life. During this time, the couple could not be found and had to be called on their cell phone. Prince's attorney claimed he had nothing to do with the crime and noted that investigators found no DNA belonging to Prince that was consistent with their theory. A roommate, Tony Ruble, testified on the first day of trial that when the couple came home from the hospital, he heard them arguing and trying to get their stories straight. On the second day of the trial, the jury was shown a video-taped confession where Prince broke down and told investigators he had strangled the child. He claimed he made have been rougher with the baby than intended while he was burping her. The accused killer told detectives that he had been sexually abused as a child. The trial continues.

"Rosetta has uncovered some surprising features about comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as it orbits it in deep space. Instead of imaging a bright, ice-covered comet, the probe’s instruments have detected that 67P is in fact darker than charcoal in some wavelengths of light. And scientists working on Rosetta’s Alice instrument have so far failed to find any large patches of water-ice on 67P’s surface. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the Rosetta orbiter at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Instead of imaging a bright, ice-covered comet, the probe’s instruments have detected that 67P is in fact darker than charcoal . ‘We're a bit surprised at just how unreflective the comet's surface is and how little evidence of exposed water-ice it shows,’ said Alan Stern, Alice principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado. Scientists had previously believed the comet’s surface would contain ice because it was too far away for the sun’s warmth to melt it. The lack of ice could suggest that the comet had been in close with our sun, or a different star, at some point during its journey in deep space. They also found that the 'coma' - or atmosphere - around the comet contains of hydrogen and oxygen. This is surprising as comas are generally thought to be composed of water vapour and dust. Alice is now probing the origin, composition and workings of comet 67P to gather insights that can not be obtained by either ground-based or Earth-orbiting observation. It has more than 1,000 times the data-gathering capability of instruments flown a generation ago, yet it weighs less than 9lbs (4kg) and uses just watts of power. Rosetta has measured the temperature of the comet and determined that . its average surface temperature is about -70°C (-94°F). Although . it may seem cold, that is actually 20 to 30°C (36 to 54°F) warmer than . predicted for a comet at that distance, suggesting its surface will be . quite dusty in addition to being icy. 'This . result is very interesting, since it gives us the first clues on the . composition and physical properties of the comet’s surface,' says Virtis . principal investigator Fabrizio Capaccioni from Rome, Italy. This suggests that much of the surface must be dusty, because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice. The instrument is one of two full instruments on board Rosetta that are funded by Nasa. The agency also provided portions of two other instrument suites. Another U.S. contribution aboard the spacecraft is the Microwave Instrument for Rosetta Orbiter (Miro) Miro is designed to provide data on how gas and dust leave the surface of the nucleus to form the coma and tail that gives comets their intrinsic beauty. Described as ‘the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever’, Rosetta will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on Earth. The comet itself is about 2.5 miles (4km) long and orbits the sun every six-and-a-half years. It is heading towards the sun, so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more. Zoom in on the image below to find out where Rosetta is at the moment . Five sites were identified on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the Landing Site Selection Group meeting held 23–24 August. The approximate locations of the five regions are marked on these OSIRIS narrow-angle camera images taken on 16 August from a distance of about 62 miles (100km) For a sense of scale, the comet is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings. In November, Rosetta will be the first spacecraft to send a probe, dubbed Philae, to explore the comet’s surface. The target drop zone for a landing on a comet in deep space will be unveiled on 15 September after weeks of analysis to find the perfect location. Throughout this year, astronomers have been monitoring the comet using ground-based telescopes, and they will continue to follow the comet on its orbit around the sun until the end of 2015. Until November, 67P is only visible from the southern hemisphere, and it is currently in a patch of the sky where it is camouflaged against the crowded star fields of the Milky Way. Taken on the 14th August, this image was taken from a distance of about 62 miles (100km) from the comet . This image of comet 67P was taken with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope on 11 August. The central pixel includes Rosetta, now orbiting comet 67P, but too small to be shown in the image . At more than 500 million km from the sun, the comet is still very faint, so only visible to large professional telescopes, including the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, or VLT, in Chile. Images of the comet are taken every two nights on average. These are quick snapshot images taken by ESO staff to monitor the comet’s activity, by measuring how its brightness changes over time. The latest image reveals the comet is now clearly active, with a dusty coma extending at least 19,000 km from the comet. ‘Its brightness remains in line with predictions based on ground-based data from previous orbits of 67P/C-G, reassuring us that the comet should continue to behave according to our expectations up to the Philae landing and beyond,’ Esa said in a blog. This . 3D image of comet 67P can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with . red–green/blue filters.

The water-propelled device allows people to fly up to 16ft (5 metres) above the surface of the water at speeds of up to 16mph (25 km/h), as well as perform tricks including somersaults and spins. The board’s agility has been demonstrated by popular YouTuber Devin Supertramp and his friends in Mexico. It is attached to a hose and propelled by a powerful jet of water. The 59 ft (18 metre) hose is attached to a ‘personal water craft’, such as a speed boat, which has between 180 and 300 horsepower. The hoverboard has one rider and can be used solo, but relies on a motor boat driver following the Hoverboard’s lead, unless a special attachment is used. There are no height restrictions for riders, although the French company notes that people weighing more than 17 stone (110kg) may not get the full effect of the device. A hoverboard like the fictional one used by Marty McFly in Back To The Future II (pictured) does not need water propulsion. The aquatic equivalent, from French jet ski champion Franky Zapata, is set to launch this summer and can be pre-ordered for $2,675 (£1,577) The company that makes it describes the Hoverboard as 'a new innovative extreme discipline that will make you experience new sensations'. A flyboard is pictured on the right-hand side of this photograph . It can be used in a lake or at sea, but the water must be over 13 ft (4 metres) deep. Riders need at least one hour of professional training to get to grips with the controls of the Hoverboard, and ensure they are safe on it. The device is related to the company’s Flyboard, which lets riders ‘fly’ through the air by strapping a small board with two water nozzles attached to their feet. The Hoverboard is set to go on sale this summer - a year before Marty McFly was said to have used his in Back To The Future Part 2. It can be pre-ordered for $2,675 (£1,577) Cnet reported. Riders need at least one hour of professional training to get to grips with the controls of the Hoverboard, and ensure they are safe on it - and considerably more practice to pull stunts like this . To provide propulsion for the board, a 59 ft (18 metre) hose is attached to a 'personal water craft', such as a speed boat, which has between 180 and 300 horsepower . Researchers have taken a step closer in the quest to develop a hoverboard that does not rely on water, by levitating objects in 3D using sound waves. While scientists have previously managed to suspend objects in mid-air using what's called acoustic levitation, a team of Japanese engineers have managed to move objects around space in various directions. Bubbles, a screw and a tiny piece of wood have so far been manoeuvred like a hoverboard, but the objects must be inside a complex set-up of four arrays of speakers to be able to fly. The machine, which was created by engineers at the University of Tokyo and the Nagoya Institute of Technology, uses ultrasonic speakers to generate sound waves that cross over. According to the researchers, this intersection creates 'a moveable ultrasonic focal point,' or a cross-over of high frequency noise greater than 20kHz, which is at the upper limit of human hearing. Standing waves - waves that remain in a constant position - provide a suspending force so the focal point can be moved up, down and from side-to-side, in order to support a small floating object such as a screw that is trapped in the standing waves. While scientists have previously managed to suspend objects in mid-air using acoustic levitation, a team of Japanese engineers have proved they can move objects around at will through three dimensional space using a refinement of the technology .","The board was invented by French jet ski champion Franky Zapata .

"Invading country after country at lightning speed, Hitler's army had Europe terrified during World War Two. But, as a Nazi soldier's letter has revealed, it wasn't just the Fuhrer's fiery rhetoric which had his troops wired. Military doctors were handing out millions of pills to the troops known as Pervitin. The label claimed it was an 'alertness . aid' which should be taken 'to maintain wakefulness'. We know it today . as methamphetamine, or more commonly, crystal meth. High Hitler: Nazi troops, pictured in occupied France, were given an 'aid' to keep them alert which was actually crystal meth . Powerful: German troops popped pills of Pervitin - a drug which we know today as crystal meth . More than 200million pills were dolled out to the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe between 1939 and 1945. German soldiers nicknamed it 'Panzerschokolade' - meaning 'tank chocolate'. Junkies: Even Hitler himself took intravenous methamphetamine . In Britain, newspapers reported how . the enemy was using a 'miracle pill.' Even Hitler himself was given . intravenous methamphetamine by his physician Theodor Morell. But the reality for many Nazi soldiers and pilots was the nightmare of an horrific drug addiction. Although the stimulant allowed soldiers to maintain long periods of activity, the side-effects were serious. They included dizziness, sweats, depression and hallucinations. There . were soldiers who died of heart failure and others who shot themselves . during psychotic phases. In light of this, some doctors remained uneasy . about giving out the drug. Even Leonardo Conti, the Third Reich's top health official, wanted to limit its use, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In May 1940, a young soldier named Heinrich Böll wrote a letter from the frontline back to his family complaining that he was exhausted by the war. He said he had become 'cold and apathetic, completely without interests'. He asked his family 'Perhaps you could obtain some more Pervitin for my supplies?' Böll explained that just one pill was as effective for staying alert as litres of strong coffee. Better still, the drug seemed to make all his worries disappear and, for a few hours at least, he was happy. Böll would later go on to become one of Germany's most famous postwar writers and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972. Millions of Pervitin pills were handed out to Nazi troops to help them maintain 'wakefulness' The Nazis also experimented with a number of other drugs which have remain popular among recreational users today. Research by the German Doctors' Association also showed they . developed a cocaine-based stimulant for its front-line fighters that was . tested on concentration camp inmates. Germany literary great Heinrich Böll wrote to his family about his need for more supplies of Pervitin during the war . 'It was Hitler's last secret weapon to win a war he had already lost . long ago,' said criminologist Wolf Kemper, author of a German language . book on the Third Reich's use of drugs called Nazis On Speed. The drug, codenamed D-IX, was tested at the Sachsenhausen concentration . camp north of Berlin, where prisoners loaded with 45lb packs were . reported to have marched 70 miles without rest. The plan was to give all soldiers in the crumbling Reich the wonder . drug - but the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, coupled with crippling . Allied bombing, scotched the scheme. 'The Blitzkrieg was . fuelled by speed,' said a pharmacologist. 'The idea was to turn ordinary . soldiers, sailors and airmen into automatons capable of superhuman . performance.' Otto Ranke, a military doctor and director of the Institute for . General and Defence Physiology at Berlin's Academy of Military Medicine, . was behind the Pervitin scheme. He found that the drug gave users heightened self-confidence and self-awareness. On . the eastern front, where the fighting was the most savage of the war, . soldiers used it in massive quantities against an enemy that showed no . mercy. In January 1942, one group of 500 troops surrounded by . the Red Army were attempting to escape in temperatures of minus 30 . Degrees C. 'I decided to give them Pervitin as they began to lie down in the snow wanting to die,' wrote the medical officer for the unit. 'After . half an hour the men began spontaneously reporting that they felt . better. 'They began marching in orderly fashion again, their spirits . improved, and they became more alert.' Methamphetamine is a highly-addictive, powerful form of the drug speed. In its crystalline form it is known as crystal meth. It is usually smocked in a pipe, in the same way as crack cocaine, but can also be eaten, snorted or injected. The drug as stimulant and induces a feeling of prolonged euphoria which can last for hours. Other effects include increased alertness, excessive sweating and loss of appetite. It is an illegal class A drug. The maximum penalty for possession is seven years in prison but for supply it can be life. As well as crystal meth, Nazi scientists took a keen interest in a number of other drugs which have since become popular recreational substances. An experimental drug codenamed D-IX was based around cocaine and was found to give soldiers increased levels of endurance. Nazi doctors hoped to mass produce the drug and hand it out to troops in 1944 but the war ended before they could execute the plan. Research has also suggested that they experimented with the hallucinogenic LSD as a form of mind control. Nazi scientists believed it could be used to enhance memory, control behaviour and help with interrogations. Until recently, it was also believed that the German pharmaceutical company Merck developed ecstasy to suppress the appetites of soldiers in World War One. But in 2006 the company trawled through its archives and claimed records showed it was synthesized by scientist Anton Köllisch in an effort to develop a medicine to prevent blood clots.","Millions of pills labelled Pervitin dolled out to troops during war .

"A Brazilian mathematician claims it is possible to predict the results of a lottery draw by applying  complicated maths and probability theories. Renato Gianella has found it is entirely possible to predict numbers which are more likely to appear than others, by following the same behaviour patterns as predicted by the Law of Large Numbers. His study called The Geometry of Chance: Lotto Numbers Follow a Predicted Pattern, finds not all combinations of numbers have the same probability of occurring – so in short, it is possible to predict patterns of numbers with a greater chance of being drawn. The mathematician behind the study has created a website which uses colour patterns to show number combinations which are more likely to win the lottery based on previous draws in 20 lotteries from around the world - but you may need more than GCSE maths to decipher the code . The study claims that there is a pattern which is applicable in all lotteries around the world, which can be worked out using a complicated coloured template. Mr Gianella said ‘Lottery should no longer be seeing as a form of a gambling but a true representation of the probabilistic theory and the Law of Large Numbers.’ It isn’t however as simple as being able to pick the six most likely numbers to win the National Lottery, it is however possible to pick several combinations of numbers which are more likely to be drawn based on probability. The mathematician has a website www.lotorainbow.com.br/en/default.asp which allows people to view the likelihood of different numbers being drawn in 20 different lotteries around the world - but readers may need a maths degree themselves to understand it. The maths behind the theory is based on previous draws and patterns which arise from them – previous draws dictate the future probability of certain number being drawn. Combinations of certain numbers are more likely to win than others according to probability. In short not all combinations of numbers have an equal chance of being drawn - but it is still highly difficult to predict actual winning combinations . If you toss a coin you have a one in two chance of getting a head but you might not get one at all. If you toss the coin many times you’re going to move more towards a 50/50 split of heads or tails (i.e. it’ll look more like the probability you’ve been given). Combinations of certain numbers are more likely to win than others. So it’s about looking at the choices you’ve made as a whole rather than the individual numbers. Rather than saying there are 12.271.512 different possible combinations Gianella reduced it to 210 coloured templates, which represent all combinations. He’s then worked out the likelihood of getting each of these combinations. For example, If someone were to  choose all low numbers (in the 1-9 range) they have a 0.0007%  chance of their template coming up as there’s only 84 combinations of using these numbers. But if they were to choose one across all the different colours (with two purples) they have a 2.6403% chance of their template coming up as there’s 324,000 different combinations that use these numbers. The study says: ‘The frequentist notion states that the probability of a given event relates to the frequency at which such event is repeated. Additionally, as predicted by the Law of Large Numbers, when an event is repeated many times, the average of the results from all events should be close to the expected result. Thus, games of all kinds in which many repetitions occur (such as lotteries) are ideal labs for the study of probabilities. Now a new study shows that not all combinations of numbers have the same probability of occurring in a lottery draw. ‘The study is based on mathematics and probabilities theories applied to lottery drawings. It adopts a coloured template that determines all the possible combinations of numbers, as established by Pascal's rule. The adoption of this coloured template provides an easier understanding, and correct identification, of the combinations of numbers with highest probabilities to win. Through experimentation, the method shows that it is possible to detect that the results of a lottery draw follow the same behaviour pattern as predicted by the Law of Large Numbers. ‘For instance, using the method proposed by Gianella, templates built on previous results from a number of lottery games in different countries show that as more draws are performed, the expected result of each template is closer to the observed result, indicating that a pattern for these combinations exists. Thus, the right choice of combinations can greatly increase your chances of picking the winning combination in your next lottery ticket. ‘The method was tested with more than 20 lottery draws all over the world, and in each case it demonstrates that the probability that a given group of combinations (defined according to the coloured template adopted) will occur is not the same for all groups of combinations and that there are groups that show a higher probability to win.’","Renato Gianella says it is possible to predict winning lottery numbers .

Dr Matt Taylor spoke about the European Space Agency's mission to land a robot on a comet for the first time in history, while dressed in a colourful bowling shirt featuring scantily clad women. Soon afterwards, #shirtgate and slightly more humorous #shirtstorm, began trending on Twitter in response to the London-born father-of-two. Scroll down for video . Apology: Dr Matt Taylor appeared close to tears and was visibly upset he apologised for his choice of shirt following a furious online response . Today, during a Rosetta project briefing on the European Space Agency's YouTube channel, a visibly upset Dr Taylor addressed the internet furore and said sorry. 'I made a big mistake,' the 40-year-old, who has a PhD in space plasma physics from Imperial College London said. 'And I have offended many people. I'm very sorry about this.' Even before the landing, the Rosetta Project scientist caused a stir on the social network because of his unorthodox appearance, involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet, which he got in January. However, the 40-year-old's choice of a shirt covered in women in PVC and lingerie broke the online science network in ways Kim Kardashian's bare bottom could only dream of. Many vented their anger on Twitter, claiming that Dr Taylor's choice of shirt was sexist and particularly inappropriate as science is a field long dominated by men.

Hot comet: During an interview about the landing, Dr Taylor branded the comet landing 'the sexiest mission there’s ever been' #shirtgate: Dr Matt Taylor, Rosetta Project Scientist, has caused a stir on Twitter because of his dress sense . Both men and women blasted Dr Taylor, accusing him of not caring about women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). 'I don't care what scientists wear. But a shirt featuring women in lingerie isn't appropriate for a broadcast if you care about women in STEM,' astrophysicist Katie Mack tweeted. She later added in response to a fellow tweeter; 'You think a shirt like this makes women feel welcome? I don't.' 'The fact that a scientist of any gender, but especially a man, would think it's a good idea to wear a shirt covered in naked women while representing a major space agency and a significant research project is appalling; and clearly, he had no idea that he was engaging in exactly the kind of casual sexism that drives women away from STEM, writer Susan  Smith pointed out on XOJane. During an interview about the landing, Dr Taylor had branded the comet landing 'the sexiest mission there’s ever been. 'She’s sexy, but I never said she was easy.' Before the emergence of #shirtgate, Dr Taylor, a father-of-two and the son of a brick layer, praised on Twitter for being 'a proper cool scientist' and 'definitely not boring'. One Twitter user wrote: 'Dr Matt Taylor is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt, sleeve tattoos. Rad,' while another said: 'Matt Taylor causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning.' The father-of-two from Manor Park in north east London now lives in the Netherlands with his wife Leanne and children Lily, 13 and Harry, 11. Dr Taylor studied at the University of Liverpool and Imperial College London, winning a PhD in space plasma physics . He has worked at the European Space Agency since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013. The role was a real change from his previous job, which was studying the physics of the northern lights, The Guardian reported. On Wednesday's ESA's Rosetta probe released its Philae lander to attempt the first ever landing of a spacecraft on the surface of a comet. The separation was confirmed at 9.03am GMT, with pictures of Philae approaching the comet expected throughout the day before it lands on the surface at 3.30pm GMT. But the success of the mission now hangs in the balance after a thruster on Philae was found to be faulty. Mission controllers say there is a 50 per cent chance the cold thruster positioned on top of the lander will work, and without it, Philae will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet. The cold thruster was designed to push Philae closer to the comet. The scientist is so positive that the mission to land on the comet will be successful that he has already had the moment permanently etched on his body (pictured) To convince his new team of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. This video shows the creation of the tattoo . Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles (30 km) away from 67P .","British scientist Dr Matt Taylor is the Rosetta Project Scientist .

"David Cameron today urged European leaders to ‘be good to their word’ and stop funding ISIS fanatics by paying ransoms. The Prime Minister said ‘tens of millions of dollars’ had been paid to extremists in Iraq and Syria. He said this was helping to promote terror against Britain. Mr Cameron told MPs France, Germany and other countries in the G7 group of wealthy countries had pledged not to pay ransoms at a summit in Northern Ireland last year. But the PM indicated they were not sticking to this agreement. David Cameron, speaking during Prime Minister's Questions today, said ransoms were directly funding ISIS . The Prime Minister’s remarks, in the House of Commons this afternoon, come after ISIS extremists threatened to murder a British hostage after releasing a video of themselves beheading two American journalists. The Briton’s capture emerged in a propaganda video titled 'A Second Message to America', in which US journalist Steven Sotloff is murdered by an ISIS executioner who speaks with a British accent. The murderer is believed to be the same man who beheaded James Foley two weeks ago. Former Lib Dem leader Sir Ming Campbell asked the Prime Minister today whether those who were paying ransoms were aware that the cash was being used ‘to advance the malevolent objectives of terrorism’. The Prime Minister said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that the many tens of millions of dollars that ISIL has raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism, including terrorism affecting our own country. ‘At the G8, I launched an initiative to try to get other countries to sign up to a very clear doctrine that in the case of terrorist kidnap, no ransom should be paid. Britain continues with this policy; America continues with this policy; but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure that other countries are good to their word.’ Mr Cameron’s remarks are a barely-veiled rebuke to France, Germany and Italy who are known to pay ransoms. The Prime Minister last month faced calls to confront the French President Francois Hollande over claims the country is funding ISIS terrorists by paying ransoms to free hostages. Mr Cameron's remarks today are a thinly-veiled rebuke to European leaders, including Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel, to stop authorising ransoms to terrorists . Britain and the United States refuse to negotiate with terrorists in an effort not to encourage further hostage taking. But this policy is being undermined by European countries negotiating secret deals to free their citizens. Over the last five years ISIS is thought to have earned £75million ransoming more than 50 captives. Kidnapping Europeans has become the main source of revenue for Al Qaeda and its spin off. Four French and three Spanish hostages have been released this year after money was delivered through an intermediary. Fears have been raised that European countries’ policy of secretly negotiating with terrorists is undermining the West’s response to the growing threat from ISIS. Tory MP Andrew Rosindall, who sits on the respected Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘If they are paying ransoms they are harming the interests of the free world and by playing the game of terrorism by paying ransom money they are funding and furthering the cause of ISIS and Al Qaeda. ‘The French and the Spanish should really look at themselves in the mirror and ask whether this is the right thing to do.’ ‘The Prime Minister should be raising this with President Hollande. The French are undermining all of us by doing this.’ A Foreign Office source told MailOnline it was a concern for the Government. ‘It is definitely an issue,’ the source said. ‘All you can do is emphasise what we do and why we think it is right. A lot of countries won’t talk about it. Some countries will say one thing and another thing happens.’ James Foley (left) and Steven Sotloff (right) were murdered by ISIS fanatics thought to be operating in Syria . But a former senior Cabinet minister told MailOnline that there was no point ‘tweaking the French tail’ because the UK would not get anywhere. He added: ‘They don’t admit it. It comes out through what other people say. When you see a French President on the tarmac greeting a freed hostage you can be fairly sure they paid.’ Militants are now thought to hold more than 20 captives, mostly aid workers, journalists and photographers who they are ransoming in order to raise funds.","PM said 'tens of millions of dollars' had been paid to Islamist terrorists .

"Andrew Latham suffers from a syndrome that stops his brain from suppressing shock, causing his whole body to tense up . A father suffers from a rare neurological disorder which means he is literally scared stiff. Andrew Latham has hyperekplexia, a neurological syndrome that stops his brain from suppressing shock. As a result, his whole body tenses whenever he hears fireworks, dogs barking, or even someone coughing. Mr Latham, 38, has suffered with the condition since birth. It also meant he was subjected to vile bullying at school - with classmates constantly making noises to make him jump. He said: 'Dogs barking, people coughing, fireworks - basically anything unexpected - startles me and makes me jump.' He must also be extra careful when going about his day-to-day errands, as even crossing the road can be a danger if he's startled by the sound of an engine or beeping horn. Despite this, he continues to support his local football team, Accrington Stanley, and can deal with the raucous noise in the stands. 'But when I'm watching the football I will stand there like anybody else. For some reason, when I'm watching the football, I will stand there like anyone else.' Mr Latham's parents, Janice and Chris, said they knew something was wrong before their son was born. His mother explained: 'When I was about seven months' pregnant I noticed in the womb that he just felt stiff. 'When he was born, he would jump every time we tapped his incubator.' 'Them when he started at school,  the children picked up that he jumped whenever the door shut in class. So then, as kids are, they would deliberately make noises whenever he was near. He was very unhappy.' Doctors, however, remained baffled as to what was causing Mr Latham to be so jumpy. His father said: 'We were seen by experts and psychologists. They really couldn't pinpoint what it was. 'First they said it was cerebral palsy, but they ruled that out and then said it was a muscle problem.' Mr Latham's condition, hyperekplexia, stops his brain from suppressing shock. It means that everyday noises such as a dog barking or someone coughing are particularly alarming for him . His mother Janice said: 'When he was born, he would jump every time we tapped his incubator' It wasn't until Mr Latham was 21 that he was finally diagnosed with hyperekplexia - a result of an abnormality in a particular gene in the brain. His neurologist, Professor Kailash Bhatia of University College London Hospitals, explained: 'There are certain chemicals that are important for inhibition of the nervous system. Hyperekplexia is a rare hereditary, neurological disorder that stops the brain from suppressing shock. People with this disorder have an excessive startle reaction (eye blinking or body spasms) to sudden unexpected noise, movement, or touch. Symptoms include extreme muscle tension  that prevents voluntary movement. This means the affected person can fall stiffly - like a log - without loss of consciousness. Exaggeration of reflexes and an unstable manner of walking may also occur. 'When these chemicals are not present the brain is more responsive - it becomes more excitable. 'Therefore he would not be able to suppress noise that the rest of us could.' However Mr Latham's case is unique, because as well as the 'jump' reflex, he also has skeletal deformities, slurred speech and movement problems. Unfortunately there is no cure but medics have been able to control the condition with medication. Today he lives with wife, Lynne, and son, Sam, in Accrington, Lancashire. His wife said: 'When I first started going out with Andrew he used to carry a little fact sheet in his pocket about his condition so he could explain it. 'I just remember saying that, at the end of the day, he was just Andrew to me. When we married it was really the best day of my life.' Six years later they had their son, Sam, who has not inherited his father's condition despite the risk being 50 per cent. Mr Latham said: 'Watching my own son being born was incredible. It was the best experience I could ever have asked for.' He is now positive about the future and is now undergoing tests in the hope that medics will be able to help others in his situation. He said: 'I wish there was just a lot more awareness for the general public to realise what I go through every day.' Mr Latham's story appears in a new series of Body Bizarre, Thursday September 25, 9pm on TLC.","Andrew Latham, 38, from Lancashire, has condition called hyperekplexia .

"American entrepreneur Jim Clark has seen his hard work and innovative ideas in the world of computer technology pay off big time, to the tune of $1.4 billion, and now he has set his sights on the sea - with a yacht. The Texas born Clark, a co-founder of Netscape, has just launched Comanche, a super-fast super yacht that took a year to build at cost millions of dollars. The 100-foot long cutting edge vessel is sleek, stylish and, according to CNN, can reach a top speed of around 40mph. Scroll down for video . Thing of beauty: Comanche is a 100-foot super yacht that took a year to build and had its maiden voyage in Newport, Rhode Island (above) earlier this month . Fast: The sleek and stylish vessel can reach a top speed of 40mph . Boating enthusiasts: Owner Jim Clark and wife Kristy Hinze (at their 2009 wedding on left and in Sydney this past May on right) are big racing fans . It is an investment that is well worth it for Clark if the yacht does what many believe it will do, and breaks a series of offshore racing marks. That being said, it does seem like an odd hobby for a man who grew up in Plainview, Texas, far from any coastline. 'People spend money on sports and I just don't do golf, I hate it,' said the 70-year-old. 'But I love sailing and the technology aspect.' He became interested in sailing while in the Navy, and bought his first boat in the late 1980s. Video courtesy of Onne van der Wal  and Hodgdon Yachts . Not cheap: The boat also cost  millions to build . Maiden voyage: The yacht's first race is expected to be the Sydney-Hobart in Australia this December . Good crew: The yacht's skipper is Ken Read, the celebrated American sailor who grew up in Newport . Now, with Comanche, he wants 'to be a record breaker.' He already plans on selling the boat in two years, and in that time has high hopes of not just winning events such as Transatlantic, Transpac, Fastnet, and Middle Sea, but breaking records as he takes the top spot. It had its maiden voyage off Newport, Rhode Island, on October 13, which was photographed by George Bekris, but Comanche's first race will be the Sydney-Hobart in Australia this December, one that is a particular favorite for Clark and his Australian wife, Kristy Hinze. Busy schedule: The boat is also expected to compete in events including Transatlantic, Transpac, Fastnet, and Middle Sea . Not competing: 70-year-old Clark has said that he will not be on board for some of the more competitive races . In his place: His much younger wife Hinze, who is 35, will likely be part of the crew in Sydney . That being said, the Sydney-Hobart is also one of the most difficult and competitive races of the year, and will be a true test for Comanche and its 21 person crew led by skipper Ken Read, the very accomplished and celebrated 53-year-old sailor who grew up in Newport. The 1998 race featured a freak storm that ultimately left six people dead. 'We want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records,' said Read. 'But to do that the conditions have to be right. You can have the greatest thing since sliced bread but you won't go record breaking if the weather's not right. But if we get into the record books -- and we believe we will - then it's job done.' Priorities: Read has said of breaking records with Comanche, 'We want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records' Tough start: The boat's first race, Sydney-Hobart, is considered one of the most competitive and had one of the most difficult courses . Late start: Read did not even buy his first sailboat until the late 1980s . And while Clark may be too old to be on board for some of the more competitive races, his 35-year-old wife seems more than ready, starting on December 26 in Sydney. 'My wife's an Australian and a very competitive lady and she wants to sail in Sydney-Hobart,' said Clark. 'I say ""we have the boat, do as you wish."" I'll let her run the show.'","Jim Clark, the billionaire founder of Netscape, has just launched a new super yacht, Comanche .

"Their faces and torsos smeared with dirt, a handful of Shiite Muslims crawl along desert sand under the watchful nose of their superior's rifles. It is one of many gruelling drills they will endure after joining the Iraqi Army in its fight against bloodthirsty ISIS fanatics wreaking terror across the country. In the Najaf desert south of Baghdad, one group of volunteers were seen jumping through pits of fire and hurling themselves from sand dunes as part of the training. Scroll down for video . A group of Shiite men crawl through sand in the Najaf desert, south of Baghdad, after joining the Iraqi Military . The men are among hundreds who  joined the military after clerics pleaded for worshippers to volunteer . The men are among hundreds to have signed up to the military after answering a plea from Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric last year. In June, grand ayatollah Ali al-Sistani pleaded with youngsters to volunteer their services in the wake of crippling attacks against the religion by ISIS fighters. Hundreds flocked to military centres across Baghdad, with Iraqi Army officials confident the boost in soldiers would help regain crucial swathes of territory. Since then extremists have faced increased opposition, fighting off Kurdish militias as well as the the army all the while under the threat of airstrike by US and UK led coalitions. Over the weekend 26 strikes were carried out across Iraq and eight in Syria by US forces as part of the ongoing campaign. Mosul, the country's second largest city and an ISIS stronghold, is primed for retaking, it was claimed earlier this week, with residents exasperated with life under the rule of fanatics. According to the former mayor of the neighbouring town of Tel Afar, civilians are 'ready' to join the Iraqi Army in its campaign to take back control of the city. ISIS militants are thought to control around a third of Iraq despite a sustained campaign of airstrikes against fanatics . The Shiite men join hundreds on the front line battling against fanatics, with Kurdish forces in the north also waging war against ISIS militants . Last year Iraqi Army officials said an increase in the number of men signing up to the army would help the country in its fight against terror . In Sinjar, one of the most heated patches of conflict, Kurdish forces fought off extremists' unrelenting gunfire and strikes after months of battle. The town's Yazidi population was all but obliterated last year in a humanitarian crisis which prompted UN intervention. While IS fighters have been driven out of the region, Kurdish troops remain under the threat of sniper fire, experts have warned. In Syria however, militiamen and women were filmed celebrating after defeating ISIS militants in the fight for Kobane. Fighters speaking on behalf of extremists admitted they had been overpowered by Kurdish forces following months of bloodshed. It is the latest in a string of blows to the fanatical regime which has also murdered Western and Japanese journalists and aid workers in the past year. ISIS has lost control of crucial swathes of territory including Kobane in Syria.

"Radical preacher: Anjem Choudary was one of nine men arrested by officers in London this morning . Britain's most notorious Islamist hate preacher was arrested yesterday in a huge police operation. Anjem Choudary, 47, was one of nine men held in a series of co-ordinated dawn raids by counter-terrorist police. The show of force targeted the leadership of radical organisation Al-Muhajiroun, which he founded almost 20 years ago, and was later banned. The arrests came on the eve of the first British air strikes on Islamic extremists waging war in Iraq and Syria. Many of those held across London yesterday have been vocal cheerleaders of the bloodshed in the Middle East. They included Choudary’s close friend, Trevor Brooks, who recently joined a wave of gloating by Islamists on social networks over the murders of hostages at the hands of the British terrorist known as Jihadi John. Experts expressed amazement that it had taken so long for police to take action against the outspoken firebrand preacher. But the operation was launched only after careful consideration of Choudary’s recent public comments against the backdrop of a lifetime of incitement. Sources said the lawyer turned preacher and his followers had become considerably ‘more brazen’ since the explosion of violence in Iraq. Choudary has stepped up his online rhetoric, bombarding his  followers with rabble-rousing messages and handing out leaflets in Oxford Street. Scotland Yard said it arrested nine men, aged between 22 and 51, in raids across the capital, and on a property in Stoke. Officers searched 18 addresses across London, including two Tower Hamlets sweet shops run by Choudary’s brother Yazdani. They have seized numerous phones, laptops and desktop computers which have been passed to forensic experts for analysis. Scroll down for video . Being held: Muslim activist Abu Izzadeen - born Trevor Brooks - is also among the men arrested . Investigation: The scene of a Metropolitan Police raid on commercial property this morning in east London . Serached: This Yummy Yummy sweets shop in Whitechapel, east London, was visited by police today in connection with the arrests made by the counter-terror police . All the men were held on suspicion of being a member of, or backing a banned terrorist group and supporting terrorism. The alleged offences, which come under two counter- terrorism acts, carry a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment. Choudary was arrested at an unknown location after fleeing his home two weeks ago in the middle of the night in the wake of threats from far-Right groups. Just hours before he was held, he posted a burst of nine inflammatory messages on Twitter, branding the US bombing raids as a ‘rallying call for Muslims’ and labelling the actions of Western governments in Muslim countries as ‘terrorism’. As recently as last weekend, Choudary made inflammatory remarks about British aid worker Alan Henning, who is being held hostage in Syria. He blamed the British Government for Mr Henning’s fate because of its ‘complicity in torture and rendition’ and said he would never feel sympathy for the 47-year-old. He said: ‘In the Koran it is not allowed for you to feel sorry for non-Muslims. I don’t feel sorry for him.’ Choudary also said the Islamic State was building the sort of society he would ‘love to live in’ with his family. But the father of four, who has spent years living off state benefits, said he would not leave Britain because he was born here. Comments: Choudary's arrest came shortly after he posted a series of nine tweets at about 5am today with an anti-Western tone, referring to the ongoing crisis involving ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria . Map: Anjem Choudary's house is located in Wathamstow, east London. A local resident said the preacher and his family moved out about a week ago. The Yummy Yummy sweets shop in Whitechapel, east London, was visited by police today . His right-hand man Brooks, a former acolyte of Omar Bakri Mohammed and Abu Hamza, was also quietly arrested yesterday. Neighbours said Brooks, 39, now known as Abu Izzadeen, was driven away by plain-clothes detectives. Brooks has revelled in the bloodshed in Syria, taunting Prime Minister David Cameron within minutes of the latest video showing the murder of David Haines. Others held by police included Mizanur Rahman, 31, an online extremist preacher and key lieutenant of Choudary. The former East London web designer boasts of being a student of Omar Bakri and runs a prominent website dedicated to broadcasting his vile views under the name Abu Baraa. Another suspect to be questioned was Abdul Muhid, 32, who was recently seen canvassing students outside the London School of Economics, and has been described as a ‘stalwart’ of Al-Muhajiroun. Choudary has been an inspirational figure for a generation of Muslim extremists, including the fanatics behind the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich. He led Al- Muhajiroun, which was repeatedly rebranded in a bid to evade attempts to proscribe its activities. Members gathered under a series of names including al-Ghuraba, Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades, but their Islamist mission has always remained the same. Campaigners welcomed the arrests but said they should have been made sooner. Nick Lowles, of Hope Not Hate, said: ‘For over a year, since our own extensive investigations into Anjem Choudary and his disciples, we’ve been saying that more must be done to curb this hate-supporting and recruiting organisation. Arrested: Choudary, 47, is pictured outside the Regent's Park Mosque in north-west London in July 2013 . Metropolitan Police: Scotland Yard said nine men were arrested by counter terror police in London today on suspicion of being members of a banned organisation and encouraging terrorism . Choudary: He has vowed to recruit in prison . By Vanessa Allen . Seen as a recruiting sergeant for Britain’s radical Muslims, Anjem Choudary has played a cynical cat-and-mouse game with British authorities. But the self-styled ‘sheikh’ has been careful to keep his incendiary speeches on the right side of Britain’s hate law. His comments that Woolwich murder victim Fusilier Lee Rigby would ‘burn in hellfire’ and calls for an anti-war march through Wootton Bassett, the Wiltshire town that honoured  soldiers who died in Afghanistan, were repugnant, but deemed not to have crossed the threshold for criminal prosecution. His network of supporters, the banned group Al-Muhajiroun, has been the focus of attention for the authorities, yet Choudary has never faced any serious prosecutions. Worryingly, he has warned that jailing him will give him access to a new, captive congregation to radicalise inside prison. Speaking after a Home Office banning order, the preacher said: ‘If they arrest me and put me in prison, I will carry on in prison. I’ll radicalise everyone in prison.’ Choudary, a trained solicitor, has been immersed in radical Islamism since the 1990s when he and firebrand cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed formed Al-Muhajiroun. The group’s supporters praised the September 11 terror atrocity and the July 7 London bombings which killed 52 innocent people in 2005. Choudary has preached that jihad,  or holy war, is an ‘obligation  upon Muslims’ – an interpretation rejected by moderate Muslim scholars – and has called for a draconian  form of Sharia law to be imposed across Britain. Public lashings for the sale of alcohol, amputations for thieves and stoning to death for adulterers would all form part of that dystopian vision. Yet Choudary himself was known as a hard-drinking womaniser with a penchant for excess while studying medicine at Southampton University. The son of a market trader from Welling, Kent, he was known as Andy and switched his studies to law after failing his first-year medical exams, before embracing extremism. Scotland Yard has continued to monitor his speeches and online comments for potential breaches of the law. Meanwhile it has simultaneously  provided him with police protection after far-Right groups threatened to attack him. Uniformed officers were stationed outside his home in East London last year after it emerged that Woolwich murderers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale had both attended Al-Muhajiroun demonstrations. Al-Muhajiroun was officially disbanded after it was banned under anti-terror legislation in 2004 but critics have argued that subsequent spin-off groups formed by Choudary espoused the same radical beliefs and aims. Choudary has called for the ‘flag of Sharia’ to fly over Downing Street and for Britain to be conquered by an Islamic country. Yet his apparent disdain for Britain has not stopped the married father of four claiming up to £25,000 a year in benefits from the British taxpayer. Radicalised at 17: Abu Izzadeen . Radicalised when he was 17, fanatic Abu Izzadeen came to notoriety during hate-filled speeches outside Regent’s Park mosque. The British extremist - born Trevor Brooks - said soldiers were ‘crusaders’ who would rape and murder Iraqi women and children. The married father of three urged a boycott of the Poppy Appeal, claiming anyone who wore a poppy to mark Remembrance Day ‘supported the  murder of Muslims’. Izzadeen, 39, who once called the July 7 London suicide bombers ‘praise- worthy’, was born to a respectable Jamaican family in Hackney, East London, but shed his Christian identity on the eve of his 18th birthday. He was said to have been radicalised by Syrian cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and hate preacher Abu Hamza at Finsbury Park mosque and joined Anjem Choudary’s Al-Muhajiroun. The former electrician and fluent Arabic speaker spent more than a decade preaching and calling for Britain to become an Islamic state and travelled in Pakistan before the September 11 attacks, as part of Al-Muhajiroun. In 2006, Izzadeen told then home secretary John Reid he was an ‘enemy of Islam’ after the minister asked Muslims to step in if they thought children were being radicalised. In an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he denounced then prime minister Tony Blair as a ‘murderer’. During an address to his supporters, he was filmed as he said Muslims who joined the Army should face the death penalty under Sharia law, saying their heads should be ‘removed’. Like Choudary, he has lived off the state, claiming up to £1,000 a month in benefits while living in a council house in Leyton, East London. He joined Muslims Against Crusades, which burnt a poppy on Remembrance Sunday in 2010 and whose supporters targeted a forces’ homecoming parade in Luton. Protests by the group and its offshoots featured chants such as ‘British soldiers burn in hell’ and banners including ‘Hell for Heroes’. Izzadeen, who married his wife Mokhtaria in 1998, when he was 23, advertised on the internet for three more wives and said he wanted ‘more than nine children’. The radical described himself as ‘the life and soul of the party’ in the ad on a Muslim dating site and described his personality as ‘passionate, bold, protective, witty and sensitive’.

Dedicated: Maxime stands by the church on top of the Katskhi Pillar looking at the beautiful view. He has lived a life of virtual solitude on top of a pillar high above his Georgian monastry for 20 years . When he wants to leave Katskhi Pillar, he spends 20 minutes getting down a 131ft ladder. Supplies are winched up to him by his followers and he only comes down twice a week to pray with his followers. But having worked as a crane operator before taking his orders in 1993, Maxime has always had a head for heights. He said: 'It is up here in the silence that you can feel God's presence.' Maxime next to his cottage on top of the Katskhi Pillar. When he wants to leave Katskhi pillar, he spends 20 minutes climbing down a 131ft ladder . His only visitors are priests and a group of troubled young men who are seeking solace in the monastry at the foot of the pillar. A photographer called Amos Chapple paid a visit to Stylite monk Maxime but was not at first allowed up onto the pillar. Instead he had to spend four days taking part in seven hours of daily prayers including a four hour stint from 2am until sunrise. When he finally was granted permission to scale the 'dicey' ladder to the top, he was worried that it might be too dark to get back down. After making it to the top, Maxime told Amos that he became a monk after a stretch in prison and decided he wanted to make a change. The monk slept in a fridge when he first moved to the top of the pillar, but now has a bed inside a cottage. The Katskhi Pillar was used by stylites, Christians who lived on top of pillars to avoid worldly temptation until the 15th century when the practice was stopped following the Ottoman invasion of Georgia.

Self-contained: The church and other buildings on top of the Katskhi Pillar (left) and the Interior of the chapel (right) For centuries the 40 metres (130ft) high pillar lay abandoned and locals could only look up at the mysterious ruins at its summit. Finally, in 1944 a group led by the mountaineer Alexander Japaridze made the first documented ascent of the pillar and discovered the remains of a chapel and the skeleton of a stylite who had perished there. Shortly after the collapse of communism, and the subsequent resurgence of religion in Georgia, Maxime decided to live atop the pillar in the way of the old stylites. He said: 'When I was young I drank, sold drugs, everything. When I ended up in prison I knew it was time for a change. 'I used to drink with friends in the hills around here and look up at this place, where land met sky. 'We knew the monks had lived up there before and I felt great respect for them'.

In 1993 Maxime took monastic vows and climbed the pillar to begin his new life. 'For the first two years there was nothing up here so I slept in an old fridge to protect me from the weather.' Since then Maxime and the Christian community in the area have constructed a ladder to the top, rebuilt the church, and built a cottage where Maxime spends his days praying, reading, and 'preparing to meet god'. As a result of the interest in the site there is now a religious community at the base of the pillar.

Men with trouble in their lives come to stay and ask for guidance from Maxime and the young priests who live at the site. The men are fed and housed on the condition they join the priests in praying for around seven hours per day, including from 2am-sunrise, and help with chores. Maxime usually climbs down from the pillar once or twice a week for night prayers and to speak with men who seek help and guidance. Speaking about his isolation, Maxime comments: 'I need the silence. It is up here in the silence that you can feel god's presence.' A sketch of Saint Simeon Stylites, the hermit of the pillar, thought to be the first member of the movement . The stylites were a group of early Christian ascetics who spent long periods of time sitting or standing on top of narrow pillars. The word comes from the Greek stylos for a column. The best known of these pillar monks was the first, St Simeon Stylites, who sat for thirty years from AD423 onwards on top of a column. The record is thought to be held by the sixth-century St Alypius, who is believed to have remained on his pillar for 67 years without a break, for the last fourteen of them lying down because his feet could no longer support him. The Katskhi pillar is a limestone monolith located in the village of Katskhi in western Georgian region of Imereti, about 10 kilometers from the mining town of Chiatura. In pagan times, before the advent of Christianity, the towering Katskhi Pillar was thought to represent a local god of fertility. With the arrival of Christianity in Georgia in the 4th century, the rock came to represent seclusion. The locals call it the Pillar of Life. At the summit of the Katskhi pillar, are the remains of a small church built between the 6th and 8th centuries. The church was probably built by the Stylites, who were early Christian ascetics who stood on top of pillars and preaching and praying. The only written record of the Katskhi pillar occur in the text of an 18th-century Georgian scholar, who noted the church for its inaccessibility. The Church of Saint Simeon Stylites is a historical building located about 30km (19 mi) northwest of Aleppo, Syria. It is the oldest surviving Byzantine church, dating back to the 5th century. St. Simeon was born in 386 AD in a village in the Amanus Mountains. Saint Simeon joined a monastery in this area, but soon decided to seek the religious life alone as a hermit monk. He relocated to the top of a pillar eventually reaching 49ft high to achieve greater seclusion. Soon the monk attracted even greater crowds who came from far and near to hear him preach twice a day. Within just a few decades (c.475), a vast martyrium was built in Simeon's honor on this site. It consisted of four basilicas radiating from the sides of a central octagon, within which was enshrined the famous column. St. Simeon's pillar can still be seen in the center of the courtyard, although it is now only a 6ft 7in high boulder due to centuries of relic-gathering by pilgrims.","Maxime, a 59-year-old monk, lives on top of Katshki Pillar in Georgia .

"Balancing 100ft above the ground these UK daredevils attempt a one of a kind high octane race. Looking to cross 60 feet between two turrets at Eastnor Castle in Hertfordshire, these daring highliners are set to appear on new ITV show Red or Black. Top British slackliners Phil Baxter, 24, from Lancashire, and red-shirt Allen Freem, 20, from South Wales, were to show off their skills in front of millions of UK viewers. Elf 'n' safety gone mad: Allen Freem walks between two turrets at Castle Eastnor for Red or Black on ITV. It is the first time slackliners have been granted access to one of Britain's most picture-perfect castles . Don't look down: Allen Freem balances as he walks along the line which is a lot more wobbly than an ordinary tightrope . Slacklines are more like trampolines than tightropes because they move around a lot as the daredevil inches across. On Red or Black competitors fighting for the £1m prize will have to guess whether Phil or Allen will be first to get across. Slackliner director, Russ Holbert, 36, from Poole, Dorset ,was approached by the show's producers to make sure they had the right people for the stunt performed in front of a live audience. 'ITV called my office because we're seen as the leading slackliners in the country,' explained Russ. Daredevil: Phil Baxter walks along the line at the castle in Ledbury. Contestants on Red or Black take it in turns to bet which of them will be first to get across the line . Terrifying: Allen Freem raises his arm above his head as he balances on his way across the wobbly slackline . Daredevils: Allen Freem, left, and Phil Baxter were approached by ITV as they are the best slackliners in Britain . 'They wanted to know about our experience and find out if this feat was even possible. 'We . started to discuss likely candidates and I decided on Phil and Allen . because they both had climbing as well as slacklining backgrounds. 'There was only going to shot at this, so we had to make sure we had people who could pull it off.' Phil has been a slackliner for four years and and Allen for three years - both are seasoned rock climbers in their own right. While . this training has given them nerves of steel and they spent two full . days practising for the stunt, nothing could have prepared them fully . for the pressure of performing at such an impressive venue - as part of a . televised competition. 'Before . the event, Allen and Phil were both saying - is this really going to . happen am I really going to step out over this massive void in front of . masses of people?' said Russ. 'Usually when they highline they're doing it for their own satisfaction. 'Suddenly . when your put in front of a massive crowd of screaming contestants . you've got that added pressure and expectation on your shoulders. 'This is on top of the discipline and concentration you need to complete this incredibly demanding stunt. 'The crowd were all jumping up and down - they couldn't believe how good it went and the realise of tension was amazing. 'Even Ant and Dec couldn't believe their eyes.' Slacklining may be new to most people - but surprisingly the sport has taken off in many parts of Britain. 'For this kind of high-lining you do need to have had years of training and a head for heights,' said Russ. 'But other types of slacklining are hugely accessible and local clubs are running across the country. 'This is the entry point to more spectacular stunts like this one. 'It's fantastic exercise with the kinds of eye-popping acrobatic moves that young people love to see and take part in.' High line: Allen Freem edges across in the ITV competition. Competitors on the ITV show try and guess how long it will take to get across .","Phil Baxter, 24, and Allen Freem, 20, will appear on Red or Black on ITV ."
"Record sales of Prince’s Charles bacon has helped to, well, save his bacon after a fall in donations to his charitable initiatives. The royal’s charitable foundation was last year gifted more than £2.8 million by supermarket Waitrose, who took over the once loss-making Duchy Originals brand two years ago and have turned it into an international success story. In 2011 their total royalties donation was just £645,000 - amounting to a staggering 348 per cent increase in just 12 months. Sales increase: A selection of Duchy Originals products which are sold at Waitrose . It also helped offset a fall in public donations to Charles’s charities, which supports organisations working to combat everything from climate change to youth unemployment, from £12.2 million in 2011 to £10.5 million last year. The donation also meant that the prince was able to invest £6.2 million in good causes, up from £4.7 million from the previous 12 months. Duchy Originals was set up by Charles in 1990 as a means of raising money for deserving causes by selling organic produce grown at his Highgrove estate. It quickly branched out, selling everything from bacon to soap, biscuits and cordials, but was hit hard by the recession and at one point saw annual losses of £3.3 million. In 2010, however, the prince did a deal . with Waitrose, giving it excusive rights to sell the Duchy range - which . has expanded to more than 260 products including a gardening and beauty . line - in return for a substantial donation to his charitable . foundation initially set at £1 million. Good causes: Prince Charles, set up Duchy Originals to raise money for charity, but the brand struggled to make a profit until the supermarket took over . Benefits for all: Thanks to Duchy Originals' success sales, Waitrose donated 2.8million to charity in 2012 . The range has become a huge success - it now exports to more than 25 countries across the globe including Japan and Taiwan - and led to a significant increase in royalties, as revealed in its annual accounts published yesterday. Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, said: ‘These figures reflect an extremely successful year for Duchy Originals from Waitrose, meaning that we have significantly exceeded our original £1 million commitment’. Charles’s charitable coffers were also swelled by a doubling of the monies raised by opening up the gardens at Highgrove to paying visitors and by selling a range of themed gifts including napkins, boot racks and even gin. This leapt from £312,000 in 2011 to £618,000 last year. The accounts also revealed that The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation has managed to pay off a controversial £20 million loan taken out in 2007 to support the purchase of Dumfries House, a stately home in Ayrshire with a world-class collection of Chippendale furniture, which is now open to the public. Charles personally stood by the deal, despite being accused of putting his entire charity empire at risk by taking out such a substantial loan.","Prince Charles' Duchy Originals is sold at Waitrose .

A London taxi driver's daughter, Lauren Marbe, 17, made headlines recently when she notched up an IQ test score of 161, one point higher than Einstein . In another publicity coup this year, she secured the presence of a London taxi driver's daughter, Lauren Marbe. The 17-year-old made headlines recently when she notched up an IQ test score of 161, one point higher than Einstein. 'I read about her in the newspapers and so I phoned her up and she said, ""It is not my world but if you invite me I will come"",' Renouard said. Her father, wearing black tie for the first time, was overwhelmed. He said: 'This is a dream! I still cannot believe it.'

Lady Amelia with fellow guests at the ball, held in Paris on Saturday to bring young ladies 'out' into society . Kyra Kennedy, great-niece of assassinated president JFK, arriving at the ball in Paris on Saturday . The event, held at the Automobile Club of France, is based on the debutantes balls that were once an established part of the British upper class's social calendar. These elaborate affairs launched well-born young women into polite society and, with luck, also introduced them to a potential husband. But the balls started to fall out of favour in the late 1950s, after Queen Elizabeth abolished the practice of the debutantes also being presented at court. In recent decades, they have been reinvented as glittering fundraisers with the emphasis on philanthropy and contact-building rather than finding a potential suitor. Among the new generation of balls, Renouard's alone offers participants the chance to borrow an haute couture dress for the night. 'They are not interested in finding a husband, they are too young,' she said. 'What they prefer is the dress, because even if they are privileged they have never been to an haute couture house.' In previous years Le Bal has attracted the daughters of European aristocracy, as well as Hollywood A-listers such as Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, Andie MacDowell, Clint Eastwood and Sylvester Stallone. The ball now has a strong showing from Asia, but Renouard says she still has to crack Russia. 'I'm not good on Russia. It's all about networks...', she said.

"People have long been fascinated by out-of-body experiences - are they just tricks of the mind or do they have some sort of spiritual significance? Now new research has shed light on what it terms as 'extra-corporeal experiences' by studying the brain activity of a Canadian woman who claims she can drift outside her own body at will. Scientists believe the left side of several areas of the brain associated with kinaesthetic imagery (the perception of the sensation of moving) are responsible for the sensation of being able to leave your body and float above it – and that more people might have similar experiences than thought. Scientists believe the left side of several areas of the brain associated with kinaesthetic imagery are responsible for the sensation of being able to leave your body and float above it. Increased activity was seen in the middle and superior orbitofrontal gyri (A,B,D) the supramarginal gyrus (B) and inferior temporal gyrus (D) Researchers at the University of Ottawa came across a psychology graduate who admitted she could have voluntary out-of-body experiences before she fell asleep. The 24-year-old revealed she is able to see herself floating and rotating horizontally in the air above her body and can sometimes watch herself from above while remaining aware of her real body. However, as she said she feels no emotions when she has the experiences, the scientists decided to classify her experiences as extra-corporeal experiences (ECE) as strong emotions such as shock, often accompany out-of-body experiences, Popular Science reported. Researchers came across a psychology graduate who admitted she could have voluntary out-of-body experiences before she fell asleep. The 24-year-old revealed she is able to see herself floating horizontally in the air above her body, rotating and can sometimes watch herself from above (illustrated) ‘I feel myself moving, or, more accurately, can make myself feel as if I am moving,’ the student told the researchers, who documented her report in their study. ‘I know perfectly well that I am not actually moving. There is no duality of body and mind when this happens, not really. 'In fact, I am hyper-sensitive to my body at that point, because I am concentrating so hard on the sensation of moving. ‘I am the one moving – me – my body. For example, if I “spin” for long enough, I get dizzy. ‘I do not see myself above my body. Rather, my whole body has moved up. I feel it as being above where I know it actually is. ‘I usually also picture myself as moving up in my mind’s eye, but the mind is not substantive. It does not move unless the body does,’ she said. Andra Smith and Claude Messier used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner to examine the student’s brain and believe she is the first person studied to have an ECE on demand without any brain abnormalities. They discovered that the ECE involved a ‘strong deactivation of the visual cortex’. But it also ‘activated the left side of several areas associated with kinesthetic imagery’ in the brain, which the scientists think is what cause mental representations of bodily movement. While the researchers have acknowledged the rarity of finding someone to study who can have ECEs on demand, they believe that outer-body-experiences could be more common than thought. This idea is based on the fact that the student thought that being able to float outside her body was not unusual. According to the study: ‘The . participant described her experience as one she began performing as a . child when bored with “sleep time” at preschool. She . discovered she could elicit the experience of moving above her body and . used this as a distraction during the time kids were asked to nap. She . continued to perform this experience as she grew up assuming, as . mentioned, that “everyone could do it.”’ The scientists discovered that the extra-corporeal experiences (ECE) involved a 'strong deactivation of the visual cortex' (pictured). A shows the right side and B the left) ‘She appeared surprised that not everyone could experience this,’ the researchers wrote in the study, which was published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. The scientists think there is a ‘possibility that this phenomenon may have a significant incidence but [is] unreported because people do not think this is exceptional.’ They also theorised that ‘the ability might be present in infancy but is lost without regular practice.’ The scientists think there is a 'possibility that this phenomenon may have a significant incidence but [is] unreported because people do not think this is exceptional.'

"An elderly husband and wife have announced their plans to die in the world's first 'couple' euthanasia - despite neither of them being terminally ill. Instead the pair fear loneliness if the other one dies first from natural causes. Identified only by their first names, Francis, 89, and Anne, 86, they have the support of their three adult children who say they would be unable to care for either parent if they became widowed. Craig Ewert, 59, whose death in an assisted suicide in a Swiss clinic was broadcasted on  television . The children have even gone so far as to find a practitioner willing to carry out the double killings on the grounds that the couple's mental anguish constituted the unbearable suffering needed to legally justify euthanasia. The couple, from Brussels, are receiving regular medical treatment for age-related ailments. Francis has received treatment for prostate cancer for 20 years and is unable to spend a day without morphine and Anne is partially blind and almost totally deaf. They always go out shopping together because they are both scared that one day the other will not return home. They decided that life in a care home was not an option because of their fear they would end up bedridden without the strength to insist on euthanasia. They are also afraid that a good retirement home would cost more than their combined pensions and that they would have to dig into their savings to afford it. They planned to commit suicide on February 3 next year, their 64th wedding anniversary, by placing plastic bags over their heads after taking an overdose of sleeping pills. The couple decided that life in a care home was not an option because of their fear they would end up bedridden without the strength to insist on euthanasia . 'We want to go together because we both fear of the future,' said Francis. 'It's as simple as this: we are afraid of what lies ahead. 'Fear of being alone and above all, fear of the consequences of loneliness.' He told Moustique, a Belgian online news service, that they eventually opted for euthanasia because they were too scared to attempt to commit suicide. 'It takes courage to jump from the 20th floor and I am unable even if I wanted to do it,' said Francis. 'It takes courage to hang, it takes courage to jump into the canal. But a doctor who makes you a shot and lets you gently fall asleep? It does not take courage.' Their son, John Paul, 55, approached their doctor to request their euthanasia - which was legalised in Belgium in 2002 - but the doctor refused because there were no grounds for it. John Paul found another doctor willing to perform the killings in an unnamed hospital in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium in which 82 per cent of euthanasia cases are performed. Francis said he and Anne were grateful for the arrangement. 'Without our son and our daughter, it would never have succeeded,' he said. 'We are not sad, we are happy,' he continued. 'When we were told we could leave life together smoothly we were on a little cloud. It was as if we had spent all that time in a tunnel and suddenly we came into the light again.' The couple's daughter has remarked that her parents are talking about their deaths as eagerly as if they were planning a holiday. John Paul said the double euthanasia of his parents was the 'best solution'. 'If one of them should die, who would remain would be so sad and totally dependent on us,' he said. 'It would be impossible for us to come here every day, take care of our father or our mother.' The double euthanasia will not be first in Belgium, a country where an average of five people a day die by lethal injection. In 2012 deaf twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, were granted their wish to die after they learned they would likely to become blind. Mental anguish is also increasingly being used as a justification for the procedure with one of the most sensational cases involving transsexual Nancy Verhelst, 44, killed by lethal injection after doctors botched her sex change operation. Earlier this month Frank Van Den Bleeken, a rapist and murderer, became the first prisoner to successfully argue for the right to die by euthanasia on the grounds that his mental anguish meant that he was suffering. Nonetheless, the Belgian couple's plan for a double death has shocked opponents of assisted suicide and euthanasia in the UK where Lord Falconer's Assisted Dying Bill reaches committee stage in the House Lords in November, . Lord Carlile of Berriew, who investigated euthanasia for a parliamentary inquiry, said: 'This is an example of a very dangerous use of euthanasia in entirely inappropriate circumstances. 'What it demonstrates is that the most stringent safeguards would be needed if this was going to be legalised in the UK.' Liz Carr, the actress who plays disabled forensics technician Clarissa Mullery in BBC1's Silent Witness, said the casual practice of euthanasia in Belgium had developed from a law designed initially for hard cases. 'Once you allow a doctor to assist you to end your life when the patient defines when they are suffering I think you are opening the door to an extension of that law,' she said. 'It may be everyone's intention that initially it will be only for a small group of people but how you monitor that and how you enforce that is practically impossible.' 'It is terrifying where this could go,' she added. Dr Kevin Fitzpatrick of Not Dead Yet UK, a network of disabled people against euthanasia, said death in Belgium was now regarded 'as lightly as stepping off a bus'. 'The pro-euthanasia lobby says there is no extension from terminally ill candidates yet everywhere we turn in Belgium non-terminally ill people are being euthanised.' Dignity in Dying which is campaigning for a change in British law, has dismissed fears that Lord Falconer's Bill might lead to similar horrors. It insists that the Bill is based on a safer model of assisted suicide 'which has been working safely for over 17 years and has never been extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness'.","Francis, 89, and Anne, 86 are planning to die in first 'couple' euthanasia .

"The thug who became the first winner on Simon Cowell’s high-profile new ITV game show could lose his £1million prize money after it emerged he lied about his criminal past. Nathan Hageman, who won the first Red or Black programme on Saturday, had claimed he was jailed over a fight with a man. But court documents yesterday revealed he was in fact convicted for an attack on a young woman – believed to be his former girlfriend. Celebrating: Nathan Hageman, with his current girlfriend Jane Makepeace. Court documents have shown that he attacked a former partner - but lied to show bosses and said it was a man . ITV bosses last night launched an investigation into the affair, raising the possibility that the winner could be stripped of his seven-figure fortune if it is deemed he breached his contract by lying to executives. Attack: Amy McLean was assaulted by gameshow winner Mr Hageman, court records show . After his win, Mr Hageman – who had been working as a bricklayer following his release from prison – was forced to admit publicly he had been given a five-year prison sentence after apparently breaking into a man’s home and assaulting him. Speaking to journalists on Sunday, the 31-year-old insisted the incident involved a male love rival and that he had acted in self-defence following a series of abusive phone calls. He also said he had turned his life around since his release in 2009. However, information from Reading Crown Court shows the victim of Mr Hageman’s attack was 30-year-old Amy Edwards, who is thought to be his former girlfriend. On Sunday afternoon, ITV bosses stood by their decision to allow the bricklayer to appear on the show, claiming they knew about his criminal past and had conducted ‘background checks’. But last night sources at the channel claimed he had misinformed them of his past conviction. One said: ‘It’s fair to say we didn’t . know. We knew about the sentence but believed it was the result of a . confrontation with another man.’ ITV . confirmed to the Daily Mail last night: ‘In light of recent . developments ITV and Syco are making inquiries to establish the facts.’ Winner: Hageman met with the show's creator Simon Cowell after his win on Saturday night - where he correctly predicted red on the spin of a giant roulette wheel . Mr Hageman was found guilty in November 2006. He served half his sentence in HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire before being released in 2009. He was put on licence for the remainder of his term. Talking about the incident after his win, he said: ‘I got mixed up with the wrong woman, someone I shouldn’t have been involved with. I decided to get out of the situation and ended up with another woman, who was such a nice girl – completely different. ‘But the woman I left wouldn’t leave me alone. Then I started getting calls from a guy in Reading. He was very threatening. I think she’d got involved with him. Pressure: Nathan Hageman reacts after he wins the £1m, alongside his girlfriend and the show's presenters And and Dec . ‘I tried to brush it off but he kept saying he was going to harm me. I was concerned for my mum, sister and niece and I went there and assaulted him. I was an idiot for doing it, I know, but that’s the state of mind I was in.’ He even claimed he had made his peace with the man in question. However, Reading Crown Court said yesterday: ‘On November 7, 2006, Nathan Hageman pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated burglary and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. ‘On December 8, 2006, he received a sentence of five years imprisonment for aggravated burglary and two years imprisonment for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to run concurrently. The victim of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm named in the indictment was Amy Edwards.’ Almost eight million viewers watched Mr Hageman, who is now with girlfriend Jane Makepeace, 29, win the ITV show after he correctly predicted red on the spin of a giant roulette wheel.",Nathan Hageman was jailed for five years and was released in 2009 .

'We will be paying contracts in full and giving full credit in the programme. The show is set to finish between 12am and 12.30am.'

"Fit for royalty: Helen Mirren with her Oscar award for Best Actress for her portrayal as Elizabeth II in The Queen . Helen Mirren, who won an Oscar for her screen portrait of the Queen, has revealed, exclusively, that she will play the monarch again — this time on the West End stage. Mirren will star in a play that exposes some unlikely alliances between the Queen and a few of her 12 prime ministers, who stretch from David Cameron all the way back to Winston Churchill. Called The Audience, the play — which is bound to be one of the hottest tickets in town in years — will begin preview performances at the Gielgud Theatre on February 15, with an official opening night tentatively marked for March 5. Producer Matthew Byam Shaw told me it’s scheduled to run to June 15. Next week, during a short break from shooting the thriller Red 2 with Bruce Willis, Mirren will travel from Montreal to London to liaise with the play’s creative team. She will meet with director Stephen Daldry, writer Peter Morgan (who penned the 2006 film The Queen) and designer Bob Crowley, and do a second read-through of the play. They will also discuss how best to deal with the age range — the actress, 67, will portray the Queen from the time she acceded to the throne, aged 25, through to her 80s. ‘That’ll be a challenge,’ she said drily. However, Mirren observed the Queen’s ‘unbelievable consistency in everything’ — from dress to hairstyle to professional attitude — made the age problem not as insurmountable as it might seem. ‘Her voice has changed, and I can use that — she had a terribly posh voice when she was young,’ Mirren said, skilfully mimicking the youthful Queen’s cut-glass received pronunciation. ‘But now even the Queen, while she isn’t quite dropping the ends of her lines — though her grandsons do! — there’s a tiny bit of estuary creeping in there. I can use all that to signify the age range, and we’ll come up with other things.’ Mirren told me that when Morgan initially emailed her about doing The Audience, she wasn’t wild about the idea, and shot back a salty message that started: ‘You B*****d!’ ‘I certainly don’t want to be known as the actress who played the Queen, so there was a slight sense of apprehension about that element,’ she told me. By the time she turned up for a reading of The Audience back in June, she said she’d made up her mind to turn the project down. ‘I was thinking: “You shouldn’t really be doing this, Helen. I don’t think it’s right.” And the thought of doing a play — you can’t go anywhere for six months!’ But then she walked into the room and saw Daldry, Morgan, Crowley and producers Byam Shaw, Robert Fox and Andy Harries (one of the producers of The Queen) — and had a change of heart. Class act: Helen Mirren as Her Majesty in The Queen alongside Michael Sheen as Tony Blair . Winning performance: Helen Mirren portraying the Queen reading anout the death of Princess Diana in the 2005 film . ‘I thought: “Here are some of the best people at what they do in the world. If you don’t do it, you’re an absolute idiot!” So here we go again.’ She revealed that the play is about the history of Britain as much as it is about the relationships between Her Majesty and her prime ministers. ‘I think it’s about what power means and how people handle it. Not the Queen, incidentally, because she is comparatively powerless. But how power is held in the hands of these men — and one woman — and the effect that has on their personalities and their psyche. ‘In the beginning, the Queen is the young, nervous, unknowledgeable one. ‘But as she progresses through them, they become the nervous ones. She’s the one constant, through a revolving door of  prime ministers.’ Historical: Helen Mirren staring as the first Queen Elizabeth in the channel 4 series Elizabeth I in 2005 . Versatile: Helen Mirren is currently filming the sequel to the 2010 comedy thriller film RED . Morgan is working on a new draft of The Audience and, for now, no one knows exactly which prime ministers will be showcased. Tony Blair didn’t appear in the first draft, but he may take a bow in the new version that Mirren will read next week. ‘She was a very young woman with Churchill, who was trying to bamboozle and then educate her; and she has gotten on better with some than she has with others,’ producer Byam Shaw told me. He added that people may find it ‘surprising who she gets on well with’. He said Morgan conducted extremely thorough research, talking to assorted PM’s principal private secretaries and Cabinet ministers. John Major had been ‘very helpful’, he said. Meanwhile, Mirren and her fellow stars from Red 2 will be in town filming over the next few weeks. ‘We’ll be shooting up London,’ Mirren joked. ‘What a contrast of characters: from retired assassin to Queen!’","Helen Mirren will take up the role of Queen Elizabeth II again - but this time on stage .

"She has dominated the airwaves during 30 years as a chart-topper, but now Radio 1 has decided that Madonna is an immaterial girl and just too old for its teenage listeners. Despite her determined efforts to look – and sound – youthful, the 56-year-old has been dropped from the station’s playlist that determines which songs are played by DJs during the day. Madonna’s latest song is Living For Love and has been available for airplay since December 20 last year. Scroll down for video . Madonna, pictured, has been placed on the Radio 1 no-play list because at 56 she is too old for their listeners . Yet it has been played on Radio 1 just once – on January 9 when DJ Annie Mac played it on her evening show. But that was after 7pm, when songs not on the playlist can be broadcast. The track is the first single from the mother of four’s new album, Rebel Heart. The station last night said the single had been omitted from playlists on the basis of ‘audience relevance’ and ‘musical merit’. A Radio 1 insider said: ‘At the end of the day it’s all about relevance. It’s natural that as an artist gets older their audience goes elsewhere and Radio 1 has to reflect that. ‘The station has a duty to meet the needs of younger listeners. I don’t think the audience is losing sleep that it is not playing Madonna in the same way that it used to.’ The snub represents a remarkable fall from grace for the star who notched up 13 UK No 1s between 1985 and 2008. She finds herself alongside Sir Cliff Richard, Take That, Kate Bush and Robbie Williams on a long list of artists who struggle to get new material played on the station. Sir Cliff Richard, left, and Robbie Williams also struggle to get their music played on Radio One . Madonna’s single is being played on Radio 2, which caters for an audience aged over 35. By contrast, Sir Paul McCartney’s new single will be played by Radio 1 even though the former Beatle is 72. This is because the track is a collaboration with rapper Kanye West, 37, and pop mega-star Rihanna, 26. A Radio 1 spokesman said: ‘Tracks are chosen on musical merit, and while around 40 per cent of the country’s 15 to 29-year-olds tune into Radio 1 each week, an artist’s age is never a factor.’ Madonna’s spokesman declined to comment.","Radio 1 has banned Madonna for being 'irrelevant and old' for its listeners .

"They already own more of London than the Crown Estate. And Qatar’s royal family are now planning their own British palace in the capital as well. The Gulf state’s rulers have submitted plans to convert three prime properties in London’s Regent’s Park into a huge mansion, set to become the UK’s first £200million home. Scroll down for video . Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned - one of Qatar’s former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's wives - bought 1, 2, and 3 Cornwall Terrace (pictured) last year and is converting the three into a palace . The garden sits at lower ground level, at the back of number 1 Cornwall Terrace, and is accessible by two sets of stairs. In the summer it can be dramatically lit to look like a ballroom . Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, 55, one of the three wives of Qatar’s former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, bought the homes for an estimated £120million last year. The Arab royal, who met the Queen at Windsor Palace in 2010, has now hired architects and lawyers to oversee a transformation of the properties into one 33,000 sq ft mansion, boasting a spa, heated swimming pool, beauty salon, butler and nanny quarters, a children’s floor, games rooms, powder rooms, massage areas, two lifts and a gymnasium. Her family also own the Shard, the tallest skyscraper in Europe, Harrods and the Olympic Village. The 13 bedroom palace will be the London home of Sheikh Hamad’s son and Qatar’s current emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, 34, who was educated at Harrow and Sandhurst. There, he will be able to relax in the mansion’s spa and sauna and dip in the pool, which is set in Portland stone. Heated kitchen seats will keep the family warm in the English winter and, for the summer, there are Italianate gardens dramatically lit to look like a ballroom. Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned (right), with husband Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's (left) Guests are treated to a selection of bedrooms and can smoke with their host in a cigar room, and select drinks from a ‘wine cave’. Lights are controlled by an iPad and staff live in their own quarters in part of the building, which comprises of the two end properties on the terrace. When completed, the mansion is expected to be the most valuable residential property in London in private hands. It is likely to be worth more than the most high profile investments of recent times in the capital – including Dudley House on Park Lane, a grade II-listed mansion which was also bought and renovated by Sheikh Hamad, 62, and is valued at £200 million. It is expected to be worth about double the highest selling residential property in the UK - a penthouse at One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, which sold in May this year for about £140 million. The Qatari royal family bought the three properties - 1, 2 and 3 Cornwall Terrace - last year. The Grade 1 listed buildings were designed and built in the 1820s by Decimus Burton, the protégé of John Nash, the architect who designed Buckingham Palace. It was named after King George IV, whose titles included the Duke of Cornwall. The homes were badly damaged in the Blitz. After refurbishment, one of the properties was the official residence of the New Zealand High Commissioner from 1955 until the seventies, with lavish parties for royalty, celebrities and ambassadors. It was subsequently overtaken by hippy squatters in 1975 and was hailed as a ‘temple’ for the ‘Rainbow People’ and ‘Divine Light Mission’ - before being redeveloped in 2007 by a property company and sold. The 33,000sq ft mansion will boast a spa, heated swimming pool, beauty salon, butler and nanny quarters, a children’s floor, games rooms, powder rooms, massage areas, two lifts and a gymnasium . Representatives of the Qatar royal family said after joining the houses together, the new single mansion ‘will be ordered through a series of zones creating a sense of hierarchy’. Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, when she met the Queen at Windsor Palace in 2010 . Plans suggest the ground floor of the neoclassical house will be used for a reception area and lobby, leading through on one side to a large dining room and on the other to the family’s main kitchen, living room and breakfast rooms. The first floor boasts formal sitting areas, a cigar lounge and three entertainment rooms. The living areas are above, with the second floor featuring a huge master bedroom, with two adjoining ‘dressing rooms’, a master bathroom and a bedroom pantry. The third floor is set aside for the children, with boys and girls wings, games rooms, playroom, pantry and a kids’ lift. The nanny lodgings are also on this floor, with an en suite bathroom. The lower ground floor, meanwhile, is to boast the heated swimming pool and gym areas, which are to be separated by a glass wall ‘to create a sense of light and space’, as well as massage rooms, another ‘entertainment area’ and a hair salon. Another part of the floor will serve as staff quarters, with a catering kitchen, wine cave and a security office controlling a system of state of the art cameras protecting the property. Fittings for the mansion will be made from the most sought after materials, including a carrara marble and champagne gold metal fireplace. The bathrooms will be provided with a minimum of 3 air changes per hour, while each room’s temperature can be controlled individually. The ideal temparatures have been specified for the family at 23C in living areas, 22C in bedrooms and between 25C and 30C in the pool area. The 13 bedroom palace will be the London home of the couple's son - Qatar’s current emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, 34, who was educated at Harrow and Sandhurst . In its current form, one Cornwall Terrace alone has seven bedrooms, 11 reception rooms, nine bathrooms, a private gym and a garage with number-plate recognition that can accommodate two limousines. The adjoining property – formed by already combining 2 and 3 Cornwall Terrace – has six bedrooms. Its dining room, restored to its former Regency glory, seats 16. Extensive works to be done include, structural realignment, part excavation of the lower ground floor, corridors to connect the properties and a ‘secret’ passage linking the new dining room and study. The state of Qatar has been ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-19th century. It is an absolute monarchy, which means the monarch has unrestricted political power over the state and its people. The current head of state is 34-year-old emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and there has been eight rulers in total since the House of Thani was established in 1850. Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani handed power over to his son - one of his 24 children - in June 2013. He was the first ruler, in a succession of three Qatari rulers to ascend to power without resorting to a coup, following his father's seizure of power from his own father in 1995. Sheikh Tamim married his second cousin in 2005 and had four children, and then married his second wife - the daughter of the Qatari Ambassador to Jordan - in 2009 and has a daughter and a son. Oil was discovered in the country in 1940, transforming its economy and it is now the world's third largest natural gas reserves and oil - in excess of 25 billion barrels. The country now has a high standard of living, with no income tax and one of the lowest tax rates in the world and less than one per cent of the population is unemployed. ‘These are to be occupied and used by the same, large family who has the long leasehold interest in both properties. They intend to use these properties as their London home,’ the planning application states. For almost 150 years, Qatar has been ruled by the Al Thani family. Sheikh Hamad was the ruling Emir of Qatar from 1995, when he seized power from his father Sheikh Khalifa in a bloodless palace coup d’état supported by the armed forces, cabinet and neighbouring states. He has more than 20 children from three wives, a fortune of £1.5billion and his family’s huge state investment fund owns more of London than the Crown Estate. His son Tamim took over last year after being educated in the UK at Sherborne School, Harrow and Sandhurst Military Academy. While not always in line for the title, the boy replaced his own brother as crown prince in 2003. He continues to outlaw all political parties and govern according to sharia principles. In Qatar, gay people face the death penalty and women are considered second-class citizens. Some of Qatar's residents are accused of acting duplicitously over jihadist terror – supporting allied efforts against Islamic State but also supposedly funding Sunni militants. There has also notoriously been much controversy over alleged corruption in the country’s successful bid to host the World Cup in 2022. Qatar has been accused of treating foreign workers with horrendous cruelty, depriving them of pay, any rights and confiscating passports. In recent years, Qataris are thought to have bought almost one in 30 homes in London worth more than £2million. Qatar owns buildings including the Shard, the UK’s biggest skyscraper. Qatar own several London buildings including the Shard (pictured), the Olympic Village and 30 homes . The Qatari royal family also used its sovereign wealth fund to buy London department store Harrods in 2010 . After Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund bought Harrods for £1.5billion in 2010, Sheikh Hamad said: ‘We are investing everywhere. Even your Harrods - we took it.’ The Qatari royal family saved almost £6million by buying the properties before last week’s stamp duty changes. They will have paid £8.4million in stamp duty when buying the properties for an estimated £120million. Had they bought the properties now, stamp duty alone would have cost them £14,227,500.","Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned bought homes for £120m last year .

"A painting by the elusive British guerilla artist Banksy has been gouged out of a wall in North London and is being sold by an American art dealer. Banksy Slave Labour, depicting a child labourer sewing Union Jack bunting, is expected to fetch £450,000 on the Fine Art Auctions Miami website. The street art was stencilled onto the side of a Poundland shop in Wood Green in 2012 but disappeared last week. Banksy Slave Labour was hacked from a shop wall and is now being sold on a U.S. art auction website. It is expected to fetch £450,000 . Gouge: The hole left behind after the artwork was stolen.

He added that the painting was being stored in Europe. Locals are furious about the painting being stolen. Councillor Alan Strickland says the artwork was a 'gift' to his community and has instigated a campaign to get the artwork returned by urging people to e-mail the U.S. auction website. He said: 'The Banksy appeared last May and created lots of excitement in the area - people were coming from across London to see it. 'We were really proud to have a Banksy in our neighbourhood, so residents were shocked to realise it had been ripped out of the wall. 'The community feels that this art was given to us, for free, and it's now been taken away to be sold for huge profit. I'm very angry about the Banksy going - we want our Banksy back!'

The original of Wrong War by Bristol's renowned graffiti artist and a signed print of No Ball Games were bought for £12,990 last month. But two weeks after delivering the artworks to a customer in Plumstead, south London, the art dealer received bank letters stating that the cards used to buy the images did not have the authorisation of the cardholders. Banksy's No Ball Games was delivered the artworks to a customer in Plumstead, south London . Both payments were cancelled and refunded to the cardholder, leaving the dealer in Essex without the artworks or payments. Officers from Greenwich CID launched an investigation when, in the meantime, the suspect contacted the art dealer again, this time to make a purchase of two Banksy prints worth £10,000. Police were informed of this order and arrested a 25-year-old man at an address in Plumstead on February 8. He has since been bailed pending further inquiries. Officers searched an address in Charlton, believed to be linked to the suspect, where they recovered Wrong War.","Street art cut from London wall last week is now up for sale in America .

This object, called the Helix nebula, lies 650 light-years away, in the . constellation of Aquarius. Also known by the catalog number NGC 7293, it . is a typical example of a class of objects called planetary nebulae. Discovered in the 18th century, these cosmic works of art were . erroneously named for their resemblance to gas-giant planets. Planetary nebulae are actually the remains of stars that once looked a . lot like our sun. These stars spend most of their lives turning hydrogen . into helium in massive runaway nuclear fusion reactions in their cores. In fact, this process of fusion provides all the light and heat that we . get from our sun. Our sun will blossom into a planetary nebula when it . dies in about five billion years. When the hydrogen fuel for the fusion reaction runs out, the star turns . to helium for a fuel source, burning it into an even heavier mix of . carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Eventually, the helium will also be . exhausted, and the star dies, puffing off its outer gaseous layers and . leaving behind the tiny, hot, dense core, called a white dwarf. The . white dwarf is about the size of Earth, but has a mass very close to . that of the original star; in fact, a teaspoon of a white dwarf would . weigh as much as several elephants. The glow from planetary nebulae is particularly intriguing as it appears . surprisingly similar across a broad swath of the spectrum, from . ultraviolet to infrared. The Helix remains recognizable at any of these . wavelengths, but the combination shown here highlights some subtle . differences. The image is eerily reminiscent of the Eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings films. The intense ultraviolet radiation from the white dwarf heats up the . expelled layers of gas, which shine brightly in the infrared. GALEX has . picked out the ultraviolet light pouring out of this system, shown . throughout the nebula in blue, while Spitzer has snagged the detailed . infrared signature of the dust and gas in yellow. A portion of the . extended field beyond the nebula, which was not observed by Spitzer, is . from NASA's all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The . white dwarf star itself is a tiny white pinprick right at the center of . the nebula. The brighter purple circle in the very center is the combined . ultraviolet and infrared glow of a dusty disk circling the white dwarf . (the disk itself is too small to be resolved). This dust was most likely . kicked up by comets that survived the death of their star. Before the star died, its comets, and possibly planets, would have . orbited the star in an orderly fashion. When the star ran out of . hydrogen to burn, and blew off its outer layers, the icy bodies and . outer planets would have been tossed about and into each other, kicking . up an ongoing cosmic dust storm. Any inner planets in the system would . have burned up or been swallowed as their dying star expanded. Infrared data from Spitzer for the central nebula is rendered in green . (wavelengths of 3.6 to 4.5 microns) and red (8 to 24 microns), with WISE . data covering the outer areas in green (3.4 to 4.5 microns) and red (12 . to 22 microns). Ultraviolet data from GALEX appears as blue (0.15 to . 2.3 microns). Nasa has previously released this image, dubbed the 'eye of sauron' which also appears to be an eye, showing the spiral galaxy NGC 4151, .","Dying star captured by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope .

"She turned 40 this year and is looking better than ever. So what's Kate Moss' secret? The supermodel, who has dominated the industry for 25 years, has revealed that she's the latest in a long line of celebrities to jump on the health bandwagon. Speaking about her virtuous new lifestyle, she said: 'I like juicing as it gives you bright eyes with a bit of a twinkle and it keeps your hair shiny.' Scroll down for video . What's her secret? Kate Moss, 40, who has dominated the industry for 25 years, has revealed that she's a huge fan of juicing and loves one supplement in particular . But you won't catch her whizzing up some banana and spinach in her blender. Kate, who makes around £12 million a year, adds a £98 superfood supplement into her morning juice created by health aficionado and fellow supermodel, Elle Macpherson. Kate explained: 'At the moment I'm using Elle Macpherson The Super Elixir supplement. I add it to my juices.' Kate is the latest in a long line of celebrities to confess their love of the product - fellow socialites Nick Grimshaw and Daisy Lowe love it too. So what is all the fuss about? Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she unveiled her very own brand. Secret weapon: Kate loves Elle Macpherson's Super Elixir, which is packed with 45 key ingredients including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom . Elle this year introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle told MailOnline: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor ""I don't feel great"". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' That's when Elle decided to create the Super Elixir. The product is designed to support healthy nutrition at a cellular level and aid the digestive, endocrine (hormonal), circulatory and nervous systems. Work hard, play hard: The model, who makes around £12 million a year starring in campaigns for brands including Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, is known for her love of a good time . Packed with 45 key ingredients including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom, Elle claims that just 10g of the powder daily contains all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements to assist wellness and vitality. 'I've spent years tweaking it and refining it and now the recipe works so beautifully. After a few weeks, my body went into cruise mode and I felt uplifted, lost weight, didn't get sick and didn't crave sugar. 'My body hummed along and functioned properly,' said Elle. It seems that it's helping Kate's hum along too; the model's career - and social life - is going stronger than ever.

"The U.S. has condemned North Korea's state media after it described President Barack Obama as a 'wicked black monkey'. A spokeswoman in Washington DC said the racist rhetoric, made two days after the U.S leader paid a state visit to South Korea, was 'ugly and disrespectful'. Korea Central News Agency, the mouthpiece of the government in Pyongyang, made the attack in one of two pieces aimed at Mr Obama and South Korean president Park Geun-hye. Scroll down for video . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (left) and U.S. President Barack Obama (right), speaking during a joint press conference with South Korean president Park Geun-Hye at the presidential Bule House in Seoul, South Korea . Angry response: President Barack Obama waves to the crowd after speaking at a Democratic National Committee reception in San Jose, California, yesterday . Both pieces were only in Korean and were not translated into English by the news agency. Kang Hyuk, a worker at the Chollima Ironworks Factory, in a translation by the NK News website, said: 'How Obama looks makes me disgusted. 'As I watch him more closely, I realise that he looks like an African native monkey with a black face, gaunt grey eyes, cavate [sic] nostrils, plump mouth and hairy, rough ears. 'He acts like a monkey with a red bum, irrationally eating everything,' Mr Kang added. 'Africa's national zoo will be the perfect place for Obama to live, licking breadcrumbs thrown by visitors.' One of articles was translated by Josh Stanton, who blogs regularly about the North's human rights violations. He said, in comments about Mr Obama's visit to South Korea made on May 2, KCNA wrote: 'Park made waste water-like reckless remarks ... after inviting her American master reminiscent of a wicked black monkey to visit South Korea.'

Other attacks in the commentary, . according to the Washington Post, described Mr Obama as being 'a . crossbreed with unclear blood' and like someone who 'has the figure of a . monkey while the human race has evolved through millions of years'. It . also called Mr Obama a 'clown,' a 'dirty fellow' and somebody who 'does . not even have the basic appearances of a human being'. In response, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said: 'While the North Korean Government-controlled media are distinguished by their histrionics, these comments are particularly ugly and disrespectful.' The second article also featured attacks on the South Korean president, describing her as an 'old prostitute'. It is not the first time North Korean media has used such language when talking about the South Korean leader. Frank Feinstein, who runs the North Korean propaganda monitoring service KCNA Watch, told NK News: 'There is no similar instance of this sort of language in the recent KCNA history.'","Washington spokeswoman said insults were  'ugly and disrespectful'

"A comet hurtling into our solar system from deep space could next year score a direct and cataclysmic impact on Mars, astronomers say. According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet. But the unpredictable nature of comet orbits, which can change as jet-like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the Sun, means it could pass further away, or veer into a direct collision course. Incoming! A computer generated image shows how a . comet might look from the surface of Mars. A recently discovered comet . could be on course for a cataclysmic impact with the surface of the Red . Planet . Respected astronomer Phil Plait, author of Slate's Bad Astronomy blog, has calculated that even if the comet is just nine miles across - a low estimate - an impact with Mars would cause a one billion megaton explosion. That, he says, is 25million times larger than the largest nuclear weapon ever tested on Earth. Much more likely, however, is that the comet will just miss Mars, which will nevertheless mean that the planet will pass through the cloud of sublimating gas spewed from the visiting rock as it draws closer to the Sun. Like asteroids, comets are large chunks of space rock that orbit around our solar system. Unlike asteroids, however, comets are packed with ice. This ice is not necessarily just water, but also things like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide that on Earth we generally think of as gases, which in the chilly reaches of space are frozen inside the nucleus of the comet. As the comet hurtles along its orbit closer to the Sun, these substances turn directly from solids to gases, often erupting from the comet through geyser-like vents. The comet's trajectory: Astronomers have . calculated that, according to its present orbit (indicated in blue), . C/2012 A1 will make its closest approach to Mars in October 2014 . At the moment, C/2013 A1 is over a billion kilometres from the Sun, somewhere past Jupiter, which means it is still very cold. However, as it draws closer it will began to vent more gas, changing its path and surrounding the nucleus with a large fuzzy cloud known as a coma - which can be up to several hundred thousand kilometres across. That means that the comet's coma - which is also filled with grit-like rubble from the comet itself - could be bigger than the distance the nucleus is predicted to miss Mars. 'If that does happen, it’ll be the gods’ own meteor shower for the Red Planet,' Plait writes. It will also be interesting to see the effect of the grit shower on Mars's two lumpy, potato-shaped moons, Phobos and Demos, which would be peppered with grit as the comet streaks past. Images of C/2013 A1 captured by the Vatican Observatory VATT on January 20: Although it was still over a billion kilometres from the Sun when this image was taken it already shows a small amount of coma activity . And if the nucleus does hit Mars, the effect would be apocalyptic for the planet. Estimates for the size of the comet's core range from nine to 30 miles across, and astronomers say it will be moving at a phenomenal speed of 120,000mph upon impact - giving it huge kinetic energy. Such an impact would leave a scar on Mars hundreds of kilometres across, says Plait. Even worse for Earth-based observers, it would almost certainly destroy all our probes in orbit around and on the surface of the planet. 'The ejecta would come screaming off the planet and sent every which way in orbit around Mars,' Plait writes. 'It would be like orbiting into a shotgun blast.' Comet C/2013 A1 was first spotted on January 3, making it the first comet to be discovered this year. Extrapolations of its orbit predict it will make its closest approach to Mars in October next year.","Comet C/2013 A1 could pass within 23,000 miles of Mars in October 2014 .

"A 14-year-old boy has accused police of over-reacting after they pinned him to the ground and choked him for allegedly giving them 'dehumanising stares'. Officers tackled unarmed Tremaine McMillian to the ground and pinned him there by his neck on Haulover Beach in Miami, Florida, in scenes captured on camera by his mother. In interviews Tremaine said he was merely walking along the beach, feeding his puppy from a bottle, when police riding all-terrain vehicles swooped late on Monday morning. Unnecessary roughness? Tremaine McMillian is pictured being restrained by a Miami-Dade Police officer on Haulover beach, after allegedly threatening them with 'dehumanising stares' and clenched fists . But Miami-Dade police have claimed they were forced to restrain the youngster after he refused to follow orders, clenched his fists and gave them 'dehumanising stares'. Their version of the story has led to the boy being charged with resisting arrest with violence. Maurissa Holmes, Tremaine's mother, captured video on her mobile phone that shows a burly police officer with his arm wrapped tightly around the neck of the slender teenager while another binds him with handcuffs. 'He started choking me, and as he was choking me, I urinated on myself because I couldn't breathe,' said Tremaine in an interview broadcast on WSVN News. Ms Holmes told CBS Miami: 'I ran over with my son and used my cell phone when I saw my son and he couldn’t breathe. 'There was no reason to slam him on the ground like that the way they did. He’s a child, not an adult. For them to jump off their ATV and do this, this is wrong. I want justice. You don’t do that to a child.' Terrifying: As one officer pinned down Tremaine by his neck, a second policeman bound him with handcuffs, in an attack the teenager found so frightening he wet himself . Tremaine's family say that just before the police moved in he had been playing in the surf with friends. He said he was holding his six-week-old puppy when officers came up and demanded to know what he was doing. Miami-Dade Police say they approached Tremaine because they saw him roughhousing with another teenager, although they admitted that as they approached officers realised there was not sort of fight going on. Nevertheless, officers went on to demand that Tremaine stop what he was doing and account for himself. 'I asked, why, and he told me, because he said so, and I asked why again,' Tremaine told WSVN. 'That's when he told me, ""Show me where your mom's at"".' He said he was following the orders and leading them to his mother when police leapt from their vehicle, slapped the puppy from his hand, grabbed him and slammed him to the ground. He says his puppy, Marco, was injured in the attack and in television interviews the animal can be seen wincing as he touches its paw. Tremaine pictured with his mother Maurissa Holmes: Police tell a different story which claims that the 14-year-old was uncooperative and became combative and clenched his fists as police attempted to detain him . Police tell a different story. Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta said it was just after 11am when officers apparently saw Tremaine body slamming another teenager onto the sand. Police reports say they then realised that no fight was going on, but Detective Zabaleta told CBS Miami that Tremaine refused to take officers to his parents and they were forced to leave their ATV to detain him as he started to leave the beach area. According to the police report, Tremaine became combative and clenched his fist as police went to hold him. 'He attempted to pull his arm away, stating, ""Man, don't touch me like I did something,""' the report ways. Detective Zabaleta said Tremaine's actions indicated he was 'resisting officers' and meant he had to be taken into custody. 'Of course we have to neutralize the threat,' said the detective. 'When you have somebody resistant to them and pulling away and somebody clenching their fists and flailing their arms, that’s a threat.' Tremaine has been charged with resisting arrest with violence and disorderly conduct. He is being represented by a public defender and has entered a plea of not guilty. His trial is slated to start on July 16.","Tremaine McMillian was tackled to the ground and pinned down by his neck on Haulover Beach, Miami .

"England had a really good day, chipping away on a flat pitch and taking regular wickets to keep alive hopes of a series-levelling win. It was not the sort of surface where you could blast out the opposition, not the pitch we expected, but the one thing that has kept England interested is a bit of swing which keeps Jimmy Anderson in the game. Just as the senior batsmen responded in this third Test with runs for Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, so the experienced bowlers in Anderson and Stuart Broad were brilliant on Tuesday. Bad day at the office: Chris Jordan struggled against India on day three of the third Test in Southampton . Stick with him: England selectors must keep faith in Chris Jordan or risk ruining his confidence . The way they kept going and found the right lengths was outstanding and Cook used them well. Chris Jordan had a bad day but the England selectors must not go back to the policy of ‘in-out’ with players that was such a problem in the bad old days. They then lose confidence and rhythm and don’t know if they’re coming or going. England should have made a decision between Jordan and Ben Stokes at the start of this summer and stuck by it. What do they do at Old Trafford? Leave Jordan out and bring Stokes back? Jordan has a few technical issues but they were there before and he needs to bowl and bowl. He has a bit of a jerky action, as well as this quirk with his thumb across the seam and three fingers on the ball. He’s got things that can go wrong and then finds himself in trouble. Bring on the big guns: James Anderson and Stuart Broad (R) stepped up to give England hope of levelling . If you’re out of form as a batsman you can nick it and walk off but if you’re a bowler you have to stay out there and work through it. The fact we didn’t mention Jos Buttler much throughout the day suggests the debutant kept well, and Jordan certainly tested him with a few down the leg side. The catch on the leg side that should have been given off Moeen Ali was an impressive one, too. Moeen, meanwhile, keeps chipping in with wickets and coach Duncan Fletcher will be fuming about the way India gifted England a wicket either side of tea. It’s as if India are not sure whether to block Moeen or try to blast him out of the attack. Chipping away: Moeen Ali after Rohit Sharma is caught by Stuart Broad at the Ageas Bowl . Safe hands: New boy Jos Buttler gets ready to catch a skied shot from Ajinkya Rahane . Chris Woakes was OK in the Tim Bresnan role but that only works if you have a spinner who can contain and attack, and without that you have to ask whether England have picked their best seamers here. Liam Plunkett or Steven Finn could have given them more wicket-taking potential. Cook had a good day, highlighted by him having mid-on and mid-off up to Rohit Sharma. It would have been easy to drop long-off back but he tempted Rohit into the shot which got him out and that was promising. I would have liked to see a gully employed more often but to have India 323 for eight on a flat pitch was a fine effort from the captain and his senior bowlers.","England restricted India to 328-8 on day three of the Third Test .

"Two ex-British soldiers who travelled to Syria to fight against Islamic State (ISIS) have had panic alarms fitted to their homes upon their return for fear of reprisals from extremists. Jamie Read and James Hughes revealed the heightened security around them since their return in their first television interview, in which they  described the battleground in the war-torn country as 'like World War One'. Mr Read, 24, from Cumbria, had previously said his motivation for travelling to fight was the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning. Scroll down for video . Former British soldiers Jamie Read (left) and James Hughes (right) - pictured with a Kurdish fighter- travelled to Syria to join the battle against ISIS after being shocked by the atrocities committed by the extremists . He said he and Mr Hughes, 26, from Worcestershire, 'felt compelled' to take up arms. 'I could not justify sitting back in the UK and watching IS pretty much do what they like,' he told Sky News. Upon their return they were detained at Heathrow Airport and questioned for six hours, although they were not arrested and were released before their homes were placed under monitoring by counter-terror police. Mr Read, who had a brief stint in the Second Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's regiment, said: 'The counter-terrorism police have got our houses red-flagged in the sense of if any calls come out from that area they will be straight to our house. We have got panic alarms fitted in both our houses now.' Mr Hughes, who served three tours of Afghanistan with the Army, added: 'There's patrols purposely put out in case of said event would happen.' On their arrest, Mr Read said they knew there was a risk but he felt their mission was a 'humanitarian effort' and the pair also again denied claims they were 'mercenaries', saying they had come back to 'a lot of debt'. In the pair's first TV interview, Mr Read (pictured, right and left) said there are fears that his or Mr Hughes may be attacked in the UK and their homes are being watched by the security services . The pair also revealed they had resolved to take their own lives if they felt they could be captured by the militants, who were battling Kurdish forces to take control of the Syrian border town of Kobani. 'If at any one point we honestly, genuinely felt they were coming coming for us, 'it's definitely over', if we had rounds on us, if we had weapons on us then keep one for yourself,' Mr Read said. 'Nobody wants to get captured by IS, nobody wants to end up on YouTube getting their head cut off. Nobody wants that. As harsh as it sounds, it's probably the better way to go.' On the other side of the battle lines, official figures suggest more than 500 Britons have travelled to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. At the time the men went to fight, the Home Office warned against all travel to the country, saying anyone who did so was putting themselves in 'considerable danger'. Mr Hughes (left) and Mr Read (right) were among a band of foreigners who have joined the Kurds. They said the battlefield they found was 'like World War One' Taxi driver Mr Henning, 47, was killed by a masked militant known as Jihadi John in a video released online in October following a string of similarly publicised killings. ISIS has also posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid worker David Haines. Footage appearing to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm. 'The best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support UK-registered charities that have ongoing relief operations.'","Former servicemen went to fight after seeing Alan Henning murder by ISIS .

"In the foothills of the Nepalese Himalayas the tribal elders of a mountain community risk their lives balancing on precarious ropes and ladders to harvest the honey from the hives of the world's largest honeybees. Dangling and winding their way up the mountain's steep cliffs, engulfed by thick black smoke which is used to ward off the bees, the elders stab at the hives to jostle honey out. Using another stick, he balances a basket to collect the chunks of honeycomb he's knocked off, before lowering it hundreds of feet to the waiting tribe below, from the remote hilltop village in central Nepal’s Kaski district, who are watching the ancient tradition which dates back to around 11,000 BC. Most of the nests are located on steep inaccessible, south-west facing cliffs to avoid predators and for increased exposure to direct sunlight . As the thick, acrid smoke rises upwards the hunter waits patiently for the bees to disperse so that he can cut the exposed hives . First the group collects foliage to make huge fires to smoke out the honeybees from their hives. Once the bees are driven off and sedated, the dozen or so hunters begin to harvest the outsides of the hives. The Nepalese tribes say the most difficult job is the 'cutter' the beige suit-wearing men who climb up a 50-meter rope ladder that’s been secured at the top and bottom of the cliff. He then uses two bamboo sticks, known as tangos, to gather the honey. With one he slices at the exposed honeycomb while using he uses the other to catch the falling honeycomb. What he doesn’t catch falls to the base of the cliff, leaving it for the other tribal members, particularly children, below. A young boy from the nearby village feasts on a piece of freshly cut honeycomb that has fallen to the ground . At the end of a hard days harvesting the Gurung men tuck into the wild honey for some much needed energy . But this Nepalese tribe is one of the many that faces losing its way of life, thanks to a changing climate and a reduced bee population, which puts both the tribal food supply, and the greater ecosystem, in jeopardy. Modifying a solution, Nepal has started cashing in on the many international tourists that want to experience the honey hunter's way of life in the Himalayan foothills, as well as the recent influx of tourists, before the bees disappear completely. The tourists are heading to Nepal from across the world, using trekking agencies that organise journeys to the remote parts of the country on the Annapurna circuit, and these companies have now realised the draw of the honey hunting spectacle, charging almost $1,000 to go on a 'guided honey trek'. The honey hunters have been tempted by this potential short-term financial benefit, and in turn are tempted to harvest their honey out of the normal season in 'staged' events. However, these face damaging the cliff walls and the nesting hives, as tourists will need to bring modern climbing gear with them which could possible hasten the already jeaporadised Nepalese honeybees demise. As the honey hunter descends the rope ladder, the blood, blisters and bee stings that are synonymous with this treacherous tradition become visible . After a 3 hour trek back up to the village carrying approximately 20kg of honey, a hunter enjoys a hard earned piece of honeycomb by the fire . Further problems come from the increased exporting of the Himalayan honey, which is sold to Japan, China and Korea for use in traditional holistic medicines. Spring 'red' honey is the most profitable, making upwards of £30 per kilo, and is increasingly exported worldwide. The knock-on effect of this is the increased profitability in trade has meant the ownership of the cliffs transferred from the government to the tribes, which could lead to an even quicker demise in the hives as the tribal ways are being replaced by more rough trade gathering.

"Louis van Gaal has admitted his players are having problems coping with his methods at Manchester United as it emerged that a one-hour inquest was held the day after the dismal 5-3 defeat at Leicester last Sunday. Striker Robin van Persie said ‘confronting’ views were exchanged during the meeting but feels this was beneficial to the squad as United look for a win against West Ham on Saturday to stop their  Premier League campaign veering completely off track. Van Persie  is still puzzled by United’s failure to beat Leicester after leading 3-1. Louis van Gaal could barely watch as his side capitulated 5-3 against Leicester City last weekend . The defeat prompted the Dutchman to accept that some of his players have not adapted to his methods . Robin van Persie, who scored United's first goal at Leicester, said Van Gaal held a post-match summit meeting . ‘It shouldn’t be possible, but it still happened,’ Van Persie told Fox Sports. ‘So we had a proper look at it the next day. ‘Sometimes it was a bit confronting. It was a really good meeting as everyone spoke up and shared their feelings. ‘It was a long meeting — one hour or something — but we went from there, started again this week, put a couple of really good sessions in and everyone feels ready to face West Ham.’ Missing 10 players through injury or suspension on Saturday, United will have an unusual look about them as manager Van Gaal admits his team have not yet fully adapted to him. ‘We give a lot of information and you have to work out that information,’ he said. ‘There shall be a moment in the season when this information is too much, maybe at this moment it is too much for the players.’ Jonny Evans limps off after injuring his ankle at Leicester, and is one of 10 players unavailable to Van Gaal . Teenage defender Paddy McNair could make his Manchester United debut due to the club's injury crisis . Van Gaal is considering his options for the West Ham match as he looks to cope with the absence of injured defenders Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, as well as the banned Tyler Blackett. Admitting that he was aware of the injury history of Evans, Jones and Smalling, Van Gaal believes he can solve the problem. ‘I have been told (about their injury records) and now they are confirming that,’ he said. ‘But I have good hopes that we shall improve in that matter because normally I don’t have any injuries. ‘As a good example, for a player who was many times injured — Arjen Robben — in my season at Bayern Munich he was never injured. ‘You do that by training sessions that adapt to the players’ level. It was not only Robben but every player at Munich. Chris Smalling is one of many Manchester United players to have under-performed since Van Gaal took over . Wayne Rooney, Tyler Blackett and Daley Blind were  among those who struggled at the King Power Stadium . ‘We are doing that here in the same way, only less than I have done with Bayern Munich. We have to improve the level and intensity so the players can play the games.’ Questions have been asked about why Van Gaal did not buy world-class defenders during the club’s big-money summer spending spree. At Leicester, a Van Gaal team conceded five for what the Dutch coach feels is the first time in his career. However, the 63-year-old insisted he did try to sign a big-name central defender. Van Gaal defended his way of operating and expects his side to bounce back against West Ham on Saturday . Referring to failed attempts to recruit Mats Hummels from Dortmund and Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal, Van Gaal said: ‘Maybe we were in the market already in August for the right central defender. ‘You never know. But I don’t want to discuss that with you. I do understand (the criticism) because I as a manager have never conceded five goals. Never. ‘Maybe once, but I cannot remember. As a player, yes, more than five against, but I was not a very good player — a top player — so I played in regular clubs. ‘But as a manager I never conceded five.’ The Dutch manager missed out on defensive targets in the summer, including  Thomas Vermaelen (right)","Louis van Gaal concedes his players are taking time to adapt to him .

"George Zimmerman's brother last night faced the public to insist his brother is 'the neighbour that everyone would want to have' and shot Trayvon Martin in while defending himself. It came hours after his father criticised President Obama for the 'hate' he had directed at his son in the wake of the fatal shooting of the unarmed black 19-year-old that has caused outrage across the nation. Robert Zimmerman said on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight: 'The fantasy or mythology that he . chased a person is absolutely false. He stopped . someone from disarming him and shooting him. He didn’t pull out a gun . and shoot him.' Scroll down for video... Defence: Robert Zimmerman Jr spoke out about his brother and described him as the perfect neighbour . Robert Jr insisted that, contrary to media reports, his brother was responsible and friendly as he said: 'He's the neighbour that everybody would want to have. He goes out of his way to help people - he always has.' And he added that police footage of the killer after his arrest proved that he was injured in a fight with Trayvon: 'To me his nose looks swollen in that video.  I’m his brother.' Robert Jr claimed his 28-year-old bother was on his way to Target when he followed Martin because he looked suspicious in the gated community where there had been several break-ins. He said George was reaching for his phone to call 911 while confronting Martin when the 17-year-old attacked him. 'He never got to make that phone call because he was attacked by Mr. Martin,' he said, adding that the screams heard on a 911 call made by a neighbour during the confrontation sound like his brother. 'Despite those screams, no one came to his aid,' he added. Targeted: George Zimmerman's father, Robert, appeared on camera for his interview as only a shadow, afraid to show his face on TV . Speaking out: This is the first time someone in George Zimmerman's family has been interviewed on TV following the shooting . Mr Zimmerman also insisted that his . 28-year-old brother would never utter the word 'c***', as he is accused . of doing on another 911 call in reference to Martin. Before ending his appearance on the show he alluded to the existence of another witness who saw the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin 'from the first blow' and would back up his story. He spoke after . Zimmerman's father had earlier said he was shocked to see 'hate' coming from . President Obama and other public figures. Robert . Zimmerman Sr, a 64-year-old Vietnam veteran and retired magistrate . judge, said his family has received 'thousands' of death threats and . become the targets of overwhelming public vitriol in the aftermath of . the shooting in Sanford, Florida. He . defended his son's actions and claimed he was left no choice but to . open fire after Trayvon told him 'you're going to die tonight' while the . unarmed 17-year-old was beating the neighborhood watch volunteer. 'I never foresaw so much hate, coming . from the president, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP,' Robert . Zimmerman told Fox Orlando Wednesday night. 'Every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety from this or profit in some way.' Obama famously said, 'If I had a son, . he would look like Trayvon,' in his remarks about the shooting. He also . called for a full investigation to 'get to the bottom of exactly what . happened' George Zimmerman, it was revealed earlier this week, is a registered Democrat. Threats: Robert Zimmerman claims that as Trayvon Martin (right) was beating his son George (left), the teen told him 'you're going to die tonight' Hatred? Robert Zimmerman says President Obama has helped ratchet up the pressure on his family . The elder Zimmerman would not show his . face on camera during the interview -- the first time he has spoken out . on television. Instead, the local TV station showed just his shadow. He described a life where his son was . forced to flee his home, and he and his wife were also forced to leave . theirs to hide out while the case attracts international publicity and . thousands of angry protestors. 'We, the entire family, we basically don't have a life,' he said. They cannot do anything in public that includes giving their names, he said, including seeking medical care. He called the negative attention on his family 'unimaginable.' 'I'm sorry all the hate that's going around,' he said of the anger toward his son. Robert Zimmerman said George is 'colorblind' and was mentoring two black children before the shooting occurred. He said the campaign against his son, especially from the lawyer representing Trayvon's parents, is a smear. 'How he is being portrayed is an absolute lie,' he said. Robert Zimmerman said his son, who is half-white and half-Hispanic, began following Trayvon because he didn't recognize the boy. He looked suspicious, he said, because he was walking in the grass behind the townhouses in the gated community where he lived, rather than walking in the road or on the sidewalk. Kevin Cunningham is the Howard University law student who created the petition that demanded that authorities prosecute George Zimmerman. The 31-year-old, who describes himself as the 'super Irish' son of activist parents, had no idea his online appeal would grow to become Change.org’s largest ever petition, amassing more than two million signatures in three weeks. It helped draw international attention to Trayvon Martin's shooting and attracted support from people who identified themselves as family members or friends of the 17-year-old. Cunningham, who told msnbc that he 'doesn't believe in black and white', transferred the petition to Martin's parents because he wanted to remain behind the scenes. Additionally, when the 911 dispatcher that Zimmerman called told him he didn't need to follow the teen, he didn't go back to his car only because he wasn't sure of the address where he had stopped and seen Trayvon, who was wearing a hoodie. Robert Zimmerman said his son walked up the street to find a street sign so he could figure out where, exactly he was. It was then, that Trayvon approached him and attacked him, Zimmerman claims. Meanwhile, . a video that emerged Tuesday night, that shows Zimmerman being brought . into the Sanford police station for questioning in handcuffs. ABC News, which obtained the video, says Zimmerman said he appears uninjured in the surveillance camera shots. Zimmerman . claimed to police that Trayvon punched him in the face, breaking his . nose, then jumped on top of him and bashed his head into the sidewalk, . putting a gash in his head. However, none of those wounds were visible from the video. On NBC's the Today Show, Zimmerman's lawyer Craig Sonner, said the video proves nothing. The . quality is 'very grainy' and Sonner said police cleaned up his client's . wounds before bringing him in for a police interview. Suspect: George Zimmerman walks through a police station in Sanford, Florida, in this frame grab taken from police video on February 26 2012. The neighborhood watch volunteer appeared uninjured when he was brought into the police station on the night of the shooting, according to a police video .

"For a studious, well-behaved private schoolgirl looking forward to a milestone coming-of-age, it was the perfect early 18th birthday present. And Lucy Clode, 17, was undoubtedly looking forward to the trip to New York with her mum Carolyn - presumably to hit the shops, see the sights and maybe even take in a show. What probably wasn’t in her plans was an unexpected online flirting session with a Hollywood superstar almost twice her age. Scroll down for video . What's going on here?: Schoolgirl Lucy Clode, 17, has claimed James Franco tried to meet up with her in a series of Instagram and text messages . Striking up conversation: James allegedly started chatting to Lucy after meeting her outside the the theatre where he was performing Of Mice And Men on Broadway . Not wasting any time: The actor appears to start asking Lucy how old she is and whether she has a boyfriend . Unluckily for A-list actor James . Franco, Miss Clode offered him nothing but a gentle knockback – because . she was on holiday with her mum. In . the Big Apple this week, the excited Scottish teenager spotted Franco . outside the stage door of the Broadway production in which he is . starring at the moment. Miss . Clode, who attends prestigious independent school Dollar Academy in . Clackmannanshire, reached for her mobile and took some pictures of the . James Dean and Spiderman star, and then - as teenagers are wont to do – . she turned the lens on herself and took some ‘selfies’ with the . 35-year-old box office hit in the background. It . is understood that Franco spotted Miss Clode taking the photos and . shouted to her that she should put the photographs on the online . picture-sharing site Instagram and ‘tag’ him so he would be alerted to . them. According to Hollywood gossip websites, the pair later started an internet conversation that led to the now-famous rejection. In . what appear to be screenshots from Instagram, Franco works fast to . establish where Miss Clode is from and how long she will be in New York. He . then seems to fire off three questions in quick succession: ‘You’re . 18?’ ‘Who are you with?’ and ‘Do you have a bf (boyfriend)?’ Making a move: The alleged messages show James asking Lucy if he should 'rent a room' in her hotel and attempts to convince her it is really him . 'Don't tell': The teen asks the star to send her a photo of himself holding a piece of paper with her name on, which he apparently does . Miss Clode replies: ‘Nearly 18, my mum and not if you’re around.’ Franco then asks exactly when her birthday is and where she is staying in New York. The . conversation then appeared to switch to text message, and Franco asks . ‘Can I see you? You’re single? What’s the hotel? Should I rent a room?’ When . Miss Clode, from Dollar, voices concerns the conversation could be an . April Fool by an imposter, Franco posts a picture of himself to prove it . is genuine. The sensible teen then decides: ‘I’ll come back when I’m 18.’ Franco responds: ‘If you don’t want to meet text me when you do.’ The . screenshots of the conversation have taken Twitter and US gossip sites . by storm – although it is unclear whether they are genuine or not, and . fans claimed they could just be a publicity stunt. It . is worth noting that Franco’s next film is the story of a high school . teacher who is dating one of his pupils – and several eagle-eyed online . commentators last night floated the suggestion that the exchange with . Miss Clode could be a sophisticated joke. One . man who has come out of the story very well is Miss Clode’s boyfriend . Brodie Dickson – an 18-year-old fellow Dollar Academy pupil who seemed . pleased to have beaten Franco in the love stakes. During . a conversation with a friend posted on Instagram, Miss Clode said: . 'James Franco asked me to meet him alone Romy! It was really him and I . rejected him!! [what] am I doing?!' 'Why are you thirsty for underage ones?': James tweeted this after the news broke but later deleted it . Meeting: Lucy shared this photo on Instagram with James in the background outside the Broadway theatre he had performed in, sparking the flirting . She then added: 'I am going to regret this for years - it's given me a confidence boost though lol.' The . friend named Romy then said: '""Damn strait [sic] it should also give . @dbrodieb a f****** huge confidence boost that you'd say no to James . Franco for him hahaha that is true love. @dbrodieb who appears to be Lucy's boyfriend, said: 'I'm on top of the world Romy!' Another woman of the Clode family – Miss Clode’s grandmother Beryl Sussex – seemed equally unimpressed with Franco. What controversy?: James ignored the claims on Thursday and instead boasted that he now has 1.6million Instagram followers . Publicity stunt?: Lucy shared this photo in Times Square on Instagram. James' alleged actions could be to promote his new movie Palo Alto, in which he plays a soccer coach who seduces his 14-year-old babysitter . 'Not if you're around': Lucy, who also posted this photo of herself and her mother, apparently told James she was 'nearly 18' and that it didn't matter whether or not she had a boyfriend . She said: 'At our age we don't know who this actor is - I've never heard of him. 'Trust our Lucy though, she is a very pretty girl and she's just finding her feet now as a young woman. 'I'm not surprised she gets noticed. But better that she doesn't marry a hollywood star just yet!' Franco . has not released a statement regarding the incident but did Tweet in . reference to a comment that he liked younger women saying: 'I’m not! I . hope parents keep their teens away from me. Thank you.’ - with a link to . an Instagram photo that has since been removed. The . age of consent in New York is 17, so even if the exchange is genuine, . Franco is not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law – but his . actions drew criticism from fans last night. On . gossip site Perez Hilton, a user called moooose wrote: 'It’s . interesting how someone could go from a charming sexy intellectual to a . disgusting creepy perv over night.’","Teenager Lucy Clode, is from Dollar in Clackmannanshire, Scotland .

"An 18-year-old Indian girl has married a stray dog as part of a tribal ritual designed to ward off an evil spell. Mangli Munda, from a remote village in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, wed the canine in a lavish ceremony. The wedding was hastily organised by village elders after a local guru led Mangli's parents to believe that the teenager possessed ill-luck and that marrying a man would bring destruction to the family and her community. Scroll down for video . Ruff deal: An 18-year-old girl in India (pictured) was ordered by village elders to marry a dog (left) to lift a bad-luck curse that's hanging over her . Ceremony: The dog, Sheru, a stray, falls asleep during the lavish ceremony . The baffled dog, Sheru, a stray found by the girl's father, was brought to the wedding in a chauffeur driven car and welcomed by revellers. Mangli, who has not been to school, said she was not happy to wed a dog, but insisted that it will help change her fortunes. The hesitant bride said: 'I am marrying a dog because the village elders believe that my evil spell will be passed on to the dog. 'After that is done, the man I will marry will have a long life.' Mangli's father Sri Amnmunda agreed. He said: 'The village elders told us that we should organise the wedding as soon as we can. We had to make sure that the evil spell is destroyed. Tradition: Rituals being performed during the wedding in the remote village . Good turn-out: Around 70 relatives attended the ceremony in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand . 'And marrying a dog is the only way to get rid of the bad luck.' And amazingly, this is not the first time that a local girl has wed a dog in the village. Sri added: 'Many weddings like this have taken place in our village and also the other neighbouring villages. This is a custom that we thoroughly believe in.' According to the village's customs, the marriage will not affect Mangli's life, and she will be free to marry again later without divorcing the dog. The big day: Mangli Munda poses with her father, Sri Amnmunda, and her stray dog husband . 'My villagers say that many girls like me have followed this ritual and they have gotten rid of their evil spells and are living happy lives now,' said Mangli. 'I will also be free to marry a man of my dreams after after the evil spell is over.' At the wedding ceremony, people danced to traditional drumming, while around 70 relatives and local villagers attended the wedding. VIP: The bride's father  carries Sheru in his friend's car on the wedding day . 'Apart from the fact that the groom is a dog, we followed all customs. We respect the dog as much as we would respect a normal groom,' said Mangli's mother Seems Devi. 'We had to spend money on this wedding in the same way as we would in a normal wedding. But that is the only way we can get rid of her bad luck and ensure the benevolence of the village.' Now with the marriage ceremony over, Mangli has to take care of the dog and raise him as a pet for the next few months. Mangli added: 'I will marry a man one day. It is the dream of every girl to marry a prince charming. So I am also waiting for my prince.'","Mangli Munda was told by village elders that she was cursed with bad luck .

The BlackBerry Passport will also be available through Amazon.com, and the retailer will be announcing its pricing 'soon'. 'As we set out to design BlackBerry Passport, we were guided by a simple yet challenging idea - to set aside the limitations of traditional design and to instead simply build a device that fundamentally changes the way business professionals get work done on their smartphone,' said Mr Chen. 'The BlackBerry Passport was created to drive productivity and to break through the sea of rectangular-screen, all-touch devices.' In addition to the large, 1440x1440 pixel square screen, the device has a 3450 mAH battery which BlackBerry claims will last up to 30 hours. It has a quad-core 2.2 GHZ Processor, 3GB RAM as well as a 13MP rear camera, and 32GB memory. The touchscreen is accompanied by a physical keyboard, and the Passport runs BlackBerry 10 OS 10.3.

This means that Android apps will run on the device, but only those available from the Amazon store, installed on the BlackBerry device. The device wil be available in more than 30 countries around the world, including the Middle East, France, India, Singapore, Austria, Germany, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia, Vietnam, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Mexico, Venezuela, Philippines, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Romania, and Colombia. Earlier this week, Mr Chen told the Wall Street Journal that the price of the flagship device should be in the region of $799, but his firm dropped the price to 'get the market interested.' The BlackBerry Passport (pictured centre) has a full HD 4.5-inch square screen and shows 60 characters of text, compared to 40 on a rectangular 5-inch device (Samsung's Galaxy S5 5.1-inch device is pictured right). Apple's iPhone 4S is pictured left to show scale. There is also a 13MP rear camera and a 2MP front camera . Other specifications of the Passport (pictured) include a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage plus expandable storage via microSD card up to 64GB . By comparison, Apple's latest iPhone 6 handset starts at £539 ($649), while the iPhone 6 Plus costs £789 ($749) - both are also available on two-year contracts. Samsung's Galaxy S5 costs around £580 ($650), and the South Korean firm is yet to release price details for its Galaxy Note Edge. The . BlackBerry Passport is the first time the firm has launched a new device, globally, since its BlackBerry 10 devices in 2013. Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'This latest handset launch shows that it’s back to business for BlackBerry - and what a smart move that is. 'After a year away from the UK market, a return to Blighty with a keyboard-based smartphone is a move that plays to BlackBerry's strengths, and shows it has finally understood what people liked about its early phones. 'In a twist, Amazon's Android AppStore comes preloaded, showing either the versatility of the OS - or that the BlackBerry app store needs help.' The Passport combines a large touchscreen with a physical keyboard. BlackBerry chief executive John Chen first revealed the square phone (pictured) during the Canadian company's annual general meeting in June . In June, BlackBerry announced it was offering . 240,000 Android apps to its smartphone users in a surprise deal with . Amazon. The . deal lets BlackBerry add a selection of consumer apps to its . devices, and to focus on developing enterprise and productivity . applications. For example, BlackBerry customers will be able to access popular . Android apps such as Groupon, Netflix, Pinterest, Candy Crush Saga and . Minecraft. The . apps will be available on BlackBerry 10 devices from autumn, when . the company rolls out the BlackBerry 10.3 operating system, the . statement said. While Ben Wood, Chief of Research, CCS Insight added: 'This . is definitely a marmite product – based on our experience so far people . either love the design or are a little perplexed by the size and shape. 'One . thing is certain – it’s a distinctive product that will definitely . stand out from the monotonous stream of similar looking touchscreen . smartphones that currently characterise the market. 'After . 18 months of disruption the strategy that new CEO John Chen has laid . out seems to be taking hold. The business has stabilised and the . Passport device is a critical milestone in efforts to rebuild the . business.' The Passport was first revealed in June by BlackBerry boss John Chen during the company's quarterly earnings report. The project . was previously known as Windermere, and Mr Chen said at the time that . Passport would be officially announced at an event in London in . September. Further details were unveiled by Matt Young on the Inside BlackBerry blog . in July: ‘Consider how IMAX movies begin with the screens set to a more . traditional 16:9 aspect ratio projection for conventional movie . trailers, before expanding to their true dimensions. 'The Passport is like the IMAX of productivity, and you don’t have to sacrifice screen real estate, vertically or horizontally.' Academic research has shown that the optimal number of characters on a line in a book is 66 characters. Most . rectangular smartphones show approximately 40 characters per line, . while the BlackBerry Passport is said to show 60 characters. The Passport (right) was unveiled alongside Blackberry's touchscreen phone the Z3 (left), and the Classic (centre) in a slide, earlier this year. It is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold, when making a call for example . This makes the Passport ‘the ideal device for reading e-books, viewing documents and browsing the web.’ It also solves the problem of having to switch between landscape and portrait mode when taking a photo or filming a video. ‘We’ve . been living in a rectangular world for quite some time and know it’s a . great ergonomic design that drives content, media consumption and quick . communications,’ continued Mr Young. ‘However, the rectangle has become a defacto approach to smartphone design, perhaps limiting innovations. ‘Just as a passport is the universal symbol of mobility and was the inspiration for the size and form factor of this device, your BlackBerry Passport becomes your ticket to open new doors of opportunity.’ It is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold, when making a call for example, and BlackBerry has not released any details about the price. The blog post did, however, position the device more towards businesses than consumers. For example, it stated architects and mortgage brokers could use it to look at full designs and schematics on the go. While medical staff could view X-rays and medical documents in the office with a patient . Mr Young . concluded: ‘The BlackBerry Passport will take you to new places on the . best business trip you’ve ever had. We want you to imagine the . possibilities.’ [caption] . The . move is the latest by the smartphone pioneer to streamline its focus as . it attempts to reinvent itself under new chief executive John Chen. BlackBerry phones have recently lost ground to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy devices. Chen . wants to remain a competitor in the smartphone segment, but is focused . on making BlackBerry a dominant force in machine-to-machine . communications. The . company's QNX software already is a mainstay in the automobile . industry, powering electronic and other systems in a wide range of cars.

"Intrigue over Manchester United’s poor injury record this season deepened on Friday night when it emerged that their respected and long-serving fitness coach Tony Strudwick is no longer involved in key first team duties. United manager Louis van Gaal revealed on Friday that he has nine players missing injured ahead of Saturday's visit of West Ham United in the Barclays Premier League. Van Gaal has described the crisis as the worst he has ever known. Now it has emerged that first team fitness expert Strudwick has been moved from his usual role to a job looking after the physical development of the club’s younger players. It is understood that Van Gaal’s long serving fitness guru Jos van Dijk is now in control of fitness planning and programming for the club’s elite stars. Manchester United fitness coach Tony Strudwick is no longer working with Louis van Gaal's first team stars . Strudwick, pictured with Van Gaal, has been told to sharpen up the fitness of Manchester United's starlets . Jos van Dijk, pictured on the far left before United's win against QPR, will work with the senior team . Van Dijk, pictured to the right of Patrick Kluivert, was part of Van Gaal's Dutch staff at the 2014 World Cup . Strudwick was in charge of things on the club’s pre-season tour of America and was regularly seen working with Wayne Rooney and the rest of the first team on the trip. Since then, though, the 42-year-old has been less visible and sources at Old Trafford confirmed last night that things had changed earlier in the season. Strudwick’s only involvement with the first team now is some warm up drills before training and some strength work. He no longer has any involvement with the crucial task of designing and planning training, the vital role he had fulfilled since joining from Blackburn Rovers in 2007. There is no suggestion that the decision to move Strudwick is any reflection on his work, rather that Van Gaal – in common with many managers – merely wished to work with his own man. However Van Gaal’s decision represents a risk as not only is Strudwick considered talented enough and experienced enough to work for the FA with Roy Hodgson and the England squad, he is liked, trusted and respected by all of the club’s senior players.

"Take a good long look at Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in action for England and enjoy them while you can. For it will be a miracle if they are still standing, let alone still playing in 18 months time, without some serious rest periods. A look at England’s schedule in that time, particularly the nine-month period from the middle of April next year to the middle of the following January, is confirmation that the cricketing world has gone well and truly mad. There is so much international cricket, including an extraordinary 17 Tests in that nine-month spell, that it will surely finish off England’s big two fast bowlers and seriously shorten the careers of many an elite player to come. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England's Anderson cleared for fourth Test against India . Burn out: Stuart Broad has been struggling with a knee injury during the Test series against India . ‘Greed is good, greed works’, says the Michael Douglas character Gordon Gekko in the 1987 film Wall Street, but he could easily have been talking about the England cricket team nearly 30 years later. This is all about money. I have long believed that there is far too much international cricket, that the bottom line is pursued at the expense of the quality of the product. The concept of less is more, that every international match should mean something, is evidently lost on administrators obsessed with short-termism. Now comes the tipping point. Now comes a year, once the relatively low-key build-up to Christmas is complete, which will jeopardise the longevity of players careers and undermine the quality and intensity of almost every England match. In January England undertake a triangular one-day series in Australia, also featuring India, before they begin the elongated World Cup in February. As soon as that is over, at the end of March, England will be off to the Caribbean for a three Test series before returning, via a one-day international in Ireland, for an Ashes summer which also features a Test and one-day series against New Zealand. Had enough yet? There’s more, much more. As soon as the Ashes, surely the priority of the whole lot, are contested and another one-day and Twenty20 series against Australia is complete England will be off to the United Arab Emirates to face Pakistan in a three-Test series, plus the usual 50-over and Twenty20 matches, before a full tour of South Africa. And on it goes into early 2016 when there is a World Twenty20 tournament in India and beyond. Mind games: Jonathan Trott returned from the Ashes tour after suffering a stress related illness . Who will be left standing? England have been asked to play 17 Test matches over the next nine months . VIDEO England's Anderson cleared for fourth Test against India . No rest for the cricket! England's calender . Now you might point out that players are well paid these days and an inevitable consequence of the wages they demand is that there has to be a full itinerary to pay the bills. But a Test every fortnight for nine months? England playing virtually on every third day throughout the whole of 2015? Crazy. It’s impossible to know how much the demands of a life lived constantly out of a suitcase, with each pressurised match rapidly following another contributed to Jonathan Trott’s illness which forced him home from Australia. But there is no doubt that the ECB are playing a dangerous game with the physical and mental well-being of their top players who, like Anderson  and Broad, simply will not be able to continue playing both Test and one-day cricket. Then there are spectators who pay big money to watch England and are entitled to expect to see the best players performing to the maximum of their ability. How often is that going to happen? There are many reasons why there have been more empty seats at England matches this summer than usual but the sheer volume of expensive cricket has to be at the forefront of them. And, what’s more, the power grab of the International Cricket Council by India, England and Australia will inevitably mean that those English spectators who pay top dollar will watch more and more matches against the old enemy Australia and India. Exhausted! Fans could miss the chance of seeing England stars like James Anderson if they are rested . Too much of a good thing? The Ashes will be contested for the third time in just over two years in 2015 . Familiarity will not only breed contempt, as we are seeing between England and India, but also indifference. The Ashes are special because, like football World Cups and rugby’s Lions tours, they should not come around too often. Yet next year will be the third Ashes series in little more than two years. When will the magic disappear? Some time soon, surely. But don’t worry because even when England are not playing Australia and India they will be playing someone else. Too much of a good thing? Unquestionably. And hugely worrying for both players and supporters alike.","England have been asked to play 17 Tests in the next nine months .

"Police in Northern Ireland are distributing scratch and sniff information cards to help the public identify cannabis farms. Police will be distributing information cards to the public so they can recognise the warning signs of cannabis cultivation in their own communities. The cards make people aware of the unique sweet and pungent smell of cannabis plants in full bloom, one of the most important factors in the discovery of illegal plantations. Pungent aroma: The cards will alert the public to the unique smell of cannabis farms in full bloom. File picture . Justice Minister David Ford said the information, in the form of a 'scratch and sniff' card, was a novel approach to a growing problem. 'The new cards will enable members of the community to help tackle the drug problem in our society, by identifying criminal activity either near their own homes or in the areas where they work,' he said. It comes as a senior police commander revealed that more than two cannabis farms are being uncovered every week on Northern Ireland. From April this year to the end of August, police arrested more than 1,000 people for drugs offences and removed almost £4 million worth of substances from the streets. Over that same period officers uncovered 49 cannabis factories across Northern Ireland. Justice Minister David Ford said the information, in the form of a 'scratch and sniff' card, was a novel approach to a growing problem, while PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris the farms were 'illegal and dangerous' PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said: 'We know that people may not realise that the empty, run-down house or flat on their street with people coming and going may actually be a cannabis factory.

"Jose Mourinho launched a furious attack on referee Anthony Taylor and claimed there is a campaign to brand his Chelsea team ‘cheats’ after their 1-1 draw at Southampton. The Chelsea boss told Taylor he should be ‘ashamed’ of his performance after he failed to award Cesc Fabregas a penalty when he appeared to be fouled by Saints left back Matt Targett. Mourinho said: ‘The reality is that there are penalties and there are penalties - this was one was big, like Big Ben. Cesc Fabregas cannot contain his emotions as he is shown a yellow card after apparently diving in the box . Replays show that contact is made with Fabregas as he controls the ball past the oncoming Matt Targett . Jose Mourinho was fuming as he spoke to Sky Sports after the game . The Chelsea manager says there is a 'campaign' against his side after Fabregas was denied a penalty . ‘Referees are not here to guess, they are there to see. He assumed dishonest with Cesc and he is wrong. ‘Match after match coaches are saying Chelsea players are diving. Out of nothing Sam Allardyce starts talking about my players. ‘I will go to the referee, wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed. There is a campaign against Chelsea. ‘In other countries where I worked before, tomorrow in the sports papers it would be front-page scandal because it is a scandal. ‘In this country - and I am happy with that, more than happy with that - we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result. ‘I am happy that it is this way, with respect for the referee. He made a big mistake like I make, like the players make sometimes.’ Targett's right leg appears to trip the Chelsea midfielder but referee Anthony Taylor chose to book Fabregas . Fabregas begins to appeal for a penalty as he hits the turf as Targett pleads his innocence . Fabregas was cautioned for simulation and Mourinho also made the valid point that there should be a device for referees to rescind yellow cards if they later accept they made a mistake. The Chelsea manager added: ‘The double punishment is something unbelievable. Anthony could go to a screen, sees a mistake and cleans the yellow card. It should be a simple process.’ Mourinho claims opposing managers are deliberately attempting to sabotage his team’s title ambitions by repeatedly accusing Chelsea of being divers. Diego Costa, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Willian and now Fabregas have all been accused of diving this season. Mourinho added: ‘They are not incidents, they are not incidents - that’s a campaign, that's a campaign. That's a clear campaign. West Ham players square up to Branislav Ivanovic after he appeared to dive at Upton Park on Boxing Day . ‘People, pundits, commentators, coaches from other teams - they react with Chelsea in a way they don't react to other teams. ‘You know the most crucial things over the last two weeks are not the cards? It is Filipe Luis and Eden Hazard because they could be in hospital with broken legs. ‘You speak about Gary Cahill and the same with Hull? Well what about Crystal Palace’s goal at Manchester City being disallowed? ‘After we beat West Ham 2-0, a game that should gave been four or five, Enner Valencia made a bad dive and Sam was talking about Ivanovic. ‘Against Southampton it was a crucial decision. The referee has made a mistake.’ Fabregas fumes at referee Anthony Taylor as he prepares to book the Chelsea midfielder . Fabregas smiles and holds his hands up in disbelief as referee Taylor holds aloft the yellow card . Jose Mourinho is clearly unhappy with the decision after seeing one of his players booked for simulation . Despite Chelsea’s slip, Southampton easily deserved a point after Saido Mane put Ronald Koeman’s team into an early lead. They remain fourth in the Barclays Premier League ahead of Arsenal and Koeman said: ‘I am proud the organisation and the spirit. One point against Chelsea is maybe three against another team. ‘The difference was that we played until the last second, we showed the spirit, it was unbelievable. ‘We didn’t make stupid mistakes, as we did against Manchester United and Manchester City. ‘The second half against Chelsea was difficult, but we were organised and disciplined. We scored a great goal. ‘I didn’t really see the penalty incident, but maybe it is a penalty I don’t know, I would have to see it again. ‘If the referees thing it is simulation, then he always has that decision to make. ‘Is it simulation or is it fault?

"Jose Mourinho’s fight on five fronts - Barclays Premier League, Champions League, Capital One Cup, FA Cup and with referees - goes on. The tension is mounting in this absorbing title race and anyone who witnessed the Chelsea manager’s unnecessary assassination of the match official’s performance recognised some familiar signs. Attack mode: High. Stress level: Off the scale. Mood: Dangerous. Vision: Blinkered. Target: Anthony Taylor. Outcome: Direct hit.

'There is a campaign - not against me, but against Chelsea,’ he whined, after Cesc Fabregas was felled by Southampton’s rookie left back Matt Targett inside the penalty area with the score at 1-1. The brutal truth is Mourinho flipped his lid here, losing control of his emotions at a time when he was unaware Burnley had equalised at Manchester City. If only he had known. To think it had all been going so sweetly, Chelsea serenely closing in on their fourth Barclays Premier League title when they moved nine points ahead of City in November. Mourinho barely mentioned a word of the game, other than to hiss repeatedly when he was quizzed about Taylor’s failure to award Chelsea a 55th-minute penalty. Fabregas was booked for simulation. It was, indeed, a ridiculous decision because Targett took the attacker’s legs from under him and appeared to be blocking his path with an arm at the same time. It should have been a penalty, but then Ronald Koeman could legitimately argue that Chelsea still had another 35 minutes to eke out a winner. In the end, given Ashley Barnes’ equaliser at the Etihad, they got away with it. Chelsea star Diego Costa tries to shoot as three Southampton defenders attempt to block his effort . This was classic Mourinho, setting up a bigger diversion than the cones being laid out on that irksome M3 last night, in a resilient attempt to avoid a heavy-duty inquest into his side’s performance. He can be thankful that City are still three points behind them after they were pegged back by Burnley. Still, this was a big slip. Southampton were excellent, barely showing signs of any fatigue after their purposeful 3-1 victory at Crystal Palace on Boxing Day. Here they scored early on, taking the lead when Dusan Tadic’s delightful lob sent Sadio Mane in the clear. The Southampton forward got his chance because Chelsea’s defensive line was so high and John Terry made a rare error by appealing for offside. After the outstanding season he has had, the Chelsea captain is entitled to make one mistake. Yet, it was a significant one. Mane went on to beat the on-rushing figure of Thibaut Courtois and send this place into raptures. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster attempts save Hazard's low shot but the ball nestles into the bottom corner of the net . Hazard celebrates after scoring past Forster while Southampton stars Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin look dejected . Cesc Fabregas goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by Southampton youngster Matt Targett . Saints fans in every area of the ground were hugging each other. And there was a long smouldering cuddle between Tadic and Koeman on the sidelines. What joy for the home fans. Koeman responded to the rhythmic chants from all four corners of St Mary’s as they sang his name after Mane’s opener. He returned a cheery wave. Tadic has seven assists now, a decent haul for a player who always seems to put in a shift down the left flank. This is the first time Chelsea have conceded in the league since Papiss Cisse’s double sealed Newcastle’s win at St James’ Park on December 6. They have had a good run for their money. Southampton cashed in first, taking the lead and prodding Chelsea into action. They had to do something about it. They have the same Christmas schedule as every other team, except they play with the added pressure that every team wants to put one over on them. Fabregas was booked by Premier League official Anthony Taylor for an apparent dive during the second half . The Chelsea midfielder reacts as referee Taylor shows him a yellow card during the match at St Mary's . Fabregas looks dejected as he lays on the turf at St Mary's during his side's 1-1 draw with Southampton . Southampton were hungry, full of willing runners in the centre of midfield. Morgan Schneiderlin, at least until he was correctly dismissed for a second booking for repeatedly chopping Hazard, was the pick of the bunch. The one man Southampton could not afford to take their eye off was Fabregas. Remember the backspin James Rodriguez put on the ball for Cristiano Ronaldo to run on to and score at Anfield in the Champions League a couple of months ago? There were shades of that here, as Fabregas put Hazard in with a wonderful chip. The Belgian took a touch past Maya Yoshida, wrong-footed the rest of the Southampton defence and curled the equaliser beyond Fraser Forster. It was Hazard’s first goal on his travels since January, against Hull, but it was worth the wait. Hazard holds off Southampton defender Maya Yoshida as he attempts to maintain possession for his side . Schneiderlin walks off the pitch after being shown a second yellow card by referee Taylor . Blues substitute Didier Drogba stretches for the ball but he is unable to score past the outstretched Forster . Filipe Luis, Willian and Fabregas speak to referee Taylor at the end of the Premier League encounter . At the break fall-guy Andre Schurrle made way for Willian to shake up Chelsea’s attack. At times he tortured the Saints defence. There were some big misses in the second half, particularly when Didier Drogba, another substitute, miscued his pass as Diego Costa was waiting to score from close-range. Then Costa slipped when Hazard put himself in a goalscoring position. Nothing was working. The only thing that did was Taylor’s whistle, calling Fabregas to attention when he went down under Targett’s clumsy challenge. He was harshly booked, the inevitable conclusion these days when a referee rules in favour of the defender. ‘My team is clean,’ added Mourinho. Yes, but sometimes you play dirty, Jose.

"Astronomers fully expected Comet Lovejoy to meet a fiery death – and with good reason. After all, it was about to fly through the Sun’s atmosphere where temperatures reach a staggering 1.1millionC. But this week stargazers were astonished when the 660-foot-wide icy rock disappeared around the back side of the sun, coming within 87,000 miles of its surface, and emerged triumphantly out the other side. This was the comet that lived. What’s more, Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory caught the great escape on camera. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured Comet Lovejoy diving past the sun just 87,000 miles from the surface - and surviving the 'graze' Heat is on: Lovejoy emerges from the clutches of the Sun and was spotted escaping by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory . After the dramatic event it tweeted: ‘Breaking News! Lovejoy lives! The comet Lovejoy has survived its journey around the sun to reemerge on the other side.’ Lovejoy was only discovered on November 27 this year and was named after the amateur Australian astronomer who spotted it, Terry Lovejoy. It is classed as a ‘Kreutz sungrazer’, which is a class of comet whose orbit comes very close to the Sun. They are named after the 19th-century German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz, who figured out that they are actually the remains of one huge comet that broke apart. Soon after Lovejoy was found three separate space agencies excitedly began tracking its trajectory – Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Its fate was quickly marked as doomed because it would rush headlong into the Sun’s hellish corona. Age: 4.5billion years . Distance from Earth: 92million miles . Diameter: 865,000 miles (in comparison the Earth is 7926 miles) Temperature at core: 15,000,000C . Composition: Hydrogen (73 per cent), helium (25 per cent) and the rest is carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron . Writing on the Sungrazing Comets website, Naval Research Laboratory scientist Karl Battams said: ‘We have here an exceptionally rare opportunity to observe the complete vaporization of a relatively large comet, and we have approximately 18 instruments on five different satellites that are trying to do just that.’ However, Lovejoy had other ideas and in a brief, but very clear, clip can be seen zooming away to safety from the Sun’s fiery clutches. Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, was stunned by Lovejoy's close encounter. He told MailOnline: ‘It was an extraordinary event. Lovejoy was incredibly close to the Sun, closer to the Sun than the Earth is to the Moon. ‘And it’s certainly a pretty rare event. The Solar Heliospheric Observatory [Note: the video is from the Solar Dynamics Observatory] has seen many examples of comets being destroyed as they approached the Sun and there was a great deal of interest in this because there was an expectation of spectacular debris. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured Comet Lovejoy's 'brush with death' - astronomers predicted the comet would be destroyed, but it survived . ‘I suppose if something is big and tough enough it will survive. This event tells us that the comet was rather more robust than expected. Doubtless it had a very rough ride though!’ Mr Massey explained that comets have probably survived skirmishes with the Sun before, but we just haven’t been able to see them. ‘It just shows how good the technology is now,’ he added.","Comet Lovejoy was expected to vaporize but the 660-foot-wide rock was filmed making a great escape .

"When they took just one point from Chelsea and Manchester City in the space of a week, any title challenge from Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United was written off. Their defence was porous, their midfield void of invention and their forwards misfiring. Even David Moyes had fared better than the new Dutch boss. A winter of discontent lay in store as November beckoned. But the forecast has changed at Old Trafford. Winter, thus far, has been a season of contentment for Van Gaal. The title race, having doubled in size when Chelsea stalled and City surged, now has a third competitor. United, after six wins on the spin, have hit top speed. Wayne Rooney is mobbed by his Manchester United team-mates after opening the scoring against Liverpool . Rooney sent Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones the wrong way to set up United's win over their chief rivals . Louis van Gaal has transformed United in the past six weeks, in which his side have won six times . As it stands: The Premier League table on Monday . The 3-0 victory over Liverpool was not without its flaws and they did, of course, need goalkeeper David de Gea at his best. But there was an air of inevitability about their triumph; such expectancy is what has marked United as champions throughout the Premier League era. They were quicker, stronger, more hungry and clinical. There was cunning, too, exemplified by the brilliant Michael Carrick. Van Gaal, it was said, was considering Carrick for the captain’s role before he was injured in the same week as the manager’s unveiling. Armband or not, he is leading their renaissance. Six starts: six wins. His return has facilitated the realisation of this team’s potential, of which there were early-season glimpses. Now, it is there for all to see. Robin van Persie, having baffled all with his failure to produce despite the arrival of his mentor, now has four goals from four games. Without his strikes two seasons back, Sir Alex Ferguson would not have signed off with a league winner’s medal. Likewise this time around - without an on-form and on-target Van Persie, they cannot challenge. At Southampton, where United were admittedly poor, the Dutch striker had two chances and took them both. They won 2-1. That is the difference. Then there is Wayne Rooney. While Van Persie has four in four, the captain has three in that period. Having worn a frown for much of last season, he is playing with a smile, free of the pressure which had appeared to weigh so heavily amid the failings of his team-mates. Robin van Persie has scored four goals in his last four games to find his best form again at last . The return of Michael Carrick (left) has provided experience and helped inspire United's recent resurgence . David de Gea (centre) has been a rock in goal, almost single-handedly repelling Liverpool on Sunday . Even the supporting cast are now playing their part; Juan Mata, Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young are all enjoying new direction under Van Gaal. 20 Dec Aston Villa vs Man Utd . 26 Dec Man Utd vs Newcastle . 28 Dec Tottenham vs Man Utd . 1 Jan Stoke vs Man Utd . 4 Jan Accrington or Yeovil vs Man Utd (FA Cup third round) 11 Jan Man Utd v Southampton . 17 Jan QPR v Man Utd . 31 Jan Man Utd v Leicester . Fellaini, aided by Carrick, is helping to shield a backline previously left brutally exposed. They have conceded just once at Old Trafford in six hours and, in De Gea, they finally boast a goalkeeper worthy of mention alongside the likes of Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. Monday’s Champions League draw took place minus the previously ubiquitous United. But that is no bad thing. Even better, they managed to dodge the Europa League and made an early exit from the Capital One Cup. Chelsea, meanwhile, have a League Cup quarter-final at Derby County on Wednesday, while Europe will serve as a distraction to domestic affairs when the knockout rounds resume with a tie against Paris Saint-Germain in February. Manchester City, too, are not without their worries. Sergio Aguero is sidelined until the new year, as is his replacement Edin Dzeko and skipper Vincent Kompany. Barcelona lie in wait in the Champions League and then there is Frank Lampard, match-winner again on Saturday and a player they can ill afford to lose to the MLS, where he is contracted to play in 2015.

Before the new year, United face Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham. They will be favourites to extend their winning run to nine matches, all the while quickening the pace in pursuit of the top two. It is all a far cry from the anonymity of their mid-table malaise just six weeks ago. Chelsea were as good as champions, City would take second and, as for United, they could do battle with Southampton, Swansea and West Ham for the Europa League places. They were 10th, residing only in the top half by virtue of goal difference over West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United. They were closer to the bottom than the top.

"A Tampa, Florida police captain exclaimed 'I can't believe what I've done' after fatally shooting a fellow moviegoer because he was texting, a witness said.

He and other witnesses gave their account of events in Pasco County court today as Reeves asks to be released on bail. He has been in jail without bond ever since the January 13 shooting.

Reeves teared up as his daughter acted as a character witness . Lost husband: Nicole Oulson (left), the widow of Reeves' victim Chad Oulson, also appeared in court today . Witness Mark Turner overheard the fight, and said he heard Oulson say: 'Do you mind, I've got a voicemail from by babysitter. I'd like to check to see that my daughter is okay.' After more requests to stop using his phone, Oulson got up and threw a small bag of popcorn at Reeves, Turner said. 'Almost immediately the gun came out, the shot was fired and it went back into Mr. Reeves' lap,' Turner said. Hamilton remembers Reeves yelling at his wife after the incident, after she said 'That was no cause to shoot anyone.' 'He leaned back around and stuck his finger out as to scold her and said, ""You shut your [expletive] mouth and don't say another word,""' Hamilton testified. Reeves officially plead not-guilty today to second-degree murder, with his defense lawyers arguing that Reeves was defending himself from Oulson, who committed battery by throwing an unknown object and a bag of popcorn at the older man.They also say Reeves is entitled to special legal protection because of his advanced age. Locked up: Reeves has been in jail without bond ever since the fatal January 13 shooting . According to Hamilton's testimony, Reeves approached him after the shooting and said: 'I just got hit by something and look at my eye'. But Hamilton says he didn't see any injury on Reeves' face. Both Hamilton and Turner say they didn't see Oulson hit or punch Reeves. These new perspectives on the fatal altercation came the same day that family and friends of Reeves acted as character witnesses for the accused murderer. Thomas DePolis, who worked with Reeves to create a SWAT team for the Tampa Police department said: 'There's nothing in my affiliation with him that would lead me to believe that he's a danger.' Devastated: The killing of Chad Oulson, center, has left 22-month-old Lexy, right, without a father and Nicole Oulson a widow . Heartbroken: Nicole Oulson spoke to Good Morning America about the loss of her husband, Chad. She said she wants his killer locked up forever . Torn apart: She said the killer left her without the love of her life, Chad, center, and Lexy without a daddy . Reeves 40-eyar-old daughter Jennifer Shaw also testified on her father's behalf, describing him as a man who dedicated his time to his family and went to church every Sunday. 'My father was present at everything. My parents seemed to realize that investing time in your family was the most important thing,' Ms Shaw said. She said all the weapons have been removed from the house she shares with her parents by her brother who is a Tampa police officer. The family are willing to but their $186,0000 house as collateral for bond. Florida Police Captain Curtis Reeves, Jr., suspected of fatally shooting Chad Oulson, 43, and wounding his wife, Nicole, 33, appears via video at an earlier court appearance wearing a suicide-prevention gown . The judge didn't make a decision on whether to release Reeves today. His bail hearing will continue on Friday. However, the judge  did decide that surveillance footage from the movie theater would be aired in court and released 30-days after. It is not clear though whether that footage will be available to view by the general public. Florida has some of the broadest public records laws in the nation. Almost any document released to the defense in a court case can be open to the public.

"It was supposed to be her acting comeback, a triumphant debut on stage in London's West End in the production of Speed The Plow. But sadly for Lindsay Lohan, things didn't exactly go to plan on her opening night on Wednesday. While not an unmitigated disaster, the 28-year-old actress didn't appear to know her lines off by heart, reading some from a book while being fed others from the side of stage. And to makes matters worse, her one main passionate speech only succeeded in causing the audience to burst into laughter, according to onlookers. A job well done! Lindsay lapped up the roaring applause from the audience at the conclusion of the play despite some unintentional laughter throughout . The three-act play, written by David Mamet, tells the story of two Hollywood hot shots, Bobbie Gould and Charlie Fox (Richard Schiff and Nigel Lindsay), who both attempt to bed their new secretary, Karen (Lohan). While those in the audience agreed Lohan looked beautiful, reaction was decidedly mixed on her performance. Nico Hines from The Daily Beast said: 'Lindsay Lohan only has one major speech in the David Mamet play that marks her West End debut. Unfortunately, she couldn’t remember how it went. 'On the first night of previews, a work-in-progress feel is to be expected. But halfway through the second act of Speed-the-Plow, the audience was openly laughing at Lohan’s struggle to grasp Mamet’s sharp, trademark dialogue.' Bravo! At the end of the evening the Mean Girls star was gifted with a large bouquet of flowers for all her hard work . Life . imitating art... The script lifts the lid on the underbelly of . Hollywood and was penned by Pulitzer Prize-winning screenwriter David . Mamet . Chic: Lindsay looked stylish in a black suit and white shirt combo while her red locks were worn out . He said the audience sat patiently through the first prompt, but noted that her second 'led to titters' in the stalls. He . added: 'Unfortunately for Lohan, the next line delivered by Richard . Schiff (Toby from The West Wing) was: ""You have done a fantastic job!"". The laughter grew louder.' At one point, Mr Hines said a woman in the crowd moaned 'Oh my God, it's so embarrassing' during a set change. She also . caused unintentional hilarity with one particular section of her speech . when the Hollywood bad girl, who has spent time in jail and rehab, said . (in character as Karen), 'I know what it is to be bad, I’ve been bad.' Entertaining plot: Lilo's character Karen is a secretary to a Hollywood executive who tries to manipulate her way to success . For me? Lindsay looked taken aback when an assistant ran up to hand her the beautiful blooms . Jitters: According to some audience members on Twitter, the star forgot a few of her lines . Onlookers . revealed this caused the entire theatre to burst into laughter, . something which Lohan would not have been too pleased with. Others were willing to cut Lohan a bit of slack on her first night. One source told MailOnline: 'She was just fine, she did forget . her lines a couple of times, but covered it up like a pro. She was a . pleasant surprise for sure. 'Lindsay's . character was quite interesting and she immersed herself in the role, . she was very strong in the second scene which was her biggest one.' Centre stage: But the jury is out on Lindsay's West End debut . A . new chapter: 'I’m hoping it’ll take away attention from me as a . celebrity name and draw attention to the fact that I’m an actress,' Lindsay told Time Out . Knuckling down: 'I’m at a point when I want a diligent routine and I really want to get back into work' The . source added: 'She looked amazing... I was in awe of her. It was no . means a perfect performance and she's certainly no Judi Dench, but she . wasn't awful. 'There . is a line where she says ""I know what it is to be bad, I've been bad"" and the audience all cracked up laughing but she got great applause in . the curtain call and someone passed her flowers from audience.' And . Twitter reaction was decidedly mixed: 'User @toflee wrote: 'So Lindsay . Lohan had her lines written down in a book & also got fed a line. Total car crash.' Rehearsals: . The actress has relocated to London for the role. 'Being here in London . is all about me this time,' she told MailOnline . Big shoes to fill: In 1988 Linday's character Karen was also portrayed by chart-topper Madonna . Good luck! The actress took to the stage in a white dress while sipping red wine . And ‏@rafayfay added: 'Major kudos to the woman who was feeding Lindsay Lohan her lines from offstage at #speedtheplow.' ‏@mizukawaseiwa . tweeted: 'Oh my, and Richard Schiff! - @thedailybeast: London laughs at . Lindsay Lohan's West End debut: http://trib.al/NdR3tLp .' However, . there were some positive reviews with ‏@SamuelCh writing, 'Loved love . loved #speedtheplow !! @lindsaylohan was superb in the 3rd act! Such an . amazing actress!!

"In football terms, ITV Sport has been on a bit of a losing streak with their coverage of the game. With the next year or so promising a rather pale mix of highlights shows and live England games, it's certainly not the end of the world. But presumably as a result, it was recently announced that two of their most worthy assistants Matt Smith and Andy Townsend would, in the language of these things, be 'parting company' with the channel at the end of the season. Now it has been announced that the gaffer has also gone. After nearly five years at the helm, we have been told that Adrian Chiles has now left 'with immediate effect'. Mark Pougatch has been quickly drafted in, certainly at least temporarily, to front their changing football coverage. Were ITV thinking that, perhaps, the Puckish Brummie may not go quite so gently into that good night? Adrian Chiles, who has been replaced as ITV's lead football host, pictured in west London on Friday . Broadcaster Mark Pougatch was named as ITV Sport's new lead football presenter on Friday . Chiles appeared in good spirits despite the news, as he walked near his home in west London . Not that you're going to be asking your waiter 'didn't you used to be Adrian Chiles?' any time soon. Since launching his career working in the business news department at the BBC, he has been, and still remains, a broadcasting heavy hitter. Even from those early days in that rather austere corner of telly, he was being seen as the kind of personality who could bring an 'everyman' touch to his work. And, laudably, he was doing so with an accent and appearance that wasn't straight off the Corporation’s production line. So when they decided that their new Sunday night version of Match of the Day would need to have a fresh approach to that of the Saturday night flagship, they no doubt also knew they had just the man in the ranks to bring that approach. Chiles had been there, bought the West Brom season ticket. And so it was that MOTD 2 launched in 2004 with a man at the helm with no parting in his hair and an excitable, scattergun, sometimes frenzied editorial approach that was more like the caller on 606 than it was the cool, controlled anchor. What's more, he also liked to find funny little crowd shots or cock ups and hit us with a one liner over them. Just the kind of thing we do ourselves at home or down the pub. Chiles, pictured as a young boy growing up in Worcestershire in and out of sporting attire, has left ITV . Chiles came to prominence as the presenter of BBC's Match of the Day 2 show that was launched in 2004 . During his time on the BBC, Chiles also presented 'The One Show' which was first aired in 2007 . Chiles (right) formed a successful on-screen relationship with Christine Bleakley during the weekday show . In other words, Chiles was never going to be another Des Lynam. Not least because there will never be another Des Lynam. But also because Chiles was his own man, a natural who also happened to have well-honed presenting skills. What you see is what you get. It was something that quickly then saw him also moving into prime time with the One Show. Then ITV came along. The big-money deal was made in 2010, which meant Adrian was now moving from his quirky late night magazine football show into hours and hours of live broadcasting (including, albeit briefly, a new breakfast show) under the glaring spotlight of our most successful commercial station. And this is where the mood began to change. It was a bit like watching an excellent magician, who wowed you up-close with tricks at the dinner table, trying to become David Copperfield on the Las Vegas stage - but using the same old pack of cards with which to do so. The settings were now Champions League venues, European Championships and World Cups. Big Football. Chiles left BBC for ITV Sport in 2010 and had worked there for almost five years prior to his departure . Chiles presented ITV's Champions League coverage but the channel will not show live games next season . Thankfully, what Chiles didn't try to do was change his personality to fit. That would have made him look like a fake, which I don't see him as. But he didn't adjust his approach. This became particularly clear with his frequent launching of custard pies in the direction of, in particular, Martin O'Neil and Roy Keane. These would often come back with interest. Chiles was determined to maintain the sense that we were all just a bunch of pals watching the footy down the pub together. But it increasingly didn't seem to sit well. Even his determination to keep his little zingers over funny pictures going from the MOTD 2 days began to feel forced, that he was trying too hard, being offbeat for offbeat's sake. And yet there was still something left in the tank for last summer. From their fold-up chairs on the beach, and with their collection of knobbly knees on full display, I thought ITV's coverage of Rio 2014 really hit the right note. And Adrian himself was just one knotted handkerchief on the head away from being that fella who had first left his seat at The Hawthorns 10 years ago to make a bunch of old pros look at football through the fans' eyes. It turns out that this would probably have been the ideal way for Adrian Chiles to close that particular chapter of his broadcasting story.

"Rachel Gow, 29, from Haslingden, Lancashire, struggled to overcome the death of her mother, and desperately wanted a family of her own, an inquest heard . A high-flying health service administrator killed herself when depressed, anxious and concerned that she was about to turn 30 without marrying or starting a family, an inquest heard. Graduate Rachel Gow, who was also struggling to recover from the death of her mother, wanted to walk up the aisle and have children. She became troubled that her siblings were ‘doing better than her’, the hearing was told. Two months before her 30th birthday, she texted her engineer boyfriend, Anton Tsarev, 30, wishing him ‘all the best for the future’. He found her body on the floor when he returned to the house they shared. Her family and boyfriend told the hearing of their devastation that the ‘kind and generous’ self-confessed ‘dizzy blonde’ hadn’t lived to see her dreams fulfilled. After doing well at school, where she enjoyed dancing and playing the violin, Miss Gow studied at Lancaster University where she graduated with a 2:1 in history, the hearing was told. She most recently secured a job as an administrator at Royal Bolton Hospital. In a statement read to the hearing, her brother Stephen Best and sister Sarah Davidson said: ‘Her greatest wish was to settle down and get married.’ She had been through three break-ups before meeting Mr Tsarev in May 2012, they said, and had been very badly affected by the death of her mother Connie, a primary school teacher, from cancer at the age of 66. The couple moved into a house in Haslingden, Lancashire in 2013, and according to family and friends seemed content. ‘Following the death of her mother, Rachel had a period of independence,’ her siblings’ statement continued. ‘She met Anton and they were both extremely happy. He moved in. They had lots in common. But she could not overcome her previous sadness and felt Anton would leave her. She was looking forward to turning 30, planning trips to Italy with Anton and going to Vegas for her birthday, she was saving money every month. ‘But the relationship became unstable and they tried to make it work.’ Mr Tsarev told the hearing in Burnley: ‘Our relationship had a lot of ups and downs due to her insecurities. She constantly felt I was going to leave her but this was not the case.’ Miss Gow went to see a psychologist last September as she struggled to cope with the approaching milestone as well as the anniversary of her mother’s death. ‘She felt she was not where she should be in life,’ Mr Tsarev said. The inquest was told that she was worried her boyfriend Anton Tsarev, 30, would leave her, and suffered a number of insecurities about the relationship . Miss Gow, who was due to celebrate her 30th birthday in January this year, went to see a psychologist in September 2014 . He added that his girlfriend felt that she should be married with children by now and that her siblings were doing better than her. ‘This was something she struggled with,’ he said. She had also talked about suicide techniques but he had regarded the comments as being ‘in the heat of the moment,’ he added. The day before Rachel was found last November 1, the couple went to her father's house to look after his dog while he was away. But in the morning, the couple had an argument over a text message Miss Gow had found on Mr Tsarev's phone from someone else. He said: 'In the morning we both got up. I had my phone on charge in the bed room. She looked at it. She came into the living room very upset telling me to leave. She had found texts on my phone from someone. They were not out of the ordinary. She didn't see it that way.' Mr Tsarev told the inquest that his girlfriend felt that she should be married with children and that her siblings were doing better than her . Later that the day couple drove home to their house in Haslingden and Anton went out to visit a friend in Preston. He said: 'She was still upset when we arrived home. She was very agitated. This was not a new thing.' He told the court he had left the house after picking some clothes  and went to stay somewhere else for a while. Miss Gow was an 'outgoing, adventurous and loving' young woman . He added: 'I got a text from her wishing me the best for the future. It was common place after an argument so I didn't think anything of it.' However Mr Tsarev 'had a really bad feeling' so he decided to go back to Haslingden to see if everything was alright. He said: ' I went into the lounge. The lights were off but the fire was on. I could see her body lying on the floor.' The inquest was told that Anton performed CPR on Miss Gow until emergency services arrived just before 9pm, but Miss Gow was pronounced dead. Tests showed Miss Gow had died from hypoxia. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Richard Taylor said: 'We have a girl who is severely troubled by a number of aspects of her life. 'As I understand it she was having a slightly more positive year because of new employment. But she clearly had difficulties and at some stage she purchased the items with which she took her own life. 'It appears from her actions she did that with intent to end her life.' In a statement Mr Tsarev said: 'Everyone is devastated by Rachel's death. It's a tragic loss for everyone, I'm absolutely heartbroken. 'Being around her was so easy, we enjoyed all the same things and we loved going walking together in the Lake District. Rachel did a lot of travelling all over the world and she was very adventurous and loved life. 'She was a fantastic person who inspired everyone around her. She was still grieving for her mum - they were very close. She really did miss her mum, she always spoke very highly of her.' Miss Gow's brother Stephen Best added: 'Through all of our grief and sadness, it is essential that we remind ourselves of why we all loved her. Rachel was effervescent, full of fun and laughter, and could tell a brilliant joke. Sister Sarah Davidson said: 'She was very popular and made friends easily. She was a kind and generous person who made other people feel at ease. She was a treasured sister and was wonderful with children.'","Rachel Gow, 29, struggled to overcome the death of her mother, Connie .

"There was a serious case of bad dresses on good bodies at the Golden Globes last night. From Lucy Liu in what could only have been inspired by wallpaper, to Emily Mortimer's sequined style sin, the stylists in charge should surely be sacked. Halle Berry, who has one of the most sensational figures in Tinseltown, failed to impress on the red carpet in a cutaway printed gown. Scroll down for video . Overexposed: Halle Berry, who has one of the most sensational figures in Tinseltown, failed to impress on the Golden Globes red carpet in a cutaway printed Versace gown . The design, by Versace, appeared to . have been carelessly sliced apart at the midriff and thigh, and the . bodice seemed far too tight, even on a waist as slim as Halle's. The split in the dated pink printed . skirt did at least allow the star to do her best impression of . 'Angelina's leg', and the nude court shoes were, at least, an elegant, . understated choice. Lucy Liu's Carolina Herrera gown also stood out for all the wrong reasons. While the smiling star no doubt felt . like a princess in the full-skirted Carolina Herrera gown - and we . applaud her risk-taking - the print seemed to be more appropriate for . wallpaper or a tablecloth than an evening gown. Sienna Miller - usually a regular on the best-dressed list - fell short for us this evening too. The wallpaper look: Lucy Liu's Carolina Herrera gown stood out for all the wrong reasons . Arm candy: The only saving grace of Jennifer Westfeldt's confusing look was that she arrived on the arm of Jon Hamm (left). Eva Longoria's Emilio Pucci gown had too-deep splits at the chest and thigh (right) She said she wanted to support . British fashion, so selected a gown by Erdem. And while the look is sure . to impress fashion insiders, it didn't do many favors for her figure. The top part sat awkwardly on her . bust, and was positioned slightly off-center above the column skirt. On . the plus side, the simple hair and make-up was a wise choice with a busy . print - the soft pink lip, in particular, looked fresh and pretty. Unfortunately little could save Emily . Mortimer's look. The silver sequin gown was just that little bit too . tight and clung in all the wrong places. Missing the mark: Nene Leakes looked ready for . work in her bizarre shirt-dress (left) while Julia Louis-Dreyfus was . channeling 1991 in her dated gown (right) Perhaps it would have worked if the . neckline were not as high and the cut not quite as austere, but on this . occasion there was nothing to save it. Perhaps Emily's serious . expression indicates that she knows this all too well. It was an issue shared by Rosario Dawson, though, whose powder-blue peplum added unnecessary bulk to her otherwise slim frame. Nene Leakes - who has successfully . elevated her profile from Real Housewife to serious actress with roles . in Glee and The New Normal - made an unlikely choice in a shirt-style . dress. The full skirt . could not save it from looking too office-like to be a real success . though, and for such a flamboyant personality, the expectations for a . fun choice were higher. Unflattering: Rosario Dawson (left) and Emily Mortimer (right) wore dresses that failed to do their slim figures favors. Sienna Miller's gown is sure to please fashionistas, but looks awkward to the average eye (center) At the other end of the scale, though, was actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, whose corseted gown with layers of brown chiffon and black lace looked like a design from circa 1991 - and not in a good way. Nicole Richie was another starlet . who missed the mark on the red carpet in a floor length gown that looked . slightly as if it had been made out of pale blue curtains. An over fussy pattern, combined with a high neck and long sleeve swamped the petite stars tiny frame. Over-the-top: Nicole's intricately patterned dress and thick blue eyeshadow did the petite star no favours . The reality-star-turned-designer also was sporting some less than flattering make- up; seemingly having gone a little overboard with the fake tan. The slightly orange hue and heavy blue eye makeup served to make the 31-year-old look far older than her years. Zosia Mamet was another star who seriously misjudged her makeup. Perhaps taking her role as the virginal prude in Girls a little too far, she ruined a stunning fitted black gown by completely abstaining from any makeup or accessories. With her hair pull back too tightly and looking a little greasy she looked decidedly drab and dull next to her glamorous red carpet companions. Both Jessica Alba (right) and Zosia Mamet (left) wore elegant classic cut dresses, but both managed to spoil their look; Alba with her creature-like bag, and Zosia with a decided lack of make-up and jewelry . Jessica Alba similarly managed to detract from a stunning dress with some poor accessory choices. While her bold salmon coloured dress wowed crowds and set of her skin tone perfectly, the look was let down by her furry clutch bag. Closely resembling a muppet, the furry monstrosity looked like it may jump to life at any minute, and rather detracted from the otherwise polished look. Breaking Bad’s Anna  Gunn suffered a serious bad hair day. While her dress was a bit of a frock horror it was her dodgy 80s hair that needed work. Her ‘do’ suggested she was dragged through a bush on the way over to the awards or simply misplaced her hair brush. A safer bet would have been some sleek finger waves or a more polished do like Amy Adams or Hedi Klum. From top to toe: Kerry Washington (right) seems to have forgotten the end of her dress, while Anna Gunn's (left) hair looks like she had an altercation with a rather angry rose bush on her way to the awards . Kerry Washington is usually a staple of ‘best dressed’ lists, but last night she seemed to have left the bottom of her dress at home. Her sheer nude dress ticked all the right boxes from the knees upwards, but there was some seriously unflattering ankle flapping happening from the usually stylish beauty. That being said, there weren't too . many fashion faux pas at the Golden Globes this year. Perhaps years of attacks from fashion police has taught the A-list that it is wiser to play it safe in flattering black and ethereal beiges . and nudes. Thank goodness there are still a few who are brave enough to give us something to talk about.","Lucy Liu appeared to be wearing a dress made out of wallpaper, and there were some serious style sins committed with sequins ."

There were no details on how Mrs Codd was killed. Police said earlier this week that Owens was also being looked at in the disappearance of 18-year-old college student Zebb Quinn in 2000. The student vanished 15 years ago after going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. Quinn, who has not been seen since January 2, 2000, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told Fox Carolina. Asheville Police Sgt. Dave Romick told ABC: 'Owens was a friend of Zebb Quinn. He was a person of interest almost immediately. Over the course of 15 years, he has become the primary person of interest.' Owens was never charged in the disappearance. Police found the remains of the Codds  in Buncombe County after the couple were reported missing on Sunday. Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan said at a news conference Friday that deputies think the Codds were dead for three days before officers were called to their home. Search warrants say Owens threw away a trash bag with one victim's belongings on Sunday. Duncan wouldn't talk about a motive for the killing. Warrants show deputies took 11 knives and a saw blade from Owens' home. Owens, who the couple had hired to work on their home, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday. Following Zebb Quinn's disappearance, Owens told police that while they were on their way to see the car, his friend pulled over and said he had to go, after being left in a 'frantic state' from a message he had received. The 18-year-old student hasn't been seen since. On January 3, 2000, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the Quinn's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, was found in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was parked at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Ms Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield. The puppy was later adopted by a police officer. Ms Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. She added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.'
