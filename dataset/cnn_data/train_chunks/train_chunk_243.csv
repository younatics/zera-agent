"Jerusalem (CNN) -- International leaders and top Israeli officials attended a state memorial ceremony Monday for Israel's former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who died last week. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair were among those at the official ceremony outside Israel's parliament, the Knesset. Under bright sunshine, rows of mourners gathered around Sharon's coffin over which the blue-and-white Israeli flag was draped. ""You never rested when in service of your people, when defending your land and when making it flourish,"" said Israeli President Shimon Peres, who delivered a eulogy to Sharon at the beginning of the ceremony. A towering military and political leader, Sharon died Saturday after eight years in a coma. Peres, a friend and sometimes rival of Sharon's, compared him to ""a lion,"" saying he'd contributed ""an unforgettable chapter"" to Israel's history. 'A complex man' Wearing a skullcap and sunglasses, Biden sat alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In his speech, Biden praised the tenacity of Sharon, a divisive figure in the Middle East. ""Prime Minister Sharon was a complex man ... who engendered strong opinions from everyone,"" he said. ""But like all historic leaders -- all real leaders -- he had a North Star that guided him, a North Star from which he never, in my observation, never deviated. His North Star was the survival of the state of Israel and the Jewish people, wherever they resided."" The memorial was followed by a funeral procession that included a stop in Latrun for a special meeting of the Israel Defense Forces and ended with a military funeral at Sharon's Shikmim Ranch. Sharon was wounded in Latrun in 1948 during Israel's war for independence. He was buried at the ranch in the southern Negev desert. Security was tight throughout. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, spokesman of the Israeli military, said that two rockets fired from Gaza landed around Sha'ar Hanagev in southern Israel. He could not confirm the proximity of where the rockets landed to the funeral. There were no reports of injuries. 'One of the giants' Thousands of people Sunday paid their last respects to Sharon as his body lay in state outside the parliament. ""He was one of the giants. He was very special,"" said Ayala Weisel, who said she grew up learning of Sharon as a widely admired soldier who fought for his country. She was one of many mourners who shared memories of Sharon. Chaim Friedman, a tour guide, described Sharon as a decisive leader. ""He was known as the bulldozer because he got his way and he made things happen. He's well respected for that,"" Friedman said. ""Sometimes in Israel, you have to do it the straight way, or you have to find the other way to get things done, and he managed to do it."" Read more: Sharon's life on the front lines . A darker view . But others have painted a darker picture of Sharon's legacy. And the same decisions that made Sharon a controversial figure during his lengthy tenure as a military man and politician were back on display in the initial reactions to his death. These moments include his role as defense minister during the 1982 war in Lebanon. During that conflict, he was held indirectly responsible by an Israeli inquiry in 1983 for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. He was forced to resign. He also raised ire in the Arab world by encouraging Israelis to build settlements on occupied Palestinian land but later did an about-face and pushed for the historic withdrawal from settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, which were turned over to Palestinian rule for the first time in nearly four decades. ""We deal with the death of Sharon as an end for the crimes he committed against the Palestinian people,"" said Isra Almodallal, a spokeswoman for Hamas, the Palestinian movement that runs Gaza. ""The biggest crime was the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, and we deal with Sharon as a criminal person."" Read more: Five things to know about Sharon .

"(CNN) -- If it were a heavyweight boxing contest it would probably be ruled a mismatch. Paul McGinley versus Tom Watson. A cut-above European Tour player against a PGA Tour -- and just about everywhere else -- golfing legend. In the blue corner, a man with precisely zero major titles -- tied sixth his best finish. In the red, an eight-time major champion -- and so nearly nine, improbably aged almost 60, at the 2009 British Open. Ryder Cup captaincy experience? Next year is McGinley's first match in charge, although he was twice on winning sides as a vice-captain. Watson led the 1993 United States team which shocked Europe at its beloved Belfry to wrest back the famous trophy. Playing record in the biennial sporting showdown? McGinley two wins and two halves from nine matches. Watson, 10 wins and a half from 15 matches. But if the prospect of going head to head against a sporting icon in the ultimate in team sports competition has left him fazed, McGinley is showing little sign of it. As the European captain, the genial 46-year-old Irishman will pit his wits against Watson, who not only has won five British Open titles, but is revered in Scotland where the 2014 match will take place at the famous Gleneagles course. With a year to go until the first shots are struck in anger in Perthshire, McGinley is well aware that the David vs. Goliath nature of the contest, at least as far as the team captains are concerned, is a talking point. ""Four of Tom's Open championships came here in Scotland, he's got a real affinity with the people, so he's going to bring that very strong dynamic to his team,"" McGinley told CNN's Living Golf program. ""He won in 1993, away from home as well, so I don't underestimate him, neither do the players. ""He'll make some astute decisions, no doubt about that. But ultimately it's not between myself and Tom Watson, it's about 12 players in each team and how well they play. ""As much as the captains are important, it's really about the 24 players."" Leading golf journalist Bill Elliott, who has covered every Ryder Cup since 1977, said while the captain's role was clearly influential, it was sometimes overstated. ""In many ways a captain can lose the Ryder Cup, but in the end it is very difficult for him to win it,"" said Elliott, who is the Editor at Large of Golf Monthly magazine. ""McGinley is hugely respected and represents all those players who have made a very good living but are not superstars. ""I think it's healthy that you can become a Ryder Cup captain without winning majors."" Where McGinley may also have an advantage is that he remains a full-time member of the European Tour and gets to see his likely team and picks close up on the golf course. The 64-year-old Watson, by contrast, plays on the U.S. seniors' Champions Tour, occasional appearances in the majors excepted. Veteran campaigner . ""I think I'm the second oldest guy with a card on Tour, but I still enjoy playing,"" McGinley said. ""I played well last season with a couple of top-five finishes, so when I play well, I'm still able to compete."" It has also enabled him to sample at first hand the layout at Gleneagles, where battle will be joined from September 26-28 next year. McGinley played all four rounds of the recent Johnnie Walker Championship, the last tournament to be played on the Perthshire course before the 40th Ryder Cup contest. ""I'll be watching the positions in the fairway and wondering if there's anything I can change or if there's anything we need to change to maximize and give our team an advantage next year,"" he told CNN before the event. ""We've got the experience of playing 10 years around here, the Johnnie Walker Championship, a lot of us know the pin positions and how the course is normally set up, we can use that to our advantage."" But like his predecessors as European captain before him, Colin Montgomerie and Jose Maria Olazabal, McGinley admits that his own playing performances have suffered. Career sacrifice . ""It's tough. There's no doubt there's a lot of challenges, all the previous captains have taught me how difficult it is to focus on your own career,"" he said. McGinley's peak came between 2002 and 2006, when he played on three successive winning European teams. Although his overall personal record is mediocre, it was his 10-foot putt on the 18th to secure a half against Jim Furyk at The Belfry in 2002 which secured the cup for Europe. A respected elder statesman, he was a natural to assist both Montgomerie and Olazabal as a vice-captain in their victorious campaigns. It also put him firmly in the frame to step up when the choices were being made for the 2014 match. With Montgomerie and former major winners such as Sandy Lyle and Darren Clarke also being touted for the prestigious job, McGinley's failure to reach the very top of the game as a player was thought to count against him. Ryder Cup standout Lee Westwood, although an admirer of McGinley, went public with his support for Clarke. ""Paul has played three Ryder Cups, Darren has played five, won a major championship and a lot of other tournaments worldwide. You have to have criteria somewhere and he edges it for me,"" the Englishman was quoted as saying. Unanimous choice . McGinley admits that by the time the process reached a conclusion with a vote of the Players' Committee in Abu Dhabi in January, he was resigned to his fate. ""If the captaincy hadn't come my way it wouldn't be the end of the world for me, and to be honest in the last week or so before the vote I had been fatalistic about it,"" he revealed. McGinley was eventually the unanimous choice of the committee and has set about forging his own imprint on the team; winning an extra captain's pick -- two became three -- was the first task accomplished. ""It's going so fast. I can't believe it's been six months since I was appointed, but fortunately it's going very well so far,"" he said. The acid test will come in the autumn of next year when McGinley makes those crucial three picks then attempts to lead his team to their eighth win in the last 10 stagings. The last two matches at Celtic Manor and Medinah, where Europe recovered from a four-point overnight deficit to score a spectacular triumph, have been desperately tight and McGinley believes they act as motivation for the United States team. ""They are obviously keen to sort this out. Tom Watson is here to do business and he is taken this on ... again ... at his age ... for a reason: to win it."" Elliott is already predicting another tense affair and believes it adds to the magic of the Ryder Cup. Close contest . ""It's better if there is only a half-point or point in it and it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if America were to win it, to help retain the interest of their public in the event."" He believes that the visitors could not have chosen a better captain than the legendary Watson. ""He even has a legend's voice, with so much gravitas! ""He will boost the American team and is particularly adored in Scotland, where he has had a love affair with the country after winning the British Open four times."" McGinley is also popular wherever he plays and takes great heart from the ""incredible"" performance of Europe's women in the Solheim Cup against the United States, beating the hosts by eight points in Colorado last month. ""I hope this will propel the Ladies European Tour to a brighter commercial future, like the Ryder Cup did for us,"" he said. Certainly the exploits of the late Severiano Ballesteros helped to send golf into wider markets, with other major winners such as Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ian Woosnam, Sandy Lyle and Olazabal giving the European team the basis for continued success. Gleneagles countdown . But McGinley believes there is greater strength in depth now. ""Back then we had six or seven really strong players, maybe four or five not so strong, and there would be a heavy dependence on the star men. ""It's different now, illustrated last year (at Medinah) when Jose Maria played all 12 players on the first day."" Whether McGinley employs the same inclusive approach at Gleneagles, only time will tell, but he gained the reputation of being an astute tactician when he led the Great Britain and Ireland team to wins over Continental Europe in the Seve Trophy in 2009 and 2011. ""He's a detail man and that should make him a very good Ryder Cup captain,"" said Elliott. Watson will surely inspire the U.S. to great heights next year, so it remains to be seen if McGinley can match him in a fascinating subplot to the eventual outcome.","Paul McGinley is captain of the European team for the 2014 Ryder Cup .

"Washington (CNN) -- For political junkies, 2013 was expected to be a quiet year following the presidential election and it basically followed the script. Nonetheless, there were some interesting developments at the ballot box. New Jersey, as expected, returned Gov. Chris Christie to office and also sent Cory Booker to the U.S. Senate. Bill de Blasio became the first Democrat elected New York City Mayor in two decades, and Democrats, led by Terry McAuliffe, swept the top three executive offices in Virginia for the first time in recent memory. Were these outcomes isolated or do they mean anything for 2014, when candidates will heat up the campaign trail big time ahead of next November's congressional midterms and key gubernatorial elections? In the new year, 435 House seats are up as are 35 in the Senate. There will be 36 gubernatorial races as well. Most of these campaigns won't be nail biters, but there could be collective power shifts in Washington and in state houses. Here, CNN Politics focuses on the Senate, where Republicans aim to retake control. Republicans must pick up six seats to claim the majority and key races are wide open at this point. The top 12 campaign questions of 2014 . Five key races: . Kentucky . The incumbent is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is under pressure from two fronts: Democrats, naturally, and from a tea party challenger within his own Republican Party who says he's not conservative enough. While McConnell is likely to defeat his primary opponent, Matt Bevin, he is expending money and other resources he'd rather use in a general election campaign against Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. The Kentucky race is likely to be one of the most expensive nationally. As a leader of the GOP, McConnell has access to major donors and party members don't like to see their leaders lose. Democrats want McConnell out and are investing heavily, too. 2014: The year of the blame game in Washington . Alaska . Sarah Palin put Alaska politics on the national map in 2008 but her Republican Party lost a Senate seat that year. Democratic incumbent Mark Begich is running again, but the GOP sees the seat as winnable. Begich isn't unpopular but a Democratic Senator in the reliably red state is just about as rare as a 70-degree winter day in Nome. The GOP aims to demonstrate that Begich's election was a fluke and not the start of a trend, and he is fully aware that the road to reelection will be tough. He is already trying to dissociate himself from the Democratic Party with the self-defining tagline: ""As independent as Alaska."" Begich is also distancing himself from President Barack Obama, who's struggling in polls, and the Affordable Care Act, the President's health care reforms that are unpopular with Republicans. Three Republicans are vying for the chance to take on Begich: Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, Dan Sullivan, a former state official, and Joe Miller, who sought to unseat Alaska's other Senator, Lisa Murkowski, in 2010. She lost to him in the Republican primary but prevailed as an Independent in the general election. Louisiana . For Sen. Mary Landrieu, it's deja vu. As a Democrat in an increasingly red state, Landrieu narrowly won her 1996, 2002 and 2008 elections, and her 2014 bid should be just as challenging. Republicans are already hammering Landrieu over the airwaves for her vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. But the candidate preferred by the GOP establishment, Rep. Bill Cassidy, must also contend with Rob Maness, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel, in a primary. Maness is a tea party favorite. ""This race has a long way to go, particularly since Cassidy isn't well known outside his district, but it is safe to say that this may end up being the most difficult race of Landrieu's Senate career,"" wrote Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the non-partisan Coook Political Report. In Louisiana, all candidates run on a single ""primary"" ballot in November. If someone breaks the 50% mark, there's no general election. But if that threshold is not broken, the top two finishers head to a run-off in December. Wyoming . Wyoming's Senate seat should remain safely in GOP hands in the general election, but an already very contentious contest for the Republican nomination should keep the race in the spotlight for much of 2014, since the primary's not until August 19. Things got ugly immediately after Liz Cheney, the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, announced in July that she would mount a primary challenge against three-term GOP Sen. MIke Enzi, who faced no Republican opposition in his last re-election bid. Both sides have attacked each, from claims of carpet bagging to whether the Senator and the former Vice President were actually fishing buddies. Liz Cheney even got into a very public squabble over same-sex marriage with her younger sister, who's married to another woman. While polls indicate Enzi is the front-runner, Cheney has some advantages. ""Liz Cheney doesn't appear to be getting much traction against Enzi, but she will be well-funded and Enzi can't afford to take her for granted,"" cautioned Duffy. While entertaining, Wyoming's primary race doesn't appear to be following the typical grassroots vs. mainstream script. ""Wyoming is somewhat of a misfit race, not only because it is last on the calendar but the GOP race between Sen. Mike Enzi and Liz Cheney doesn't fit neatly into the establishment vs. anti-establishment narrative. Anyone with the last name of Cheney isn't exactly a political outsider in a Republican contest,"" writes Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. Georgia . The Georgia Senate seat up for grabs is held by a Republican who decided not to seek reelection. That leaves a wide open battle for fresh faces. In a traditionally Republican state, which Mitt Romney won by 7 points in 2012, Democrats are making a play in what Cook Political Report sees as ""one of the Democrats' few opportunities"" to pick up a seat. The Democratic candidate has never run for office before but her well-known family name could help her cause. Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, ""has run a very strong campaign"" for a first-time candidate Duffy wrote. The Republican side of the race is interesting as well with eight candidates battling to win the nomination. They include three sitting members of Congress and a former Georgia Secretary of State. Reps Phil Gingrey, Jackson Kingston and Paul Broun are all trying to outdo each other on the conservative side. A far-right platform could result in electoral success in the primary but make it more difficult for the nominee to beat Nunn in the general election. The biggest campaign moments of 2013 . Those are the five big ones, but there are some other races to watch, too. New Hampshire: . Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a former governor, appears as of now to be on the road to re-election in the Granite State. But all eyes are on former Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who's been flirting with a run. If Brown does go, this contest would immediately land in the national political spotlight. Brown represented Massachusetts in the Senate but lost his reelection bid in 2012 and his move to New Hampshire is raising eyebrows. Iowa: . Longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's retirement gives the GOP a prime pickup opportunity in this Midwestern swing state. But while Democrats have rallied around four-term Rep. Bruce Braley, the battle for the Republican nomination is wide open among candidates without strong name recognition. Arkansas and North Carolina: . Like Begich and Landrieu, Democratic Sens Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas face tough re-elections in Republican friendly states. Montana, West Virginia, and South Dakota: . The retirements of longtime Sens Max Baucus of Montana, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, and Tim Johnson of South Dakota could put Democrats in a bind. All three states are considered red, and all, especially South Dakota, present the GOP with prime pickup opportunities.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A passenger on the Air Canada flight in which a young Asian man boarded disguised as an elderly man says she tried to warn the crew about the mask but was rebuffed. Nuray Kurtur-Balas said she approached three flight attendants before take-off from Hong Kong, but nothing was done. ""I thought he was going to harm the plane,"" Kurtur-Balas, 35, told CNN. ""I kept my iPhone in my pocket to call my family if something happened."" Officials said the man apparently boarded the plane wearing the mask and removed the disguise during a trip to the plane's restroom while it was in flight. In a statement e-mailed to CNN, Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzgerald said, ""Our crew took the necessary measures in-flight to ensure that CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) authorities met the aircraft at the gate upon landing."" Kurtur-Balas, a clothing retail production manager, contacted CNN after reading an article about the incident and provided a copy of her boarding pass to confirm she was on the flight. The incident was so bizarre that when she returned home and told her husband what happened, he didn't believe her. ""He said, 'You are watching too much 'CSI' and 'Criminal Minds,'"" she said. The incident happened on October 29, which coincidentally, was her 35th birthday. The Asian man in his early 20s boarded the Air Canada flight from Hong Kong wearing an elaborate silicone mask of an elderly man, according to an alert from the Canada Border Services Agency. After the plane landed in Vancouver, he was questioned by officers from the agency. The man requested refugee protection and admitted that he boarded the flight in the disguise. Chuck Strahl, the Canadian Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, said both Canadian authorities and Air Canada are conducting investigations into the incident. ""Obviously, we are very concerned about what happened and will be taking whatever steps are necessary to make sure it doesn't happen again,"" Strahl said. Kurtur-Balas said she was returning from a business trip in Hong Kong and first noticed the man when she was walking to the restroom before the flight took off. She said she was 10 rows in front of him. He was sitting in a middle seat near one of the restrooms, she said, and the crew was trying to get him to stand up so another passenger could get to her window seat. ""The lady was trying to get to her window seat, but he wouldn't move,"" Kurtur-Balas told CNN. ""He wouldn't move or understand what people were saying. Two flight attendants were trying to talk to him. I was standing there trying to go to the restroom. Finally, he stood up, and he came towards me and I just showed him with my finger where he was supposed to sit."" When she left the restroom, she said, she noticed that he was wearing a mask and that his hands appeared much younger. ""It wasn't a real person's skin. It looked plastic,"" she told CNN. I said to the flight attendant, 'Did you check out that person's hands? They seem like they belong to a 20-year-old kid. There are no wrinkles.' She said 'good observation.'"" After not getting a response, she said she spoke to a second flight attendant. ""Did you check it out? I'm feeling nervous going on this flight,"" she said she told the attendant. ""He said 'We'll look into it,' then again nobody said anything."" Finally, she said, she spoke to a third flight attendant before the plane departed Hong Kong. The attendant told her the man had not done anything wrong and explained he may have a medical condition. ""I was thinking the whole time he was wearing a mask,"" Kurtur-Balas said. ""Why would somebody wear a mask if they have a medical issue?"" ""I was thinking he was going to blow the plane up. I know it sounds crazy, but that's what I thought,"" she said. ""I wouldn't feel nervous if he was just a guy trying to go to Canada and file to become a refugee."" Kutur-Balas said she kept looking back at the man during the flight, but after several hours, she said his seat was empty and she didn't see him. About half way through the flight, she said attendants seated a young Asian man in the empty seat next to her. She said the man was wearing a striped blue shirt. Photos of the Asian man with and without the disguise were contained in the alert from the Canada Border Services Agency about the incident. She said she could not be sure, but it could have been the same man who was moved next to her during the flight. ""The flight attendant said this guy's seat was not working so they sat him right next to me in the middle seat,"" she said. After the plane landed, she did not see the man again. Last week, when she was downloading the CNN App for iPhone, she read the article about the disguised man. ""I said, 'Oh my God, this is the guy I saw on the plane.' My husband said, 'Are you serious?' I said, 'I told you I wasn't crazy.""'","Nuray Kurtur-Balas says ""elderly"" man had the hands of ""a 20-year-old kid""
A flight attendant said the man did nothing wrong, she says .

"London (CNN) -- India has launched a rocket it hopes will allow it to join an elite group of space explorers to Mars. The country's space research organization (ISRO) launched its orbiter to the Red Planet on Tuesday -- only NASA, the former Soviet Union and the Europeans have previously been successful in operating probes from Mars. Japan made an attempt with the Nozomi orbiter in 1998 but it failed to reach the planet and a Chinese probe was lost along with the Russian Phobos-Grunt mission in January 2012. The UK's Beagle 2 probe separated from the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter in 2003 but nothing was ever heard from the lander. It will take 10 months for India's Mars Orbiter Mission to reach the Red Planet after lifting off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre near Chennai. The probe will explore the planet's surface features, minerals and atmosphere. ISRO is hoping to discover more about the loss of water from Mars, map the sources of methane gas, as well as collecting data about the two moons Phobos and Deimos. But ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan told CNN that one of the biggest technological challenges was just getting there. Many missions have failed to reach the planet while others have crashed on the surface or contact has been lost before the probes could send back data. India's space program launched its first Earth satellite in 1975 and put an unmanned probe into orbit around the Moon in 2008. It plans to launch its own manned spaceflight in 2016, though an Indian cosmonaut, Rakesh Sharma, flew aboard a Soviet space mission in 1984. The U.S. is aiming to build on the success of a series of robots that have roamed the surface of the Red Planet when it launches its own orbiter mission called Maven -- Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft -- scheduled to launch on November 18. The European Space Agency is working with the Russians on an ExoMars rover that is due to start its mission in 2018. But private companies are also proposing trips to the Red Planet -- and some of them are only one-way. The Mars One project wants to colonize Earth's neighbor, beginning in 2022 and the Inspire Mars Foundation wants to launch a man and a woman on a 501-day round-trip in 2018 without ever touching down.

"(CNN) -- ""Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end."" - Henry David Thoreau . The March on Washington in 1963 was a day for great speeches. Of course, no one knew that the day would also include one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century, Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" oration (actually titled, ""Normalcy No More""). In fact, King's adviser and draft speechwriter, Clarence B. Jones, says that with everyone consumed by march logistics, the speech was not their highest priority, and hours before the event while King was considering a theme for his speech he didn't know exactly what he would say. Ah, the triumph of procrastination. It was a different time, a time when politicians like JFK and preachers like MLK made efforts to craft big ideas in beautiful language. It was the age of thriving newspapers and bookstores. Back then, audiences listened expectantly for the art of rhetoric. They demanded that speakers respect them enough to put real effort and poetry into their publicly spoken words. And, they listened without the pressure and distraction of multitasking on mobile devices. They listened patiently, even while sweating profusely in the August heat. What about today, in the age of social media? Would Martin Luther King, Jr. be an active social media communicator? And, a more important question: How well would Martin Luther King, Jr.'s gift for rhetoric translate over social networks? Opinion: 50 years later, civil rights struggle is far from over . The answer to both questions is positive. As a public theologian he had an encyclopedic knowledge of political writings and literature. He had an amazing ability to educate, inspire and mobilize people through language and speech. He would have recognized that social media is the public square of the 21st century. A keen communicator could not afford to be silent in this space. According to King's advisers, Clarence B. Jones and Andrew Young, Martin would have utilized Twitter and other social media. Jones says, ""He would be up all hours of the night telling me and Stanley Levison his thoughts and we would have learned to send tweets."" It's worth noting that during the mid-1950s, King (most likely assisted by a staff member) responded to readers' letters in his ""Advice for Living"" column in Ebony Magazine. He did this in order to communicate with a more diverse audience through popular media. He discontinued the responses after his life became too busy and his doctor recommended a slower pace following his 1958 stabbing. As a man who both loved people and loved to talk, he would have a large social media footprint. As for the second question, could King be King via Twitter? The real taste test is found in the actual language he used to educate and inspire. And, surprisingly, much of it fits within the most constraining of social media platforms, the 140 character limit of Twitter. Here's a sample: . ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality."" 108 characters. ""Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again."" (quoting the poet William Cullen Bryant) 42 characters. ""We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice.""  (paraphrasing abolitionist Unitarian minister Theodore Parker) 93 characters. ""Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream."" (from the biblical prophet Amos). 71 characters. ""I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality."" 88 characters. ""This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant."" 74 characters. ""Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective."" 128 characters. And, ""From every mountainside, let freedom ring. And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, 'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!'"" Oops, 470 characters. OK, he'd have to split that one into a quartet of tweets. King's instincts for youth culture were strong and, if alive today, he would be a prominent commentator with a vast social network of followers and friends. This would be an easy way to engage in meaningful dialogue with millennials and Gen X, particularly important since researchers report that younger people do not attend traditional houses of worship at near the rate of their parents.

Probably, they would never hear his sermons from the pulpit, but they would read his tweets and Facebook posts and see his Instagram pics. For Dr. King, everybody in and nobody out . Seeking to engage youth, he taught a course at Morehouse College to a small group of college students that included former NAACP chairman Julian Bond, he spoke to countless university audiences, and he was famously photographed playing pool on Chicago's west side with ""the boys in the hood"" -- not to mention the touching photos of him with his own lovely children. King was determined to remain relevant to a dynamic freedom movement that rode on the backs of students despite the fact that, ultimately, he was bound by conscience to criticize the most militant expressions of that youth culture, largely dominated by Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael of ""black power"" fame, anti-war hippies, and Huey P. Newton, co-founder and icon of the Black Panther Party. His inner moral compass compelled him to criticize ideologies that encouraged further racial separatism and/or violence. Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen say in a new book, ""The New Digital Age,"" that the Internet is ""the largest experiment involving anarchy in history"" creating a brave new capacity for free expression and free movement of information. We have seen evidence most recently in Egypt where the Arab Spring was driven by social media but later also led to troubling disruptions to a young, fragile democracy. King was no fan of anarchy. He was irrevocably committed to nonviolent civil disobedience, and would have taken pains to influence the marketplace of ideas toward greater order, fairness, interdependence and civility. Our new global connectivity requires an encompassing moral vision of how humans can and should live together. Dr. King understood this and would be an active voice expressing the big ideas of freedom and justice for all, through mellifluous phrases and cadences that would appeal even to hip hop ears.

"Washington (CNN) -- The new Congress is still a month and a half away from being seated, but the battle for the next Congress is already heating up. And the fight for the 2014 Senate may end up being the most compelling storyline as the dawn of the midterm campaign approaches. After failing to take advantage of a golden opportunity to win back control of the chamber this year, the GOP gets another chance in 2014. The Democrats, with big victories in the 2008 election, will be defending 20 of the 33 Senate seats up for grabs in 2014. If it sounds familiar, it is. Thanks to their success in the 2006 midterms, the Democrats defended 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs last week. In fact, they expanded their majority by at least one seat and probably two -- depending on which party Independent Angus King, the senator-elect from Maine, caucuses with -- from their current 53-47 majority. Analysis: It's never too early to talk about 2016 . ""It would be easy for someone to say the Democrats 'were on the defensive in 2012 and they did just fine,' but I don't think any two election cycles are exactly the same. We have to see what the political environment looks like; we have to see what candidates and nominees emerge; we have to see what kind of retirements we have. Those are the factors that play into how successful a party will ultimately be in the upcoming election,"" says Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. And the current lame-duck session between now and the end of the year could also impact the next election. Difficult votes on avoiding the fiscal cliff in 2012 could come back to haunt some senators facing difficult primary or general election challenges in 2014. Among the most vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election in 2014 are (in alphabetical order): Mark Begich of Alaska, Max Baucus of Montana, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. Democrats may also have some open seats to defend. Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey is an obvious candidate to retire. He'll be 90 by November 2014. And Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia will be 77 by the midterms. Republicans and Democrats proclaim optimism on fiscal cliff deal . ""There are some vulnerabilities on the Democratic side, but a lot of it depends on how popular the president is in the midterms and the quality of the Republican challengers against these Democratic senators,"" adds Gonzales. A senior GOP strategist argues that President Barack Obama's victory last week makes it tougher for some of those Senate Democrats facing challenging re-elections. ""The irony of this past election is that if you're Mary Landrieu, Mark Pryor, Tim Johnson or other targeted Democrats, it would have been easier for each of them politically if President Obama had not been re-elected. Because the president's liberal, big government agenda, and their longtime support for it, will undoubtedly play an even greater role in each of their races next cycle,"" says the strategist, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the group that focuses on getting Democrats elected to the Senate, disagrees. ""Last week's results proved that conventional wisdom is often wrong, especially two years out from Election Day. We've proven we can win in red states, we can overcome steep spending deficits, and we can defy the odds even when the map is tilted against us. Remember only two Democratic incumbents have lost reelection in eight years,"" DSCC Communications Director Matt Canter tells CNN. Opinion: Conservatives, don't despair . The 2014 geography seems friendlier to the GOP. Of the 13 Republican seats up for grabs next November, only Susan Collins of Maine comes from a state that's not solidly red. The moderate Republican senator hasn't said if she'll retire or run for another term in 2014. Some of the Republicans up for re-election, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, could face potential primary challenges. Regardless, just holding onto their seats won't be enough for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. A big problem, of course, is that the last GOP primaries resulted in some extreme, combustible or un-electable Senate candidates, who have arguably cost the Republicans five Senate seats over the past two cycles. That includes controversial comments about rape by Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri and Indiana State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, who both lost their contests last week. ""Republicans openly acknowledge that they have a lot of soul searching to do right now. The party is at war with itself. Even in more conservative areas of the country, voters reject the extremism and tea party ideology that has taken over the Republican Party,"" suggests Canter. The key for the Republicans is if stronger, less controversial and more generally acceptable nominees emerge from their 2014 primary process. People 'unliking' Romney on Facebook . ""I think you can find common-sense conservative candidates who can appeal to primary and general election voters,"" says another Republican strategist, adding this needs to come without the downside of those candidates saying some stupid things. For the GOP, the simple math of the next Senate means winning back the majority will be a tougher proposition in 2014 than it was this year. But Republicans do have one thing in their favor: A midterm electorate. ""If 2014 is similar to past midterm elections, the demographics of the people who turn out to vote will be very different from the electorate in the presidential elections of 2008 or 2012,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""In midterms dating back to the 1990s, voters under the age of 30 represented 11%-13% of all voters, compared to 19% this year. African-Americans in past midterms have represented 9%-11% of all voters, compared to 13% in 2012. So if history is any guide, the 2014 midterm electorate will be older and a bit whiter than this year, which could easily benefit Republican candidates,"" adds Holland. Just like last cycle, we may not have to wait until Election Day for the first Senate contest of 2014 and if that's the case, we'll have Massachusetts to thank. The 2009 death of Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy forced a January 2010 special election, which Republican state Sen. Scott Brown won, in an upset. If Massachusetts' senior senator, Foreign Relations chairman John Kerry, is nominated as Obama's defense secretary or secretary of state for his second term, there would be another special election in that state. And that could provide an opening for Brown, who was just defeated last week, to make a comeback. Moderate Senate Democrats eye midterms warily .","The race for the 2014 U.S. Senate is already starting .

"(CNN) -- Florida prosecutors have asked a judge to tighten conditions or revoke bond for Marissa Alexander, who faces a second trial for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband. The Jacksonville woman was sentenced to 20 years in prison despite arguing before trial that her actions were justifiable under Florida's controversial ""stand your ground"" self-defense law. She was released on $150,000 bond in November after an appellate court struck down her 2012 conviction. In court papers filed Monday, prosecutors argued that Alexander ""repeatedly flouted"" the limits of her bond by running errands, taking shopping trips and taking relatives to the airport. Under the terms of her release, Alexander was only allowed to leave her home for medical emergencies, court appearances and other pretrial functions, they argued. In a scathing response, Alexander's lawyers wrote Tuesday that each trip had been approved by the sheriff's official supervising her release. ""Obviously, including those omitted facts would expose the frivolity of the state's motion,"" they wrote. Alexander's case had drawn the attention of civil rights leaders, who say nobody was hurt and the sentence for the mother of three was too harsh. Alexander said she was attempting to flee her husband on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall. She said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. State Attorney Angela Corey had said the case deserved to be prosecuted because Alexander fired in the direction of a room where children were standing. Corey had said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence -- but Alexander chose to take her chances at trial, where a conviction would bring an enhanced sentence for the use of a firearm.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's point person for Obamacare implementation faced her critics on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, testifying under oath before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Here's what we learned from Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' 3Â½-hour hearing: . Highlights from Sebelius in the hot seat . Analysis: Sebelius' difficult day . 1. The buck stops with Sebelius . Republicans repeatedly pushed the secretary to name names as to who was at fault for recent service outages with the government's online insurance exchange, who made key decisions to delay window-shopping features or who chose to present vague price quotes once that feature was eventually deployed. Sebelius deferred to the software contractor now responsible for overseeing website repairs, QSSI, and to officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But when asked specifically by Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn who was responsible for the Healthcare.gov ""debacle,"" the secretary took responsibility. ""Hold me accountable for the debacle,"" Sebelius said. ""I'm responsible."" Perhaps in an attempt to defray this line of questioning, Sebelius took a cue from CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday and apologized for problems with the rollout in her opening statement. ""In these early weeks, access to healthcare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans, including many who have waited years, in some cases their entire lives for the security of health insurance,"" Sebelius said in remarks not included in her prepared testimony released earlier in the week. ""I am as frustrated and angry as anyone with the flawed launch of healthcare.gov. So let me say directly to these Americans, you deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems."" 2. Sebelius tallies up healthcare.gov cost . For weeks, independent analysts have pored over contracts issued by HHS in an attempt to determine how much the government spent to develop the failing website. Conservative critics of the new health care law have cited estimates ranging all the way up to $600 million, but on Wednesday Sebelius gave Congress a figure. ""We have spent about $118 million on the website itself and about $56 million has been expended on other IT to support the web,"" the secretary said. Sebelius also revealed that there are outstanding obligations to the agency's primary contractors, CGI Federal and QSSI, and that money will compensate those companies for their assistance in repairing the website. What happens if either contractor fails to fulfill the terms of its contract? ""There isn't a built-in penalty,"" Sebelius said in response to questions about the contracts' language. ""But I can tell you that paying for work that isn't complete is not something that we will do."" 3. Even HHS isn't sure how many people have enrolled . Echoing Tavenner's testimony, Sebelius said that the rocky rollout of healthcare.gov will likely result in low enrollment numbers when the administration issues its first data release in mid-November. ""Our projections prior to launch were always that there would be a very small number at the beginning,"" Sebelius said. ""We watched the Massachusetts trend, which started slowly and then built. I think there is no question that given our flawed launch of healthcare.gov it will be a very small number."" But Sebelius was pushed by many Republicans as to why she couldn't provide any data now. Members asked about call center data, paper applications and attempted enrollments that were thwarted by technical glitches. No matter the context, Sebelius' answer was the same, ""We do not have any reliable data."" When pushed by Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska to authorize insurance companies to release data from their end, Sebelius said that all of the data that exists was unusable because ""the system isn't functioning."" ""According to the insurance companies who are eager to have customers, they are not getting reliable data all the way through the system,"" she said. ""It's one of the real problems that we have."" 4. It depends what you mean by 'crash' At one point on Wednesday, Sebelius raised the ire of Republicans by pushing back against their use of the word ""crash"" when talking about the problems with healthcare.gov. ""I would suggest the website has never crashed,"" the secretary said. ""It is functional, but at a very slow speed and very low reliability, and has continued to function."" CNNTech: When is a crash not a crash? Administration warned by contractor a month before launch . As many members noted, at the time of those remarks, visitors to the application portion of healthcare.gov were unable to create an account and instead were faced with an error message. ""The system is down at the moment,"" the message read. ""We are experiencing technical difficulties and hope to have them resolved soon. Please try again later."" Many might consider limited or no functionality as a ""crash,"" but when asked for clarification, HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters stuck by the secretary's assertion that the website has never crashed. ""As the secretary says, the site works,"" Peters said. ""But it is slow and has a lot of user errors. But even on the first day, some people could get all the way through the system. So it did not crash. If it crashed, it would have been totally down."" While the application portion may have been totally down during Sebelius' testimony, visitors were still able to access the healthcare.gov homepage, learn about the law and browse plans through the site's window-shopping feature. Meaning the site wasn't totally down. 5. Sebelius won't get an Obamacare card . Because of an amendment added to the health care law, members of Congress and their staff must enter the insurance exchange intended for those without employer-provided coverage. Earlier this year, the Office of Personnel Management issued a rule that allows those federal employees entering the exchange to keep the contribution that the federal government currently provides to help cover the costs of insurance. Republican Rep. Cory Gardner of Colorado asked the secretary whether she would join members of Congress and their staff in purchasing insurance on the federal insurance exchange, even though the law did not require her to. After consulting with Office of Health Reform Director Mike Hash, who was seated behind her, Sebelius responded that it would be ""illegal"" for her to join the exchange because she receives insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. ""If I have affordable coverage in my workplace, I'm not eligible to go into the marketplace, that's part of the law,"" Sebelius said. Is it really 'illegal' for Sebelius to have Obamacare? Later, in a somewhat heated exchange with Republican Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, Sebelius repeated that explanation, telling the committee, ""I don't want to give misinformation to the American public."" ""I think it's illegal for me to access the marketplace,"" she said, before adding, ""I would gladly join the exchange if I didn't have affordable coverage in my workplace. I would gladly join it."" Later, Peters confirmed that it was in fact illegal for Sebelius to join the exchange, but not for the reason she stated. ""Marketplace plans cannot be sold to a Medicare enrollee, and the secretary is a Medicare enrollee,"" Peters said. If Sebelius, who turned 65 in May, did not have supplemental insurance through Medicare, she would have the option of foregoing her employer-sponsored plan through the FEHB and purchasing insurance on the exchange . But because she had affordable insurance available to her, she would be ineligible for federal subsidies regardless of her income, and because the law did not require her to move onto the exchange, the OPM rule would not apply to her -- as it does to members of Congress.

"(CNN) -- Charles Smith insisted Sunday that the former NBA players who went to North Korea for a basketball diplomacy trip, led by Dennis Rodman, weren't paid by the repressive regime. ""Absolutely not. I think I am astute enough to understand the dynamics, especially collecting monetary dollars from North Korea. No, we did not get paid from North Korea at all,"" he told CNN in a lengthy exclusive interview on ""New Day Sunday."" Smith, who retired from the NBA in 1997 after nine seasons, said an Irish online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors. However, last month the Irish company, Paddy Power, said it had disassociated itself from Rodman's project after the execution of Kim's uncle and top aide, Jang Song Thaek. Speaking by satellite from Beijing, Smith said it wasn't about the money. He saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens. But he didn't see it as a birthday present for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""That's the date that was set. I didn't know it was his birthday,"" he said in the half-hour interview. ""And it didn't matter to me once I found out that it was his birthday."" Smith said he felt for Rodman, who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event. ""I saw the pressure mount. I saw him change, and it was very difficult keeping him and everyone together (once controversy began over traveling to North Korea),"" he said. The trip also met with criticism because North Korea still holds Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in November 2012, convicted last spring by Pyonyang of ""hostile acts"" intended to topple the government, and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp. Some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release, but they didn't -- at least not publicly. ""We didn't go there for that. We went there to do what we normally do, and that's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange,"" he said. Smith said the difference between this trip and other sports exchanges was that the players weren't sent as representatives of the United States. ""We're athletes doing it ourselves,"" he said. When celebrity meets brutality . Smith said he has no regrets about going. He said he was able to meet some North Korean citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first African-American he had ever met. Smith said the man told him they didn't have a very good view of African-Americans. The man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off, Smith said. Rodman appears to bow, sings 'Happy Birthday' to North Korea's Kim . ""Then the next day after we talked for a while, he came up to me and said he was sorry,"" Smith said. The former NBA player, who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador, said he didn't go to any areas where people are hungry. Smith also swapped sports stories with North Korea's sports minister and basketball players from the national team. He thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip. ""We accomplished a relationship on the sports side in North Korea,"" he said. ""Where it goes from there, I do not know at this point in time. But we established a relationship. They've asked us to come back. Whether we go back or not, I'm not sure. I don't know. But there was a relationship established between a group of individuals in two different countries that don't communicate.""

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has nominated a 14-year-old boy who died tackling a suicide bomber outside his school for a top civil award for bravery. Aitazaz Hassan Bangash has been hailed as a hero in Pakistan for the sacrifice he made to protect his schoolmates. The Sitara-e-Shujjat is the same honor awarded to Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani schoolgirl who survived being shot in the head by the Taliban for her efforts to promote education for boys and girls. A statement from Sharif's office Friday said Aitazaz's ""brave act saved the lives of hundreds of students and established a sterling example of gallantry and patriotism."" The nomination follows a campaign on social media for the teenager to be recognized. The ninth-grader was on his way to school Monday in the Hangu district of northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when the bomber, dressed in a school uniform, asked him where the school was, the teen's cousin, Musadiq Ali Bangash said. He and Aitazaz became suspicious, the cousin said. ""The other students backed off, but Aitazaz challenged the bomber and tried to catch him. During the scuffle, the bomber panicked and detonated his bomb,"" he said. Aitazaz and the bomber died at the scene. Witnesses say the blast injured two other people. Hangu is a troubled district bordering Pakistan's tribal areas. It is rife with sectarian violence, with attacks against Shia and Sunni Muslims. ""It was a great sacrifice to save the lives of hundreds of both Shia and Sunni students, who were in morning assembly,"" Musadiq said. CNN's Zahir Shah Sherazi reported from Peshawar, Saima Mohsin from Islamabad and Anna Maja Rappard from Atlanta.","A teenager who died tackling a suicide bomber outside his school is nominated for an award .

"(CNN) -- Call it knee-jerk panic or an abundance of caution. After an eyewitness reported a man with a gun on campus at American University, authorities put the Washington college on lockdown as officers swarmed out to look for him. In the end, no shots were fired, no crime committed. No one was hurt. The man turned out to be an off-duty officer from the Metropolitan Police Department. He was sitting on the bus with a woman he knew -- a student at the university. Two tense hours . But until that revelation, students already stressed over finals spent two tense hours ""sheltered in place"" -- as the school asked them to do. Warnings went out via campus e-mail within seconds of the eyewitness report: . ""AU Alert: man with gun seen on campus. Campus is in lockdown. Shelter in place. More info to follow."" The university also sent out the warning via Twitter, and shortly thereafter, photos appeared online on the social networking service showing hundreds of students herded into safe rooms. Victoria Bera was taking a final when she saw the alert, she told the student newspaper, The Eagle. ""We were really stressed out because we weren't getting the alerts at the same time as other students,"" Bera said. ""We were able to hear the helicopters outside."" Suspicious object . The eyewitness saw a man wearing something suspicious and called authorities. They were both riding a campus bus at the time. ""Someone saw a holster, what they believe was a holster, somebody had on them,"" Lt. Jesse Porter said. But it was enough to put the police on full steam. ""Given the culture we are in now"" police thought it was better to start with a massive response and scale back if needed, he said.

"(CNN) -- It boasts some of the world's most celebrated works of art: Michelangelo's frescoes depicting the creation of man and a severe God at the Last Judgment. But on Sunday, Pope Francis told mothers not to feel intimidated by the splendid surroundings of the Sistine Chapel as he baptized 32 sometimes wailing babies. At the yearly event, Francis, who has become known for the more simple style he has introduced in the Vatican, offered a brief homily centered on the infants. ""Today the choir sings but the most beautiful choir is of children,"" he said. ""Some are crying, because they are uncomfortable, or because they are hungry. If they are hungry, mothers, give them something to eat. ... They are the central figures, the protagonists."" Formally welcoming the children as members of the Catholic Church, the pontiff poured water from a shell-shaped dish over the heads of the babies, dressed in white satin or silk gowns. In the same chapel last March, he was elected as the first Latin American pope. He has since made headlines for embracing a humble way of life. Also on Sunday, Pope Francis named 19 new cardinals from Africa, Latin America, Asia and elsewhere during his weekly address to worshipers gathered in St. Peter's Square. Sixteen of the new appointees, who will be instated next month, are under the age of 80, making them eligible to enter a conclave to elect the Pope's successor. The pontiff also said three archbishops emeriti, over the age of 80, will join the College of Cardinals.

"(CNN) -- Would the ""first conservative"" recognize modern conservatism? The conservatism of recent days has been a conservatism of radical individualism: a politics that sees its job as protecting society's ""makers"" from society's ""takers."" Yet the man most often credited as the founder of modern conservatism, the 18th-century British thinker-politician Edmund Burke, saw things very differently. Against the politics of ""I want, I want, I want,"" he emphasized continuity, responsibility and community. That was a tough teaching 200 years ago, and it remains a tough teaching today. It's not a surprise that it often goes unheard. This year, however, Burke's tough teaching is again getting the articulation it deserves, thanks to two distinguished books by two rising conservative thinkers, one British, one American. Jesse Norman is a British member of Parliament who strongly identified with Prime Minister David Cameron's modernizing conservatism. His book was first published in Great Britain under the title ""Edmund Burke: Philosopher, Politician, Prophet"" but then rereleased in the United States under the pithier ""Edmund Burke: The First Conservative."" As Norman tells it, Burke was a thinker and politician who rejected the demands of ""I want"" in favor of the duties of ""you should."" In Burke's words: . ""[T]he state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties."" Burke rejected both the ""I want, I want"" of people who expect ever more generous social programs from government -- and the ""I want, I want"" of bankers and brokers who wish to be allowed to stake huge gambles with other people's money. ""Except in reaction to the most extreme necessity, [Burke's] politics is one of moderation. He was an early supporter of free markets, but only within a strong context of personal probity, law, market norms and trust."" Norman's Burke forcefully critiques the disintegration of society into personal atoms, each seeking only its own personal economic betterment. ""[T]he individual is not simply a compendium of wants, human happiness is not simply a matter of satisfying individual wants, and the purpose of politics is not to satisfy the interests of people living here and now: it is to preserve an evolving social order which meets the needs of generations past, present, and future."" Make no mistake: Norman's Burkean politics is conservative politics. Burke defended free enterprise and private property rights. Burke's contemporary Adam Smith, author of ""The Wealth of Nations"" and founder of modern economics, saluted Burke as the only person whose ideas had corresponded with his own without any prior communication between the two. Burke favorably reviewed Smith's books, and the two men became friends. Yet Burke could also forcefully denounce the abuse of economic power and the corruptions of wealth. Norman again: ""[H]e regarded as his greatest achievement his campaign to restrain the influence, greed and self-dealing of the East India Company, and to insist on the accountability of private power to legitimate public authority."" Here is a conservative who has much to say in the era of predatory finance and selective bailouts. A politician himself, Norman shrewdly appreciates that Burke's contributions emerged from an active career. Burke understood the limits of the possible because he himself had often bumped up against them -- hard. Burke spent only a few months of his long political career in office; he passed most of his parliamentary career estranged from the government of the day and exerted almost all of his influence in writings and speeches from the back benches. Norman bumped up one of those limits himself. In September, he voted against his own party leadership on a proposed intervention in the Syrian civil war and was stripped of his party leadership position. In politics, yet separated from it -- that is the place and role to stimulate fresh political thought. The author of this year's second great work on Burke, Yuval Levin, is located both closer to -- and simultaneously further from -- political power even than Norman. A former domestic policy adviser to President George W. Bush, Levin now edits the flagship conservative policy magazine, National Affairs. At the same time, he is one of the most influential advisers of Rep. Paul Ryan, the former GOP vice presidential nominee; you might say that Levin now holds the Irving Kristol chair as a one-man Republican brain trust. Levin presents his new work on Burke as a study of a fierce debate that erupted in the 1790s between Burke and his one-time friendly acquaintance, Thomas Paine. Both men were migrants: Burke, Irish-born, had moved to England; Paine, English-born, moved to the American Colonies. Paine had given words to the American Revolution in his pamphlet ""Common Sense,"" which became, after the Bible, probably the most widely read book in the America of the 1770s. Burke had urged compromise with the Americans in speeches in Parliament and then, after it was too late for reconciliation, urged peace and acceptance of independence. Fifteen years later, however, those two former allies bitterly quarreled. Burke's 1790 book, ""Reflections on the Revolution in France,"" eloquently and prophetically warned that revolution would end in blood and tyranny. Paine wrote a rebuttal to Burke, ""The Rights of Man,"" published in 1791. He transplanted himself to France to lend personal support to the new regime and was elected to the French National Assembly. To his surprise -- but probably not to Burke's -- Paine ended up in a French prison cell when his preferred faction lost power in late 1793. But he was not guillotined, and he lived and kept writing, becoming probably the first writer in English to propose something prophetically like the modern welfare state. In ""The Great Debate: Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, and the Birth of Left and Right,"" published in December, Levin argues that Paine deserves equal billing with Burke as a founder of our modern political debates. Levin sets each thinker as a standard and corrective for their modern descendants. Yet as Levin himself seems well aware, it is the conservatives who have drifted further -- and who need correction more. Levin's Burke often seems to be debating -- not against his contemporary Paine -- but against our contemporaries of the libertarian right. ""Burke essentially denies the relevance (though not necessarily the existence) of abstract, individual, natural rights. He defines instead some practical rights to the benefit of society. And those benefits do not amount to freedom or power. In fact, some of the benefits of society to which men have a right involve restraints on their freedom and their passions."" And again: . ""Human beings cannot live in society if they follow their wants and passions unrestrained, and so one of the rights of citizens is to have their passions brought under some control. Thus society guarantees some liberties and some restraints, and precisely how these are balanced is in normal times a matter of prudence, not absolute principle."" And once more, this time maybe most tellingly: . ""Where Paine imposes on government the obligation to respect the freedom of action of each of its citizens, Burke imposes on government a much less exacting (if somewhat more demanding) obligation to meet the wants of the people and advance the interests of the complex social whole."" It is Paine, Levin's non-hero, who speaks the language of the tea party -- and Burke, Levin's hero, who rejects maximum individual rights in favor of a theory of social obligation. Burke sees, and Levin sees with him, that a politics of egoism and individualism leads to the dissolution of the institutions a conservative will want to protect. As Levin concludes: ""Today's conservatives are thus too rhetorically strident and far too open to the siren song of hyper individualism. ... They could benefit by adopting Burke's focus on the social character of man [and] from Burke's thoroughgoing gradualism."" These are wise and needed cautions -- and phrased with the cautious wisdom necessary to make them acceptable to conservatives who do not wish to hear what they most need to know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","British thinker Edmund Burke often considered the ""first conservative,"" David Frum says .
Yet Burke would differ from the radical individualism of today's U.S. conservatives, he says .
Frum says Burke saw the importance of community, continuity and responsibility .

"Cleveland (CNN) -- First came the pain -- a decade of torture, torment and terror for three captive women and one of their young daughters. Now comes the prosecution and -- if there's a conviction -- punishment for the man accused of being responsible for their hell. Ariel Castro appeared silently in court Thursday, his head down, as he was arraigned on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape, accused of holding the women captive in his Cleveland home. Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Lauren Moore ordered Castro held on $8 million bond -- $2 million for each of the three women and the child born to Amanda Berry before they were freed Monday evening. Hours later, the top prosecutor in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, announced he'd press for more charges -- ""for each and every act of sexual violence ... each day of kidnapping, every felonious assault (and) all his attempted murders."" Furthermore, Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said he'd try to persuade a grand jury to indict the 52-year-old Castro for ""aggravated murder"" for the termination of his captives' pregnancies. He cited a state law that a person can be charged with murder -- a conviction that could lead to the death penalty in Ohio -- for killing unborn children. CNN Exclusive: 'We don't have monster in our blood' According to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, Michelle Knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home. When that happened, she told investigators, Castro ""starved her for at least two weeks, then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried."" It is not known how many times, if any, the other two women got pregnant only to miscarry. One of them, Berry, gave birth to a daughter while in captivity. That's just one of the brutal tales reported so far about the women's captivity, which McGinty described as ""beyond comprehension."" ""The child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in the heart of the city,"" he told reporters. ""The horrific brutality and torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension."" Castro's own mother is among those trying to make sense of the horror. ""I have a sick son who has done something serious,"" she told Univision and Telemundo. ""I'm suffering very much. I ask for forgiveness from those mothers; may those girls forgive me."" Source: Writings detail actions, reasons behind them . So what was going through the suspect's mind, when he allegedly lured three women into a car between 2002 and 2004, took them to his home three miles away and held them there -- where they were chained, threatened and repeatedly sexually assaulted? Neither Castro, his attorneys nor police have spelled out a motive publicly. The suspect has talked with investigators, confessing to some of the actions of which he's accused, said a law enforcement source closely involved with the investigation. The source did not describe precisely what Castro confessed to when he was interrogated. Plus, investigators have asked the state crime lab to expedite tests to create a DNA profile of Castro -- something that typically takes 20 days, but should be back Friday -- said Ohio Attorney General's office spokesman Dan Tierney. They're also poring over evidence, including more than 200 items seized from Castro's Seymour Avenue home. Among them are writings authorities believe were written by the suspect, said two law enforcement sources closely involved in the case. Those contain ""specific detailing of actions and reasons behind actions"" tied to the women's abduction and their kidnapper's behavior toward them, one of the law enforcement sources said. The author cites his own history of abuse by family members as justification. The latest developments in the Cleveland case . The source -- who described the ""pretty lengthy"" writings as ""more of a diary"" -- said they included talk of suicide, though that's just one of many aspects. Authorities are working ""meticulously"" to see whether others were involved in the kidnapping plot. Two of Castro's brothers, Pedro and Onil, were initially arrested in the case only to be released Thursday -- after appearing in court on unrelated cases -- when investigators found nothing, including from the victims' interviews, linking them to the abductions. One of his daughters, Angie Gregg, told CNN that she ""just wanted to die"" upon hearing her father had been implicated. But looking back, she thinks there were signs of something awry -- such as how her father ""kept his house locked down so tight"" and would sometimes leave mysteriously for an hour or so, then return, with ""no explanation."" ""Everything's making sense now,"" Gregg said. ""It's all adding up, and I'm just disgusted."" Source: Death threat if newborn died . According to the initial incident report, the women said Castro first chained them in the basement but later let them live upstairs on the second floor. The women went outside only twice during their ordeal -- and just ""briefly"" at that, Cleveland Public Safety Director Martin Flask said. Most of the time the three would be in different rooms, though they interacted occasionally and came to ""rely on each other for survival,"" said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. One thing they could count on was that their alleged captor wouldn't let them out. Castro would often test his captives by pretending to leave, the law enforcement source said. Then he'd suddenly return; if there were indications any of the women had moved, they'd be disciplined. Survival the key difference from 'House of Horrors' case . While Knight told investigators Castro forced her to miscarry her own unborn children, she said he ordered her to deliver Berry's child, according to a police source familiar with the investigation. The baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid, the source said. Panic ensued soon after. The child stopped breathing, and everyone started screaming, the source said, citing accounts by the young women. Knight said Castro threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive, the initial police report states. ""What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old,"" the source said. 'I don't think she would have lived very much longer' Knight remained hospitalized in good condition Thursday, said MetroHealth Medical Center spokeswoman Tina Shaerban-Arundel. The others held -- Berry, her 6-year-old daughter and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus -- are back with relatives. FBI specialists who talked with them feel they ""desperately need space and time,"" said McGinty. Who are Berry, DeJesus and Knight? ""These victims need to be decompressed,"" he said. ""They need a chance to heal before we seek further in-depth evidence from them."" Those close to them, as well as residents of Cleveland and beyond, are trying to make sense of the alleged depravity. One of them is Arlene Castro, the suspect's daughter and once a very good friend of DeJesus. She was interviewed on an ""America's Most Wanted"" segment in 2005 talking about how she'd been with DeJesus, hoping to spend the afternoon with her, shortly before her abduction. Speaking Thursday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" she said she last spoke with her father late last month, adding the two had never been close. Whatever their relationship, she insisted, ""I had no idea"" what was happening. ""I'm really disappointed, embarrassed, mainly devastated,"" Arlene Castro said. ""... I would like to say that I'm absolutely so, so sorry."" Women crushed by news her father allegedly abducted her friend . Fern Gentry said on CNN's ""Starting Point"" Thursday that hearing Berry, her granddaughter, was alive 10 years after her disappearance was the ""most important thing that ever happened in my life."" Gentry, who spoke to Berry by phone from her Tennessee home Tuesday, said she's grateful for all involved in the case -- from police to helpful neighbors -- and that her granddaughter can now live her life. ""If she hadn't got out, I don't think she would have lived very much longer,"" Gentry said. Timeline: From missing to liberated .

"(CNN) -- Newtown, Connecticut, officials met with the media on Monday to ask them to respect the town's privacy Saturday, the one-year anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School where a gunman killed 20 students and six staff members before killing himself. Earlier that morning, Adam Lanza shot and killed his mother. ""The community needs time to be alone and to reflect on our past year in a personal ways without a camera or a microphone,"" First Selectman Pat Llodra said. ""There's an emotional and economic toll that we pay when the media descends on us, so we ask for your forbearance after today and respectfully request that you allow us a time of peace and quiet."" Sirens and news trucks remind residents of that awful day nearly a year ago, Llodra told reporters. ""We don't need to be reminded. We don't need to re-live it,"" Llodra continued. ""We were hurt very badly last year as you all know... We carry it with us, so we are trying to say to the world, 'please give us the chance to grow into that really happy healthy place that loves children and families, that has great schools.' We know who we are, but we need you to help us get there by please staying away."" Newtown Police Chief Mike Kehoe said that there will be extra law enforcement personnel in town over the weekend, but officials want to maintain a sense of normalcy for residents. CNN will honor these requests and will not be in Newtown on the anniversary. ""Newtown is cracked. We've been through a devastating experience, and yet in the midst of those cracks, in the midst of that brokenness, you are seeing light of all kinds showing through the kindnesses from friends and neighbors, families doing amazing things, remembering and celebrating the gift lives that were lost to them,"" said the Rev. Matt Crebbin, senior minister for the Newtown Congregational Church and coordinator of the Newtown Interfaith Clergy Association. Also Monday, families of the victims of the shooting announced the launch of a website, MySandyHookFamily.org . ""In the midst of our grief, we have come to realize that we want our loved ones to be remembered for the lives they lived and how they touched our hearts. We have been uplifted by the support of so many people and we would like to keep that spirit of unity and love alive in all we do to remember those we so dearly miss. It is with this in mind that we have created the MySandyHookFamily.org website,"" Krista Rekos, whose daughter Jessica was among the victims at Sandy Hook, said at a news conference attended by many of the victims' families. JoAnn Bacon, mother of Charlotte Bacon, added: ""This website is intended to serve as a singular place of sharing, communication, and contact with the families of those who lost their lives that day. MySandyHookFamily.org allows us, the 26 families, the opportunity to honor our loved ones in a way that feels right to each individual family.""

"(CNN) -- A young man huddles under a thick gray blanket, pressed against a steam grate as he braces himself against the biting cold. While on assignment over the weekend, an Associated Press photographer took his photo to show the effects of unusually cold weather sweeping across the country. The man, who only gave his first name -- Nick -- was a face in a crowd of homeless people huddling to stay warm on a Washington street, just blocks from the U.S. Capitol. But all that changed when the photograph appeared in USA Today Sunday. Hundreds of miles away in an upstate New York town, the man was much more than a face in a crowd. Nicholas Simmons was missing. And a mother who saw the photo in the newspaper realized she'd found her son. A disappearance on New Year's Day . In Rochester, New York, the man's face appeared in local news reports last week as police and frantic family members searched for him. Police in the town of Greece, New York, said Simmons, 20, disappeared New Year's Day from his home, driving away in a red Buick with only with what he was wearing: plaid pajama pants, a gray T-shirt and sneakers. He left his wallet and cell phone behind. Family members and authorities had been looking for him for days without any luck. There were few leads without a phone or credit cards to track him. ""We couldn't do a lot of things we normally would do in a missing person's case,"" said Capt. Patrick Phelan of the Greece Police Department. But the photo became the answer to the Simmons family's prayers. The family learned about the photo through a public Facebook page they'd set up, according to an article published in the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. Simmons' sister, Hannah Simmons, sent a message on Twitter to USA Today reporter Natalie DiBlasio, who wrote the story. ""Please contact me,"" the tweet read. ""You wrote an article for USA today that features a picture of my missing brother."" Family members also reached out to AP photographer Jacquelyn Martin, who captured the image. Communication between Simmons' family, DiBlasio, Martin, and the Greece Police Department helped the Washington Metropolitan Police track down Simmons. Now he's reunited with his family, police said. Washington Metro Police Officer Araz Alali said he's considered a ""missing person returned."" On the Facebook page, his mother Michelle Simmons said she was stunned. ""We are going to get him home safe, and this is by far the greatest example of God's love and divine intervention I have ever experienced,"" she wrote, according to the Democrat & Chronicle. ""I am beyond able to put into words how I am feeling."" Questions remain . It's unclear why Simmons left home and what brought him to the streets of Washington. According to police, Simmons is fine physically but distraught. He was taken to George Washington University Hospital for evaluation, Phelan said. The hospital declined to comment, citing privacy restrictions. Phelan said police were told there was a ""discussion"" between Simmons and his parents that may have made him leave home. ""There was no indication or precursors to believe he would do something like this,"" Phelan said. The police official described Simmons as a normal 20-year-old living at home with his parents and working part-time jobs at local fast food chains. Just a day after her brother was found, Hannah Simmons sent Martin a message of appreciation on Twitter Monday. ""You have saved our family,"" she wrote. ""Thank you so much.""

"(CNN) -- Do you ever look at your smartphone and think it's just too stiff and flat? A growing number of tech giants have, and they're aiming to fix that with what may become the next wave of smartphone innovation. LG announced on Monday that it will start mass-producing a flexible, curved smartphone screen. Its first devices to use the new 6-inch OLED screens will be available next year. Several companies have shown prototypes of flexible displays before, but so far there haven't been any mass-market bendy phones. Samsung announced a similar screen technology last month and plans to release the 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 3, its first device with a curved display, later in October. Apple has long been rumored to be looking into similar technology for the iPhone. A patent filed in March describes an ""electronic device with wrap around display"" that would go around most, or all, of the device. Apple, like other companies, sometimes files patents for products that never come to market. What's clear in the minds of many is that the coming wave of flexible and curved displays is just the first step in what could become a dramatic shift in what we expect of our phones. ""What we're seeing today is a big step toward a break from the rectangular norm of smartphone design, paving the way for more outlandish shapes and sizes for future devices,"" Aaron Souppouris, of tech blog The Verge, wrote Monday. Since Apple released the keyboard-killing iPhone, the physical design of smartphones has pretty much stagnated. The touchscreen rectangles have appeared in different sizes, and recently companies like Motorola and Apple have tried to spice things up with different colors and patterns on the back. But the basic look is the same. Most of the serious competition takes place inside the devices. Manufacturers compete for the best camera, the fastest processor, the widest selection of apps and, of course, low price tags. When all those specs are close and the devices start to blend together, companies turn to splashier -- some might say gimmicky -- features to try to make their 5-inch Android smartphones stand out from the other guy's 5-inch Android smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S4 has a motion-controlled scrolling feature to make it easier to read text without tiring your fingers. Apple recently added a fingerprint sensor that makes it faster to unlock your phone. Some companies are trying to change how you interact with your phone, such as Apple and Google, which are pushing voice-activated interfaces like Siri and Google Voice. And now there are curved displays. LG says its technology works because the panels are built not on glass, but on plastic substrates. Also called wafers, substrates are thin slices of material that act as semiconductors. The new LG display will curve in from top to bottom. So, other than the ""gee whiz"" factor, what are the advantages of a curved or flexible screen for smartphone owners? To start, a flexible display is thinner and lighter than a glass display. In a field where companies (Apple chief among them) brag about being a fraction of an inch or a few millimeters thinner than the competition, that's apparently an issue. LG and others also market the screens as unbreakable. It's not entirely clear what the practical benefits are of a curved, concave 6-inch screen, beyond the novelty of having a curved screen. Samsung has said that a curved screen would have more viewing space in the same footprint. There are already curved TVs on the market that use similar technology. They take advantage of the flexible OLED displays and offer a screen that curves in towards the viewer on the left and right sides, supposedly for a more immersive visual experience. The effect won't work the same way on a small 6-inch screen, though. The TV panels are stuck in their curved position permanently and cannot actually be re-bent, so the flexibility is gone. The other big mobile trend that has been bubbling up over the past year is wearable peripheral devices that connect to your smartphone, like smart glasses and watches. If LG or Samsung gets the flexible display technology right, it could prove extremely useful in the new wave of small screens that the tech industry is betting we'll wear on our bodies in the coming years. The bulky and poorly received Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch, for example, could greatly benefit from a screen that molds to your wrist instead of the giant solid square it sports now. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","LG is working on a flexible, curved screen for 6-inch smartphones .

"(CNN) -- Thanks to Obamacare, nearly 6 million currently uninsured Latinos in the United States will have access to affordable health care come January 1, 2014, including mental health and substance-abuse services. But some experts say that won't be enough to encourage mentally ill in the Hispanic community to seek help. In 2011, 15.9% of Hispanic adults reported suffering from a mental illness the previous year, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. But thousands in this population often go without professional mental health treatment. Perhaps the most problematic issue for the Latino community is their fear of being highly stigmatized for accessing mental health services, experts say. Among Hispanics with a mental disorder, fewer than 1 in 11 contact a mental health specialist, while fewer than 1 in 5 contact a general health care provider, according to the American Psychiatric Association's Office of Minority and National Affairs. Even fewer Hispanic immigrants seek out these services. Stigma haunts mentally ill Latinos . If a mental health issue is even acknowledged, Latinos tend to rely on their extended, family, community, traditional healers and/or churches for help during a health crisis, according to the APA. As a result, Hispanics often mistake depression for nervousness, tiredness or a physical ailment, and see the issue as temporary. There are also a lack of culturally relevant services that cater to this population. ""What makes it worse is having very few Latino leaders in the mental health workforce,"" said Henry Acosta, former executive director of the National Resource Center for Hispanic Mental Health. Less than 25% of mental health professionals are minorities, according to the American Psychological Association. ""Most aren't bilingual and management hasn't enforced culturally relevant strategies."" Acosta knows from personal experience how trying the mental health care system can be for Latinos. After witnessing a friend being fatally shot following an altercation with a police officer in his New Jersey hometown, Acosta said he knew he would never be the same. But what he didn't expect was the severe depression that followed and -- what seemed worse -- being called ""crazy"" by his high school peers. ""When I was 16 years old, I tried to commit suicide,"" said Acosta, now 44. ""Latinos always hear how they have to be self-reliant when they have problems or even turn to prayer. But if you have a chemical imbalance, prayer won't help you."" Even though the teasing in high school was bad, one of his worst memories is translating for his parents at the psychiatric ward because they only knew Spanish. ""I wish the hospital had translators or even someone who understood us culturally,"" Acosta said. Eventually, Acosta overcame his mental illness, got into college, majored in psychology and became a social worker. He's since made it his mission to change Latinos' apprehensive perspective on mental health issues and better the health care system in hopes others won't have to go through what he did. ""The situation for Hispanics in this country will only get worse unless the system changes,"" Acosta said. According to the National Resource Center for Hispanic Mental Health, Hispanics are a high-risk group for depression, substance abuse and anxiety. About 1 in every 7 Latinos has attempted suicide. Hispanic adults and youth are also dealing with unique stressors like immigration and acculturation, according to the AMA -- which the organization said is even more of a reason to provide services that cater to this population. ""Latinos are overrepresented in service industry and those took a big hit with the recession,"" Acosta said. "" 'Hard to make ends meet' is definitely a different kind of stressor."" Many older Latinos find the strain of acculturation overwhelming. Their traditional values and beliefs are often at odds with the new culture, or they may lack family support and face language barriers. Hispanic youth have also been found to be at risk for higher levels of emotional distress because of the pressures to rapidly adopt the values of their new culture while they suffer from inequality, poverty and discrimination. According to the AMA, Hispanic youth suffer from many of the same emotional problems created by marginalization and discrimination, but without the secure identity and traditional values held by their parents. ""While working at a clinic in New York, I was seeing a Puerto Rican family who became increasingly concerned (about their) 21-year-old son,"" said Luis H. Zayas, dean of the school of social work at the University of Texas. ""They said he was having trouble with nervios (nerves)."" The young man was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. ""We were able to explain to the family the severity of the situation. It was a matter of helping them understand that their son's schizophrenia was a mental illness of the brain -- not be critical, avoid pejorative judgment and assure them that they didn't fail as parents."" After several months, Zayas said, the family refrained from using labels and changed their perspective on mental illness. He said part of the problem is how the mental health and primary care systems are separated, and how they are presented to Latinos. ""I worked with undocumented immigrants who would ask for 'consejo' (advice) knowing they were asking for mental health services,"" Zayas said. ""We could reduce the stigma significantly. ... It's how we present it to them. It helps to have integrated mental health services into the primary care setting. We should (be) bringing the services to them rather than bringing the people to the services."" In the last decade, the Latino population -- now at 53 million -- has grown by nearly 40%, and is expected to make up close to one-third of the nation's inhabitants by the year 2050. Tackling the mental health disparity now could prevent serious future health issues, experts say. Obamacare will help fund new clinics and community centers in highly Hispanic-populated cities around the country, which would allow them to seek mental health care at little or no cost. ""Change won't happen overnight, but I think the key is educating the current population and, even more, motivating the Latino youth interested in the health sector,"" Acosta said. ""After having gone through my own mental health issues, I can tell you that just knowing you aren't alone is so important,"" Acosta said. ""Most times we have our own answers, but if I had someone who understood where I came from it would have made an even bigger difference.""","Obamacare will give 6 million currently uninsured Latinos access to mental health care .
Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to seek out professional help .
Disparity could be linked to lack of Hispanic mental health professionals .
Stigma in Hispanic community around mental illness is also a problem, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- A spectacular ""kinetic cube"" is lighting up Seoul's district of Gangnam. Comprised of 576 clear LED poles that move up and down, the 36-square-meter matrix, named ""Brilliant Cube,"" continuously flashes hypnotic, colorful patterns and images in one of the most crowded -- and now famous -- areas of Seoul. Korean media artist Jin-Yo Mok created the 3D matrix in collaboration with Seoul-based media artist group Jonpasang, and requested animation images from fellow media artists Jussi Angesleva and Alvaro Cassinelli. The full hypnotic effect, that uses up to 120 kilowatts per day, can be seen in this video. More than 50 people were involved in the four-month production process. ""It should have taken a lot longer actually, but the Korean work environment doesn't allow this so we finished very quickly,"" said Mok. Mok was also the creative mind behind the beautiful three-layer LED facade of another Seoul icon -- the Shinsegae Department Store -- as well as the dramatic kinetic landscape ""Hyper Matrix"" exhibited at the Yeosu Expo last year. Hyundai Motor Company commissioned the $1.5 million work, with additional support from the Gangnam district government. Mok's artwork -- infusing art with technology -- fit the image that Hyundai has been increasingly aiming to project, leading to the Korean conglomerate's commissions of both ""Brilliant Cube"" and ""Hyper Matrix."" This latest project was unveiled in October with much fanfare. It was planned to show until December, but the end date has been extended until March due to its popularity. ""It will probably be moved to the national museum of contemporary art in Seoul after March,"" said Mok.","Gangnam's new art fixture is a spectacular LED kinetic sculpture .

"(CNN) -- A Cardiff City fan who became so disillusioned with the rebranding of the football club he followed that he put his support up for auction on eBay has a new team to follow -- Tottenham Hotspur. The final straw for Cardiff fan Ben Dudley was the decision by the Welsh team's Malaysian owners to rebrand the club by insisting they play in red rather than their traditional blue to boost their appeal to Asian audiences. The internet sparked global interest with Dudley's support eventually bought by a Spurs fan for over a thousand dollars. ""The reception from Spurs fans that have been in contact with me has been great and I've had offers of help with tickets and people to attend games with,"" Dudley told CNN. ""I will also be looking to attend some Europa League fixtures, with my only previous experience of European football coming from watching Cardiff City win the Algarve Cup against Celtic in 2008."" Trips to Tottenham's home ground will involve a 320 mile round-trip for Dudley, but he doesn't seem daunted as at one stage it looked like he might have to travel abroad in his new supporter project. ""As the auction began to get worldwide coverage, I moved from getting bids from places such as Bristol, Huddersfield and Nottingham to getting bids from New York, Seattle, Istanbul and the west coast of Australia! ""I was rather worried at this stage. Traveling to Middlesbrough and Sunderland away with Cardiff was one thing, but Melbourne Victory away was probably pushing it! ""Just when it looked like I would be clocking up some serious air miles, a bidder from north London came in and won the auction with a bid of $1,324."" Cardiff City have come agonizingly close to promotion to the Premier League in the last few years, so Dudley is looking forward to experiencing life in English football' s top. ""I am most excited about visiting new grounds and the new experiences that Tottenham Hotspur will bring."" By a curious twist of fate, Dudley already has an association with Tottenham as his father is a Spurs supporter. ""Tottenham Hotspur are the team supported by my father, meaning that I will be able to talk to him about footballers he cares about."" The eBay bid has only bought Dudley's support for a season, but he is already making plans for next year in case Cardiff City don't return to being the club he used to support. ""I'm praying it's a one season only thing. If it isn't, then I will either stick with Spurs, as I believe they are a club who can restore a bit of my faith in modern football, or donate the cost of my Cardiff season ticket to charity and watch non-league football instead."" However, having become so disheartened with Cardiff , the internet auction has gone some way to restoring his faith in football. ""While in an ideal world I would still feel connected to Cardiff enough to support them, Tottenham have gone a long way to show the good side of the game. ""If you don't get goosebumps when Tottenham fans sing ""oh when the Spurs"" then you either support one of their rivals or you probably don't like football very much."" The winning bid proceeds are to be split between British military charity Help for Heroes and Ty Hafan, a charity that help life-limited children in South Wales.","Ben Dudley put his support up for auction after Cardiff City were rebranded .

"BOISE, Idaho (CNN) -- ""First, please let me apologize to my family, friends, staff and fellow Idahoans for the cloud placed over Idaho. I did nothing wrong at the Minneapolis airport. I regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife, family, friends, staff, and fellow Idahoans. For that I apologize. ""In June, I overreacted and made a poor decision. While I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the Minneapolis airport or anywhere else, I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away. I did not seek any counsel, either from an attorney, staff, friends, or family. That was a mistake, and I deeply regret it. Because of that, I have now retained counsel and I am asking my counsel to review this matter and to advise me on how to proceed. ""For a moment, I want to put my state of mind into context on June 11. For eight months leading up to June, my family and I had been relentlessly and viciously harassed by the Idaho Statesman. If you've seen today's paper, you know why. Let me be clear: I am not gay and never have been. ""Still, without a shred of truth or evidence to the contrary, the Statesman has engaged in this witch hunt. In pleading guilty, I overreacted in Minneapolis, because of the stress of the Idaho Statesman's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around Idaho. Again, that overreaction was a mistake, and I apologize for my misjudgment. Furthermore, I should not have kept this arrest to myself, and should have told my family and friends about it. I wasn't eager to share this failure, but I should have done so anyway. ""I love my wife, family, friends, staff and Idaho. I love serving Idaho in Congress. Over the years, I have accomplished a lot for Idaho, and I hope Idahoans will allow me to continue to do that. There are still goals I would like to accomplish, and I believe I can still be an effective leader for Idaho. Next month, I will announce, as planned, whether or not I will seek re-election. ""As an elected official, I fully realize that my life is open for public criticism and scrutiny, and I take full responsibility for the mistake in judgment I made in attempting to handle this matter myself. ""It is clear, though, that through my actions I have brought a cloud over Idaho. For that, I ask the people of Idaho for their forgiveness.

"(CNN) -- A victim in the sexual abuse case against Jerry Sandusky has sued Penn State University, saying he couldn't reach a settlement with the university over claims that the longtime assistant football coach abused him. The man, known only as ""Victim 9,"" is one of 10 victims who were part of the criminal trial, in which the Nittany Lions' former defensive coordinator was convicted on 45 counts of sexual abuse in June 2012. Since the trial, 26 men have settled claims with Penn State totaling $59.7 million in connection with the Sandusky scandal, the university announced last month. Sandusky, currently serving a 30- to 60-year sentence, has always maintained that he is innocent and wrongly convicted of abusing young boys he met through his charity, The Second Mile. Sandusky raises another appeal . Many of the victims were abused on Penn State's campus, and some even after two incidents allegedly were brought to the university's attention -- once in 1998 and again in 2001. Victim 9 was raped repeatedly starting in 2005 when he was 12 years old, and ending around the time that another victim's allegations finally started a police investigation into Sandusky's decades of abuse. ""By the time this boy was introduced to Sandusky on the Penn State Campus, the top administrators at Penn State knew that Sandusky was a sexual predator,"" the man's attorney, Stephen E. Raynes, said in a press release. ""It's now clear that Penn State enabled Sandusky to sexually abuse more than twenty other children before Sandusky preyed on this boy. Each of those tragic assaults provided Penn State with the opportunity to stop Sandusky, opportunities which Penn State squandered. We will learn through this lawsuit why that happened and what additional lessons Penn State should learn from this tragic episode in its history."" Penn State paying $59.7 million to settle Sandusky cases . Raynes said Victim 9 tried to negotiate a settlement with Penn State, but the university refused ""to compensate him adequately for what he needs and deserves."" Penn State's former president, vice president and athletic director are all awaiting trial on charges they lied to a grand jury, obstructed justice and failed to report allegations of abuse reported to them in 2001. The abuse scandal resulted in the dismissal, in November 2011, of legendary head coach Joe Paterno amid allegations that he failed to respond forcefully enough to reports of Sandusky's crimes. Paterno died just weeks later, on January 22, 2012, at age 85. Penn State has said a few other claims by Sandusky victims have not yet been settled.

"(CNN) -- It's the battle of the tech titans. No, not Apple versus Samsung. Sony has gone head-to-head with Microsoft after releasing their next-generation gaming platforms for the holiday shopping season. And according to a recent sales report, Sony's PlayStation4 seems to have won the first round of the battle. The PS4 sold 1.25 million units in the United States during November, while the Xbox One sold 750,000, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan, in a recent note to investors. As for global sales, the Japanese manufacturer announced they had sold more than 2.1 million PS4 units worldwide at the beginning of December. Microsoft say they sold over 2 million systems. With the XBox One starting at $499, and the PS4 at $399, Pachter says the the $100 price difference is responsible for Sony's success: ""The reason Sony beats Microsoft is solely the price. Microsoft loses the next generation unless they cut price."" In at the starting line . From the start, it was far from clear which console would reign over the world of gaming. ""These are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between Xbox and PlayStation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere,"" says David Hutchinson, chief video games writer for The Times of London. The tech landscape has transformed drastically since the last time these two electronics giants went head to head with the Xbox 360 in 2005 and the PlayStation 3 in 2007. Back then, smartphones and tablet devices didn't even exist. While PS4 is being touted as the perfect machine for social media lovers -- offering games that players can share easily with friends -- Xbox One is said to be ideal for those after a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games, movies, music and applications quickly and seamlessly. ""The PlayStation 4 has been set as more of a games machine versus the Xbox One's aim to be the multimedia entertainment center at the heart of your living room ... Both systems are essentially PCs in a console shell,"" explains Hutchinson. The two systems have everything from motion tracking and facial recognition to cameras and redesigned controllers. What's more, the Xbox One can not only be plugged into your cable box for on-demand TV and movies, but can also be personalized to a user's interests running a series of apps and programs, including Skype, NetFlix and LoveFilm. Smart strategies . Seven years ago, Microsoft pushed development on the Xbox 360 so that they could put their console on the market a year ahead of the PlayStation 3. Hutchinson says this move gave Microsoft plenty of time ""to gain an audience within a gaming community where the PlayStation had previously ruled supreme."" ""They gained a huge market share in that unchallenged year,"" he explains. ""Sony are obviously aware how this has affected their market dominance, so in this cycle of consoles they have made sure to release the PS4 slightly ahead of their rival in the U.S. to make sure they aren't left behind again."" At the industry's E3 conference in June, not long after Sony went public with their early release date, Microsoft announced they'd priced their console $100 more than Sony's PS4. Though the news didn't sit well with gaming enthusiasts, Microsoft refused to budge on the price. A gamer backlash ensued when fans found out the Xbox One was not going to allow offline gameplay or secondhand games to be used on the device. In turn, resistance from fans forced Microsoft to reverse its decision, explains Hutchinson. ""Xbox were wise to backtrack on their initial idea that you wouldn't be able to easily resell secondhand games or pass old games onto friends more than once,"" says Hutchinson. ""It showed a lack of understanding of the importance of selling on games for younger gamers, but also showed Microsoft's maturity in knowing when to backtrack if mistakes have been made."" The death of consoles? In recent years, the video game industry has seen users develop a growing appetite for mobile devices. This has led some to question the future of the console industry. ""Rumors of gaming console death are a bit premature,"" says Eric Smith, a consumer electronics expert from Strategy Analytics. ""It's been a down year in 2013 [for consoles], but going forward, this next generation is going to boost sales for several years to come."" Industry analysts attribute few top game releases and the tail end of the last generation of consoles as contributing factors for this year's downturn. Meanwhile mobile play continues to grow at a significant rate. Research firm Gartner forecast in their latest report that revenue from mobile gaming alone is predicted to ""nearly double between 2013 and 2015 from $13.2 billion to $22 billion."" ""Casual gamers I think have moved on most likely to mobile platforms. Tablets and phones are cheaper [and] more easily accessible,"" says Smith. ""These are impressive machines that have been released, they are enjoying great sales and beforehand, they were enjoying great pre-orders ... But the audience has shrunk and I don't think those casual gamers are going to return."" So with casual gamers moving over to their smartphones, hardcore gamers have been left to save the console for future generations. Smith says: ""[Xbox One] does gaming as well, but it is targeted towards a much broader audience and I think there is a risk in that gamers look at it and say: 'This is not for me, this is not built for gamers first' ... But at the same time, if these functions do catch up, [Microsoft] stands to gain sales down the road."" Meanwhile, Hutchinson hopes that neither electronics giant will reign supreme as it means a better and more competitive experience for the fans themselves. ""The joint dominance of the Xbox 360 and the PS3 marked a great era for the gaming public,"" he says. ""With no monopoly, gamers get better deals on games and hardware after the initial round of console launches are out of the way. Long may this continue.""","Microsoft and Sony release their next-gen gaming consoles .

"(CNN) -- I am covering the Olympics for Slate this year, and, as such, it's my job to know what happens at the Games as soon as it happens. No waiting for the tape-delay broadcast for me; I wake at 4 a.m. to watch archery and stay in front of the screen until the sun sets on the British Isles. What this means is that I have personally spoiled at least seven people's enjoyment of the Olympics by blabbing prematurely about who won what event. ""Did you see that Michael Phelps came in fourth?"" I ask. ""No, you jerk, and thanks for ruining it for me. I was going to watch that tonight,"" they respond. For this and myriad other moments of spoiler-related thoughtlessness, I heartily apologize. And in order to make amends, I hereby offer 10 tips on what to do and how to prepare if you want to avoid having the Games spoiled by careless obsessives like me. Opinion: Is it really #NBCfail? 1. The key to any good spoiler-avoidance strategy is practice. Construct a training space in your basement or backyard, and prepare yourself for the challenges to come. See how long you can resist the urge to check your phone for swimming updates. Practice walking with your fingers in your ears while shouting ""I can't hear you! I can't hear you!"" 2. Fun fact: Casual commuting is responsible for 75 percent of sports spoilers. When you're walking along the street or sitting on a subway, you often can't avoid overhearing other people talking about the Games. So be sure to take the necessary precautions before you leave the house. Map your route and follow it to the letter, making sure to gaze straight at the ground the entire way. Some might recommend that you also don a heavy pair of earmuffs, but there's no need for you to go outside looking like a freak. Carrying around a portable white noise machine will be fine. 3. Your smartphone is your enemy during these next two weeks. If you carry it around, you will be tempted to check the Internet, and you risk receiving spoiler-laden text messages from your gymnastics-loving friends. Switch to an older phone for the duration of the Olympics, preferably one that is decades old, is shaped like a brick and has a wan green display that can handle neither text messages nor the Internet. You could also take this opportunity to rediscover the joys of pre-cellular communication devices. Bag up some quarters and see if you can still find a working payphone. Fire up your old CB radio. (Nobody on the CB radio is talking about the Olympics. They're all talking about speed traps and convoys and such.) Twitter takes the Olympic gold for speed . 4. Streamline your social media feeds. You can probably divide your Facebook friends into ""people who are likely to follow the Olympics"" and ""people who are not."" Hide all status updates from the Olympics-following friends. This should leave you with a Facebook feed composed entirely of elderly relatives, local merchants and new mothers posting photographs of their children. Abandon Twitter entirely, or, at the very least, unfollow everyone except Jose Canseco. 5. Implement and rigorously follow a household media blackout: no radio, no television, no newspapers, no Internet, no virtual reality devices. Mollify your children by telling them it's Dictionary Month, and promise a handsome prize to whichever child memorizes the most words. If your spouse complains, cut her off by shouting irrationally ""Who did you marry: me or Comcast?! It's like I don't even know you anymore!"" If a full-fledged media blackout isn't feasible, then at least limit yourself to the stations that are least likely to air anything having to do with modern times: the radio stations that play big band music and old-timey radio programs. On television, the TV stations that specialize in old reruns of ""Mama's Family."" 6. Your friends and family are likely to try to spoil the Olympics results for you. Thus, it is critical that you do your best to alienate them for the duration of the Olympics. Avoid bathing and repel them with your hideous smell; refuse to answer their phone calls, e-mail messages or direct questions. If they start talking about London, cut them off immediately with a brusque ""I don't want to hear ANYBODY talking about the Olympics. MY GRANDFATHER DIED IN A DECATHLON ACCIDENT!"" 7. The office is bound to be a prime place for Olympics spoilers. Stay away from the water cooler; go thirsty if you must. Arrive 10 minutes late for every meeting, to avoid any obnoxious spoiler-laden pre-meeting chatter. Take the stairs instead of the elevator; it's better to be a bit winded than to risk picking up untimely information on those stupid elevator televisions they have. Really, the best thing is to just not go to work for a couple of weeks. Now's the time to cash in those ""Olympics days"" you've been saving up. Jobs give their workers Olympics days, right? Day 4: The best photos of the Olympics . 8. Don't go to the gym, either, because the gym is filled with armchair Olympians who like nothing more than to discuss the day's sporting events. Do your exercising outdoors, instead. If you must visit the gym, be sure to only use the unpopular equipment, like jump ropes and medicine balls. And, for goodness sake, stay away from bars, because bars are a prime location for loose-lipped sports talkers. Instead, you should drink alone at home. If you find yourself craving the tavern experience, all you need is some plywood, a few milk crates and a couple of cases of Keystone, and, presto, you'll have your own makeshift wet bar. (Home improvement projects are easy!) 9. If you are handy, you might consider building a Cone of Silence, like they used in the TV show ""Get Smart."" This is basically just a hard plastic fishbowl that you wear over your head. (This will certainly stop you from hearing any spoilers, but also, if you wear it, you may asphyxiate.) 10. You know where nobody's talking about the Olympics? In the forest. Take these next two weeks as an opportunity to go back to nature. Pitch a tent in the woods, and commune with the stars and the seedlings. Bring a battery-powered television that gets only three channels, and fire it up every night around 7. You'll be able to watch the key moments of the Games in peace and quiet. And, despite what you've heard, it is quite unlikely that you'll be eaten by a bear. Photos: Olympian outtakes .

"London (CNN) -- The former husband of celebrity chef Nigella Lawson will take the stand Thursday in the trial of the couple's former personal assistants, who are accused of defrauding them of 300,000 pounds (U.S. $488,000). The British court heard earlier this week at a pre-trial hearing for the assistants that Lawson and ex-husband Charles Saatchi had a ""culture of secrecy"" around their marriage. In the hearing, the defense read an e-mail from Saatchi to Lawson about the allegedly embezzled money, saying that the assistants would ""get off"" because, he wrote, Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Representatives for Lawson declined to comment on the allegations, citing the ongoing court proceedings. The defense also read a statement from Saatchi saying that he learned of Lawson's alleged drug use in June, around the time the couple were photographed in a restaurant having an argument. In the photos -- which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers at the time -- Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat. Saatchi, a renowned art collector, accepted a police warning for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon after. The defense claimed that the e-mails showed both Saatchi and Lawson had attempted a ""manipulation of the court"" and that the case should be thrown out. The judge ruled the trial would proceed. The former assistants, Italian sisters, have denied they embezzled any money from the couple.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy believes his renowned ability as a frontrunner will land him the Dubai Desert Classic title despite seeing his lead cut to a single stroke at the halfway stage Friday. McIlroy was unable to reproduce his first round heroics when he shot a 63, but followed it up with a two-under-par 70 for a two-round total of 11-under 133. Unheralded American Brooks Koepka was his nearest challenger after a sparkling second round 65 while world number one Tiger Woods struggled to a one-over 73 to make the cut by one shot on three-under. England's Danny Willett matched Koepka's 65 to share third place on eight-under with Ireland's Damien McGrane and Frenchman Julien Quesne. Defending champion Stephen Gallacher, who played in the same group as McIlroy and Woods, was among seven players a shot further back, which included last year's European number one Henrik Stenson of Sweden. McIlroy struggled from the outset with a bogey on his opening hole but recovered to card three birdies to the turn. On the easier back nine he would have expected to pull further clear but instead made two bogeys, canceled out by birdies at the 10th and 18th. The 24-year-old remained optimistic he could build on his slender lead at the weekend and land his sixth European Tour title. ""I will just go back tonight and regroup and realize that I am still leading the tournament,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""I hit a couple of loose drives which I haven't done the last couple of weeks but I still feel like I'm playing well enough to go and win the tournament."" McIlroy has won a number of events, including the 2009 Dubai Desert Classic after leading for much of the way and believes it will hold him in good stead. ""I have led from the front quite well in tournaments that I have won. I feel like I am still playing well, I know the course as well as anyone else and I expect to go out there and shoot two good scores over the weekend and hopefully lift the trophy."" Koepka, who won three events on the secondary Challenger Tour last season, carded seven birdies to earn his chance of pairing with McIlroy Saturday. ""I've never played with Rory, so it's going to be fun. I know him a little bit from seeing him around, so hopefully I'll be able to play as well as I did today,"" he said. Stenson, who topped the money lists in both the PGA and European Tours last season, looks to pose the biggest threat to McIlroy. ""I think there is still a little way to go but today was the best I have putted for a long, long time,"" said the Swede. Woods, who missed the cut in his opening event of 2014, was wayward off the tee and found the fairway just twice from 10 attempts when using his driver. The result was a three-bogey round that left him tied for for 44th, but still not out of the running if he could produce an inspired round at the weekend.","Rory McIlroy leads at halfway of the Dubai Desert Classic .

"(CNN) -- I first met Alvaro Palacios in 1989 when I was freelancing for the Wine Spectator magazine. That job required me to visit dozens of wineries, and I was even obligated to taste wine. Palacios, a fifth-generation Spanish vintner, understood these hardships. As he drove me around his family's operation in the Rioja winemaking appellation back then, he kept talking about the search for special vineyards in the mountains of northeastern Catalonia. He insisted that an old, forgotten region there could produce the next great Spanish wines. Since then, Palacios has gained international fame for two red wines, Finca Dofi, which costs about $100 a bottle, and L'Ermita, which costs about $1,000 a bottle. He makes them in that appellation he was searching for, called Priorat, a two hour-drive southwest of Barcelona. I recently decided it was time to for CNN to pay a visit. Read more: Driverless cars: From Hollywood to real world . We arrived to the hillside village of Gratallops at dusk and checked into what could be described as a wine-obsessed hotel, Cal Llop, run by a wine-loving couple who left Madrid years ago to pursue a new life. My room looked out at the L'Ermita vineyard and my cameraman's room overlooked Alvaro Palacios's winery. The dinner was all about wine, although I recall that the food also was good. Read more: Bumpy road ahead for London cabbie business . The next morning, we were deep inside Palacios' wine cellar, with hundreds of French oak barrels. In just one extra large cask, the entire 2012 vintage of L'Ermita was aging. ""The real queen, absolutely,"" Palacios said, gently stroking the cask. Upstairs, we were soon tasting it. ""See the perfume. It's so delicate,"" Palacios explained, large wine glass in hand. Delicate but very distinguished, as is the price, about a thousand dollars a bottle. ""Who matters what the price is?"" Palacios said. Read more: Scottish pride restored by world porridge champion . ""Is this going to solve Spain's economic crisis, this wine?"" I asked. ""Well, that would be a nice help,"" he said. Palacios looked to markets abroad 20 years ago, long before the crisis struck at home. And he said others in Spain need to do the same. ""I tell my friends to tell his sons, his relatives, that they must get internationalized because the future is so global, everything happens so fast,"" Palacios said. Palacios has built a $16 million business in three Spanish wine regions: Rioja, where his family started; Priorat, where he made his own mark, and more recently in Bierzo, in northwest Spain, an old vineyard region that has also gained new fame, working closely with his nephew. Read more: Skyscanner brings a pinch of Silicon Valley to Scotland . Most of Palacios' wine from these three appellations costs $18 a bottle or less. But that's the point -- he's producing the marquee vintages and the wine that's accessible to regular consumers. ""You have to make the best product possible because the consumer is very smart, very clever,"" he said. ""So, great quality and then export. You have to also sell in your country. It's both things, together."" He isn't afraid to take an unusual path. He uses mules to plow prime vineyards on hills too steep for tractors. And he doesn't have a website for the business. Read more: Spain turning back the clock on siestas . ""I don't need a website to drink the best wines of the world,"" he said. ""I know where they are, or I just ask."" And Palacios thinks there is a silver lining in Spain's long economic crisis. ""I think that this crisis is making young generations, new generations, understand the that the concept is to guarantee a market in the international trade,"" he said. After all these years, catching up with Palacios was comforting confirmation that he and I are not aging too badly, although his wines are surely doing better at that.","Alvaro Palacios gained international fame for two red wines, Finca Dofi, about $100 a bottle, and L'Ermita, about $1,000 a bottle .

"London (CNN) -- With her lashings of butter and flirtations with the camera, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson has charmed her many fans by turning everyday cooking into a more sensual experience. As she's licked her fingers while talking viewers through her recipes, she has earned nicknames such as ""domestic goddess"" and the ""queen of food porn"" in the British media. But her successful cooking career has not been mirrored in her recent personal life. Her 10-year marriage to millionaire art collector Charles Saatchi collapsed after photos of the couple having an argument at a restaurant emerged in June. In the photos -- which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers at the time -- Saatchi has his hand around Lawson's throat. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon after. Since then, the trial of the couple's two former personal assistants -- who were cleared Friday of defrauding Lawson and Saatchi of hundreds of thousands of pounds -- has gripped the media. This has mainly been thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi. During the trial, the two former assistants, Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo told the court they believed the celebrity chef repeatedly used drugs. Saatchi had said in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in his testimony before the court last month, he backed off that claim. The court heard that none of the witnesses had seen her take drugs. In her own testimony, Lawson, 53, confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times, during two periods of her life, and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user, saying, ""I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem."" 'I am not a chef' Her admission of limited drug use may cause some surprise because of Lawson's connections with the British political establishment. Born in London, she is the daughter of Nigel Lawson, a former Conservative Party British chancellor of the exchequer, or finance minister. Her brother Dominic was formerly editor of The Spectator, a British conservative political magazine. In the 1980s, before Lawson married him, Saatchi ran Saatchi & Saatchi, a leading global advertising agency, with his brother. Its campaigns included the promotion of the Conservative Party under then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. After studying at Oxford University, the celebrity chef began her career in publishing before moving into media, writing restaurant columns. She met her first husband, John Diamond, while working at the Sunday Times newspaper. The couple had two children. In 2001, Diamond died after a battle with throat cancer. Lawson went on to contribute to various UK newspapers before writing books. In 1998, she brought out ""How to Eat,"" in which she stated how food was an early love. ""I am not a chef. I am not even a trained or professional cook. My qualification is as an eater,"" she wrote. Her second book -- ""How to Be a Domestic Goddess,"" in which she taught readers how to feel just like that while baking muffins or cakes -- came out two years later and won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year. Lawson went on to release a string of other successful cookbooks and host numerous cooking television shows, such as ""Nigella Bites"" in Britain. In the United States, she's been a judge on the ABC show ""The Taste,"" which is due to air its second season starting in January. She also launched a successful kitchenware line and once oversaw a lunch menu for former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former U.S. President George W. Bush. Lawson lists her recipes on her website and posts them on her Twitter account.","Fans call Nigella Lawson the ""domestic goddess"" and ""queen of food porn""

"(CNN) -- A lockdown at Yale University was lifted Monday afternoon, hours after someone anonymously told a 911 dispatcher that his roommate was coming to the southern Connecticut university to shoot people, authorities in New Haven said. No gunfire and no injuries were reported. Most of Yale's schools already were out for Thanksgiving recess, but some students and staff remained, and the school sent e-mails and texts asking them to stay in locked rooms or offices. At least one person subsequently reported seeing somebody with a weapon on or near campus, though police were trying to determine whether the sighting was of an investigating police officer, New Haven Police Chief Dean Esserman said Monday afternoon. ""Nobody has been hurt. Nobody has been apprehended with a gun. But in this day in age, when there is a call, it behooves us to overreact and not underreact,"" said Esserman. ""Though it is starting to tilt in the direction of an innocent mistake, it started with a purposeful and malicious call,"" the police chief told reporters. ""And the New Haven police are going to track down the person who made that call. We're going to find the person who made that call, and we're going to put handcuffs on the person who made that call,"" he said. The shelter-in-place order slowed officers' room-to-room searches of dorms and other buildings, because the people inside often weren't immediately opening doors for the police, not trusting that the police had come to check, according to New Haven police Officer David Hartman. Many of the doors, he said, didn't have didn't have peepholes, so officers were taking their time persuading the occupants. ""If Yale were in full session right now, this certainly would be a tougher job for law enforcement,"" Hartman said. Police said someone called 911 from a pay phone around 9:30 a.m. and matter-of-factly said his roommate ""was on his way to Yale university to shoot people,"" Hartman said. Investigators didn't know who the caller was or who the supposed roommate is, he said. He wouldn't comment on whether the call might be a hoax.

What makes 2014 even more significant is the likelihood of an epic battle between the ruling Indian National Congress and its allies versus the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with the controversial Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi at its helm. The Indian National Congress has been in power for the past decade under the leadership of the Italy-born Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul, heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. In an era of coalition politics, the rise of regional leaders and local political parties is also crucial. While it's difficult to predict winners when there are numerous unknowns, here are five factors bound to influence Indian voters in 2014. 1) Corruption . It's so ingrained in almost every aspect of daily life that most Indians have long tolerated and gotten used to small-scale corruption. However, after a series of multimillion- and even billion-dollar scams, brought to light by an unrelenting media, the fight against corruption has reached a tipping point in India. In New Delhi's recent state assembly polls, the stellar performance by a brand new political party founded on an anti-corruption platform was unprecedented. Both houses of the Indian parliament subsequently passed landmark legislation in December to create an anti-corruption ombudsman with the power to investigate graft at the highest levels. How it will be implemented is yet to be determined, but without a doubt, the prevailing anti-corruption sentiment will continue to have major ripples in 2014. 2) Youth . Much is said of India's untapped and vast youth potential. In 2014, first-time voters will account for almost one-third of the electorate. These young adults grew up in an India reveling in near double-digit growth rates. A recent economic downturn is shaking things up politically, although the influence this will have on youth voters remains unclear. What moves Indian youth to act is unpredictable, as manifested in the stunning outpouring of support for the victim of a vicious gang rape in New Delhi in 2012. But increasingly, young people appear to be shedding their indifference to politics, and this crucial voting block cannot be ignored in 2014. 3) Religious violence . In September, India had the worst case of religious violence since the Gujarat riots in 2002. More than 60 people, mostly Muslims, were killed and tens of thousands displaced along religious lines in Muzaffarnagar, a district about 130 kilometers north of New Delhi. In a country founded on the principles of secularism, there's growing fear over what the re-emergence of religious tensions could mean for the country's politics. With the rising popularity of the opposition's candidate for prime minister, the Hindu hardliner Narendra Modi, there are concerns he'll adopt a polarizing strategy to win votes. Analysts say political tensions could also mount as political groups opposed to Modi try to paint him as a radical. The long-running election strategy of dividing communities for political gain could be an ongoing political tactic in 2014. 4) Inflation . India's economic slide may have bottomed out and growth is conservatively expected to rise to around 6% in 2014, but the common man continues to be deeply affected by inflation. For most of 2013, consumer inflation hovered around 10%. The outcome of the recent state elections in which the ruling party suffered a massive blow was partly on account of rising prices. The chief of India's central bank has made taming inflation his top priority, but the impact of recent monetary tightening measures may not be felt in the short term. Inflation, then, could remain a critical factor in the national elections. 5) Rise of states and regional parties . India's economy slowed in 2013, but one of the main reasons the economy hasn't come to a standstill is that growth in several of India's 28 states continues to rise at unprecedented levels. In the once impoverished state of Bihar, for instance, the economy grew at 14% in 2012-13, in Madhya Pradesh 10% and Odisha 9.14%. These states were never India's engines for growth. Economic power translates to political clout, and as the central government is becoming weaker, the states are becoming stronger. This shift is so substantial, states and regional parties can now dictate national and international policies. How these regional parties fare and which coalitions they choose to join will have a massive influence on the national elections.","India's election takes place with some 788 million eligible voters .

"(CNN) -- In Egypt, the words ""street food"" and ""gourmet"" don't often go hand in hand. Street food is not about style; it's meant to be quick, cheap and filling. However Chris Khalifa, a 30-year-old owner of Zooba cafe in Cairo, has tried to change that. He saw a trend elsewhere in the world: chefs hit the streets and serve dishes out of food trucks. ""I noticed no one had ever tried to do this with Egyptian street food,"" said Khalifa. ""I try to create a brand around a more gourmet Egyptian street food."" But instead bringing gourmet food to the street, Zooba turns street food into fine dining. Located in Cairo's upmarket Zamalek neighborhood, the cafe serves classic street fare like koshari and falafel with a new twist. The dishes, like spinach-infused ""baladi"" bread or sweet potatoes roasted with a blowtorch, are prepared by professionally trained chefs, using top-quality ingredients. Read more: Egypt's street art revolution . Khalifa's business partner, Moustafa El Rafaey, handles the creative side of running the restaurant. Trained at a culinary arts program in the United States, he initially found cooking Egyptian cuisine was quite daunting -- and foreign. ""I was scared to be honest,"" said El Rafaey. ""I had (a) good international background. To leave all this to cook... Egyptian food was a bit scary for me."" To develop the restaurant's menu, El Rafaey traveled across Egypt. He mastered local recipes, tried new flavors and searched for best ingredients. He relishes his experience, saying that preparing food is like creating an artwork. ""Anything that puts a smile on your face is an art. When you watch a good dance or listen to a good music that makes your smile,"" Elrafaey says. ""And I put smiles on people's faces with my food."" ""When we started, I honestly had no idea how people would respond to a gourmet 'ful,' 'tameya' or 'koshari,'"" said Khalifa, who quit his banking job to start the restaurant. ""The response has been good, people have been coming in."" Business is so good that they are thinking to expand, opening a second and a third branch of Zooba in Cairo. And perhaps one day, in Dubai or even London -- which means taking Egyptian street food to the world.","For many residents of Cairo, the best food is street food .

"(CNN) -- At 10 Friday morning, the Russians will give Frank Hewetson the best holiday gift of all: a stamp in his British passport that will allow the Greenpeace activist to leave the country and return home to his family. The exit visa will put an end to Hewetson's chilling saga that began in September in the icy waters surrounding an Arctic oil rig. He was among 28 protesters and two journalists aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise who were arrested by Russian authorities and thrown in jail. Hewetson, 48, was on the helicopter deck of the ship, taking in a full moon and a sunset on that September evening. It was a sight to behold in the Arctic. Amid the breathtaking beauty, he saw on the horizon what looked like a little wasp buzzing around, getting bigger and bigger. Suddenly, a massive helicopter swooped down, the monstrous gusts of winds knocking Hewetson off his feet. Russian paratroopers stormed the Greenpeace ship. It was frightening and Hewetson felt queasy, his just-eaten dinner barely digested. Five days later, he found himself locked up in a Russian prison that seemed a mix between a joke and a Cold War-era novel by John le Carre. It was dilapidated and rat-infested. Some windows were broken and the central heating didn't work everywhere. ""It was like stepping back in time,"" Hewetson said. He'd worked for Greenpeace, perhaps the world's best known environmental activist group, since 1989 and on campaigns across the world. He joined the mission to protest the rig owned by Russian company Gazprom because he firmly believed oil companies had to be stopped from drilling for fossil fuels in the Arctic. Suddenly, his life seemed severed from all that he loved -- his wife and two children in London, his dog Pluto and his passion for ping pong. Russia had not only jailed him but he, like the other Arctic 30, as they became known, were facing charges of piracy so serious that he was looking at a possible 15 years behind bars. At home in England, those kind of charges meant the authorities had a heap of evidence against the accused. He felt ""pretty damn desperate,"" he said Thursday. ""That was a very hard night for me in prison."" The charges were later reduced to ""hooliganism"" which still carried a penalty of seven years in jail. Each day, the minutes ticked slowly. Hewetson passed time by reading, though it took a long time for the prison to receive books sent by family and friends and even longer to add them to the library. Author Terry Pratchett's light-hearted writing struck the right chord. ""One had to pace one's reading,"" he said, ""because staring at the ceiling lying in your bunk with nothing to take your mind off your immediate predicament was not a good place to be."" The cell was about 18 feet by 7 feet and contained three men -- Hewetson and two inmates already there on criminal convictions. The floorboards had rotted out, the window, busted. A toilet was separated by thin, wooden panels -- a call of nature at dinner hour was not appreciated by other cellmates. The light was on 24/7 and the air was thick with cigarette smoke, something that bothered Hewetson, a nonsmoker. Hewetson got on famously with his two cellmates, a fact that is fundamental, he said, to enduring prison life. He discovered through a strange form of lingua franca the reason for incarceration of his cell mates. They played chess together once Greenpeace managed to send across a set. ""During these games I found out, quite slowly, that 'S' was in for double manslaughter and 'V' was in for gangland violence,"" Hewetson said, referring to his cellmates. ""Despite the differing reasons for our incarceration we became very close friends."" He spent 23 of 24 hours every day in that cell. He was allowed one hour a day of solitary exercise in a small pen. He dreamed of playing ping pong, a game he loves enough to list as a hobby on his Greenpeace profile. Another lifesaver was a Russian human rights activist who visited him regularly. The British prisoners nicknamed her Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle because she (rather unkindly, he said) resembled the hedgehog washerwoman in a Beatrix Potter tale. Hewetson, like everyone else, lost a lot of weight during his imprisonment. The food, he said, was truly awful. ""The evening meals quite often contained fish heads. This mainly got flushed away as it was unpalatable even when really hungry."" The ordeal ended last week, when a sweeping amnesty program in Russia allowed the Arctic 30 to go free. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been generous with ""get-out-of-jail free cards"" of late. The amnesty law freed business executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky and two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot, jailed for a performance critical of Putin. Hewetson said he was relieved. ""I think the Russian Olympics had quite a bit to do with it,"" he said about the upcoming 2014 winter games in Sochi. Hewetson hopes to leave for St. Petersburg Friday morning. In the meantime, some prison habits have been hard to shake. He does his own laundry, cooks his own noodles with a boiling ring in his hotel room and eats kasha (porridge) every morning. ""Such activity before prison would have been pretty alien to me,"" he said. Despite prison, Hewetson seems committed to Greenpeace. He spoke Thursday about how dangerous drilling for oil in the Arctic is to the environment. But for now, he just wants to get back home to London, to his family. He wants to light a wood-burning stove and brew a good cup of tea. And take his dog for a long walk.","Hewetson was among 28 activists and 2 journalists arrested at an Arctic oil rig .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt ended his season on a high note with a comfortable 100 meters victory at the final Diamond League meeting in Brussels on Friday. The Jamaican sprint king, who said this week he wants to retire at the top after the 2016 Olympics, went close to his best time of 2013 as he clocked 9.80 seconds. It was just 0.03s slower than the time he set in regaining his world title in Moscow last month. ""If I had got a better start it would've been 9.70,"" he said after the race. ""I can definitely run faster. I started my season pretty poorly and got injured at the start so it was not the perfect season or the best of my career. But the best thing is I finished on top and dominated."" Bolt is a popular figure at the Belgian event, where he set a meeting record time of 9.76 in 2011. ""I still enjoy doing this -- this is one of the best crowds and it gave me the energy,"" he said. The 27-year-old was 0.1s quicker than second-placed American Michael Rodgers, whose 9.90 was his season's best. Bolt's compatriot Nesta Carter was given third place after sharing a time of 9.94 with Moscow silver medalist Justin Gatlin of the U.S. while Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole was fifth in 9.98. Gatlin, however, had the consolation of winning the $40,000 prize for being the overall Diamond League champion over the distance, with Bolt second. Bolt's win completed a 100m double for Jamaica, as Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce consolidated her place at the top of the women's standings with victory. The 26-year-old, who like Bolt won three golds in Moscow, set a meeting record of 10.72 to head off American Alexandria Anderson (10.92) and fellow Jamaicans Carrie Russell (10.99) and Kerron Stewart (11.19). Fraser-Pryce's time was just outside her personal best of 10.70 and 0.01s behind her leading effort this year in Moscow. She added the 100m Diamond League crown to the 200m title she had already sewn up. Bolt didn't enter the men's 200m in Brussels, which was won by his compatriot Warren Weir -- who clinched the overall title for the distance. However, the country's on-track success was tempered by Friday's news that the five athletes who tested positive for prohibited substances in June have had confirmation that their ""B"" samples also showed the presence of the drugs. The Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission has sent confirmation letters to the quintet, according to a report in the Jamaican Gleaner. The group includes former 100m world record-holder Asafa Powell and ex-Olympic relay champion Sherone Simpson, who have both protested their innocence.","World and Olympic champion Usain Bolt wins final Diamond League race .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The key players in the ""Fast & Furious"" series meet Friday to discuss the future of the movie franchise, star Vin Diesel said. ""We always took pride in trying to make each one better than the last,"" Diesel said in a post on his verified Facebook fan page late Thursday. Diesel has used his Facebook page to keep fans updated since co-star Paul Walker died in a high-speed car crash six weeks ago. ""P.s. Tomorrow we meet with the studio, regarding the future of the Fast saga ... and the completion of seven,"" he said. Walker, 40, and the rest of the ""Fast & Furious"" cast were on a short break for Thanksgiving when he stepped into a red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT for a short ride around a Santa Clarita, California, business park. Investigators concluded that the car, driven by Walker's friend, was speeding at more than 100 miles per hour when it clipped a light pole and was engulfed in flames, killing both men. Walker's ex-cop character, Brian O'Conner, was central to five of the first six ""Fast & Furious"" stories, and his death left the future of the next film in doubt. Millions of dollars are at stake, considering the franchise has sold $2.6 billion in tickets around the world since 2001. Universal Studios, which was planning to release the franchise's seventh installment this July, announced last month that it would hit theaters on April 10, 2015. Diesel posted a message and photograph on Facebook two weeks ago that showed the last scene he and Walker filmed together. ""There was a unique sense of completion, of pride we shared ... in the film we were now completing ... the magic captured ... and, in just how far we've come,"" Diesel wrote.

"(CNN) -- Legal strife plaguing the family of South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela may have cooled down a notch Tuesday, when charges that his grandson had tampered with the graves of Mandela's deceased children were dropped. Prosecutors also dropped unrelated charges of bigamy against Mandla Mandela, the South Africa Press Agency reported. The grandson, whose full name is Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, had admitted to reburying the remains of three of Nelson Mandela's children, SAPA said, including those of his own father, in Nelson Mandela's birthplace, the village of Mvezo, in 2011. In July, 16 members of the Mandela family filed grave tampering charges against Mandla, and the remains were transferred to Nelson Mandela's home in the town of Qunu. The bigamy charges were filed in 2011, after Mandla Mandela married a woman against a court order in 2004. The couple later filed for divorce. A prosecutors' spokesman told SAPA that the office dropped both charges against Mandela's grandson after determining that investigations had not produced enough evidence to allow for a trial.

"(CNN) -- One by one, retired tennis legends are returning to the tour as coaches and Novak Djokovic says that can only be a ""very good"" thing for the game. Andy Murray got the ball rolling by hiring eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl at the end of 2011, with Djokovic turning to six-time major champion Boris Becker this month. And just this week, Roger Federer added six-time grand slam winner Stefan Edberg -- who was a playing rival of Lendl and Becker -- to his team in a bid to recapture old form. ""It is very good for the sport,"" Djokovic told CNN in Abu Dhabi, where he won an exhibition tournament on Saturday by defeating David Ferrer. ""I've seen people coming out with head to heads between Edberg, Lendl and Boris, which was funny to see. ""It's going to attract more positive attention to our sport ... on court, off the court. These guys have won multiple grand slams and achieved a lot on and off the court. They can identify with us and us with them. ""They know what we are going through. I believe all of us who made arrangements with ex players (are) looking forward to the help on court during big moments."" Djokovic didn't discard longtime coach Marian Vajda in appointing Becker and he is confident he has the right people in place. ""(Vajda) has been a friend and a life companion for so many years,"" the world No. 2 added. ""And then Boris coming in as a legend of the sport and somebody who has achieved so much and has great experience that he can transfer to me ... the combination of the two I believe will be (successful)."" Straight sets for Nole . With Becker courtside, Djokovic captured the Mubadala World Tennis Championship for a record third time by easing past Ferrer, 7-5 6-2, and pocketed $250,000. Djokovic hasn't been beaten since the U.S. Open final in September and heads to the Australian Open in January as the three-time defending champion. Rafael Nadal, the man who topped the Serb in New York, overcame Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third-place match, 7-6 6-3. The world No. 1 will now compete at next week's Qatar Open in Doha and was looking forward to more training time. ""The period between seasons is not big,"" the Spaniard was quoted as saying by The National. ""So during Abu Dhabi and Doha, I will continue practices and doing my warm-ups for the match more than what I would usually do. ""The period of practice in Mallorca was not enough so I need to keep preparing myself in these two events.

"Alamo Heights, Texas (CNN) -- A campus police officer who fatally shot a Catholic-college honor student following a traffic stop told the student to stop resisting arrest 56 times before shooting him five times, police said. Cpl. Christopher Carter, who is on administrative leave after the shooting, is ""very remorseful,"" police say, but he shot 23-year-old Robert Cameron Redus only after Redus took his police baton and hit him with it. Carter was able to get his baton back, but Redus then charged him, prompting the University of the Incarnate Word officer to shoot six times, hitting Redus five. Redus was pronounced dead at the scene, Alamo Heights police Chief Richard Pruitt said Monday. There is no dashboard video of the shooting available, but a microphone recorded sound from the altercation Friday. It started with a traffic stop. Redus had been drinking, according to a witness, and drove past Carter, who was patrolling in a campus police pickup truck, Pruitt said. The student sped into a construction zone in ""bad weather conditions,"" he said. Carter followed him. Redus struck a curb on the right, Carter reported, then swerved left into the opposite lane of traffic, so the officer switched on his emergency lights and pulled him over, Pruitt said. Redus pulled into the apartment complex where he lived, and Carter followed, but he made a fateful slip. He reported the wrong street location to police dispatchers, which caused his call to be routed to a police department farther away. Alamo Heights police could have made it there to assist him sooner, but his call went to their San Antonio counterparts. This caused a delay of several minutes in response time. He was left alone with Redus, and things went wrong. Had Pruitt's officers, who were closer, been called to respond, Redus might still be alive, the chief said. The scuffle . By the time Carter got out of his patrol truck, Redus was already walking away from his vehicle, Pruitt said. Carter later told police that Redus was drunk, and one of the student's friends later confirmed she had been barhopping with him. Carter ordered Redus to put his hands on his vehicle, and he obeyed, but when the officer pulled out his handcuffs, the student refused to cooperate, Pruitt said. The two scuffled for more than six minutes. The dashboard camera's mount was not working. It had been glued in place two days before the incident, but the adhesive didn't hold, the school said. The camera was pointing in the wrong direction, but its microphone recorded the altercation. ""Officer Carter instructed Robert Redus 14 times to place his hands behind his back, and informed him three times that he was under arrest, and to stop resisting 56 times,"" Pruitt said, referring to the recording. ""During the struggle, the officer attempted to subdue the suspect with his baton. ... The baton was taken by the suspect who used it to hit the officer,"" the university said in a statement. Pruitt said the officer had injuries on his arm and head. Carter was able to wrestle the baton away from Redus, but then the student charged at the officer with his arm raised; Carter warned him four times that he would shoot if Redus did not stop, Pruitt said. Carter opened fire. Witnesses . One of Redus' neighbors reportedly heard an argument and the shots. Mohammad Haidarasl, 22, told the San Antonio Express-News that Redus was his upstairs neighbor and that he was on his apartment sofa at 2 a.m. when he heard noise outside and a voice he believes was the officer's, saying, ""Stop resisting, stop resisting."" The newspaper quoted Haidarasl as saying he thought he heard a struggle, and ""Then the cop said, 'I'm going to shoot.' "" A male voice replied, "" 'Oh, you're gonna shoot me?' like sarcastic almost,"" Haidarasl said. Less than a minute later, Haidarasl said, he heard shots. Pruitt said there were other witnesses who heard and saw parts of the struggle. One of them called police. Friends at the school say the Cameron Redus they knew wasn't the type to attack police. They knew a student who made the dean's list at college and had been co-valedictorian at a Christian high school back home in Baytown, Texas, east of Houston. They knew a fun-loving campus television news anchor who was ""the sweetest, kindest, gentlest person,"" Annie Jones told CNN affiliate WOAI-TV. ""That is nothing like him at all,"" Redus' friend Jonathan Guajardo said. ""He is one of the nicest, most caring, compassionate guys ever. Not a mean bone in his body."" Carter, who has ""an extensive law enforcement background,"" has been placed on administrative leave -- standard procedure in these types of incidents, a university statement said, adding that all campus officers ""are licensed and trained as certified peace officers by the state of Texas."" Guajardo believes deadly force was unnecessary and grilled Pruitt on the topic at a news conference. He questioned whether Redus was a real threat to Carter, who Pruitt conceded was much taller and heavier. ""The officer is very, very remorseful over this,"" Pruitt said. ""This is not an easy thing for him, I can assure you."" Family devastated . Redus' family released a statement to CNN affiliate KENS-TV saying, ""We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time."" Friends have set up a Facebook page, Cardinals for Cameron (the UIW mascot is a Cardinal), and a memorial fund to assist the family. University President Lou Agnese said in a statement released to WOAI, ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident."" This was the first shooting in university history, it said. Hundreds of people, including relatives of Redus, gathered at the university's convocation center Saturday for a vigil. Students brought a slide show of Redus in happy poses and many wore green ribbons, Redus' favorite color. Shooting leaves 2 high-schoolers dead at house party near Houston .

"(CNN) -- A professional rugby league player has been jailed for two years for a drunken assault in Sydney, amid national soul-searching over the prevalence of alcohol-fueled violence in Australian society. Russell Packer, a former New Zealand representative who plays for the Newcastle Knights in Australia's National Rugby League, attacked the victim during a night out drinking in Sydney's CBD in November, stomping on the man's face as he lay motionless. The severity of Monday's sentence apparently came as a surprise, with Australia media reporting that Packer's lawyer, Murugan Thangaraj, told the judge that he had no idea jail time was being considered. Packer's long-time mentor, former player David Lomax, speculated to Fairfax Media that the 24-year-old's ""harsh"" sentence may have been a reaction to public concern over recent high-profile street assaults. The most recent victim, 18-year-old Daniel Christie, was critically injured after being punched in the face in Sydney's King Cross nightlife district on New Year's Eve. The assault, which left him in a coma with a fractured skull, occurred close to the spot where another 18-year-old, Thomas Kelly, was killed with a single punch in July 2012. Kelly's death drew public attention to the potential damage wreaked by ""king hits"" -- a term widely used in Australian media for single, devastating punches -- and prompted the New South Wales state government to move to introduce a new ""one punch"" law, that will remove the legal requirement to prove assailants know a blow will kill in order to secure a conviction. The recent assault on Christie has sparked calls from doctors, politicians and victims' families for a concerted effort to tackle the problem of street violence, including an overhaul of Australian society's relationship with alcohol -- and its close association with sporting culture. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has weighed into the debate, urging police and the courts ""to absolutely throw the book at people who perpetrate this kind of gratuitous, unprovoked violence"" during an interview with an Australian radio station. He said the trend reflected the ""rise of the disturbed individual."" Steve Hambleton, the president of the Australian Medical Association, told CNN that changing habits of alcohol consumption was essential to tackling street violence. ""Australia seriously needs to think about its culture, that alcohol is connected next to nearly every gathering that occurs,"" he said. ""You would be forgiven for thinking you can't be successful in life, you can't be successful with the opposite sex, you can't be a successful sportsperson unless you drink."" He said the current regime for the responsible service of alcohol had ""failed,"" with ""too many intoxicated people being served alcohol."" Potential solutions included introducing early closing times, restricting the number of alcohol licenses and implementing ""no re-entry"" policies in hotspots for violence, as well examining the relationship between alcohol and sport. ""All our youth are exposed to enormous amounts of alcohol advertising through sport,"" he said. The acting leader of the Australian Greens, Richard Di Natale, called for a Senate inquiry into the promotion and advertising of alcohol. ""We need to have a close look at how the promotion of alcohol is contributing to a culture of drinking in this country that is unhealthy and dangerous,"" said Di Natale, a former drug and alcohol clinician. ""Perversely linking healthy pursuits like cricket and football with alcohol through sponsorship and alcohol advertising is the dark side of Australian sport."" Christie's family said even the widespread term ""king hit"" should be abandoned. ""We don't agree with the popular term 'king hit,'"" read a statement from the family. ""We have heard it referred to as a coward punch, which seems more appropriate."" New South Wales Police Minister Michael Gallacher said there was ""no silver bullet for alcohol-fueled violence,"" but that initiatives rolled out in recent years had seen assaults in Kings Cross drop 33% last summer. ""We will continue to work with NSW Police to curb alcohol-related violence, but individuals also need to take responsibility for their actions,"" he said. Packer has launched an appeal of his sentence, which will be heard on February 11. His lawyer, Thangaraj, did not return calls to CNN. Another National Rugby League player, Reni Maitua, is currently facing assault charges after a night out in Kings Cross in November.","Rugby league player Russell Packer was jailed for a late night assault in Sydney .

"Gaza City, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli airstrikes and tank shells pounded parts of Gaza Tuesday -- killing a 4-year-old girl, Palestinian security and medical sources said -- after Israel said a Gaza sniper killed a Muslim Israeli man near a border fence. The events began when a sniper in Gaza shot a Bedouin Israeli citizen -- Salah Shukri Abu Latyef, 22 -- who was performing maintenance work Tuesday on the fence separating Israel from the Palestinian territory's northern border, the Israeli military said. Abu Latyef was from Rahat, a southern Israeli city inhabited mainly by Bedouins, an Arab Muslim minority in Israel, the military said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office promised a forceful response, saying the shooting was a ""very severe incident, and we will not let it go unanswered."" ""Our policy until now has been to act beforehand and to respond in force, and this is how we will act regarding this incident as well,"" Netanyahu's office said. Israeli warplanes launched strikes on and near some Gaza camps of the al Qassam Brigades -- the military wing of Hamas, which controls Gaza -- Hamas security sources said. The Israeli military confirmed it launched tank and air attacks, saying it struck a weapon manufacturing facility and ""a terror infrastructure in the southern Gaza Strip, a terror site and another terror infrastructure in the central Gaza Strip, and a concealed rocket launcher in the northern Gaza Strip."" One airstrike struck a house near an al Qassam camp in central Gaza, killing a 4-year-old girl and injuring three of her relatives, the Hamas sources said. Israeli airstrikes also hit an empty field at an al Qassam camp near the southern Gaza area of Rafah, and an empty al Qassam training camp in the southern Gaza community of Khan Younes, the Hamas sources said. Hamas said the training camps were evacuated after the Israeli's killing. Israeli tank shells also hit near the al Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas sources. The sources said 11 people were injured in the airstrikes and tank attacks, in addition to the child who was killed. The al Qassam Brigades claimed on its Twitter account that the slain Israeli was a soldier. The Israeli military, however, said Abu Latyef was a civilian. The Israeli defense minister, Moshe Ya'alon, said Israel holds Hamas responsible for the shooting. ""We will not allow life in the south to be disturbed, and we will react in the sternest and gravest way to any attack on our sovereignty and injuries of our civilians and soldiers,"" Ya'alon said in a statement released by the defense ministry. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is concerned about the violence, condemns Abu Latyef's killing and deplores the death of the Gaza girl and other Palestinian civilian casualties, his spokesman said Tuesday. The Israeli military said Abu Latyef was the first Israeli civilian killed near the Gaza Strip since it launched a series of attacks there last year. In Israel's ""Pillar of Defense"" operation in November 2012, the country's military launched strikes on Gaza designed to stop constant rocket fire. Eight days of round-the-clock warfare followed between Israel and Hamas. More than 160 Palestinians, many of whom were civilians, were killed. Six Israelis died, including civilians and soldiers. Journalist Talal Abu Rahma reported from Gaza City; CNN's Michael Schwartz reported from Bethlehem in the West Bank.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 22 people were killed and more than 80 wounded Sunday in several car explosions and shootings in Iraq, including an attack on an Iraqi army base, authorities said. The war in Syria and sectarian tensions have played a part in the recent surge in violence in Iraq. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased after violence that broke out in Anbar province in recent days. On Sunday, the most fatalities occurred when men with small firearms attacked the army base in Abu Ghraib west of Baghdad, police said. The attackers fled into a nearby area. Police said the Iraqi Army opened fire on the area and targeted it using helicopters. At least eight civilians were killed and 17 others wounded. It is not clear whether the casualties included any attackers. CNN has not been able to reach the Iraqi Ministry of Defense spokesman for comment on the incident. Police officials in Salaheddin province north of Baghdad said at least four people were killed and 26 others wounded in a double bombing Sunday evening. A parked car bomb, followed by a motorcycle with a cart attached to it, detonated in a busy part of the town of Tuz Khurmato, police said. The town is an ethnically mixed part of Salaheddin province and is home to Arabs, Turkmen and Kurds. Three people were killed and 12 wounded when a car bomb exploded at a bus station in central Baghdad, police said. The parked car bomb targeted Iraqi army recruits who were returning home after submitting applications to join the army, police said. The attack is the second in less than a week targeting recruits in the Iraqi capital city. On Thursday, a suicide bomber killed at least 13 people and injured 25 others at an army recruitment center in central Baghdad. At least four people were killed and 14 others wounded Sunday when a car bomb detonated in a predominantly Shiite area in the Iraqi capital, police said. The parked car detonated in Adan Square in the Kadhimiya district of northern Baghdad. The attack happened at noon, an hour when the area is usually crowded. In the northern city of Mosul, a bomb targeted members of the Iraqi security forces, killing at least one officer and wounding six others. Police said the bomb was attached to a vehicle belonging to the Facilities Protection Services. Earlier, at least one person was killed and 11 others wounded in a car bombing south of Mosul. The parked car exploded near a sheep market in the Hamam al-Aleel area, police said. At least 60 killed in weeks of violence in Iraq . Journalists targeted . Gunmen shot and killed a local television presenter outside his home in Mosul. Mohammed Ramadan al-Hadidi, who hosted a show on herbal medicine on Nineveh al-Ghad TV, was shot by unidentified gunmen as he left his house in the western part of the city. A local journalist told CNN that the journalists union received a text message Sunday threatening to target journalists in Nineveh province. The message was signed by al Qaeda-linked groups in the province. In another incident Sunday, an Iraqi journalist was wounded along with a driver when a bomb attached to the car they were in detonated south of Mosul. The journalist works for the city's Mosuliya TV channel. Late last year, a 19-year-old anchor for the same channel was shot dead outside her home in the city. Last month, a news anchor and four other people were killed in a suicide bombing after armed militants stormed a TV complex in Tikrit, Over the past decade, Iraq has been one of the world's deadliest countries for journalists, who have been frequently targeted by militants. Mosul, the provincial capital of the predominantly Sunni Nineveh province, is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Baghdad. Security forces in Mosul say they have detained 137 suspects belonging to a Sunni-led group tied to al Qaeda, known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, in a series of raids in the city over the past seven days. Local residents say tensions have been rising in the city since violence erupted in Anbar province. At least 60 people have been killed and 297 wounded since the most recent round of violence started December 1 in embattled Anbar province, officials have said. Most victims were civilians, Ramadi and Falluja health officials said on Friday. Fighting has raged between al Qaeda-linked fighters and government troops in Falluja.

"(CNN) -- Blues singer Rita Chiarelli has played every kind of venue during her award-winning career: nightclubs, music festivals, concert halls. But of all those locales one remains unforgettable: the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Chiarelli, an Ontario native, went to Angola with the intention of playing solo for the prisoners, but wound up performing and recording with inmates, an experience she says changed her. ""I had no idea that I would be so moved and that my heart would be opened up so much from spending time with these guys,"" she said. Chiarelli's unlikely collaboration with Angola's prison musicians is documented in the film ""Music from the Big House."" She is touring North America, showing the film and performing for audiences. Chiarelli said she arranged to get a tour of Angola a decade ago after learning of its rich musical history. The legendary blues/folk artist Huddie William Ledbetter (better known as Leadbelly) plied his 12-string guitar from behind the walls of Angola. His music came to light through the efforts of folklorists John and Alan Lomax, who recorded Leadbelly and other inmates. ""I saw where Leadbelly was probably incarcerated,"" she said. Angola ""haunted me, you know, the Mississippi River flowing through it and ... I was just haunted by these images. And that all this music had come from this place."" Chiarelli said she began to wonder whether there were any musical inmates currently serving time at Angola. The answer was a resounding yes. ""We have 10 or 12 bands"" comprised of prisoners, Warden Burl Cain confirmed to CNN. He said he didn't hesitate when Chiarelli pitched him on the idea of performing with the inmates, and having a documentary crew film it. ""When she talked about a blues concert, that got our attention. We were excited about that,"" Cain said. ""It was a real morale booster for the inmates in the (music) program. She stood for the blues and we like that music here."" ""I think that the wardens trusted me,"" Chiarelli said. ""I met with them several times and I convinced them that my aim was true. Honestly I felt that it was really important historically to once again document music that was going on at Angola."" The documentary shows her working intensively with musicians in three bands in a variety of styles -- blues, country and R&B. ""They were really great (musicians). A few of the vocalists -- I was very, very impressed,"" Chiarelli said. ""I mean they just have so much soul and they give it when they're performing."" As they rehearsed for a concert in the prison chapel, Chiarelli developed a close rapport with her bandmates, a bond that is evident in the film. Some of them reveal on camera how their lives got off track, putting them behind bars. ""They opened up and told us their stories, which was the wondrous part of the film,"" Chiarelli said. ""It's really moving to see a fellow that's in there for murder tell his story, tell his circumstances, realize that there's victims -- that a lot of people have been hurt through his actions. It's emotional."" Most of the musicians (singers Ray Jones, Albert Patterson, Emanuel Lee, bassist Laird Veillon and drummer Calvin Lewis, for instance) are serving life sentences without the possibility of parole. ""Ninety-five percent of them are going to die here,"" Cain said. ""It's really important to give them encouragement and hope. ... You can do the time if you have hope."" For many, hope comes in the form of playing in a prison band. ""It's something that's really kept me going,"" Jones told filmmakers. He's been locked up in Angola for 32 years. Chiarelli said her documentary reveals ""how these inmates feel when they're performing ... and the release of anger and frustration and everything that happens through the power of music."" She said making the film made her mindful of not only the victims of the crimes committed by the men, but also of the prisoners' capacity for redemption. ""Through the film we see the humanity of these folks and realize that sometimes it's not always bad people that do bad things,"" she said. ""Sometimes good people zig instead of zag and end up in a situation where something horrible happens."" Chiarelli said her experience ""moved me deeply and just opened my heart to realize that sometimes people need to be forgiven, that maybe, you know, some people have a right to be forgiven."" She is aware that's a controversial proposition, one she is prepared to let audiences debate. So far she is encouraged by the reaction. ""A lot of them (moviegoers) come out of (screenings) and are moved to tears,"" she said. ""And I think a lot of them, their outlook is changed.""","Chiarelli says she took a tour of Angola after learning of its rich musical history .

"(WIRED) -- Facebook unleashed a new commenting system last week that promises to help online publications clean up their commenting cesspools, while simultaneously extending Facebook's tentacles further into the web outside its walls. Unfortunately for those with visions of a non-Facebook dominated web, this initiative has the potential to dramatically expand the ginormous social network's already imperial reach. The new system lets website owners replace their current commenting system with Facebook's simply by dropping in a few lines of Javascript. Then, commenters have to sign in using either their Facebook or Yahoo IDs, an attempt to ensure a commenter is a real person. Commenters can opt to have their comment posted as an update, along with a link to the original story, which spreads the story link inside Facebook's walls. This offers publishers a number of benefits. They get more links to their site from inside the net's most popular website. A lot of people are ""registered"" to comment on their sites. And, they have a system designed to discourage vitriol because it's easy for the site owner to ban a user and tough for a user to create a new identity. For Facebook, the benefit is also clear. Users now have even more incentive to be constantly logged into Facebook (those who are already logged into Facebook don't have to do anything to comment on a website using its system). Additionally, even more of Facebook's users' net activities flow through its site, since by default comments -- and replies to them -- post to a Facebook user's wall. That deepens users' ties to Facebook, adds more content to Facebook, and gives people more reason to check their Facebook newsfeed for the increased information flow. It also builds on what's becoming Facebook's most important function: being the identity provider and validator for the wider net. The system opens the door for what's likely inevitable: having news sites rely on Facebook to identify its users and eventually to serve ads to its readers based on their individual Facebook pages. The Facebook system competes most directly with Disqus (a system Wired.com has just starting using), which also creates a single, central profile used to comment on any site that uses the system. Facebook offers its plug-in for free, while Disqus commenting requires premium accounts for the features a large site needs to have. The immediate drawbacks of Facebook's commenting system match the larger issues of the social networking site. There's no way to export the comments if a publication decides to drop the system -- just as Facebook jealously holds onto the e-mail addresses of the people you are connected to on Facebook so you can't re-establish your network on some other site. Facebook will likely create some sort of export system, if only to assuage potential publications, though given Facebook's history with exporting, it will likely be bare bones and not particularly useful in practice. Facebook's entry into this arena presents sites with three choices -- none particularly ideal. The first is to gamble that your site is important enough to your readers that you can get away with requiring them to have a specific login for your site, and that you have the technical resources to build that out. But even if you don't use Facebook Connect, the movement seems to be away from a collection of site profiles and passwords and toward a single one that gives you entry to your collection, be it from Google, Yahoo, OpenID or others. The second option is to go with a service like Disqus and pay that company annually to uphold the belief that there should be multiple identity providers on the net and hope they have enough staying power and stickiness to appeal to your readers. Or, you can go with Facebook, tacitly acknowledging that the world's largest social network has won the identity wars and getting in on the spoils without paying an annual fee and agreeing to be an occupied outpost in Facebook's empire. Online publications are desperate for a commenting system that encourages civility, and too many, including Disqus, veer closer to the land of YouTube comments than to the ideal of comments on sites like MetaFilter and Hacker News. Sites that can afford to do so will likely continue to have their own login systems, if only so that they can collect e-mail addresses, which are still considered incredibly important for marketing and for ""owning"" a customer. But doing so leaves a site open to the bad PR of being hacked (like Gawker Media) and without work by either the site or the software maker they use to publish, they will fall behind on the benefits of a social web. Facebook is clearly gaining more of a presence around the web with its ubiquitous Like buttons and its easy-to-use login system for sites, including its often-creepy automated login system on sites like Yelp and Pandora. And with its comment system, it gains even more ground. It's yet one more promising avenue for Facebook to encourage users to be constantly logged into Facebook, and lays more track for Facebook to become not only the net's identity provider, but also its largest referrer of traffic and its biggest provider of ads. Is it any wonder then that investors keep pushing Facebook's valuation higher and higher? How much would you pay for an empire that encompasses nearly the entire web?

"El Paso, Texas (CNN) -- When the cell phone rang, the words ""private number"" flashed on the screen. Marisol Valles Garcia knew who was calling. The threatening, mysterious voice on the other end of the line had hounded her for almost four months. But this phone call had a starkly sinister tone. The man said something he'd never said before. He was coming to pick up the 21-year-old police chief at the station. ""Some people"" wanted to see her, he said. The same day -- March 1 -- her mother spotted strange cars driving past the family's home. Valles Garcia knew it was only a matter of time before they closed in. She called her husband and told him to grab their 1-year-old son. Four months after headlines around the world heralded her as the ""bravest woman in Mexico,"" Valles Garcia plotted a hasty escape across a remote border crossing in West Texas. Terrified of being tortured or killed, she fled the country without packing a suitcase. With her parents, sisters, husband and son, Valles Garcia crossed a footbridge into the United States and asked for asylum. ""I came here for the security my country cannot provide for me,"" she told CNN in a recent interview. ""The fear will never go away. What I experienced is a fear that will last a lifetime."" A few days after she left Mexico, Valles Garcia learned her mother's house had been ransacked. She is hiding in the United States while she awaits a ruling in her asylum case, and agreed to speak with CNN in El Paso, Texas. The asylum process is a lengthy legal road that could take up to three years, El Paso attorney Carlos Spector said, and there's no guarantee U.S. authorities will grant the request. But Spector said one thing is certain: Going back to Mexico would be a death sentence. ""I have no doubt she will be killed,"" said Spector, who calls Valles Garcia ""the Rosa Parks of Mexico."" ""She is a trophy for the cartels. She represented the average person saying, 'No more,'"" he said. Last October, Valles Garcia took a job no one wanted. She became police chief in the small Mexican border town of Praxedis G. Guerrero. The previous police chief had been murdered. Drug cartel assassins cut off his head. Nationwide, the Mexican government says there have been more than 34,600 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. Praxedis, located only about 35 miles away from Ciudad Juarez, is in a region that has seen some of the bloodiest conflict, as rival cartels fight over smuggling routes into the United States. The idealistic criminology student's rise to police chief in one of Mexico's most violent areas thrust Valles Garcia into the international spotlight. News reporters from around the world came to Praxedis, a town of only 3,000 people, to tell the story of the woman who dreamed to make a difference. ""We had a beautiful idea. That's why I accepted the job,"" Valles Garcia said. ""We wanted to re-establish people's confidence in the police."" But just weeks into her new job, the threatening phone calls started, Valles Garcia said. At first, the man on the phone tried to convince her to work for both sides. To many public officials in Mexico, it is a familiar offer, commonly referred to as ""plata o plomo"" (silver or lead) -- a not-so-subtle demand to accept the drug cartel's bribes, or be on the receiving end of bullets. Valles Garcia refused the offers for months. Knowing she could not take on the drug cartels with her tiny police force, her mission at the police department was focusing on prevention. She hired 13 female police officers. They refused to carry weapons and the young police chief never used body guards, unlike many other public officials in Mexico. ""Yes, there is fear,"" Valles Garcia told CNN shortly after she started the job. ""It's like all human beings. There will always be fear, but what we want to achieve in our municipality is tranquility and security."" Her vision was training the police force to focus on pushing children to stay in school and helping single mothers find steady-paying jobs. It was a lucrative offer in a town full of women widowed by the drug war, where many families were scrambling to survive. Valles Garcia hoped the same circumstances that made so many young people fall prey to drug cartels' offers of making easy money would bolster her police force's success. ""We were helping the people they (the cartels) were recruiting from,"" Valles Garcia said. ""I don't think they liked that. We were trying to help them make a better life."" But perhaps naively, Valles Garcia said, she didn't expect to be run out of her hometown by the narco underworld. ""I thought we made it clear to the drug cartels, we were going to be focused on social issues,"" said Valles Garcia. ""We weren't going to attack them. That was the job of the state and federal police."" But the threats kept coming. Eventually, Valles Garcia became so frightened that she asked her father to drive her to work. Now, she fights back tears as she acknowledges that she can never return to the only place she's ever lived -- a violent, corrupt world where many of her friends and family remain. ""My whole life was in Mexico,"" Valles Garcia said. ""I hope Mexico becomes what it once was, a safe, fun place with life."" Valles Garcia is devastated that she can't go home, and disappointed she couldn't finish her three-year term as police chief of the small town where she was born and raised. But still, she's proud of her accomplishments. ""We at least made a difference, gave people a little hope,"" she said.","Marisol Valles Garcia says threats forced her to leave, gave her ""fear that will last a lifetime""

"(CNN) -- The slaying of one of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's best friends in September 2011 is now being reviewed by a ""wider group of eyes,""a source close to the Boston bombing investigation tells CNN. The killings of Brendan Mess and two others -- all of whom had their throats slit -- in Waltham, Massachusetts, remain unsolved. The Middlesex County district attorney's office said at the time that the three victims were killed by ""sharp force injuries of the neck."" District Attorney Gerry Leone said days after the crime that the victims and two unknown perpetrators appeared to know each other and that it was not a random crime. No suspects were named or arrests made in the case.

"(CNN) -- Despite most humans' land-centric view, Earth is an ocean planet. The global ocean covers more than two-thirds of our planet's surface and makes life as we know it possible: it produces half of the oxygen we breathe, helps regulate our climate and provides the single largest habitat for life on Earth. Yet, with nearly 2 miles or 3,000 meters of water covering more than half the surface of our planet, much of this vast realm remains unexplored and unexamined. But not unconsidered. Indeed, our progress is not limited by scientists' and engineers' imaginations, but rather by the rate and cost of development of technologies suitable to pursue the cause. Advances in satellite technology provide us with global coverage in the study of Earth's atmosphere. But in the case of the ocean, that approach quite literally only grazes the surface. What happens in the vast, deep ocean, out of sight and beyond the reach of sunlight and satellites? Here's one example why we should care: in 1977, diving in the human occupied vehicle Alvin, scientists investigating a volcanic ridge 2500 m (1.5 miles) below sea-level found something totally unexpected -- lush ecosystems thriving at hydrothermal vents fueled by chemical energy released from the Earth's interior. This discovery, made just three years after new technology first enabled Alvin to reach these depths, changed our understanding of how life can function here on Earth, and opened entirely new fields of research. We now know that the hot-springs that sustain these ""vent"" ecosystems occur in every ocean basin and are host to hundreds of previously unknown animal species. In the past 30 years, those new species have been discovered at a rate of about one every two weeks -- and we still have more than 75% of this 55,000-kilometer (>34,000-mile) volcanic ridge system to explore. These same sites also host large metal deposits, which could become essential mineral resources for us in the future and some of these same systems may even reveal how life first originated -- on Earth and beyond. Given all the discoveries that we have made from an up-close investigation of these ocean ridges, we can't help but wonder what we might find at the far end of the same plate tectonic cycle where seafloor is drawn back into the Earth's interior at deep-ocean trenches. To date, only three humans have ever ventured to these deepest parts of the ocean -- the 1960 dive of Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh in the Bathyscaphe Trieste went unmatched until James Cameron's dive in his Deepsea Challenger last year. These were pioneering dives that took great courage. But to truly explore ocean trenches, scientists need to study them methodically which requires routine access to emerging technologies such as the Hybrid Remotely Operated Vehicle Nereus, which dove to the Challenger Deep in 2009, to the Cayman Trough in 2010 and will return there this summer, and to the Pacific in 2014. If our study of trenches progresses at the same rate as our past exploration of ocean ridges, however, another 30 years may pass before we've explored even one-fifth of them. And it's not just the trenches that need to be explored but the vast ocean volumes themselves. Despite a decade of internationally-coordinated global investigation through the Census of Marine Life, for example, Earth's largest ocean basin, the South Pacific, also remains its least understood. We believe the deep Pacific, for now, remains relatively untouched by the atmospheric pollutants (bomb-test radionuclides, chlorofluorocarbons) that are already penetrating deep into the Atlantic. But how to characterize its pristine state before it is too late? Put simply, we need to innovate beyond the conventional ways of doing our work. In addition to direct human exploration of the seafloor, we need to mobilize a new generation of collaborative self-powering robots that can explore the oceans, top to bottom, while maintaining communication to shore-based scientists at all times. These robotic systems must be programmed with enough decision-making autonomy to know when to diverge from a mission to follow something important and unexpected that they have encountered, and to know when to alert a scientist on shore to solicit input on what they should do next. The development of these kinds of vehicles and systems is already underway, through partnerships between leading robotics laboratories and deep ocean engineers, in efforts such as the new Center for Marine Robotics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, but we need to turbo charge that effort. As the technology expands and improves, we will also need to find new, more effective ways for humans and robotic systems to interact over the vast and remote distances involved. The technologies we need for this comprehensive exploration and understanding are within our grasp. And we'll need the knowledge that results to cope with the many challenges we faceâ€”climate change, food and resource depletion, pollution. Understanding our Earth's oceans has never been more crucial: they aren't just a defining feature of our planet; they're our life support system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris German.","Oceans make life on Earth possible providing oxygen and regulating our climate .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A paper cape sits loosely around your shoulders, covering your naked chest. A radiology technologist directs you toward an imposing-looking machine. As you hold your breath, one bare breast at a time is tightly compressed between two flat panels and X-rayed. You'll undress from the waist up for a mammogram; wearing two pieces, not a dress, makes it easier. It's a scene that's been repeated more than 35 million times in the past year at certified mammogram facilities around the United States. No matter what their age, race or medical history, the female patients probably shared a similar experience during the 20-minute procedure. ""Mammograms are known to be uncomfortable,"" concedes Dr. Sujatha Reddy, an Atlanta, Georgia,-based gynecologist. ""The harder they squeeze and squish that breast, the less tissue the X-rays have to go through and the more likely they are to find something."" The American Cancer Society reports two to four mammograms out of every 1,000 lead to a diagnosis of cancer. About 10 percent of women who have a mammogram will require more tests. Accuracy often depends on patient cooperation, but Reddy reveals there's another side as well: ""A mammogram is only going to be as good as the technician and the doctor who read it, so you want to go to a good place."" A recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that doctors reading mammograms miss an average of two in every 10 cases of breast cancer. Medical experts remind women that mammograms alone don't guarantee a clean bill of health. ""I wish I could say the mammogram could find 100 percent of breast cancers,"" Reddy said. ""I think we have to rely on having a clinical breast exam once a year at a health care provider and doing your self-breast exam on a monthly basis."" Reddy recommends having mammogram screenings at a reputable facility that is certified. She also suggests going to the same office every year so that old X-rays can be compared with new films. A convenient location is another factor that makes it more likely that someone will actually show up for an annual mammogram appointment.  Health Minute: Watch more on what to expect during a mammogram. » . Fear of discomfort is what often keeps some women away. Reddy advises her patients to schedule a screening appointment for the early part of their menstrual cycle. ""The best time of your cycle to do a mammogram is going to be when your period is over, maybe the week after your period is done when the breasts are not going to be tender."" Caffeinated coffee, tea and soft drinks may also contribute to tender, lumpy breasts. Experts recommend avoiding caffeine for a week before the procedure. Before having any type of imaging test, the Cancer Society warns patients to tell technicians if they think they might be pregnant or are breast feeding. Similarly, reveal any unusual breast symptoms or problems before a mammogram. The screening requires women to undress from the waist up. You'll be given a disposable wrap to put around your shoulders and chest. Wearing a two-piece outfit will make the process easier and more convenient. Technicians tell patients not to wear deodorant, antiperspirants, perfumes or powders. They might leave a residue that can be picked up on the X-rays, interfering with the results. All mammogram facilities are required to issue results within 30 days, but many will contact patients within a week if there is a problem with the mammogram. The Cancer Society recommends women 40 and older get a mammogram every year. Younger women may be advised to be screened earlier if there is a family history of breast cancer. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Southern California residents flooded 911 centers Wednesday night with calls about a mysterious, fast-moving streak of light in the sky. Was it a meteor?, they wondered. The answer, according to meteorologists, is maybe. The North American Aerospace Defense Command weather department says the streak of light that caused consternation from many most likely was part of a meteor shower. ""We've gotten numerous phone calls of people reporting seeing something brightâ€”consistent with a meteor shower---over the eastern desert communities of San Diego,"" said Lt.Michael Munsey of the San Diego Sheriff's Department. There were sightings as far away as Arizona, Utah and Las Vegas, CNN affiliate KCBS reported. And someone even claimed on YouTube that he captured footage of the streak of light. Matthew Isaacs, from Mission Viejo, said he was driving when he saw the flash of light. ""I saw this big, greenish flash like, light up the sky. It was headed pretty sideways from like, east to west. I thought, 'Is that a firework?' And then I realized, that couldn't be that big. It's just in the middle of nowhere in a totally dark area where there's no houses or anything where anyone would shoot fireworks. I thought, 'Man, it must have been a meteor,'"" Isaacs told KCBS. The light most likely came from the South Taurids meteor showers. These meteors are generally the most visible in the first half of November, the American Meteor Society says.

"(CNN) -- Twenty-nine pilot whales that were part of a pod that was stranded off the Florida coast are still missing, and scientists are asking the public for help in finding them. The missing whales were among 51 stranded on the edge of Everglades National Park last week, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Twenty-two of those whales are confirmed dead, and scientists are performing necropsies to figure out why. The only commonality so far is that all the dead adult whales are female, scientists said. Eleven dead whales were spotted Sunday in the lower Florida Keys, and 11 others were found dead last week. Some whales were spotted alive on Friday, when a pod of 20 was seen five nautical miles offshore, moving inshore and in a southward direction. They were reportedly swimming slowly and in a disorganized fashion, which might suggest exhaustion, dehydration or malnutrition, according to NOAA. Pilot whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, but they are not endangered. Mass strandings by pilot whales are not uncommon in Florida. In 2012, nearly two dozen pilot whales stranded and beached themselves. In 2011, 23 pilot whales stranded and beached themselves. Anyone who spots the whales in the waters off southern Florida are asked to call 877-WHALE-HELP.","29 pilot whales that were stranded are still missing off the Florida coast .

"East Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Near the areas where the decomposing bodies of three young women were found wrapped in plastic last weekend, angry and frightened residents gather to rally and pray. ""Our women do not feel safe!"" one community leader yells. ""We will protect our families!"" yells another. The community here has been badly shaken recently. In the past several years, Cleveland's metropolitan area has been the center of a series of grisly discoveries of missing, murdered, kidnapped, raped and mutilated women. The start of this week brought grim news to three families in East Cleveland, as each learned their beloved daughter or mother had been identified as a victim of the city's latest accused serial killer, Michael Madison. With the discovery of the three missing women's remains, the question is being asked often here: What's happening to women in Cleveland? More questions than answers in Cleveland . ""We need for the president of the United States of America to bring in the National Guard to find these women,"" said Kathy Wray Coleman, leader of a group called the Imperial Women. ""We can't do it alone. We need them to come in and find these women."" Coleman's group was created and named after the discovery of the victims of Anthony Sowell, the so-called ""Cleveland strangler"" who was convicted of kidnapping, raping, and murdering 11 African-American women. Sowell buried his victims' battered bodies in and around his home, located on Imperial Avenue. Sowell's victims were discovered in 2009, though many had been missing for months, or even years. He is now on death row. Madison is a registered sex offender who has now been charged with murder in the deaths of the three women, all found near his apartment last weekend in East Cleveland. Madison, 35, is currently being held in jail, with his bond set at $6 million. The investigation continues into whether there are more victims connected to him. This past May, Cleveland was also in the spotlight when three women missing for a decade were able to escape years of brutal bondage and rape in the home of Ariel Castro, who accepted a plea deal under which he will avoid the death penalty, but spend the rest of his life in prison. Fast Facts: Cleveland kidnappings . Officially, 54 women currently are missing within Cleveland's city limits, according to the city's police department. That compares with four missing women in Cincinnati, an Ohio city of similar size. Many of Cleveland's community activists who work to fight crime in their neighborhoods say the number of missing is much higher than the police website says. ""I would predict that 500 women are missing in the city of Cleveland and East Cleveland,"" said Art McKoy, leader of a group called Black on Black Crime. Cleveland police say they are doing the best they can and acknowledge their list of missing people is incomplete and difficult to keep accurate. The list does not include missing women from neighboring East Cleveland, which has a separate police department. All across both cities, posters of the missing women can be seen, especially in impoverished neighborhoods. Minerva Tripp is one of those missing women. She vanished without a trace last August. The single mother was raising a 10-year old daughter. Minerva's two older sisters have endured months of heartache and worry, spending endless hours searching for her. ""Not knowing where she is -- it's a pain I can't even describe,"" said Marcellette Love, Minerva's older sister. ""For months I would dream of her, seeing her in the mud, in trash bags, soaked in the rain. ... I just want to have her back. I just want to see her."" Love said she thinks the police have not done nearly enough to help them find Minerva. ""On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give them a zero,"" she said. ""They have not followed leads and have not done nearly enough."" The family of Charlene Price agrees. Price, who went missing in 1997, would now be 55 years old. ""We will not give up, we want to find her and bring her home,"" said Howard Jackson III. Gallery: The faces of some of America's missing . Cleveland and East Cleveland's officials and police defend their work over the years, but acknowledge the problem is very serious. ""In the cities combined, there are far too many people missing,"" said Gary Norton, mayor of East Cleveland. Many here believe the ever-growing number of missing and murdered women is tied to the recent economic crisis. Across Cuyahoga County, home to the Cleveland metro area, about 76,000 residences are vacant, according to Census Bureau figures -- the wreckage left from the loss of jobs, and the foreclosure crisis. ""I hate to say this, but in a sense, to a large degree, we have an underclass in the city of Cleveland of those that truly are disconnected from the social fabric, from the mainstream economy and society,"" said Ronnie Dunn, an urban studies professor at Cleveland State University. ""They're left without anything to grasp onto."" Once a hub of the nation's industrial might -- shipping out seemingly endless streams of iron, steel, machinery and automobiles from its perch on Lake Erie -- the city that once housed nearly a million people now has barely a third of that population. The crisis has gotten so serious that civilians are now doing things that are normally left to the authorities. On Wednesday, groups of local residents went into wooded areas and several abandoned homes in East Cleveland, looking for bodies or signs of missing women who might have been kidnapped or assaulted. McKoy of Black On Black Crime helped lead the search. ""The real heart of our city is our women, and if you can't protect our women, it's not a city,"" he said. Why are women disappearing in Cleveland? All over the Cleveland area, fliers were posted for a missing 18-year-old named Shirellda Helen Terry, a regular at Bible study, who went missing just this month after leaving her summer job at an elementary school. On Wednesday afternoon, members of Shirellda's family stood on roads, as they do nearly every day, handing out fliers and missing posters, calling out ""Help us find Shirellda!"" That afternoon, the family learned Shirellda was no longer missing. She was dead, positively identified as one of the three women found in East Cleveland. Hours later, family, friends and supporters gathered for a vigil at the same place where they had been searching for the young woman. ""My baby is gone,"" said her father, Van Terry, as he was consoled by friends. ""That's the reality of it all. Now, when I cry tonight, I'm not crying hoping I find her. I know where she's at. I'm crying because I miss her, and now she's gone on."" CNN's Michael Pearson contributed to this report. Got a story idea or tip for CNN's investigations team?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown was booted from a rehab facility this month after smashing his mother's car window during a family session, his probation officer reported Wednesday. The judge overseeing Brown's probation in his Rihanna beating case ordered the singer to immediately enter another rehab program and stay for 90 days. Brown, who was arrested on an assault charge in Washington, D.C., last month, still faces a possibly probation violation charge that could send him to prison. ""There is much concern with the probationer's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility,"" the probation report said. The singer sat nervously in a Los Angeles County courtroom, holding girlfriend Karrueche Tran's hand as he waited while his lawyer, Mark Geragos, met privately with the judge and prosecutor before his hearing began Wednesday afternoon. Brown's freedom has been in question since he was arrested on a sidewalk near the White House after allegedly punching a man. The probation imposed when he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in the 2009 attack on Rihanna -- his girlfriend at the time -- requires that he stay out of legal trouble. The lawyers and judge emerged from chambers with a deal, which required Brown to spend the next 90 days in a court-approved treatment facility. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Mary Murray told the judge she still reserved the right to ask for Brown's probation to be revoked on the D.C. arrest. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin ordered the probation officer to provide a detailed report about that incident, with that report expected to be presented when Brown returns to court on December 16. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab center on October 28, a day after he was released from a Washington jail. ""His goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior, enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point,"" representative Nicole Perna said when he entered. When he checked out on November 10 his representative said he would continue in the program as an outpatient. However, the probation report given to the judge Wednesday disputed that, saying he was kicked out of the program. It quoted a center official saying he was ordered out for ""breaking programs rules by acting violently."" The violence involved Brown ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center in which she said she wanted him to stay in the treatment. ""Mr. Brown preceded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. Brown's ""prognosis is very guarded"" unless he gets professional help, the letter said, . Brown will leave the new rehab center three days a week to work eight-hour shifts of community labor so that he can complete the 1,000 hours of work still remaining in his punishment for the attack on Rihanna. The report estimated he will have to work on community labor three days of every week until next August to meet his deadline. He may also travel to Washington for a court hearing Monday in the assault case there, the judge said. His lawyer said he would try to get the hearing delayed.

"(CNN) -- Stranded in the unforgiving expanses of Niger's Sahara Desert after their vehicles broke down, scores of people, almost all of them women and children, slowly died of thirst. The migrants had been trying to reach Algeria, Azaoua Mahaman of the Synergie nongovernmental organization said Thursday. Instead, they died of dehydration, unable to escape the sandy wastes of the Sahel. A total of 92 bodies have been found, Niger security forces told CNN on Thursday. Synergie earlier put the number found at 87. Many of the bodies were severely decomposed and appeared to have been partially eaten by animals. The travelers were hoping to find a better life for themselves in Algeria, trying to escape the extreme poverty and economic hardships in Niger, said Mahaman. Their story is the latest tragedy to befall migrants trying to leave behind a woeful existence for opportunities elsewhere. Others who have survived the arduous journey from sub-Saharan Africa to the continent's northern shores have drowned as they tried to cross the Mediterranean in overcrowded boats, with Europe in their sights. For many of Niger's 16 million or so people, life is not easy. The population is one of the fastest growing in the world, but the large, landlocked country is prone to political instability and natural disasters, according to the World Bank. Droughts, floods and locust infestation all contribute to the country's chronic food insecurity -- and the poverty rate is one of the highest in the world. The World Bank puts the annual per-capita income at just $360, and the country lies second from bottom in the U.N.'s Human Development Index. Less than 30% of adults are literate, and life expectancy is only 57.5 years. 'Extremely dry and difficult conditions' Faced with these tough conditions, many decide to leave. This has turned Niger's desert north into a major transit area for migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration, and many human smugglers operate there. Algeria and Libya are the final destinations for some travelers, while others seek to reach Europe, said Laura Lungarotti, migrant assistance regional specialist in the IOM's west and central Africa office in Senegal. Most are from Niger, although others also come from central and western Africa. Once they embark on their journeys, they face ""extremely dry and difficult conditions,"" she said. Those who get stranded in the desert face a challenge to survive. Part of the problem is that many would-be migrants are stopped by Algerian or Libyan authorities and are expelled back over the border into Niger's desert, Lungarotti said. Some of those kicked out are transported directly to two transit centers run by the IOM -- outposts in the desert where the migrants can receive food, water and first aid. Others manage to make their own way there. Despite the dangers, the migrants' numbers have been increasing since the beginning of this year, Lungarotti said. Over the past 10 months, more than 15,000 from Niger and 1,300 from other countries have reached the two transit centers -- one in Arlit, closer to Algeria, and the other in Dirkou, nearer to the Libyan border. Some who've made their way back from Libya have told of being held in detention where they suffered harsh treatment, Lungarotti said. Before Libya's revolution overthrew the regime of strongman Moammar Gadhafi two years ago, many migrants from Niger worked in its construction and agricultural sectors. But the instability forced many out. The recent conflict in northern Mali also sent about 60,000 refugees over the border into Niger, according to the European Community Humanitarian Office, adding to the pressure on its meager resources. 220 km Sahara desert run: 'The toughest race on Earth' Journalist Ibbo Daddy Abdoulaye in Niger contributed to this report .","Bodies of 92 people have been found in the Sahara Desert, say security officials .

"(CNN) -- One of two former high school football players convicted in a rape that shook the eastern Ohio community of Steubenville has been released from juvenile detention, his attorney said Monday. Ma'lik Richmond, who was 16 when he was convicted last year of raping a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville in 2012, ""recently completed his designated time"" at a juvenile correctional facility, Richmond's family said in a statement released by attorney Walter Madison. Richmond had been sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile correctional facility, but he was credited for the time he served before the trial. ""He is a better, stronger person and looks forward to school, life and spending time with family,"" the statement said. Bob Fitzsimmons, the attorney for Richmond's victim, called it ""disheartening"" that the statement failed to mention the girl at the center of the case ""whom (Richmond) and his co-defendant scarred for life."" Richmond and Steubenville High School football teammate Trenton Mays were convicted in March of the rape after a trial that divided the football-crazed Rust Belt town of Steubenville. Lurid text messages, social media posts, as well as cell phone pictures and videos helped raise the national profile of the case, which revolved around Richmond and Mays' actions during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012. It attracted the attention of bloggers, who questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the integrity of the investigation. Mays, who was 17 when he was convicted, also was found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor and was sentenced to two years. Both Richmond and Mays have been classified as tier II sex offenders and will be required to report to their local sheriff's office every six months for the next 20 years. 4 more school employees charged in Steubenville rape case .

"(CNN) -- At the request of the government of India, the United States will withdraw one official from its embassy in New Delhi over tensions involving a case surrounding an Indian diplomat. The decision comes as Devyani Khobragade, whose December arrest and strip search in New York strained ties between New Delhi and Washington, headed back to India. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said she hopes this will help gain closure in the incident. U.S. prosecutors accuse Khobragade of lying in a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper. She was indicted this week by a federal grand jury on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. Her house keeper has also publicly come out to criticize her. The Indian government denied a request by the State Department to waive Khobragade's diplomatic immunity so she can answer the charges, U.S. and Indian officials said. The immunity was granted after her controversial arrest. Khobragade arrived at the New Delhi airport Friday, according to an Indian official who is not authorized to speak to the media. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs said earlier in the day that she had left the United States. Khobragade told CNN, through an intermediary, that the charges against her ""are false and baseless."" ""I look forward to demonstrating that to all of you,"" she said through the intermediary. Khobragade ""affirmed her determination to ensure that the episode would not leave a lasting impact on her family, in particular, her children, who are still in the United States,"" the ministry said. New Delhi is demanding that Washington apologize and have the charges dropped. Allegations denied . Federal prosecutors allege Khobragade promised in the visa application, under which her housekeeper moved from India to the United States, to pay her at least the minimum wage in New York, and to require she work no more than 40 hours per week. They allege that Khobragade then had the housekeeper, Sangeeta Richard, sign a second contract, which set her pay her far below the minimum wage and required that she work much longer hours. ""I would like to tell other domestic workers who are suffering as I did -- you have rights and do not let anyone exploit you,"" Richard said in a statement released Thursday. Khobragade's lawyers have repeatedly said the diplomat is not guilty and is entitled to diplomatic immunity. ""She is pleased to be returning to her country,"" her attorney Daniel Arshack said Thursday. ""Her head is held high."" Khobragade ""did not make any false statements and she paid her domestic worker what she was entitled to be paid,"" he said. Richard fled the diplomat's home last summer, and Khobragade started legal proceedings against her and her husband in the Indian courts. Richard has been granted permission to remain in the United States. Diplomatic status . Arshack said Khobragade and her legal team were pleased that the State Department had done ""the right thing"" Thursday by recognizing her diplomatic status. U.S. officials had previously said Khobragade was entitled to consular immunity, which is less broad than diplomatic immunity and covers only actions carried out under official duties. Khobragade was India's deputy consul general for political, economic, commercial and women's affairs. But after her arrest, Indian officials appointed her as counselor at the country's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York. Through that post, she was accorded ""the privileges and immunities of a diplomatic envoy,"" the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said. Two senior U.S. officials said that the State Department had no choice but to grant Khobragade full diplomatic immunity once she was accredited to the United Nations because she did not pose a national security threat, which is the only reason for which, in very rare cases, immunity is denied. When India refused the U.S. request to waive the immunity so that she could face the charges against her, she had to leave the country, the officials said. Father's gratitude . Khobragade's father, Uttam, thanked people across India for their support in the case. ""Because of the support from all of you ... my daughter is going to come back to her country and unite with the family,"" he said Friday at a news conference in New Delhi. He said his daughter had been fighting for the ""sovereignty of this country and dignity of the judicial system."" India has expressed outrage over the arrest of Khobragade, who was handcuffed and strip-searched by federal agents on December 12 after a complaint filed by Richard. Some observers have suggested that Indian officials' protests and repeated demands for an apology are driven by political concerns. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" about the situation last month, but stopped short of saying authorities had done anything wrong. U.S. law enforcement officials have said that Khobragade's strip search was standard procedure and that she received a number of privileges not usually accorded to defendants. Pressure from New Delhi . Amid the uproar, Indian authorities removed concrete barriers from outside the U.S. Embassy and took away American diplomats' identification cards. That was followed recently by an order that the United States shut down ""commercial activities"" at a recreational facility at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. Embassy should halt the activities at the property by January 16, an Indian external affairs official said Thursday. The property houses a bowling alley, swimming pool and gym. The multipurpose club in the embassy compound was used by nondiplomats, Indian officials said, accusing the U.S. of contravening an article of the Vienna Convention. As the diplomatic fallout deepened, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz delayed a trip to India that had been planned for next week. ""We have been in conversation with Indian counterparts about the dates, and we have agreed to hold the dialogue in the near future at a mutually convenient date,"" an Energy Department official said. Human rights activists say India's anger about the strip search misses the bigger issue. They say the mistreatment of domestic workers is a widespread and often overlooked problem worldwide. Officials from both nations have repeatedly said that they hope the issue won't undermine their relations in the long term. Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of demonstrators slept on the streets of Bangkok on Monday night, continuing a protest intended to force Thailand's Prime Minister from office, authorities said. The protesters have laid siege to major intersections in Thailand's large and hectic capital city. At their peak on Monday evening, they numbered as many as 170,000, Lt. Gen. Paradon Pattanathabut, the nation's security chief, said Tuesday. But many of the demonstrators have since returned to their homes in the Bangkok area, Paradon said. About 60,000 of them stayed out on the streets overnight, he said, sleeping under tents and mosquito nets. The protesters, who aim to keep demonstrating for a month, occupied seven main intersections and blocked one government office on Monday. They say they intend to march to several other ministries, close more intersections and cut off electricity and water supplies at some government offices. It's all part of an effort dubbed ""Bangkok shutdown."" It's orchestrated by the People's Democratic Reform Committee protest group, led by Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister for the opposition Democrat Party. Traffic disrupted . On Monday -- Day 1 -- students stayed at home as 140 schools were closed. In some places, protesters stopped cars from crossing blockades. Many people used alternative routes or means of transportation to reach their destinations. Though many areas of the city are unaffected, several of the rally sites are in popular tourist areas. About 20,000 security personnel kept watch throughout the city. But so far, the shutdown has gone without serious incident. The government has offered talks with protesters and other concerned parties to discuss a way out and way to postpone the election, but Suthep has rejected the offer. Urging caution . Rights groups and others have called on Thai authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during the mass demonstrations. Since the anti-government protests began in November, eight people have died and 470 have been injured, authorities said. ""The situation in Thailand is tense, volatile and unpredictable,"" Isabelle Arradon, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific deputy director, said last week. ""There is a real risk of loss of life and injury unless human rights are fully respected."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Friday in New York that he had spoken by telephone with Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva over the past three days ""in an effort to help them bridge their differences."" Ban said he was ""very concerned that the situation could escalate in the days ahead,"" particularly on Monday. ""I urge all involved to show restraint, avoid provocative acts and settle their differences peacefully, through dialogue,"" he said. Abhisit has denied being a member of the PDRC but has appeared on stage and among the crowds at some of their demonstrations. Travel warnings . In a bid to cool tensions, Yingluck dissolved the nation's parliament in December and called for new elections to be held on February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters. They have called on the Prime Minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" which would see through electoral and political reforms. The national Election Commission has urged the government to postpone elections amid the continuing unrest. On Wednesday, Yingluck will meet with protest leaders and election commission officials to discuss whether to postpone, her office said. Dozens of countries have issued travel advisories amid fears the tensions could erupt into violence. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has urged U.S. citizens to avoid large gatherings in the city and to ensure they have a stock of cash and essential items in case the situation deteriorates. ""While protests have been generally peaceful over the last two months, some have resulted in injury and death,"" its online warning said. ""Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational, and can escalate into violence without warning."" The protest group said that on Monday, it would still allow ambulances to pass along the roads it intends to block, and that it would not block access to airports and public transportation. Ambitious goal . Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin, a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class, particularly in Bangkok. Thaksin's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast Thailand. His supporters, known as ""red shirts,"" plan to hold demonstrations in various places in Thailand, but not the capital or south of the country, on Sunday. They support the holding of elections on February 2.","NEW: About 60,000 protesters stayed out on the streets of Bangkok overnight .

While there are still NFL restrictions on how computer tablets can be used, these devices are slowly starting to change the way professional teams operate, offering high-quality video and Internet connectivity almost anywhere. Just before this season, the Bucs moved the team's playbook , a huge three-ring binder, into a custom app on the tablet. It plays NFL films used to study upcoming opponents, says general manager Mark Dominik. ""It was a smashing success for our players. They loved it,"" he said. The team printed paper playbooks as a backup this year, but Dominik says next year, ""We're going green"" -- no paper playbooks. The Bucs first developed a customized application on the iPad as a draft tool to allow coaches to watch college games while evaluating players involved in the draft, said head coach Raheem Morris. ""I was able to watch college players on the iPad while in the car or in the hotel,"" Morris said. After the success of the draft tool app, the Bucs' owners approved the purchase of 150 iPads and 90 were handed out to players and coaches. They were loaded with the Bucs' newly updated custom application. ""Everyone loves this, man. It's very helpful,"" said Bucs defensive tackle Gerald McCoy. But don't expect to see the tablets on the sidelines of games, in locker rooms or in the coaches' booth. NFL rules prohibit the use of any electronic computers, tablets or recording devices within 90 minutes of kickoff. ""Polaroid-type cameras"" are the only device allowed to be used during a game, according to NFL rules. The cameras capture high angle still images of the field, which are printed on paper near the players' benches on the field, giving the teams a different view of what their opponents are doing on the field. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy says the league is ""strategically holding back"" on technology advancements. ""We try to keep as much of the human element in the game,"" he said. In addition, he said, the NFL's strategy is to keep competition fair among all the teams. Even if the NFL allowed computer tablets on the sidelines, it's unlikely that Apple's iPads would be used, because the league's major sponsor Motorola has a tablet, the Xoom. Motorola tablets not selling . With 11 million iPads recently sold, according to Apple's financial report, app developers are scrambling to get the attention of young professional athletes who are accustomed to Apple products. One of those developers, Bloomberg Sports, decided to give iPads to professional baseball players so they could review its newly developed app, ""Pitch Review,"" created exclusively for professional baseball players. ""We didn't have to,"" said Bill Squadron with Bloomberg Sports. ""Because every player had an iPad."" The front office management of 19 out of 30 baseball clubs have adopted apps like Pitch Review, which features statistics, averages and video clips that can be customized. The National Hockey League is also utilizing mobile technology, allowing its live games to be broadcast through paid subscriptions to NHL GameCenter Live on mobile devices including tablets. But not everyone in professional sports has immediately embraced the technology. ""Our dinosaurs have been our coaches,"" said Dominik. ""(They) are older and used to the more traditional way of doing things."" The Bucs' linebacker coach, Joe Baker, admitted he was ""a little skeptical"" when the team started using iPads. His concerns were rooted in a past experience, when another team he worked for started using laptops. At the time, he said, it was a poor integration of technology and the team's needs. Today, he admits things have changed. ""To have all that information at your fingertips accessible and convenient,"" said Baker. ""It's a godsend."" Baker and the other coaches said they believe the iPads have helped improved their players' study habits. Morris points out that the players' motivation was already there, the technology has just helped them capitalize on it. ""At the end of the day these guys want to be great, so they want to study their opponents,"" said Morris. ""So they have the ability to be (great) and that's the desire that makes them watch it."" Bucs linebacker Geno Hayes says the easy access to watching plays has created a kind of addiction. ""I use it on a daily basis, sometimes my girlfriend gets mad at me because I'm so into it,"" Hayes said. ""I'm watching films all day.""","Tampa Bay Bucs are one of two NFL teams using iPads instead of playbooks .

"(CNN) -- As we mark the 25th observance of World AIDS Day on December 1, we have a golden opportunity to begin to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. To start with, this has been an extraordinary year for HIV/AIDS research, with headline-grabbing breakthroughs that stand as undeniable evidence of progress toward a cure. The first documented case of a child cured of HIV, reported in March, was followed in July by a report of two adult HIV patients no longer showing any signs of virus after undergoing stem-cell transplants and stopping antiretroviral treatment. Much work lies ahead before these and other scientific advances can be parlayed into a broadly applicable cure that can be made available to the 35 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. But it is an irony bordering on tragedy that just as a cure for HIV/AIDS is beginning to seem like a realistic proposition, the belt-tightening measures of the age of austerity could halt our momentum, cripple our progress and dash our hopes for ending AIDS in our lifetime. As a result of U.S. budget sequestration, the National Institutes of Health -- the engine of progress on AIDS research for 30 years -- will lose $229 million in AIDS research funding in the coming year. This caps a dismal decade for AIDS and other biomedical research support: From 2003 to 2012, the NIH lost 22 of its purchasing power as a result of stagnant levels of funding. This hammer blow to AIDS research funding will be accompanied by cuts to a range of other HIV/AIDS programs -- cuts that will have negligible effect on the federal deficit but will have real consequences for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States and around the world. Alicia Keys: Get loud about fighting HIV . Based on the latest available data, amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, has estimated that reduced funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) alone could result in 228,000 fewer people receiving treatment for HIV. This could lead to as many as 52,000 AIDS-related deaths and could leave more than 100,000 children orphaned. The Institute of Medicine has said that PEPFAR has been ""globally transformative"" and has ""had major positive effects on the health and well-being of individual beneficiaries, on institutions and systems in partner countries, and the overall global response to AIDS."" Interactive: World AIDS Day and what it means . Why, then, are we shortchanging a program that enjoys broad bipartisan and popular support, has done more than any other foreign policy initiative in recent years to burnish America's image abroad, and has already altered -- though not irreversibly -- the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS pandemic? Nor will people living with HIV here in the United States be spared. amfAR also estimates that the sequester could cause about 15,000 Americans who need help paying for their medications to lose support from the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. And more than 4,000 households could lose housing assistance as a result of cuts in the federally funded Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS program. All of these cuts will fall disproportionately on people of color. Just a few years ago, the notion of a cure for HIV was considered by many to be heretical. It was creating false hope. It wasn't technically feasible. It couldn't be done. That all changed with the first reports, in 2008, of Timothy Brown, the ""Berlin patient."" While on treatment for HIV, Brown was diagnosed with leukemia. To treat the leukemia, he received a stem-cell transplant -- with a twist. His savvy German doctor deliberately sought, and found, a stem-cell donor from among a very small group of people born with a genetic mutation that renders them highly resistant to HIV infection. After the transplant, Brown was able to stop HIV treatment without experiencing a return of the disease. Zero new HIV infections among children can be a reality . Similarly, the idea of an ""AIDS-free generation"" today is tossed around with abandon. It wasn't always thus. But over 30 years, we have developed a raft of tools that enable us to effectively prevent and treat HIV infection. What's more, research has shown us conclusively that treatment is prevention. Putting people on antiretroviral drugs makes them less infectious and less likely to transmit the virus to others. Combine a broader deployment of these tools with an expansion of programs such as PEPFAR and a sustained investment in research, and you have a trifecta: a winning combination that could achieve the conquest of the AIDS pandemic in the foreseeable future. Backpedal on AIDS, and you'll pretty much guarantee that we'll be dealing with it for generations to come. Bill Gates: Where to put the smart money to end AIDS . The opinions expressed are solely those of Kevin Robert Frost and Sharon Stone.","It's been a year of breakthroughs in HIV/AIDS research .

"(CNN) -- Since President Xi Jinping assumed power, he's reshaped China's foreign policy by recalibrating its stresses on sovereignty and stability, what the Chinese call wei quan and wei wen. On the one hand, China has stepped up its emphasis on sovereignty, especially concerning its territorial dispute with Japan over the Diaoyu Islands (or the Senkakus, as they're known in Japan). Beijing has streamlined its various maritime agencies to make them more efficient and better coordinated, and it keeps sending government vessels to the area to demonstrate its jurisdiction over this region. More recently, it announced a new Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea to assure its sovereign security over territory, territorial water and space in the ADIZ. On the other hand, China has attached more importance to its peripheral stability.  Despite its earlier skirmish over Ladakh with India in May, it cut a border defense co-operation agreement with New Delhi, to avoid mutual tailing between their patrols in border areas where there is no common understanding of the line of actual control. And recently, President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang visited five out of 10 ASEAN countries, and wrapped up a cooperative deal with Vietnam to jointly develop an oil well in the mouth of the Gulf of Tonkin.  China has also furthered its relations with major powers -- Xi visited Russia and the U.S. within the first three months of coming to power, promoting a ""new type of major country relationship."" However, the quest for sovereignty and stability at the same time could prove challenging.  China's ADIZ announcement is turning into such a case. Origins of the ADIZ . The concept and practice of ADIZ are not China's invention. Rather, it was invented by the U.S. in 1951, with a purpose of identifying, through various means, incoming aircraft toward North America.  An ADIZ would usually be much bigger than one's territorial space, to allow sufficient time for such identification. Last weekend, the Chinese government announced its East China Sea ADIZ, asking foreign military planes flying over this area to identify themselves or, if necessary, the government would take defensive military action to enforce their identification. It is noted that the ADIZ is a national mandate, rather than demanded by any international law.  Therefore, any other country has to make its own sovereign choice to follow or not. The establishment of the East China Sea ADIZ looks to be China's latest attempt to stress sovereignty and stability. The purpose of such identification is to assure China's sovereignty over its airspace without disrupting the international law of freedom of flight through international airspace. Obviously, China is able to identify those foreign civilian airlines which routinely fly to and from China. China will also be able to monitor and identify some foreign military aircraft flying over this zone. Establishing such a zone would allow China, ideally, additional time to predict if some of the flights over the area would be harmful and, consequently, if its defense establishment should take precautionary measures. Challenge to status quo? As establishing an ADIZ is a national endeavor rather than one mandated by international law, it is predictable other stakeholders could view it a challenge to the status quo, which suits their national interests. Soon after China's ADIZ was announced, the U.S. sent two B-52 bombers into the new air zone on what the U.S. says was a pre-planned trip. It is understood that the U.S. strategic bombers neither loaded bombs nor were escorted by jet fighters, and didn't go too close to China's territorial space, signaling that the mission was not intended as a military threat. Such a restrained challenge seems to have led China to properly balance its quest for sovereignty and stability. If and when China's newly declared ADIZ is truly challenged, as long as China could identify the incoming foreign aircraft and manage the challenge to a certain degree, China would not send aircraft to ""greet"" them.  But certainly, if the incoming foreign aircraft did not respond to China's query of identity, and if China detected a threatening posture, its air force would act in a defensive way. Though the U.S. has presented its challenge to China establishing such a zone, the country's ADIZ may have more to do with Japan. Japan's own ADIZ has been as close as to 130 kilometers from China, and includes the Diaoyu, or Senkaku, Islands.  If China's inclusion of Diaoyu Islands is intolerable to Japan due to their dispute over this area, Japan's inclusion of the same islands, some four decades ago, has much earlier provoked a similar degree of irritation. Japan's establishment of its ADIZ was a breach of the status quo at that time. Japan further pushed the envelope last year by ""nationalizing"" the main islands, representing another effort to break the existing status quo.  Its persistent changing of the status quo cannot go unchallenged. China's efforts to strike a balance between sovereignty and stability are destined to be difficult. However, facing increasing security challenges, Beijing is likely to respond in kind, while abiding by international law. The opinions in this article are solely those of Shen Dingli, a professor and associate dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.","President Xi has reshaped China's foreign policy, stressing sovereignty and stability .

"(CNN) -- Apple has bought a 3-D-sensor company that helped build Microsoft's motion-control system Kinect, stirring curiosity about what the tech giant might be up to behind closed doors in Cupertino. PrimeSense is an Israel-based company that specializes in sensors that let users interact with mobile devices like tablets and smartphones by waving their hands. The company's technology was used to help create Kinect, rolled out for the Xbox 360 in 2010 as a way for gamers to put down the controller and use their bodies and voices to play games. It's been incorporated further into the new Xbox One console, letting users control movies and other media with their voices. Apple had reportedly been in talks with PrimeSense since July. The deal was sealed for a reported $360 million. A statement released by Apple in response to queries resulted in the same ""non-confirmation confirmation"" it has released after past acquisitions. ""Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,"" the statement says. PrimeSense has confirmed the purchase but offered no further details. The purchase, of course, immediately spurred speculation about what Apple might have in mind. ""Apple could be thinking a number of things, from gaming on iPads to a way to interact with Apple TV or the rumored TV set,"" said Carolina Milanesi, a tech analyst with Gartner Research. She said she doubts Apple is working on a dedicated gaming device. Instead, she speculated, the company could be looking at a way to connect multiple devices and operate them at the same time. ""Gesture certainly has a place in complementing touch and voice as a way to interact with different devices,"" she said. ""Gesture could be particularly useful in interacting with different screens in the home."" The less exciting possibility is that we'll never see a product or feature as a direct result of the buyout. ""Apple has done a series of acquisitions that we have not seen through as far as a practical implementation of the technology,"" Milanesi said. But as the news spread Monday, it was the possibility of the long-rumored Apple TV set that many were thinking about. Apple-centric blog 9to5 Mac reported in September that Apple was testing motion-sensor technology for television products. To some, the PrimeSense purchase signals that Apple is working on something truly different. The television has supposedly been in the works for years, and the company is widely expected to be rolling out a smartwatch in the not-too-distant future. But incremental upgrades to its popular iPhone and iPad lines in recent years have led some observers to say the company has lost its knack for groundbreaking innovation. That's a concept Milanesi rejects. ""To think that Apple is not innovating just because we do not see a new category of product hitting the market is quite shortsighted,"" she said.","Apple buys 3-D motion-sensor company PrimeSense .

"(CNN) -- There were always three possible scenarios for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Bridgegate: . One, that he was explicitly involved in the shutting down of three lanes feeding the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as political retribution against a no-name mayor who didn't endorse him in an election Christie ran away with. Two, that he was marginally involved, in that he told staffers to ""take care of"" the problem mayor but wasn't specific about the actions to take. And three, that he wasn't involved at all; that an appointee at the Port Authority and staffers in his office cooked this up unbeknownst to him, didn't tell him and repeatedly lied to him about their involvement until e-mails proved otherwise. Wednesday, many assumed the third option impossible, admittedly including me. It's Christie, we said. It's politics, we said. It's ... New Jersey, we said. Nonetheless, that's exactly the story Christie's going with, and in his two-hour news conference, he did a tremendous job convincing me, at least, that he really was blindsided by the news. And as apologies go, he hit all the right notes: . I'm sorry. I'm responsible. I'm sad. I'm embarrassed. He stuck around for an hour and a half answering reporter questions. He admitted the buck stops with him. He fired two staffers immediately. He said he planned on meeting with the jilted Fort Lee mayor and with Fort Lee residents to apologize directly to them. In contrast to other well-known news conferences, it was one of the best mea culpas in recent memory. But he's not out of the woods yet. Democrats would very much like to hang Christie on this, and they will not be satisfied with the ""it wasn't me"" defense. If there's any dirt, any inkling that he had knowledge of this, they'll find it and destroy him over it. This is sure to be a sideshow for the next few weeks, if not months, as investigators look into exactly how this happened. And even if it turns out Christie's hands are clean, it still won't paint a pretty picture of politics in Trenton. He's also heading up the Republican Governors Association, a post that requires him to regularly raise funds and speak alongside other Republican governors. Christie said in his news conference that this wouldn't affect his job at the RGA, but that's pretty naive. What governor wants to share a stage, at least in the short term, with a guy embroiled in a seedy, petty political scandal? In the long term, however, if Christie is telling the truth, this is perfectly survivable. If he's not ... well today's performance was Oscar-worthy -- and fatal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of SE Cupp .","S.E. Cupp saw three scenarios: 1. Christie knew directly about bridge payback. 2. He knew obliquely .

"(EW.com) -- The first weekend in December is a notoriously weak one at the box office, and, true to form, most movies faced harsh declines this weekend after the record-breaking Thanksgiving frame. But Disney's animated musical ""Frozen"" managed to score a not-so-severe 53 percent fall to $31.6 million this weekend, which sent it past ""Catching Fire"" and straight into the No. 1 spot on the chart. ""Frozen"" has earned $134.3 million after 12 days in wide release, 39 percent more than 2010′s ""Tangled,"" which had earned $96.6 million at the same point in its run. The film will match its $150 million budget by this time next week, and if it maintains its current pace (which seems likely given its ""A+"" CinemaScore), ""Frozen"" could be headed for a finish of about $280 million. Movie review: 'Frozen' The film's box office success is sending its soundtrack into the upper echelons of the music charts. The soundtrack debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard 200 last week, and it's risen all the way to No. 4 on the iTunes chart as well. In second place, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" fell 64 percent to $27 million, giving the blockbuster a $336.7 million domestic total after just 17 days. ""Catching Fire"" is still playing about $34 million ahead of ""The Hunger Games"" at the equivalent point in its run, but as evidenced by this weekend's drop, it's falling faster than that film, too. ""Catching Fire"" appears likely to finish with just about $400-410 million, matching ""The Hunger Games'"" $408 million total. Worldwide, though, ""Catching Fire"" will be much, much bigger. It's already earned $673 million, and it will take just a few days for the film to blitz past ""The Hunger Games'"" $691 million global haul. Movie review: 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' Christian Bale's latest drama, ""Out of the Furnace,"" didn't connect with moviegoers on its opening weekend. The bleak revenge movie, which also stars Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, and Zoë Saldana, pulled in a terrible $5.3 million from 2,021 theaters, yielding an anemic $2,523 location average. Even worse, audiences gave the film a rough ""C+"" CinemaScore, which will limit appeal in the weeks to come — especially given the upcoming release of Bale's other, more anticipated release, ""American Hustle."" Two Disney films rounded out the Top five: ""Thor: The Dark World"" and ""Delivery Man."" ""Thor"" grossed $4.7 million, enough for a $193.6 million total (and $610 million worldwide). ""Delivery Man"" earned $3.8 million, and the Vince Vaughn comedy has now grossed $24.8 million against a $26 million budget. Movie review: 'Out of the Furnace' 1. ""Frozen"" -- $31.6 million . 2. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" -- $27.0 million . 3. ""Out of the Furnace"" -- $5.3 million . 4. ""Thor: The Dark World"" -- $4.7 million . 5. ""Delivery Man"" -- $3.8 million . In milestone news, Paramount's ""Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa"" passed the $100 million mark after pulling in $855,000 in its seventh weekend. Johnny Knoxville's prank film has now out-earned big budget spectacles like ""Elysium,"" ""White House Down,"" ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Jack the Giant Slayer,"" and, unlike those films, ""Bad Grandpa"" cost only $15 million to produce. Further down the chart, the Coen Bros.' folky Oscar contender, ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" made a huge splash in limited release. The rootsy tale strummed up $402,000 from just four theaters, which resulted in a $100,500 per theater average — the second best of the entire year after ""Blue Jasmine,"" which managed a $102,011 average from six theaters in July. CBS Films will begin expanding ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" in two weeks. Also notable: In the wake of Nelson Mandela's death, the Idris Elba-starring biopic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" fell only 8 percent in its second weekend to $77,000 from four theaters.

"London, England (CNN) -- Who are the greatest feminist film characters? Buffy the Vampire Slayer? G.I. Jane? Catwoman? What about an astrophysicist? If it was up to Academy Award-winning actor Natalie Portman, our feminine heroines wouldn't be limited to ass-kicking wonder women. They could even be -- wait for it -- nerdy scientists. The 32-year-old star of Hollywood blockbuster ""Thor: The Dark World,"" hopes her role as astrophysicist love interest Jane Foster will encourage a new generation of young women to enter the sciences -- much like ""Star Wars'"" Princess Leia is believed to have done over three decades ago. WATCH: Marvel and Portman make science cool . ""It's really cool that Marvel -- the comic company behind the Thor series -- is working on what they call STEM: science, technology, engineering and math,"" Portman told CNN in an interview in London, ahead of the premiere this week. ""Women are underrepresented in those fields so they are trying to encourage girls to study them more, because obviously there's no reason why they shouldn't be."" ""And that's really exciting because that's exactly what you want with these kinds of movies. They're big and they're fun and if you can have a little bit of impact on a young girl seeing them and saying 'wait, that's possible too,' then that would be really cool."" While the original ""Thor"" comic book portrayed the superhero's sweetheart, Jane Foster, as a nurse, the character has been reinvented as a scientist for the big screen. Could Portman become the new role model for female scientists, much like Jodie Foster as astrophysicist Ellie Arroway in 1997 film ""Contact"", or Sigourney Weaver as zoologist Dian Fossey in 1988 drama ""Gorillas in the Mist"", or even sci-fi hero Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in the ""Star Wars"" series? She certainly hopes so. For Portman, feminist characters aren't necessarily the ones who keep up with the boys -- they come in all shapes and sizes. ""The fallacy in Hollywood is that if you're making a 'feminist' story, the woman kicks ass and wins,"" she told Elle UK in the magazine's November 2013 issue. ""That's not feminist, that's macho. A movie about a weak, vulnerable woman can be feminist if it shows a real person that we can empathize with."" Featuring Australian actor Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the crown prince of Asgard, the second installment of the film tells the story of an otherworldly superhero who has been exiled from his homeland to Earth. ""At the beginning of Thor 2, Jane Foster is really focused on her scientific inquiries. Thor has been missing in action for a couple years, hasn't called, hasn't written,"" explains Portman. ""She's seen him on TV in New York and he hasn't made contact so she's pretty angry at him. But she's just trying to move on with her life and that's where we find her,"" added the mother-of-one, who reportedly watched ""Physics for Dummies"", to prepare for the role. French feeling . Born in Jerusalem, the only child of her American film agent mother and Israeli fertility specialist father, Portman moved to the U.S. at three years old, eventually settling in New York. As a youngster she attended theater camp and entered science fairs, until at age 11 she scored her big break as a gun-toting orphan in English-speaking French film ""Leon: The Professional"". Decades before Chloe Moretz appeared as a 13-year-old hitgirl in 2010 action film ""Kick-Ass"", Portman was targeting her own bad guys in the 1994 thriller which launched her career. Almost 20 years later, Portman, who won an Academy Award in 2011 for her portrayal of a disturbed ballerina in Darren Aronofsky film ""Black Swan"", may again be returning to French cinema. It was on the ""Black Swan"" set that she undertook a year of training with future husband, French dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied. The pair now have a two-year-old son, Aleph. ""Well I hope I'll be able to work in French cinema, that will depend on what people will hire me for,"" said the actor who speaks French, Hebrew, and German. ""I think I'd probably need to work on my French a little, but I'd be happy to try. A little Jean Seberg kind of accented French,"" she added, referring to the 1960s American-born screen siren. Women in cinema . Portman, who in 2008 served as the youngest member of the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival jury, added that she would like to see more female filmmakers and pointed to directors Sarah Polley, Lena Dunham and Sofia Coppola as inspirations. ""You still really see that the majority of American filmmakers and writers are predominantly male. Which is great, I want men to keep making movies, but I'd love for there to be more female voices as well. And of course it influences the kind of material you read because the stories that a male perspective has, the way women figure into it, is very different,"" she said. ""You get a lot of girlfriends and muses and shrews. And every once in a while there's a magic moment where there's a really interesting perspective. My hope would be that they widen the access to women, and women are more inspired and encouraged to take on those kinds of roles."" Portman, who has a degree in psychology from Harvard University, also pointed to the defined gender roles on set: ""You don't see female directors of photography, you don't see female technical crew members. Usually they're more on the hair and makeup, and wardrobe side. ""And it's more common to have all of the grips and gaffers and electric and camera, to be entirely male, which is just interesting."" If Portman has her way though, there won't just be more females on film sets -- but in science laboratories as well.","Natalie Portman says new role in 'Thor: The Dark World' could encourage female scientists .

""There's an emotional and economic toll that we pay when the media descends on us, so we ask for your forbearance after today and respectfully request that you allow us a time of peace and quiet,"" said Pat Llodra, the town's first selectman, a role similar to that of mayor. In Washington, President Obama and the first lady observed a moment of silence and lit candles in honor of those lost in the massacre. Obama devoted his weekly address on Saturday to the one-year anniversary of the shooting. ""As parents, as Americans, the news filled us with grief,"" Obama said in his address. ""Newtown is a town like so many of our hometowns. The victims were educators and kids that could have been any of our own. And our hearts were broken for the families that lost a piece of their heart; for the communities changed forever; for the survivors, so young, whose innocence was torn away far too soon."" Obama honored the ""impossibly brave"" Newtown parents ""who stepped forward in the hopes that they might spare others their heartbreak. And they were joined by millions of Americans -- mothers and fathers; sisters and brothers -- who refused to accept these acts of violence as somehow inevitable."" ""Over the past year, their voices have sustained us. And their example has inspired us -- to be better parents and better neighbors; to give our children everything they need to face the world without fear; to meet our responsibilities not just to our own families, but to our communities. More than the tragedy itself, that's how Newtown will be remembered,"" Obama said. Many news organizations said they'll honor that request by not reporting in the city of Newtown itself, but that was before Friday's shooting at Arapahoe High in Colorado. The news value of Newtown has gone up. CNN will air a documentary about Newtown at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. Media vow to remember Newtown tragedy in respectful manner . Nobody knows why Lanza, 20, killed the children and adults at the school, his mother at the home they shared, and himself. He had attended the school briefly, but that was years ago. Last month, Connecticut's state attorney's office released its official report that tried to piece together what happened. The investigation provided some insights into the life and actions of the gunman, but his motive remains a mystery. The report suggested that improving the delivery of mental health care to those with chronic mental illness may be an important element in reducing certain acts of violence, and that mass shooters are not ""enthralled"" with violent video games. After Newtown, mental health gains prominence in gun debate . The unanswered questions deepen the tragedy of Newtown, the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, following the April 2007 slaying of 32 people at Virginia Tech. The shootings also caused a renewal of the debate over gun control. Obama addressed that issue in his Saturday remarks. ""We haven't yet done enough to make our communities and our country safer. We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily. We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved, and valued, and cared for,"" he said. ""As a nation, we can't stop every act of violence. We can't heal every troubled mind. But if we want to live in a country where we can go to work, send our kids to school, and walk our streets free from fear, we have to keep trying. We have to keep caring. We have to treat every child like they're our child. Like those in Sandy Hook, we must choose love. And together, we must make a change.""

"(CNN) -- There's a reason most of Scotland's population clusters near the English border. It's safer there -- OK, give or take certain Glasgow pubs. The country just gets wilder the further north you go. From its ghostly peat bog moors, to the minke whales and basking sharks patrolling its islands, the wild geese that flock here and even its own indigenous cat (a wild cat -- in Scotland?), this small country contains some of the most unspoiled territory left in Europe. Yet few people in heavily urbanized Britain -- or outside it -- know much of these fiercely beautiful places within their country's borders. Fewer still have explored them. Below is the nitty-gritty (there's probably some Scottish way of saying that) of getting to them, starting with a certain improbable cat ... 1. ""Highland tigers"" There are fewer than 100 purebred wildcats left in Scotland. Seeing a ""highland tiger"" in the wild is a rare privilege, but you might glimpse one in the thick heather and fir woodlands of the Cairngorms National Park (access free, 365 days a year). This pocket wilderness is home to red deer, golden eagle and osprey, as well as wildcats. Most of the park, whose landscapes include four of Scotland's five highest peaks, can be explored only on foot. 2. The curlew's cry on the moor . Few places feel as wild as windswept Rannoch Moor. Only one road crosses this expanse of peat bog, heather moorland, streams and lochans (a small loch). Often the only sound here is the cry of the curlew, a wading bird. This remote country is traversed by the West Highland Way. After crossing the moor, this long-distance trail plunges into the forbidding ravine of Glencoe. In 1692, Campbell soldiers in government pay massacred almost 80 MacDonald clanspeople here. The walk across the moor from Bridge of Orchy (four trains daily from Glasgow -- see Scotrail.co.uk) takes one day. Allow another day to walk to Glencoe and down the rugged ""Devil's Staircase"" to the coast. You can camp anywhere on the way, but beware of swarms of biting midges in summer. 3. Scotland -- by sea kayak . The Scottish Sea Kayak Trail is Europe's first long-distance sea kayak journey. This 500-kilometer odyssey takes in almost mythically beautiful stretches of coastline between Gigha, off the Mull of Kintyre, and the Summer Isles, near Ullapool. You can do the journey in stages, or in one epic voyage that takes around two weeks. Wilderness Scotland (Inverdruie House, Inverdruie, Aviemore; +44 (0)1479 420 420) offers four- and five-day guided journeys from £895 ($1,420). The price includes equipment, hotel accommodation and ground transfers. 4. Ben Nevis's shorter, tougher rival . Suilven, rising above the desolation of Assynt, isn't among Scotland's highest mountains. Reaching its 2,399-foot summit, though, involves a near-vertical scramble up rocky gullies and is a far greater challenge than the comparative stroll to the peak of much higher Ben Nevis. At the top, after the nerve-racking final ridge traverse, a spectacular panorama of loch and moorland scenery rewards you. With luck, golden eagles will be soaring overhead. Suilven is 19 kilometers south-east of the village of Lochinver, Assynt; access is free. Downloadable maps are available at Walkhighlands.co.uk. 5. Wild geese and clashing stags . Vast flocks of wildfowl darken Islay's skies in winter, when tens of thousands of barnacle geese and white-fronted geese migrate from the Arctic to this southern Hebridean isle. Their arrival in autumn and departure in spring are among Europe's most memorable wildlife spectacles. Islay is also the best place in Scotland to see red deer stags up close as they clash antlers to establish their mating territory. At the same time of year, you'll see mad March hares ""dancing"" as they, too, seek mates. Seals and otters haunt the island's rugged coastline. Islay Stalking (Gearach Forest, Islay; 44 1496 850 120) offers morning and evening photo safaris from £20 ($32). 6. Benign beaver hunt . Beavers -- extinct in Scotland for 400 years -- were reintroduced into the wild in 2009. A small colony has set up home at Dubh Loch and Loch Corrie Bar, in Knapdale Forest. Knapdale is a unique wetland landscape of rocky ridges and lush oak woodland. As well as beavers, it's home to otters and a rich variety of birdlife. Guides from Scottish Beaver Trail (Knapdale Reserve, Barnluasgan, Argyll) lead walks to lochs, beaver dams and feeding sites. 7. Minke whales and loggerhead turtles . The waters around the Isle of Mull are surging with marine life. You can take a boat trip from this lovely west coast island to spot minke whale, dolphin, porpoise and basking sharks at sea, seals and otters on island shores and sea eagles in the sky above. Rarer sightings may include giant ocean sunfish and even loggerhead turtles. A three hour wildlife-watching boat trip with Mull Charters (Fascadale, Salen, Isle of Mull; +44 (0)1680 300 444) costs £35 ($55). 8. Climbing the twisted Old Man of Stoer . The ""stacks"" of Scotland's west coast offer unique climbing routes. These steep rock pinnacles rise straight from the waves and challenge the boldest climber. The Old Man of Stoer, a twisted, 60-meter sandstone spire, is rated among the best of these multi-pitch climbs, with a 55-meter abseil back to sea level from the summit. Go Further Scotland (9 Melvaig, Gairloch, Ross-shire; + 44 (0)1445 771 260) offers guided ascents (maximum two climbers per expert guide) from £130 ($207) per climber. 9. Abandoned St. Kilda . It's hard to believe people ever lived on St. Kilda. After centuries of grinding hardship, in 1930 the last islanders asked to be resettled on the mainland. Since then, St. Kilda's only permanent inhabitants have been seabirds, wild sheep and a unique species of fieldmouse. This is the wildest of wild places. Getting here, even in a modern vessel, takes hardihood. St. Kilda's sheer cliffs provide nesting places for huge flocks of gannets and fulmars. Below the sea's surface, the cliffs plunge deep, creating world-class wall dives. Elizabeth G Charters (Failte, Main Street, Tobermory, Isle of Mull; +44 (0)1688 302 495) operates luxury liveaboard wildlife and diving cruises. Prices from £1,000 ($1,600) per person for a six night cruise. 10. Wild stories . And then there are the wild stories -- of which one of Scotland's wildest concerns the supposed monstrous inhabitant of Loch Ness. On an overcast day, it's easy enough to believe unknown life forms lurk in its depths. And cryptozoology is big business in these parts -- but this vast, dark loch, containing more water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined, is impressive, Nessie or no. The unsettled side of the loch, which you can paddle to from Fort Augustus, feels remarkably unspoiled for such a well-known place as Loch Ness -- no wonder whisky smugglers used to love its calm, hidden little bays. Cruise Loch Ness (Knockburnie, Inchnacardoch, Fort Augustus, Inverness-shire; + 44 (0)1320 366 277) offers one-hour ""monster-spotting"" trips on RIBs and sonar-equipped boats, from £22 ($35) per person. Or you can canoe the Great Glen, from Loch Ness to Loch Morar, with Boots 'N' Paddles (14 Cabrich, Kirkhill, Inverness; +44 (0)845 612 5567). The journey takes three to five days.

"(CNN) -- Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli prime minister who died Saturday at age 85, made a name for himself as a military and political leader who put Israel's security above all else. It was a position that earned the controversial figure the nickname ""the bulldozer"" as a fearless leader who got things done. To many Israelis, he was a hero. To some in the Arab world, he was a killer. Here are five things to know about Sharon: . 1. Some saw him as a war hero: . Sharon, who rose through the ranks of the Israeli Defense Forces, first gained hero status among Israelis during the 1967 Six Day War that saw Israel attack Egypt, Jordan and Syria to counter what they saw as an impending attack by the Arab nations. Under Sharon's command, Israeli troops routed Egyptian forces during a nighttime battle to capture Um Cataf, a crucial crossroads in the Sinai. That victory is considered a major factor in Egypt's loss of the Sinai to Israel. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Sharon earned the nickname ""The Lion of God"" among Israelis for surrounding Egypt's Third Army and, defying orders, leading 200 tanks and 5,000 men across the Suez Canal -- roughly 100 miles from Cairo. Israelis mourned the death of Ariel Sharon . 2. Others accused him of war crimes . During the Lebanon war in 1982, Sharon -- a former army general then serving as Israeli defense minister -- was held indirectly responsible by an Israeli inquiry in the 1983 massacre of Palestinians by a Lebanese Christian military at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. The inquiry -- which led to Sharon's prompt resignation -- found he did nothing to stop Christian militiamen allied with Israel from entering the camps, despite fears they might seek to avenge the killing of their leader the previous day. Many in the Arab world dubbed Sharon ""the Butcher of Beirut,"" and Palestinians attempted to bring war crimes charges against him in European courts. 3. He made a provocative visit to an important mosque . Sharon long insisted that a controversial visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, one of Islam's most holy sites, in 2000 was not a provocation. But it is considered among many to be one of the flashpoints that sparked the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising that followed a failed round of peace talks with Israelis. During the visit, Sharon walked through the mosque's compound. Within hours, protests over his visit turned violent. The mosque and its compound sits on Temple Mount, a holy site for Jews, that is known to Muslims as Haram al Sharif, ""The Noble Sanctuary."" At the time, according to published reports, Sharon said his visit was intended as a message of peace. But critics have said Sharon, already considered a possible contender for Israeli prime minister, knew the visit to Al-Aqsa would spark violence. Ariel Sharon: A life on front lines of war and politics . 4. He removed settlers from parts of the West Bank and Gaza late in his career: . Sharon, who early in his political career promoted the establishment of settlements on occupied land, appeared to do an about face in 2005 when he ordered the Israeli withdrawal from 25 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. Under Sharon's order, the military dragged settlers from their homes. The move was part of Sharon's plan to pull Israeli troops from Gaza, ending nearly four decades of control. While considered an essential move for peace talks, Sharon's right-wing Likud Party was outraged. It lead Sharon to break with his party and form a new one -- Kadima, Hebrew for ""Forward."" 5. He suffered strokes, spent years in a coma . Sharon was serving as a prime minister when suffered a small stroke in December 2005. That was followed by a massive stroke in January 2006 that left him on a respirator and in a comatose state. Immediately after he fell ill, his power was transferred to Vice Premier Ehud Olmert. In April 2006, Israel's cabinet formally ended his term as prime minister after declaring him permanently incapacitated. The former prime minister's health fluctuated during the time he was in a coma. In January 2013, doctors said testing on Sharon indicated some brain activity when he was shown photos of his home and heard his son's voice. CNN's Alan Duke and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is dead at 85 .
Sharon had been in coma for past 8 years after suffering massive stroke .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan's president declared a state of emergency Wednesday ahead of peace talks to stop the latest violence in the country. President Salva Kiir issued the declaration for the states of Unity and Jonglei, which include the rebel-held towns of Bor and Benitu, the scene of recent fighting and scores of civilian deaths. State radio also reported that Kiir ordered the formation of a negotiating team to take part in the peace talks in Ethiopia. The government delegation includes key opposition figures, as required in the presidential decree, state radio reported. Representatives from the warring parties in South Sudan will arrive in Ethiopia on Wednesday for talks aimed at ending the violence wracking the nation, the United Nations' special representative to South Sudan said. Hilde Johnson, who heads the U.N. mission to South Sudan, said she wanted to see both parties ""take a decisive step to cease all hostilities"" starting Wednesday. ""We want to make this day the day that the violence stops,"" she told a news conference in the South Sudanese capital, Juba. Kiir and the rebels' leader, former Vice President Riek Machar, agreed Tuesday to send delegations to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, home of the African Union, for peace talks after two weeks of violence. A cessation of hostilities between their forces is expected to top the agenda. Johnson said it was too early to say if the move was a breakthrough, ""but it is a step in the right direction."" The African Union has set up a group to investigate human rights abuses, Johnson said, which met for the first time Tuesday. She stressed the need for people to be held accountable for their actions, and for a community-based reconciliation process to run alongside the peace talks. ""There has been killing and brutality, we have seen killing on ethnic grounds. We need to do everything to prevent the cycle of violence,"" Johnson said. ""I condemn elements on both sides."" The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African trade bloc that has been helping to mediate between the battling parties, has said an independent body is needed to monitor any cease-fire, Johnson said. Leaders of the bloc warned Friday that they would ""take action"" to stop the conflict if South Sudan's warring factions didn't lay down their arms. The spiraling violence has sparked a humanitarian crisis in the world's newest nation. About 180,000 people have been displaced nationwide by more than two weeks of conflict, Johnson said. Peacekeepers are working to protect the camps where tens of thousands of civilians have fled, but more resources are needed, she said. She appealed for $166 million in aid to help provide families with food and other emergency relief. Anti-government forces were not targeting U.N. bases in the country, Johnson added. Ethnic targeting . The fighting began on December 15 after Kiir, from South Sudan's Dinka ethnic group, accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup. The two men have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July. Kiir told CNN on Monday that African nations should have acted quickly to help quell the rebel forces. As soon as an attempted coup took place and violence broke out, ""the original leaders and all African leaders should have come in with military support,"" so that the rebels would have been ""crushed once and for all,"" he said. The two sides clashed Tuesday in the key town of Bor, capital of oil-rich Jonglei state, which had already changed hands last week. However, the situation was quiet there Wednesday, Johnson said. Fighting has also halted in Malakal, the capital of Upper Nile state, which may be a positive sign, she said. United Nations forces are patrolling the streets of Juba in order to protect civilians, she said. More than 160 police officers arrived in the past three days, with an additional 240 expected Wednesday and more in the next two weeks. The U.N. Mission to South Sudan on Tuesday voiced ""grave concern over mounting evidence of gross human rights abuses in the strife-torn country, including extra-judicial killings of civilians and captured soldiers, massive displacements and arbitrary detentions, often on ethnic grounds."" Its statement cited the discovery of large numbers of bodies in Juba, as well as in Malakal and Bor. ""Available evidence indicates that atrocities are continuing to occur in various parts of South Sudan,"" it said. ""Many of these violations appear to be ethnically targeted. Most of the more brutal atrocities are reported to have been carried out by people wearing uniform."" South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country. CNN's Antonia Mortensen reported from Juba and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","South Sudan president declares a state of emergency in Unity and Jonglei .

"(CNN) -- ""Less than human."" ""Lost."" ""Courageous."" ""Unwanted."" Those are a just few of the dozens of responses CNN iReport got when we asked our online community how their incomes make them feel. ""My income makes me feel unwanted because I, like many people, have to rely on food assistance,"" said Marcus Kastler, a 31-year-old from Kansas. ""There is a huge gap that is unfair and unrealistic. (Low) Minimum wage keeps this gap wide because you can't advance without higher education. We need to start more entry level jobs so that low income can work their way up. Lower the cost to go to college so we can afford to go."" iReport: My income makes me feel ... Plenty of pundits this week are talking about America's ""War on Poverty,"" which has lasted 50 years now. Somewhat missing from the conversation is the war that has emerged since the 1964 State of the Union address, when President Lyndon B. Johnson, as The Nation describes it, ""slowly put on his black-framed reading glasses, looked around at the assembled dignitaries and immediately issued a call to action"" on American poverty. America's new war is on income inequality. It's time we put our glasses on and saw this shift clearly. I started reporting on income inequality last year because CNN readers wisely voted me to cover that topic as part of the Change the List project. I spent about two weeks reporting in East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, which has the largest rich-poor gap in the nation. There, I learned that the income gap can get so wide that people don't understand each other anymore. That's what splits one America into two. Related: The most unequal place in America . How to change course? That's something I've wrestled with in recent months. Anyone who says they have all of the answers is lying to you. But I do think one way we can start to knit our nation back together is to talk about income inequality -- to acknowledge how different America is today from the time of John F. Kennedy and Johnson, when the rich weren't so stratospherically different from the rest of us, and when the minimum wage was actually worth more in real dollars than it is now. It's clear the nation has been diverging. Since the late 1970s, the United States went from being a relatively egalitarian country to one of the more unequal places in the world. America is more unequal than Russia, Kenya and Pakistan, according to the CIA World Factbook. And the 1% continues to do better than the rest: That group saw 86.1% real income growth from 1993 to 2012, according to a UC Berkeley analysis. The bottom 99% of the population only saw 6.6% growth in their incomes during that time. Related: Is income inequality morally wrong? It's not about the numbers, though -- it's about society. There's research to show more unequal countries tend to have problems with health, education, incarceration and infant mortality. There's an empathy gap, too, researchers have argued in books such as ""The Spirit Level,"" which was written by two epidemiologists. People stop knowing each other. That's why we decided to ask iReporters to submit essays, videos and photos about how their incomes make them feel. The goal was to initiate a conversation about the increasingly wide range of economic experiences in the United States. Aimee Clark, a 30-year-old in Colorado, said her income makes her feel ""lost."" ""I feel lost because although we are not in poverty anymore, we are not financially safe,"" she said. ""We still live paycheck to paycheck, just not as dire as years before. I feel lost because I can taste the 'American Dream,' but it's like a tease."" Related: War on poverty isn't over . I think many Americans can identify with that limbo. The high cost of education -- a ladder out of poverty -- was another consistent theme. ""I feel like I'm living from paycheck to paycheck and owe more than I'm worth,"" said Nicole Lucas of Baltimore. She said she is struggling to pay down student loans while working a part-time job that has no benefits. ""People say 'go to school, market yourself, cut back,' etc. However, the recession taught me that you can have a good job, have a 401(k) and have a degree, but still be the last to know your job is going to go under."" Recently, there has been much talk about what would increase ""economic mobility"" in the United States, which is the term academics use when they're talking about the American Dream. The United States has has fallen behind many European nations in that category. ""If you want to live the American Dream,"" Kate Pickett, a researcher who studies income inequality, told me last year, ""you'd better go to Denmark or Finland."" There, it's easier to get ahead. Related: 5 things the world could teach America . So it's telling that Lucas, the woman in Baltimore, also said the American Dream, to her, is ""not sustainable, let alone attainable."" It feels out of reach. Shifting attitudes like that should scare us all. Who wants to live in a country where people don't believe they can get ahead anymore? Not all of the iReport responses to our query were negative, of course, but I didn't see any reports from the super-rich, either. (Buffett? Bloomberg? There's still time ...) Julie West of Columbus, Ohio, said her income makes her feel ""grateful."" She lost her job in 2008 but found a new, lower-paying gig in 2010. ""Many people that were hit with unemployment in 2008 lost homes, experienced many hardships just as I did,"" she said. ""Many have never fully recovered. I feel like I had been given a chance to turn it around for myself. I will always be grateful."" Related: How to help Inequality, USA . That's pretty incredible, huh? Not just because West has managed to remain ""grateful"" in the face of hardship but because she's aware that others aren't so lucky. She has empathy for other Americans. That's something all of us, regardless of income, could take to heart. It's not that the War on Poverty is over. It isn't, and it shouldn't be. But extreme poverty exists, now more than in recent decades, alongside extreme wealth. It's time for ""America's longest war"" to evolve and expand.

"(CNN) -- At least nine people -- five soldiers, a police officer and three civilians -- died Saturday in what Colombia's president called a ""terrorist"" attack carried out by a storied rebel group. Military authorities, national police and President Juan Manuel Santos blamed the morning attack in the nation's Cauca state on the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. In addition to those killed, three soldiers, 12 police officers and 23 civilians were injured, according to the president's website. ""We have to continue to be on the offensive, not to give them a single minute of rest, not give them a single minute of truce so that they do not have the capacity to commit acts like this one,"" Santos said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. The national police website posted audio from police Maj. Gen. Jorge Nieto saying, ""All (evidence) indicates that there were cylinders camouflaged by food items inside of a vehicle."" Nieto added that the attack occurred when residents were preparing for a farmer's market day in the municipality of Inza. The FARC has been at war with the South American nation's government since the 1960s, a time marked by periodic bloodshed. Santos was first elected in 2010 on a platform of continuing an offensive against the leftist guerrillas that have been at war with the government for decades, but he instead followed a different path by pushing forward with the peace process starting last year. He announced last month that he'd seek re-election against, among others, rival Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, who has called for an end to the peace talks and is against giving a political space to the rebels. Santos said during an awards event Thursday in Bogota that Colombia ""is a country decisively seeking peace, and advances in the direction of dialogue with firmness and prudence, without neglecting security for a single second."" On Saturday, the president condemned what he called a ""cowardly"" act and offered a reward of up to 30 million pesos ($15,500 US) for any information leading to those responsible. He also insisted that the Colombian government wouldn't back down in the face of these and an estimated 500 other attacks carried out this year. Said Santos: ""If the FARC believe that these acts will get us to a cease-fire,... they are wrong, they are completely wrong beginning to end.""","NEW: President calls the bombing a ""terrorist"" attack, offers 30 million peso award .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- More than two dozen college players on three major Division I football teams staged an unauthorized protest of the NCAA during their games Saturday. With black marker, they wrote the letters ""APU"" standing for ""All Players United"" on their gear as part of a pledge calling for NCAA reform. The pledge, designed by the nonprofit group the National College Players Association (NCPA), calls for the NCAA to take more steps to minimize brain trauma, and for money to be designated to increase scholarships and graduation rates, and guarantee medical treatment. It also includes support for those involved in Ed O'Bannon's lawsuit against the NCAA. O'Bannon, a former UCLA basketball star, is suing for the rights to his own likeness in video games and TV broadcasts. ""The priorities are misplaced and part of this movement is to address that,"" said Ramogi Huma, president of the NCPA. Twenty-eight athletes playing for Northwestern, University of Georgia and Georgia Tech were seen participating. ""I think it was a smart decision by the players to design a campaign as visible as the logos that they wear,"" Huma said. Mixed reaction on protest . After the games, the NCAA said in a statement that it ""supports open and civil debate regarding all aspects of college athletics."" But there was less room for discourse after the Georgia Tech game, where head coach Paul Johnson said, ""I assure you that now that I am aware of it we'll talk to them about it."" Two players who participated at two different universities told CNN they wanted to talk about it, but backed out of interviews after their respective games. CNN caught up with two other players who wore APU on their gear after the Georgia Tech game. Georgia Tech quarterback Vad Lee backed away from his actions, saying he wrote it as a favor to injured teammate Isaiah Johnson. Defensive end Jeremiah Attaochu told CNN that he, too, made a last-minute decision to wear APU, but that he does believe in the cause. ""I know the guys out there go to Georgia Tech and don't have the academics to fall back and things like that so, you know, looking out for everybody,"" Attaochu said. A team handler who was standing nearby discouraged CNN from asking questions about the pledge, and cut questions short. Huma, the NCPA president, later told CNN that he hadn't heard of any players being disciplined for wearing the gear. Controversies plague NCAA . The silent protest is just another example of growing dissent for the NCAA. Controversies over suspending players, handling of academic scandals, players' rights and medical concerns plague the organization. This summer, Pennsylvania Congressman Charles Dent introduced legislation that would overhaul the NCAA. ""This is big business. 6.1 billion dollars annually,"" Dent said. ""A lot of people are profiting off this. I would not say that the students are."" Dent said he's particularly troubled by the fact that the NCAA can cut short a player's education if they get hurt. ""Let's be clear, and the concussion issue relates to the scholarship issue,"" Dent said. ""If a student feels ... that they are going to lose their athletic scholarship because of a concussion or some injury, something that is not necessarily visible, he'll be less inclined to report that injury out of fear that they're going to lose a scholarship."" Huma said the NCAA doesn't force universities to pay medical bills for injured players, and that if a student doesn't graduate before their eligibility expires, they aren't guaranteed an education. He also sees a great disparity in who profits from the games. A former UCLA linebacker, Huma told CNN he started the NCPA in 2001 after he watched a teammate get suspended by the NCAA for accepting groceries -- a violation of the rule that athletes can't accept gifts. ""And at the time they were selling his jerseys at the stores and it just really made me feel like college athletes needed a voice,"" Huma said. The NCPA has grown into a nonprofit that says it has 17,000 members. ""Any way we can gain leverage, we try,"" Huma said.

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for the family of a former Florida A&M football player fatally shot by police in Charlotte, North Carolina, have filed a civil lawsuit against several parties connected to his death. According to the complaint filed Monday by Jonathan Ferrell's mother, the family is targeting the city of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe and the shooter, Officer Randall Kerrick. The mother, Georgia Ferrell, said Tuesday that she hopes the lawsuit will lead to changes in the way Charlotte-Mecklenburg police are trained. ""I don't know if it will bring peace, but I hope and pray that (in) doing this ... that they get the proper training,"" Ferrell said at a news conference, flanked by her two attorneys. Kerrick shot an unarmed Ferrell, 24, in September after a woman -- home alone with her 1-year-old child -- called 911 and reported that someone was trying to break down her front door. It was 2:35 a.m., and according to the lawsuit, the woman ""does not understand that Jonathan may be injured and is in need of assistance and becomes frightened by his presence on her doorstep at such a late hour. She quickly closes the door, calls 911 for assistance and activates her home security system,"" the lawsuit states. The woman told police Ferrell was ""yelling for her to turn her alarm off,"" but never reported that Ferrell harmed her, made threatening statements, brandished a weapon or stole or vandalized her property, the lawsuit further alleges. Police were dispatched, and Ferrell walked down the street to seek assistance elsewhere, according to the lawsuit. Kerrick and two other officers arrived on the scene about 11 minutes after the 911 call, but Kerrick didn't speak with the woman, the lawsuit says. He instead tracked down Ferrell, who ""never engages in any conduct which can be objectively reasonably interpreted as aggravated active aggression,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Defendant Kerrick, in direct violation of written CMPD regulations, fires 12 high-velocity bullets at Jonathan, striking him 10 times in the chest and arms,"" the lawsuit continues. Kerrick is accused in the lawsuit of failing to recognize Ferrell was injured and unarmed, failing to identify himself and failing to adequately assess the situation before firing his weapon. The lawsuit further alleges that Kerrick used ""stealth and surprise"" in approaching Ferrell and ""negligently failed to realize that, because of the dim lighting in the area, Jonathan would be startled, frightened and unable to see his approach and commands."" ""Afterwards, as he lay dying on the ground in a pool of his own blood, on information and belief, Jonathan struggled to breathe and, in effect, drowned in his own blood. In short, upon information and belief, Jonathan experienced excruciating and horrible physical pain and mental suffering as he died from gunshot wounds inflicted upon him by Defendant Kerrick,"" the lawsuit states. The 25-page lawsuit, which devotes about two pages to citing allegations of misconduct and excessive force by Charlotte police since 1997, seeks monetary relief of more than $10,000, though the exact amount isn't specified. Back in October, family attorney Chris Chestnut accused Kerrick of ""cold-blooded murder,"" saying the incident was caught on a dashboard camera of a police cruiser at the scene. Ferrell was involved in a serious wreck a block away and was only seeking help, according to Chestnut. Kerrick has been charged with felony voluntary manslaughter, meaning he is accused of either using excessive force in self-defense or shooting Ferrell without the intent to kill him. He is free on $50,000 bond. ""We are confident that at the resolution of this case, it will be found that Officer Kerrick's actions were justified on the night in question,"" his attorney, Michael Greene, said in September. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has called the shooting unlawful. ""The evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive,"" police said in a statement on September 14, the day of the shooting. ""Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter."" The statement further said, ""It has devastated a family as well as caused a great deal of sadness and anxiety in our organization."" Police used the words ""charged,"" ""ran"" and ""advanced"" in describing Ferrell's interaction with police. But Chestnut said the young man merely walked ""briskly"" toward them and surmised that Ferrell was relieved police had arrived to help him after he wrecked his car. An officer tried to subdue Ferrell with a stun gun but was ""unsuccessful,"" police have said. Kerrick opened fire after that. At the time of his death, the former gymnast, FAMU chemistry major and safety for the football team was working at both Dillard's department store and Best Buy, to save money to complete his education as an automotive engineer, the lawsuit says. His fiancee, Cache Heidel, told CNN in October that Ferrell had been out with friends the night he was shot. He had just given a coworker a ride home, about 17 miles east of central Charlotte, and on his way back to his own home, Ferrell drove off the road, down an embankment and into a group of trees, the lawsuit says. Ferrell couldn't find his phone, and his car doors were jammed shut, so Ferrell kicked out the back window of the car and walked a half mile to a home where he knocked on the door for help, according to the lawsuit. Family members have said Ferrell was a happy, outgoing guy. Heidel described him as someone who was always joking and finding ways to make people smile. His demeanor was so gentle and caring, she said, that she nicknamed him ""Sweets."" ""He's always a joy to be around. He cared so much for other people, more so than himself,"" she said in her October interview. She said she hopes Kerrick is convicted and that her fiance's death will spur dialogue across the nation. ""That is a hope I have, that his death will resound for a country that prides itself on being diverse and inclusive and accepting everyone for who they are,"" she said.","NEW: Ferrell's mother: ""I hope and pray"" lawsuit will prompt training changes for police .

"(CNN) -- Dana White loves a good fight. But the Ultimate Fighting Championship president may have second thoughts about mixing it up with members of the hacker collective Anonymous on Thursday night on Twitter, where he was on the receiving end of a brutal punch. White's personal information, including his Social Security number, cellphone number and address, was published online just moments after the exchange, in which he defended his company's support of the controversial -- and now-shelved -- Stop Online Piracy Act. The UFC's website was also hacked for the second time in a week. The mixed-martial-arts promoter's parent company was a supporter of SOPA, which was intended to crack down on digital piracy. The company, Zuffa, says many of its fights are posted illegally online, either for free or with the pirate sites selling advertising on them. The back-and-forth kicked off shortly after 9 p.m. when one of the more popular Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous called out White -- an avid Twitter user -- for comments he made in a recent interview. After UFC's site was briefly hacked last weekend (traffic was redirected to a site associated with Anonymous) White called the Internet ""a place where cowards live"" and compared hackers to terrorists. ""The way this whole thing has gone down, them hacking our site is the best thing they ever could have done for us. Because what that does is, now, you look like terrorists and now a lot of people who were afraid of you now hate you,"" White told Ariel Helwani of MMA Fighting. ""Is this bill perfect? No. No bill is perfect. I think this thing started off with the right idea. Stealing is stealing ... . It's not right and there's something that needs to be worked out."" He wrapped up with a UFC-style challenge. ""I'm not afraid of you,"" White said. ""You don't scare me. Do it again. I don't care."" Of course, they did. ""Ahoy @danawhite - what do you have against the Internet? We're just curious, as we were quite surprised at the harsh tone of your comments,"" wrote the people behind the Twitter feed @YourAnonNews. White responded: ""I love the Internet. It helped us grow our biz. Stealing is stealing! And hacking into people's s--- is terrorism."" What followed was a sometimes profane back and forth with White defending his company's stance and Anonymous members or sympathizers either lobbing attacks or defending their own group's efforts, which have included attacking Mexican drug cartels and oppressive governments. ""If you guys want to change the world good for you!"" White wrote. ""Just don't steal my s---."" He argued that his fighters suffer financially when UFC money is siphoned away and cited the company's own ""outsider"" pedigree, noting that mixed martial arts were banned in many states before gaining widespread recognition. Between live bouts, pay-per-view sales, video games and other products, the UFC is now a billion-dollar industry. For a brief moment Thursday, it looked like everyone would walk away happy. ""Why don't you read thru our dialogue with him. It was actually quite pleasant and civil...no s--- talking that we can see!"" the YourAnonNews account tweeted to another Twitter user. But minutes later, someone posted a document on the site Pastebin showing what appears to be White's Social Security number, cellphone number, address, legal cases and other information -- including his wife's name. (A later, edited version removed family information). The UFC site also was hacked again, with Anonymous logos briefly appearing on its main page. White did not mention either hack on his Twitter feed Friday morning, having moved on to promoting a fight card set for Saturday night. Anonymous, of course, wasn't so quiet. ""We wonder if @danawhite will ask #Anonymous to hack him again tomorrow,"" YourAnonNews wrote.","UFC's Dana White hacked, info published after Twitter fight with Anonymous .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United football star Chris Smalling has apologized after pictures appeared in a British newspaper of the defender dressed as a suicide bomber at a private party. The England international wanted to make a joke based around the popular ""jagerbomb"" drink by dressing in a costume decorated with empty bottles of jagermeister and cans of the energy drink Red Bull. ""Chris and his girlfriend hosted a fancy dress party to celebrate Christmas and their belated birthdays with close friends in the assumed privacy of his own home,"" Smalling's management company Wasserman Media Group said in a statement. ""He dressed in a costume consisting of empty bottles of jagermesiter and cans of Red Bull strapped to his chest in an attempted comedy play on the popular 'jager bomb drink'. ""Although he fully accepts in hindsight it was an ill-thought out and insensitive decision, absolutely no harm was intended whatsoever and he apologizes for any offense caused."" Smalling, who hopes to be part of the England squad which will travel to Brazil in June for the 2014 World Cup, is not the only footballer to have courted controversy with his choice of fancy dress outfit. The girlfriend of Stoke City's Jermaine Pennant recently posted a picture of the winger dressed as Osama Bin Laden at a New Year's Eve party.

"(CNN) -- Robin Roberts' battle against myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, is just beginning. The ""Good Morning America"" anchor will undergo chemotherapy before having a bone marrow transplant later this year. ""Bone marrow donors are scarce and particularly for African-American women,"" Roberts wrote Monday. ""I am very fortunate to have a sister who is an excellent match, and this greatly improves my chances for a cure."" More than 10,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with blood-related disorders every year, according to the National Marrow Donor Program. Often the best treatment is a bone marrow transplant. During the procedure, a donor's stem cells are directly transfused into the sick patient's bloodstream. The patient's new cells multiply over time to create healthy bone marrow. Unfortunately, the chance of finding a match on the national registry is as low as 66% for African-Americans and other minorities, compared with 93% for Caucasians. Be the Match, the national registry, has 10 million potential donors, but only 7% are African-American. While the percentage is comparable to the overall African-American population in the United States (which is 12%), the registry is meeting only about a third of the needs for African-American transplants, said Dr. Jeffrey Chell, CEO of the National Marrow Donor Program. Tuskegee's ghosts: Fear hinders black marrow donation . It's a disparity that's come up time and again. Last year, the death of Shannon Tavarez attracted attention because doctors were unable to find a bone marrow match for the young Broadway star, who had acute myeloid leukemia. ""It's absolutely critical to have more people on the registry,"" Chell said. ""You're more likely to find a match with someone who shares your common ancestry or ethnicity."" African-Americans and bone marrow donations . Be the Match tests the immune system's genetic coding to determine bone marrow compatibility. The human immune system has evolved over thousands of years, which is why racial and ethic background is so important. For instance, European-Americans' ancestors may have survived the medieval plague, while African-Americans could have a natural immunity to malaria because of their ancestors' environmental pressures. If a good match isn't found, the donor's immune system will attack the sick patient's ""foreign"" cells in a condition called graft-versus-host disease. As Roberts' situation shows, a sibling is often the best genetic match. But 70% of transplant patients will end up using a complete stranger's bone marrow, according to Katharina Harf, chief inspiration officer of DKMS, the world's largest donation center. ""My mother (who had blood cancer) had six siblings and none of them matched,"" Harf wrote in a statement. ""That's why we started DKMS, to help other patients in need -- so no family would have to go through what we did."" DKMS recently teamed up with Help Remedies to create a first aid kit that includes bandages and a bone marrow testing kit. Now when you get a paper cut, you can possibly save a life. Chell said Be the Match wants to encourage people to sign up for the registry by dispelling the myth that the donation process is complicated or painful. The registry is launching a national campaign in July for African-American Bone Marrow Awareness Month. But ""nothing works as well as someone who has the courage like Robin Roberts to step forward and let people know what she's going through,"" Chell said, adding the registry has received an influx of potential donors to its site since Roberts' announcement. To sign up to be a donor, you must be between 18 and 60 years old and be in good health. Visit BeTheMatch.org for information.

"(CNN) -- Anti-China protesters gathered Saturday in Tokyo and six other major cities in Japan to rally against what it calls an invasion of disputed islands that both claim are part of their territories. Protesters held up Japanese flags and chanted, ""We will not allow Communist China to invade our territory."" Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku. The rally was organized by Toshio Tamogami, a former Japanese chief of staff for the Self Defense Force. Japan rejects China's demand for an apology . ""Senkaku Islands is Japan's traditional territory,"" Tamogami said. ""If we don't protect it, China will make action to take it."" Tamogami called China a ""thief"" and vowed to protect the islands. Beijing and Tokyo have been clashing over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain by Japan off the disputed islands. The captain was accused of hitting two Japanese coast guard ships and obstructing public officers while they performed their duties. ""I am very angry with China,"" said student Shohei Fukumoto. China should apologize and pay for the repair of the vessel because the captain was in Japan's territory when the accident happened, according to Fukumoto. Japan has since freed the fishing captain, who returned to a hero's welcome in China. Yoko Sakamoto, 55, said Japan has been too easy on China. ""I 'd like to criticize Japanese government's weak attitude toward China and Senkaku Islands issue, rather than China itself,"" Sakamoto said. ""We should get our national pride back."" The captain's arrest prompted the suspension of diplomatic talks and canceled trips between the nations. Beijing has sought an apology and compensation over the arrest, which Tokyo has rejected. Japan has also demanded compensation for damage done to coast guard ships. Journalist Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report.","Protesters hold up Japanese flags and chant slogans against China .

"Fort Lee, New Jersey (CNN) -- The lane closure scandal rocking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's administration is raising questions whether gridlock delayed paramedics' effort to save a 91-year-old woman who was in cardiac arrest and later died. ""This crosses a line that is rarely crossed: People's lives were in danger,"" said New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak, a Democrat. ""Endangering people's lives -- that's not politics. That's why the U.S. attorneys have to get involved."" Lesniak is asking for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman's death. Her daughter told CNN affiliate WABC that she didn't believe the traffic trouble was a factor in Florence Genova's death. ""I really don't think so, no, I really don't. I think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got (to her house),"" Vilma Oleri told the station. The investigation also would look into allegations that aides to Christie, a Republican, closed lanes at the George Washington Bridge as retaliation against the mayor of Fort Lee, a Democrat who didn't endorse Christie's re-election campaign. The delays to paramedics were red-flagged on the second day of the lane closures last September when Fort Lee EMS coordinator Paul Favia wrote a letter to the mayor saying the snarled traffic was ""causing unnecessary delays for emergency services."" In two emergency calls, response time was doubled because of the traffic jams, Favia wrote. Christie drops swagger amid heat of scandal . Among two other delays listed in the letter was the cardiac arrest of the elderly woman. On September 9, Emergency Medical Services personnel received a call about an unconscious 91-year-old woman, and the response time was seven minutes because of traffic, Favia said in his letter. The delay could have been longer, but because paramedics were already heading to an unrelated incident reported one minute earlier, they were able to shorten the delay in reaching the elderly woman, Favia said. ""The result of this call was a cardiac arrest, which was pronounced at Englewood Hospital,"" Favia wrote. ""I would also like it noted that the paramedics were delayed due to heavy traffic on Fort Lee Road and had to meet the ambulance en route to the hospital instead of on the scene."" Favia did not indicate what the response for the call on the elderly woman should have been, but he pointed out details from the incident reported one minute earlier. That one was a motor vehicle accident with injuries. Favia arrived on that scene in seven minutes, when it should have taken him less than four minutes, he said. An EMS crew arrived in nine minutes, he said. Four people in that accident were transported to the hospital, he said. Chris Christie bridge scandal: a primer . In summarizing a total of four delayed emergency responses on September 9 and September 10, Favia urged Mayor Mark Sokolich to take action. ""I am bringing this to your attention so that perhaps some type of modification of change can be made to this new traffic pattern, so we can possibly avoid any further delayed response times to emergencies throughout the borough,"" Favia wrote in the letter, dated September 10. Favia couldn't be reached for comment Thursday.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown doesn't have to worry anymore that bumping into ex-girlfriend Rihanna could get him locked up, but he still has to be careful about what he says to her. Los Angeles County Judge Patricia Schnegg lifted the ""stay away"" order imposed on Brown two years ago after he was charged with assaulting the singer on the eve of the 2009 Grammys. ""He just can't bother her,"" lawyer Donald Etra, who represents Rihanna, said after Tuesday's hearing. A protective order banning Brown from harassing, stalking or striking Rihanna stays in place, the judge said. There are no restrictions on Brown calling or otherwise communicating with her, Etra said. Brown, 21, sat silently next to defense lawyer Mark Geragos in court during Tuesday's hearing. Brown was sentenced in August 2009 to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the assault conviction. He was also ordered to complete a 52-week domestic violence program. Brown ""has done a very good job of completing the domestic violence program in a timely manner,"" Schnegg said Tuesday. She said she would review Brown's progress on his community service requirement, which he is doing in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, at a June 22 hearing. The restraining order previously required Brown to stay 50 yards away from Rihanna, 10 yards if the two are at the same industry event. It was set to expire in 2014, but Brown's lawyer asked the judge to lift it early. Schnegg delayed approving the request at the last hearing until she could hear from Rihanna's lawyer. ""I have spoken to my client, and she does not object to the reduction to the stay away order,"" Etra told the judge Tuesday. Brown was arrested after an early morning argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street on February 8, 2009. According to Brown's probation report, the argument began over an incident at a Beverly Hills party. An earlier, sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna found a text message on his cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" The pair argued while in the car driven by Brown, the police statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched Rihanna -- identified in the statement by her real first name, Robyn, and the first initial of her last name, Fenty -- numerous times and put her in a headlock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to beat her and kill her, according to the statement, and he bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, the statement said, ""Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a domestic violence emergency protective order."" The detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. Rihanna's injuries included cuts and bruises inflicted by a large ring on Brown's right hand, which he used to punch her, the probation report said. ""Officers at the scene observed numerous contusions and abrasions to the victim's face and forehead, as well as bruising to her left arm near the bicep,"" it said. ""They also saw abrasions to her arms near both wrists and on her upper chest near her collarbone and around her neck. There were abrasions on her left leg and on the inside of her upper lips."" Rihanna declined to speak to the probation investigator, so the probation report's details were gathered from police detectives who interviewed her soon after the attack. ""He beat me up,"" Rihanna told the police, the report said. Brown made a public apology in July 2009, in a video statement posted on his personal Web site. ""I have told Rihanna countless times, and I'm telling you today, that I'm truly, truly sorry in that I wasn't able to handle the situation both differently and better,"" Brown said in the Web site statement. ""What I did was unacceptable, 100 percent. I can only ask and pray that you forgive me. Please.""","A judge lifts the ""stay away"" order keeping the singers apart .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The changes that we are seeing in public attitudes about homosexuality are just the tip of the political iceberg. As Bob Dylan once sang, performing to the Baby Boom generation when it was challenging the prevailing political orthodoxies, ""something is happening here. But you don't know what it is. Do you, Mr. Jones?"" America's political parties would do well to listen to Dylan's song. There are two new generations of Americans who have entered into their adulthood, now in their late 20s, 30s and 40s, who are starting to become more influential in the electorate. Generation X consists of the Americans born in the late 1960s through the late 1970s. Though they were originally thought to have little cohesive identity, their contributions to the computing revolution that transformed the world were immense. They lived through historic moments such as the presidency of Ronald Reagan and the end of the Cold War. The Millennial generation (Generation Y) followed Generation X. This cohort was born between the late 1970s and early 1990s. They have reinvented the way we communicate and have been at the forefront of some of the most dynamic sectors of the economy. Now we have entered a period when these two generations are having a major impact on politics. This is a moment, comparable to the one when the Greatest Generation (New Deal and World War II) came of age or the Baby Boom generation (1960s and 1970s) reached maturity and forced the parties to adjust and change the way they did business. The maturation of X and Y will have implications on the process, substance and relative importance of politics compared with other sectors of society. The impact on the process has already been evident in the last two presidential cycles. These generations consume everything via the Internet and all forms of social media. One of the reasons President Obama did so well was that he brought figures into his campaign, such as Facebook co-founder Christopher Hughes (a Millennial), to reach younger constituencies through new media. Hughes understood that younger Americans don't read print newspapers or magazines, they don't follow the nightly news or look for the most objective reporters, and they expect their information to come to them in short, dynamic and concise data that are filtered and sent via multiple social networks. Television spots, billboards, posters and local volunteers distributing information in person will go only so far in the coming years. Generations X and Y expect to receive and process their information in ways that the parties will have to master. The substance of politics will also change. This has been evident with the recent debates over gay rights. Americans in their 30s and 40s have grown up much more comfortable with homosexuality than their predecessors. Many of them lived through the horrors of the AIDS epidemic, when it became unacceptable to continue adhering to old taboos that prevented serious discussions about public health concerns. They had more friends and family who were openly gay, considering this to be an acceptable and fully normal part of America life. They watched popular culture that was filled with gay characters, such as the two male leads in ""Will and Grace."" When Jerry Seinfeld joked in his show, after being mischaracterized as a homosexual, ""not that there's anything wrong with that,"" these generations laughed and understood. According to Pew Research Center, 70% of Millennials support gay marriage. Their values will impact other big issues in coming years. X and Y, for instance, grew up in a world that was profoundly shaped by the waves of immigration since 1965. Its effects are felt in everything from the food they ate to the people they met to the popular entertainers who came from and blended all sorts of cultural traditions. They are also two generations who are deeply attuned to the problems facing the environment and the need for the government to make smart choices about education and technology that will help them and their children survive in a new economic world that provides less stability and requires more adaptability than the one of their parents. While Generation X saw the economic highs of the 1990s suddenly collapse with the dot-com bust, Generation Y, as New York Times reporter Annie Lowery recently wrote, suffered through the financial crisis ""that battered career prospects, drove hundreds of thousands into the shelter of schools or parents basements and left hundreds of thousands of others in continual underemployment."" Many members of X and Y also don't trust the formal political system to get much done. This is not because the political system betrayed them, the sentiment felt by the Baby Boomers, but because it literally doesn't seem to work. The kind of intense partisan polarization that so many older Americans lament as being different from what they experienced in their youth is the only kind of politics that these generations have ever seen. In the 1990s and early 2000s, they have watched as the parties failed to reach agreement on almost every issue, and the nation's leaders have constantly engaged in a vicious style of combat that leaves all sides injured. The result is that many of them look to other forms of activity to solve public problems, whether through startups or nonprofits. The nation's political leaders will not only have to reach these generations but will have to win back their trust that politics can work at all. The generations have clearly arrived. Politicians have been extremely slow to respond. But they have no choice. This is no longer the electorate of their father's and mother's America. The politicians who want to succeed will have to keep up with expectations, concerns and basic values of Generations X and Y if they want to succeed in the coming decades. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","America's political climate is changing due to maturity of two generations, says Julian Zelizer .

The show will be back with heavy competition from NBC's ""The Voice,"" which for the first time last year beat ""Idol"" in the ratings on a Thursday night. But even while the show, which for years has been a juggernaut in the ratings for Fox, has slid in terms of viewers for the past year, it is still a force to be reckoned with in TV land. ""I don't think 'The Voice' is more popular than our show,"" ""Idol"" producer Trish Kinane reportedly said at the recent Television Critics Association winter press tour. ""If you look at the ratings, 'American Idol' still beat it. But having said that, 'Idol' is the gold standard. It is the original format."" Kinane added that she thought there was room for both shows. In addition to the reboot of judges, the show has also made some other tweeks, The Hollywood Reporter quotes Kinane as saying. ""We made a lot of small changes,"" she said. ""We didn't want to do anything radical. We went back and examined every single element of the show, from the talent search to the finale. ... It's still 'American Idol.' It's a million tiny decisions that I think has made for a fresher whole."" Some are looking to new kid on the block, Connick, to help revitalize the show. The singer told E! News that he will be honest, but kind. ""I watched the show when they were calling people names and making fun of them,"" Connick said. ""I don't do that. It's uncomfortable."" The reality singing competition has suffered from quite a few complaints from the poor performance of the male contestants last year to the lack of producing chart-topping artists in recent years. According to a Forbes ranking, Carrie Underwood was the top money-making ""Idol"" winner last year. The country artist/ ""Sound of Music"" actress raked in $31 million last year and has pulled in $83 million over the past few years. Kelly Clarkson was second on the list, with earnings of $7 million. Season 13 of ""American Idol"" returns Wednesday night on Fox.","""American Idol"" returns Wednesday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Conservationists are optimistic Hong Kong will move to destroy its huge stockpile of confiscated ivory -- believed to be one of the world's biggest -- following China's landmark destruction of six tons of tusks and ivory sculptures this week. Hong Kong, one of the principal gateways to mainland China, has previously opted not to destroy its stockpile of the illegal ""white gold"" -- most of which is seized en route to the mainland -- opting instead to hold it in secret warehouses, sending small amounts to schools for educational purposes. China is the world's largest ivory market, accounting for an estimated 70% of global consumption, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). But a spokeswoman for Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said a committee would consider alternate means of dealing with the stockpile of ""about 30 tons"" of contraband ivory held by the Chinese Special Administrative Region (SAR), a hub of the global ivory trade, at a meeting later this month. The department had been trialing means of destroying ivory, including incineration, she said. Activists are hopeful Hong Kong will be encouraged to emulate the recent example of China, which took the symbolic gesture of crushing of tons of ivory in the southern Guangdong province Monday. The public demolition, which took place before diplomats, conservationists and media, came a month after China pledged at an African Elephant Summit in Botswana to take action to combat ivory trading. The quantity destroyed by China -- the first occasion the superpower has destroyed any of its stockpile -- amounted to about one-sixth of the illegal ivory confiscated worldwide in 2012, according to IFAW estimates. ""The government of China took a stand finally on the issue and made a symbolic gesture to say to the world they want to join the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade,"" said activist Alex Hofford of lobby group Hong Kong for Elephants. Given Hong Kong's close relationship with China and with key trading partner the United States, which similarly destroyed its entire 6-ton stockpile of ivory in November, ""I don't very well see how (Hong Kong) cannot"" follow suit, he said. The destruction of seized ivory hordes has also taken place in the Philippines, Gabon, and Kenya in recent years. ""There's a bit of a pattern emerging, a global trend now to get rid of the ivory stockpiles,"" said Hofford, adding that Hong Kong's trove would be by far the largest to be destroyed. READ MORE: Chinese construction camps eyed as ivory conduits in Republic of Congo . Conservation groups have been calling on governments to destroy their stockpiles, which often require substantial resources to keep secure, in order to help wipe out the demand for ivory and prevent the product returning to market. According to the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species, a large amount of confiscated African ivory goes missing every year. More crucially, said Hofford, public destruction also sends a powerful message to potential buyers. ""It sends a really strong signal to consumers in China that it's morally reprehensible -- it's the wrong thing to do, and by buying illegal wildlife products, they're directly contributing to the poaching crisis in Africa,"" he said. A survey of 900 middle and upper middle class Chinese, commissioned by National Geographic last year, found nearly 60% of respondents believed that strong government directives not to purchase ivory would be the most effective way to counter the trade. The survey also found that Chinese consumers associated ivory products with luxury and prestige. According to Jeff He, special assistant to the Asia Regional Director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a rise in demand from Asia, and especially China, in recent years has fueled the black market and put increasing pressure on African elephants in the wild. The elephant population in Africa has now shrunk to around half a million, from 1.2 million in 1980. Nearly one hundred African elephants are killed for their tusks every day, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. Hofford said that incinerating, not merely crushing, the ivory was a key consideration, as the crushing process would chunks of ivory large enough that they could still be worked into trinkets and returned to the ivory market.

"(CNN) -- Roma was unable to reclaim top spot in Serie A following a 0-0 draw Monday with Cagliari at the Stadio Olimpico. The home side's third successive draw after 10 consecutive wins sees them maintain their unbeaten record in the league but means they are now one point behind Juventus who beat Livorno 2-0 on Sunday. Rudi Garcia's men had plenty of chances to win the match against a Cagliari side who haven't won away from home all season, but were denied all three points thanks to a combination of sloppy finishing and some sturdy goalkeeping from Vlada Avramov. The Serb denied Gervinho first with a save at the near post in the fifth minute and was on hand five minutes later to deny Brazilian defender Maicon. Gervinho, who was returning after a month out with a hamstring strain, went closest in the half heading against the post from close range just before the break. The frustration continued for home supporters in the second half as Avramov repelled all that Roma threw at him, including a late save from Leandro Castan's header. ""We didn't manage to score a goal but the man of the match was Avramov,"" Garcia told Sky Italia. The result means Roma now have 33 points from 13 games while Cagliari have 14 points and remain in 14th place. Meanwhile in the English Premier League, West Bromwich Albion drew 2-2 with Aston Villa in the Midlands' derby at the Hawthorns. Striker Shane Long netted two fabulous early goals to put the home side in control before Villa fought back in the second half. Long's first came in the third minute when he finished neatly following an exquisite pull down and switch of direction. The Republic of Ireland striker doubled the lead eight minutes later in equally assured fashion latching on to a sloppy pass from Leandro Bacuna before jinking past defender Nathan Barker. Long then coolly dinked his shot over the advancing keeper Brad Guzan with the ball going in off the underside of the crossbar. But the second half belonged to the visitors. Karim El Ahmadi pulled one back in 67th minute before Ashley Westwood unleashed an unstoppable 25-yard drive to level the scores. The draw keeps West Brom and Villa level with 15 points in 11th and 12th place respectively. In La Liga's only fixture on Monday, Athletic Bilbao claimed a 2-1 win at Malaga. The win sees Bilbao stay in fifth with 26 points, one point behind fouth-place Villareal.

"(CNN) -- Kevin Chapman, the college graduate student who led the team that recently unearthed Civil War artifacts at the site of a Confederate prison in Georgia, recalls two visitors who came one day to watch one of the digs. Doug Carter of Fayetteville, Georgia, and Nina Raeth of North Augusta, South Carolina, traveled in April to Magnolia Springs State Park, unaware of each other and the bond they shared. Carter brought a ""fowling"" shotgun that belonged to his great-grandfather, Jesse Taliaferro Carter, who was a Confederate prison guard at Andersonville and Camp Lawton, site of Chapman's work. Raeth, a great-granddaughter of a Union prisoner who also was at Andersonville and Lawton, came out of curiosity. ""It was kind of a magical day,"" said Chapman, a student at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro. Since then, Carter and Raeth have become good friends, sharing research and family stories. Jesse T. Carter was only 17 when he went off to war. After serving as a guard he was wounded in battle in South Carolina and ended the war at Columbus, Georgia. He died in 1924. Raeth's ancestor, Sebastian Glamser, was a German immigrant who moved to Little Sandusky, Ohio, a few years before the Civil War. He served with the 37th Ohio, Company F. ""Doug has been such a source of information for me,"" said Raeth, who grew up in Michigan. Her great-grandfather was captured in Atlanta in July 1864. After serving time in the prison camps, he was paroled in Virginia. He died in 1911. Part of the family lore is how Glamser tried to hang on while in prison. One of his few possessions was a lice comb. ""He loaned it (to other prisoners) for a ration of food,"" Raeth said. The descendants noted that both inmates and guards suffered late in the war. ""They shared a deplorable condition,"" said Carter. ""They were both American soldiers."" Chapman, 36, said the chance meeting amplified what an archaeological excavation is really about -- understanding the lives and circumstances of the people who left personal belongings behind. ""It's huge,"" Chapman said of the discovery of the stockade's exact location and the first 200 artifacts. ""This was a very scientific survey,"" said the Summerville, Georgia, native. Chapman was the star of Wednesday's formal announcement of the major find. Carter and Raeth also were on hand. ""He realized he was on to something that was the work of a lifetime,"" said Mark Musaus, deputy regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which recently hired Chapman to work part time as an archaeological technician. Chapman and fellow Georgia Southern students used strings, posts and grid patterns to work a tree-covered site on the grounds of Bo Ginn National Fish Hatchery next to Magnolia Springs State Park near Millen. In addition to the low-tech equipment, which included shovels, they also employed high-tech ground-penetrating radar and LIDAR, a device that studies soil beneath vegetation. Chapman and Sue M. Moore, an anthropology professor at the university, said they didn't expect to find artifacts. Their target was pinpointing the camp's stockade. Matt Luke, another student on the team, said technology one day will allow visitors to use devices to get a virtual look at artifacts and models of structures. For example, a visitor to the dig site could use a smart phone that would bring in GPS coordinates to show a model of the stockade wall. So far, Chapman said, the students are unearthing many artifacts in clusters, indicating they may have been left in tents or shelters. The discovery at Camp Lawton is expected to boost tourism in economically struggling Jenkins County as well as awareness of the anthropology program at Georgia Southern University, about a half hour south in Statesboro. ""It gives us visibility if nothing else,"" said Moore. ""I'm just ecstatic my students were involved."" Aptly, Chapman's background has elements of the military and of corrections. He served in the U.S. armed forces in Bosnia, learning the importance of the small things, like the bent picture frame he found at the Lawton site. ""It reminds me of the things you left behind,"" he said. He also works part time as a bail bondsman at Akins & Sasseen Bonding Co. in Statesboro and has worked at the Bulloch County Jail. ""Prisoners have not changed much over time,"" Chapman said. ""They've always improvised.""","Doug Carter and Nina Raeth have become friends after meeting at site of Camp Lawton .

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania authorities issued an arrest warrant this week for a high school field hockey coach accused of covering up the alleged rape of one of her players during a weekend athletic festival over the summer. A 23-year-old man has been charged with rape in the case. Court documents say Rafael Gomez-Echavarria of Reading raped a 16-year-old girl early on the morning of August 4 at a Best Western Hotel near Harrisburg. The teen was in town attending the Keystone State Games with her family, but had been given permission to spend the night at the hotel with Alicia Colon, her field hockey coach at Kutztown Area High School, and two other girls for what was billed as a ""girls night."" But it didn't stay that way for long, according to a probable cause affidavit. The document says Colon, 25, went to nearby Elizabethtown to pick up three men, including Gomez-Echavarria, who spent the night in the room with Colon and the girls. The coach told police that the males had taken Ecstasy, and she admitted to smoking marijuana with them. The alleged victim told police she slept on the floor because Colon and one of the men were ""carrying on"" in the bed in which she was supposed to sleep. The girl said she woke up when one of the men, later identified by police as Gomez-Echavarria, began kissing her neck. She told police she had to tell him approximately five times to stop before he did. The girl woke up again about two hours later when Gomez-Echavarria was touching her ""private areas"" and later forced her to have intercourse, according to court documents. She told police she didn't scream because she was afraid he would hurt her. When the alleged sexual assault was over, Gomez-Echavarria instructed the girl not to say anything, telling her it was ""our little secret,"" before he went to sleep. It was then that the girl texted her coach, who was on a bed next to her. Colon didn't read the text message until later in the morning, the affidavit said. This is when the alleged cover-up began, according to court documents. Afraid of losing her job, Colon told the girl to ""forget about the rape and it will go away,"" the police report said. The men had left the room at that point. It's unclear how long the girl kept her secret, but her mother contacted the Lower Swatara Township Police Department on October 27 to report a rape. Police interviewed Colon on November 7, according to court documents. She initially told police there was no attempt to cover anything up, but when told that authorities had her text messages, ""her story changed."" ""Alicia tried to cover up the rape in fear of losing her job,"" Detective Ryan Gartland wrote in the affidavit. ""We confirmed this through text and Facebook messages."" Both Colon and Gomez-Echavarria were charged November 27 in district court -- each with multiple felonies and misdemeanors. Colon's charges included hindering an investigation, destroying evidence, endangering children and the corruption of minors. Among Gomez-Echavarria's charges are forcible rape, sexual assault, indecent assault and unlawful contact with a minor. Officer Joseph Smith with the Lower Swatara Township Police Department told CNN Tuesday night that neither suspect had been arrested yet. CNN's attempts to contact Colon and Gomez-Echavarria were unsuccessful. Kutztown School Superintendent Kathy Metrick said Colon has been an assistant field hockey coach for two years. She is employed by the district only during the season, which this year began August 12 and ended October 14. Two ex-players on California high school football team accused of sex crimes .

"(CNN) -- What is Ariel Sharon's legacy? The eulogies have focused on his decision to pull Israeli settlers out of Gaza in 2005 under the so-called ""disengagement plan."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised Sharon's ""political courage and determination."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sharon ""surprised many in his pursuit of peace."" The reality is that Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza portended no courage to change his pro-settlement, virulently anti-Palestinian policies. Since the 1970s, when he planned and helped establish 64 West Bank settlements, Sharon had earned his moniker as ""the father of the settlements."" His evacuation of 21 settlements in Gaza and four in the West Bank seemed surprising, indeed. But the removal of settlers must be seen in the context that overall during Sharon's term as Israel's prime minister from 2001 to 2006, the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, increased from roughly 388,000 to 461,000. Sharon's legacy is deeply disturbing. He went to his grave without facing justice for terrible things he did. His death is a grim reminder that impunity for human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law has plagued Israel and the Palestinians for far too long. It mattered little to Sharon that Israel's transfer of its civilians into Palestinian territories wasâ€”and isâ€”a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and a potential war crime. It mattered even less that the settlement regime and Israel's military rule in these areas subjects Palestinians to severe discrimination and a mountain of restrictions that makes life miserable. Part and parcel of this settlement expansion plan was Sharon's construction of the Israeli separation barrier, which today stands as a monument to human rights violations. Sharon's government approved its construction in 2002, ostensibly to prevent Palestinian attacks that killed 640 Israeli civilians during his term. But the real motivation for the barrier, as countless studies have documented, was to build a wall around the Israeli settlements, deep into the West Bank, cutting off thousands of Palestinians from the rest of the West Bank. Worse, he avoided prosecution for the killings of civilians in which he was implicated: a fact that deserves not eulogy, but infamy. Ban and Kerry couldn't very well mention it, but history will remember Sharon for his role in the massacres of civilians by Lebanese militias in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. From September 16 to 18, the militias killed at least 700 people, and perhaps more than 2,000, including infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly, some of whose bodies were found to have been mutilated. Sharon, as Israel's defense minister in 1982, had overall responsibility for the Israel Defense Forces, which controlled the area of the camps. According to a document prepared by his office, Sharon's instructions on September 15, the day before the massacres began, included: ""For the operation in the camps the Phalangists should be sent in."" In February 1983, the Kahan Commission, Israel's official commission of inquiry investigating the events, found that Sharon bore ""personal responsibility"" for the massacre. There was a ""serious consideration ... that the Phalangists were liable to commit atrocities,"" the commission reported, but ""from (Sharon) himself, we know that this consideration did not concern him in the least."" His ""disregard of the danger of a massacre"" was ""impossible to justify,"" the commission found, and recommended his dismissal as defense minister. Although he did resign as defense minister, in a glaring example of gross impunity for crimes against Palestinians, Sharon remained in the Israeli Cabinet as a minister without portfolio and later became prime minister, serving until his stroke in January 2006. Similarly, Elie Hobeika, the Phalangist leader the Kahan Commission named as responsible for directing the militias, also escaped prosecution and served as a Lebanese Cabinet minister until being killed by a car bomb in 2002. The massacres constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity. Yet Israeli justice authorities did not conduct a criminal investigation to determine whether Sharon and other Israeli military officials bore criminal responsibility. Israel also made sure that no one else could bring Sharon to justice, either. In 2001, survivors from Sabra and Shatila brought a case in Belgium requesting Sharon be prosecuted under Belgium's ""universal jurisdiction"" law. Political pressure from the United States and Israel -- it ""was like nothing I have ever seen,"" said a colleague who closely followed the issue at the time -- led Belgium's parliament to amend the law in April 2003, and to repeal it in August. Belgium's highest court dropped the case against Sharon that September. Many in Israel are now highlighting Sharon's record as a warrior and bold political leader. But it is worth pausing to consider his record as a man who brought devastation and destruction to the lives of thousands of Palestinians, without ever facing justice for his crimes, and whose policies undermined efforts to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sarah Leah Whitson.","Sarah Whitson: While eulogies praise Ariel Sharon, his legacy is actually disturbing .

"(CNN) -- If you can define Ariel Sharon's legacy in one line, citing just one of his dramatic actions, then you have missed most of the man. The former Israeli prime minister led a life that looks much like the history of his country, filled with trauma, heartbreak, creativity, bloodshed and transformation. He aroused intense hatred from his enemies and profound admiration from his followers. He had strong opinions, took bold, risky actions. He made brilliant moves and disastrous mistakes. Sharon stood at the center of the greatest disputes, the most feverish controversies in the country's history. And then he stunned the world with a radical change of heart. The brazen right-wing hardliner remains a target of hatred for many in the Arab world. And yet, when he suffered a devastating stroke in 2006, he had undergone a breathtaking political conversion. Once a major proponent of the plan to build Jewish settlements in territories captured during the 1967 Six Day War, he had decided it was time for Israel to withdraw from much of the territory. As he told the New York Times' William Safire in 2004, he didn't believe the Palestinian leaders would respect a peace agreement, but he didn't want Israel to rule over millions of Palestinians. So, he said, ""I discussed this between me and myself and came up with a new initiative."" Initially, nobody liked his idea very much. ""In Israel, the right does not like me to do it, and the left cannot do it,"" he said, ""but you don't wait forever."" Despite bitter protests from his former allies and stiff resistance from the settlers, he carried out the ""Disengagement"" in 2005, removing every single settler and every Israeli soldier from the Gaza Strip. And he cryptically spoke of more ""painful compromises"" to come. ""We yearn for peace with our neighbors,"" he said to Israelis, ""even at the price of painful concessions."" There is every reason to believe he was preparing to withdraw Israeli settlements from much of the West Bank, as well. Had Sharon stayed in office, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would look very different today. Sharon embodied the Israeli dilemma of how to obtain peace while maintaining security. As he had predicted years earlier, the withdrawal from Gaza ultimately turned the territory into a launching pad for attacks against Israeli towns. And yet, few Israelis wish their country still occupied the Strip. The larger-than-life prime minister helped his country survive in a deeply hostile region, where Israel's neighbors made it clear from the day the state was founded that they would find it the happiest of outcomes if the Jewish state would cease to exist. But he also drove Israel into terrible quagmires. Barely 20 years old in 1948, he sustained multiple injuries fighting in a war against half a dozen Arab countries, which attacked the moment Israel declared its independence. In 1973, when Egyptian and Syrian armies crossed into Israel on Yom Kippur, while much of the country was fasting for the calendar's holiest day, Israel appeared at risk of falling. Egyptian forces were headed for Tel Aviv. It was Sharon who devised and executed a plan to cross the Suez Canal, cut off and encircle part of the Egyptian army, a plan that helped Israel win the war and pave the road to peace. He suffered head injuries in battle but kept on fighting. Pictures of Sharon with his head bandaged while winning the war became iconic, a metaphor for a country battered, creative, resilient. He was the defense minister who carried out the withdrawal of all Israelis, including settlers, from the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for peace with Egypt. The darkest, most destructive chapter in Sharon's life unfolded in Lebanon in 1982 when he was defense minister. It is by that chapter that most Arabs remember him. Back then, Israeli civilians were coming under constant attack from the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the PLO, which had become a state-within-a state inside Lebanon. Sharon launched an invasion to remove the PLO, allying Israeli forces with Lebanon's Christian militias, the Phalangists. Israeli forces allowed Phalangist fighters to enter the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla in Beirut to clear out Palestinian militias. Instead, the Phalangists committed horrific massacres of civilians. Contrary to what many believe, Sharon had no knowledge that the massacres would occur. An Israeli commission of inquiry found that despite previous excesses by the Christian militias, Israel had concluded that Phalangist forces had reached a stage of maturity that would ""ensure that such actions would not repeat themselves."" Given the sectarian passions, it was reckless to allow the Christian militias into the camp. The Israeli inquiry headed by the country's President of the Supreme Court, the Kahan Commission, found Sharon bore ""personal responsibility"" and recommended his removal from office. Israelis were seething at him and their government. He rejected the charges and refused to step down. Israeli peace activists launched protests to push for his removal. When a hand grenade was detonated in one demonstration, killing an Israeli protester, Sharon finally stepped down. Eventually, Sharon rose again. He had never cared much what people thought about him and was never one to follow ideological fashion. That was probably a result of his childhood. When he was born in 1928, his parents had settled in a socialist farming community, but rejected their neighbors' views on communal living. Sharon and his family were outsiders in their own home. He learned to think for himself and follow his instincts rather than the crowd. He had reached the height of his career in 2006 when it suddenly ended from a massive stroke that put him in a coma. Before his illness, Sharon had found a new path. He broke with his rightist party, the Likud, in a rift that put him on the opposite side of other hardline stalwarts such as today's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sharon created the Kadima (forward) party ahead of elections he was poised to win in a landslide. When he was incapacitated, Kadima won. His deputy Ehud Olmert became prime minister and carried on with peace talks, which ultimately foundered. Sharon had hand-picked Tzipi Livni to join him in Kadima. She is now a leading advocate of concessions for peace and member of Israel's negotiating team. Despite his missteps, Israelis trusted Sharon as a strong defender of their security. That meant that when he was prepared to take risks for peace, they were ready to join him. That's why he won elections while vowing to undertake ""painful compromises."" That's why it was so demoralizing when he suddenly left the stage. Israelis, including Netanyahu, know that peace will not be possible without some risk-taking. The question is the extent of the danger they are prepared to accept. His life showed the complex link between security, peace and politics. And he showed once again that it is often the fiercest warriors who take risks for peace. It was another Israeli right-wing leader, Menachem Begin, who made peace with Egypt. It was Yitzhak Rabin, a respected general, who shook hands with Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn. It was Sharon, an architect of the settler movement, who said settlements had to be removed. He left a complicated legacy, defending his country from those who would destroy it, and taking on those who disagreed with his controversial views at home.

"(CNN) -- In the hills of Burundi, farmers tend their coffee crop. Their livelihoods depend on a good harvest. Coffee in the small central African nation is more than just a hot drink; it's a valuable commodity that props up Burundi's agrarian-based economy. The world of Starbucks baristas and double macchiatos are an alien concept to coffee growers in one of Africa's poorest nations, where 55% of the population earns their livelihood from Arabica beans. Read more: Africa's giant infrastructure projects . Chantal Ka-Hor-Rury, a coffee trader and head of a collective that helps farmers bring their crop to market, is committed to helping Burundi expand its coffee industry. ""We chose to cultivate coffee because in our country, it's a crop that gives a lot of money,"" she said. Coffee accounts for 80% of Burundi's export revenues but with market prices slipping to their lowest level since 2009, according to the International Coffee Organization's index, profit margins are thin. ""The market is very low but it does not discourage us,"" Ka-Hor-Rury said, ""because when you have a lot to sell you always make a lot of money."" Wedged between resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo and the rapidly expanding economy of Tanzania, Burundi is trying to carve out a reputation as one of Africa's leading coffee producers. Ka-Hor-Rury, who began trading five years ago, said: ""We will continue to grow crops and increase the production and the quality too."" Read more: Ethiopia bids to be Africa's powerhouse . Burundi is trying to rebuild following a brutal civil war that lasted over a decade, ending in 2005. But the country's scars remain as two thirds of Burundians linger below the poverty line and 60% of the population is chronically malnourished, according to a U.N. report. Increasing domestic production . Today, Burundi's coffee producers are trying to transform the country's fortunes, with farmers harboring ambitions to process coffee domestically. Ka-Hor-Rury wants to buy her own roaster, but according to the latest figures from the United Nations, less than 5% of the Burundian crop was processed in the country in 2009, with raw beans, known as ""green coffee,"" making up the majority of exports. Read more: Johannesburg's crime hotspot transformed to hipster hangout . Mauricio Galindo, head of operations at the International Coffee Organization, said that Brazil and Colombia are the only coffee-growing countries that have successfully managed to export roasted coffee, but even then with great difficulty. He said that many farmers in Africa lack the harvesting skills needed to compete in the premium coffee market and do not have the access to consumers in Europe and the United States. ""It's not that they don't have the right varieties."" he said, ""It's that the growing, then harvesting and processing is not done properly in many cases. Coffee is a surprisingly complicated thing to make perfect."" Every stage counts, according to Galindo, from the altitude at which coffee is farmed to the temperature in storage. He added that the gap in specialist training and knowledge is hindering Africa's ability to compete with products from Central and South America. ""Coffee comes from Africa so it should be able to produce the best coffee in terms of the characteristics of the bean,"" he said. The future for Burundi's coffee markers . In a United Nations report published this year, experts stated that coffee revenues in Burundi ""represent the difference between food security and hunger for much of the population."" And Galindo believes more needs to be done to increase revenues for Africa's coffee producers. ""Every single African country has increased production over the last few years,"" he said ""yet there is a failure in the supply chain that doesn't allow the farmer to capture the premium."" Read more: From warzone to holiday paradise . However, he expressed a positive outlook for the future of African coffee producers by adding: ""It's only recently that we've seen the comeback of African countries, so I think there is hope, no doubt. There is a greater awareness in these countries that is quality based, but I wouldn't say it's a process that will happen overnight.""","More than half of Burundi's population makes a living from coffee beans .

"Aachen, Germany (CNN) -- Three men have been sent to prison for the acid attack that nearly blinded Sergei Filin. But the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet says that nothing can give him back what he has lost. In an exclusive interview with CNN in Aachen, Germany, on the day his attackers were sentenced in a Moscow court, Filin said the attack had dented his spirit as well as leaving him in agony and partially disfigured. ""It's not just a problem with my eyes, it's a problem with my heart,"" he said. Filin now wears dark glasses much of the time and has undergone numerous surgeries in Germany since the attack in a Moscow street last January. And he bears the pain of knowing that it was one of the dancers in his own world-renowned company who masterminded the attack, star soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko. Dmitrichenko was sent to prison for six years Tuesday, while accomplice Yuri Zarutsky was sentenced to 10 years and driver Andrei Lipatov got four years. Filin said he accepts the court's verdict and sentencing -- but he is not prepared to forgive and forget. ""Of course not, I cannot forgive them because there is no sentence nor punishment today that would enable me to recover my eyesight, the eyesight that I once had,"" he said. ""What will happen in the course of my future treatment, nobody knows. Whatever is ahead, it will be a struggle."" So far doctors have managed to restore some of Filin's vision, but his sight remains impaired. 'It hurt all over my skin' As a dancer, Sergei Filin was one of Russia's brightest stars. Now 43, he took up the key role of artistic director at the storied Bolshoi Ballet in 2011, after three years directing Moscow's Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater, amid what was reported to be fierce rivalry. He won the position but his artistic leadership of Russia's most prominent cultural icon has been marred by scandal, not least the horrific attack he suffered outside his Moscow home. Filin recalls what happened on that fateful January day, when a masked assailant tossed sulfuric acid into his face. ""What I felt was unbearable agony. It hurt all over my skin and I immediately felt an atrocious pain in my eyes,"" he said. ""There was lots of snow around and I slid and fell several times. But I felt the cold snow was relieving the pain, so I started covering my face with it."" He was eventually helped by passersby. But the damage was already done -- and the next time he was seen in public, it was with his head swathed in bandages and third-degree burns to his face and eyes. When it emerged that Dmitrichenko was behind the attack, the dark rivalries and score-settling at the heart of the Bolshoi were laid bare, amid allegations of affairs, corruption and jealousy. Filin does not believe that different actions on his part might have resulted in a different outcome. ""Those accusations that we have heard have not been underpinned by any evidence,"" he said. ""They are all lies aimed at lessening the degree of guilt or punishment for this crime."" CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Aachen and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","""It's not just a problem with my eyes, it's a problem with my heart,"" says Sergei Filin .

"(CNN) -- On December 15, 2013, teachers Nick Gough and Richard Sears rolled to a stop after what's likely to be a Guinness World Record-setting 42,120 kilometer journey around the globe. The 16-month trip, which took them through 39 countries, is impressive in itself. That they did it on a three-wheeled tuk tuk -- the ubiquitous urban transport solution in many parts of Asia -- makes their story remarkable. Starting from the British Museum in London on August 13, 2012, the expedition took them through southern Europe to Turkey, where they crossed into Egypt and drove down Africa. From South Africa, they shipped the tuk tuk to India, where they resumed their journey through Southeast Asia. From Singapore they shipped the rickshaw to Latin America, then did a loop of South America -- nearly having to give up due to mechanical issues -- before reaching the finish line in Buenos Aires last month. The men say they overtook the current world record for the longest journey in an auto-rickshaw and are now waiting for Guinness to officially validate it, a process that can take a few months. Here, the pair recaps some of the highs and lows of the journey and why they did it. CNN: What was the motivation behind this adventure? Nick Gough: One of the key things we are doing is promoting awareness of world education problems. As clichÃ© as it sounds, the idea was hatched after teaching and traveling abroad and seeing the amazing work of the local people who are working to find innovative ways to provide an education to children in their communities. In 2000, the 189 United Nations member states and 23 international organizations made promises with the Millennium Development Goals that every primary aged child in the world would have access to education by 2015. This is going to fail miserably. There are still 57 million primary aged children who are out of school and countless more who lack a quality education, either through number of kids in the classroom or other factors. CNN: Why a tuk tuk? Nick Gough: The tuk tuk as a small, open-sided vehicle is iconic for many of the countries we have traveled though. There was never any doubt that it would be a tuk tuk. Loads of people drive and cycle their way around the world, which in many ways is more impressive than what we've done. But we wanted to stick out like a sore thumb, so that people would take notice. Also, no one had driven the length of Africa or around the world in a tuk tuk, and there was a world record on offer, so it was the perfect vehicle for our goals. It helped that we were both pretty obsessed with tuk tuks and just loved being in them when we were traveling. CNN: How would you rate the overall comfort of long distance tuk tuk travel? Nick Gough: Tuk tuks are built for city travel and for this they are perfect. We have found that they are not so good driving in long straight lines (ours had a max speed of 50 km/h), high altitude (doesn't start), thick mud and sand (back wheels don't rotate) and roads that aren't sealed (no suspension in the back two wheels). CNN: What were the best and worst places to travel with a tuk tuk? Nick Gough: This is a tough question. Often the best places from a reaction point of view are the places that don't have tuk tuks, or that do but don't have many. With this in mind, we got the best reactions from people in Southern Africa, Chile and Argentina. I would say that Africa was the real highlight for us (even though at times it was very challenging). Likewise, though the heat and humidity of India made life very uncomfortable, it's an amazingly interesting assault on the senses -- driving is like a real life computer game. Generally, the most boring times are long straight roads that go on for days with not much scenery to look at! CNN: Easiest and toughest border crossings? Nick Gough: We adopted the attitude of ""we have all the correct paper work (most of the time) and we are going to stay here until you let us through."" Many countries do say, ""sorry we don't let tuk tuks cross this border,"" but they normally give way after a couple of hours. What's challenging is getting through customs when you ship the tuk tuk. We spent days/weeks in customs in both Egypt and Colombia. We just had to be patient (or at least smile and pretend to be). More: Bangkok tuk tuk driver confessions . CNN: Was safety ever an issue? Nick Gough: We actually feel that the tuk tuk is a pretty safe vehicle. We couldn't go very fast which meant unless one of us fell asleep at the wheel a head on collision was pretty unlikely. We did get bundled off the road a lot and no one respected us, but you can deal with that. What we couldn't control was stuff driving into the back of us. This occurred in Malaysia when a guy was coming onto the main road via a slip road and looking over his shoulder. He slammed into the back of us, knocking us sideways into the fast lane, but luckily there was nothing coming. More: Malaysia travel: 10 things to know before you go . CNN: What other vehicle would you consider for an around-the-world journey? Nick Gough: Rich has plans one day to do an expedition on a Royal Enfield motorbike. I think that my next (much shorter) adventure is going to be on a tandem bicycle. CNN: Did you raise any money during the trip? Richard Sears: Our main aim is to raise awareness -- about the educational challenges facing the world today and for the Global Campaign for Education. We are raising money too though to support grassroots education projects that we've visited throughout our journey. We're supporting these small projects, set up and run by local people, through our UK registered charity, The Tuk Tuk Educational Trust, where 100% of donations go directly to the projects. This process has started, and will be our focus from now on. People can support projects (donating to or fundraising for those that may particularly appeal to them) through our website www.tuktuktravels.com/projects. CNN: How did you pay for the journey? Richard Sears: The journey itself (totally separate from our charity) was funded by ourselves with the support of some sponsors and partners, including Cardiff University and DSV Global Transport and Logistics. We couldn't have done it without their kindness and support. CNN: What's next for you two? Nick Gough: To wrap up this project we will both be doing school talks around the UK for a few months. We will also be working on a book and trying to find people to work with us on our travel/education documentary that we would like to release in 2015 when, ideally, the Millennium Development Goals are supposed to be realized. After that we aren't sure. We both still want to work in some capacity in development and education. Rich is unlikely to go back into teaching -- probably focusing more on the business side of education. I miss being in the classroom and the community aspects of school life so depending on what turns up I might well head straight back into teaching.

"(CNN) -- Pau Gasol is a seasoned and accomplished basketball player, both in the NBA and in his native Spain. His list of accolades is almost as long as he is tall -- two NBA championships, two silver Olympic medals, NBA Rookie of the Year, to name a few. But the Los Angeles Laker finds success isn't measured solely by his performance on the hardwood. He maintains a wider perspective on his role off the court and just what his duties should be. ""I don't like to use the term celebrity, but people that are known have a responsibility because you have the potential of impacting people's lives,"" Gasol says. ""And regardless of what you do or you don't do, you are a role model. People look up to you. They pay attention to your actions, so it's up to you whether you want those actions to have a positive impact or a negative impact."" Early in his career, Gasol reached out and became a UNICEF ambassador in 2003. ""I wanted to be a good role model for the children that look up to me and make a difference in society beyond my own needs and accomplishment,"" he says. Over the past decade Gasol has dedicated much of his time off court to his role as ambassador. Most recently he helped respond to the immense need for aid in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan struck in November. Gasol knows the people of the Philippines will need assistance for a long time. To inspire others to donate to UNICEF's efforts in the region, Gasol pledged to donate $1,000 for every point he scored in a game against the Golden State Warriors shortly after the typhoon hit. He also took to Twitter and Facebook to encourage fans to join in and pledge for each point he scored. ""I was also carrying that responsibility, and it made me focus even more and made me want to do better and score more points and have more people donating and helping all the people in the Philippines,"" Gasol says. In addition to raising money for UNICEF, Gasol accompanies the group on trips to communities in need whenever he can. ""It's real important to me. And that's one thing that I told UNICEF. After my first year of being with them, I told them that I needed to go and see and feel for myself,"" he says. ""Because then I would be able to share my experiences and talk about it with knowledge of what's really going on. So if I wanted to be a good ambassador for UNICEF, I needed to live it."" His 7-foot frame often stands out on these trips, but the NBA superstar makes an even bigger impact by trying to better the lives of the world's most vulnerable. ""Kids are our future. So if you provide good teaching, good guidance to kids, I think we're going to have a brighter future. And I think that every kid should have the right to get an education, have a right to play, have a right to -- a chance -- basically."" Beyond his duties with UNICEF, Gasol and his younger brother and fellow NBA player, Marc Gasol, created the Gasol Foundation. ""We wanted to have our own foundation and create our own legacy outside of basketball, something that we could invest our time and dedicate ourselves to in the future -- during, but also when we were done playing,"" Pau Gasol says. The Gasol Foundation aims to empower children to lead healthier lives. Gasol and his brother work with local chapters of the Boys and Girls Club in Los Angeles and Memphis, Tennessee, where they each play and live, respectively. They have a variety of programs to guide children into making smart choices about foods and activities. ""We really connect with children. I like to feel like children look up to us ... and we have a tremendous power of influence (on) these kids. So if we give them that positive influence, it makes a huge difference,"" Gasol says. ""We try to empower these kids to live healthier lives through exercise, through good nutrition and understanding how picking up healthy habits from an early life is going to save them from a lot of health issues down the road."" Gasol says everyone must decide what his mission in life will be. ""(I) just try to remind myself how fortunate I am and also just how much I like to inspire others by my actions.""","NBA player Pau Gasol is an ambassador for UNICEF .

"(CNN) -- London's Metropolitan Police have praised the good behavior of Scotland fans during Sunday's match against Brazil, despite claims by Brazilian striker Neymar that a banana was thrown at him as a form of racist abuse. Santos striker Neymar, 19, scored both goals in Brazil's 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium, the home of English Premier League side Arsenal. But the Brazilian attacker later revealed that he was subjected to racist taunts from Scottish spectators, which culminated in the banana-throwing incident. However, the police confirmed they had received no complaints about any form of racism being displayed during the match on Monday. Will Neymar win 2014 World Cup for Brazil? Match commander, Chief Inspector Mark Shearan, issued an official press release which read: ""The Scottish supporters who travelled down to the game in their numbers were friendly and good-natured, colourful and supportive of their team. ""There were six arrests at the match -- of which only two were definitely Scottish supporters and were drink-related. This figure must be the seen in the context of a 53,000 strong crowd."" After his two-goal winning performance, Neymar had earlier claimed to Brazilian media that he had been the subject of racist abuse: ""This atmosphere of racism is totally sad. ""They were jeering me a lot, even when I was about to kick the penalty the entire stadium was jeering. ""We leave our country to play here and something like this happens. It's sad. I would rather not even talk about it, to keep the subject from escalating."" Neymar's teammate Lucas Leiva, who plays in England for Liverpool and removed the banana from the pitch, added: ""There is no more space for racism in the world. ""Europe is where it happens the most. That has to change, everybody is equal today and it's a matter of respect."" The Scottish Football Association (SFA), in a statement on their official website, denied the claims from Neymar. ""There was no evidence of such instances but the Scotland supporters have confirmed they booed the player for perceived unsporting behaviour during the match. ""The tens of thousands of Scotland fans who travelled to London were, in fact, commended for creating a carnival atmosphere not just inside the stadium but across the city throughout the weekend. ""The Scottish FA has contacted the Brazilian Football Federation and the match organisers, Kentaro, to inform them of our information and of our supporters' unhappiness at the unfounded accusations,"" the statement read.","London Police praise behavior of Scotland fans during the match against Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Let us not doubt, even in the age of deep cynicism, the power of words can still stir the spirit. And let us acknowledge, whatever our politics, that President Barack Obama has redefined oratory for our times, and perhaps more, revived it. Not all of his speeches are memorable. His talk on the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington fell short. Not all of his remarks inspire thoughtful reflection, initiate critical debate or compel us to move forward. In some ways, his Second Inaugural speech was a missed opportunity. But when he is focused, when the moment and its meaning coalesce, no president since John F. Kennedy matches Obama's ability to transform ideas into phrases, and phrases into the passion to be a force for progress. I give President Ronald Reagan and President Bill Clinton their due. Magnificent speakers and eloquent in their convictions, both in their time elevated the stature of presidential speeches. Obama, though, as he proved in his eulogy for Nelson Mandela, can be in a league of his own. Let me first deal with -- or rather dismiss -- the gossipy flutter over Obama's handshake with Raul Castro, president of Cuba and Fidel Castro's brother. As CNN reported, it happened in the context of Obama's shaking hands with dozens of world leaders. Respect for Mandela and his family required Obama to be polite. As CNN Foreign Affairs Correspondent Jill Dougherty wrote, ""refusing to shake Castro's hand would not have been in keeping with Mandela's legacy of reconciliation."" There are times when all of us can be critical of President Obama. After all, he's not infallible. His speech at Mandela's memorial was beyond my expectations. I watched as more than 100 world leaders walked into the stadium where South Africans had gathered to celebrate Mandela's life. They took their seats to applause. Latin American, Asian, Arab, European and African leaders sat together, so they could talk amongst themselves, I guess. It was an interesting juxtaposition since they were there to honor a man who brought people of different colors and backgrounds together. But when Obama spoke, I became lifted from the drizzle and dim light. Obama's words made me proud as an American and as a person; they resurrected Mandela's spirit. It is because of Mandela's soul, his spirit, that so many gathered. It has not vanished. Mandela's spirit was present within each person who was there. It was reflected in the hope that was palpable even across the miles and through a television screen. Mandela, a man of persistence, forgiveness, decency, struggle and strength, has left an overwhelming legacy as reflected in the faces of those in attendance, from the pauper to the world leader. We all know there is nothing easier to overdo than a eulogy. It is so tempting, in the graciousness of not speaking to human errors because they are gone, to lay it on so thick that the deceased, if he could, would look around and say, ""Who is he talking about?"" Obama avoided that trap. It was because Mandela showed us his human traits in all their mix that we came to love the man, he said. He also showed us that a human being, though weighted by faults, can rise to the greatest heights of the human spirit. As Obama reminded us, ""There is a word in South Africa -- ubuntu -- that describes [Mandela's] greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us."" Obama also hit the hypocrisy in all of us, but especially in world leaders (including himself, he said) who would praise Mandela but then not walk the walk that Mandela walked. Twenty-seven years in prison would have killed many a person's hopes. At some point, most would have thought, ""I'll never get out, my dreams are gone."" While social media was gossiping about Obama shaking hands with Castro, Obama chastised leaders who would praise Mandela's racial reconciliation yet oppose the most modest reforms to end economic injustice and inequality. And speaking to the heads of authoritarian governments present, Obama said there were too many leaders who ""claim solidarity with freedom,"" but do not ""tolerate dissent from their own people."" Obama spoke of Mandela's uniqueness as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Mandela's special qualities should inspire us to make our own imprint for the continuing struggle of equality, reconciliation and freedom. ""While I will always fall short of Madiba's example, he makes me want to be a better man. He speaks to what is best inside us,"" Obama said. That he does. Thank you, Mr. President, for words and a spirit befitting the occasion.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi has harsh words for his successor, Nuri al-Maliki. ""He doesn't believe in power sharing. He doesn't believe in reconciliation. He knows very well that reconciliation will bring about radicalized democracy in this country, and it seems, he doesn't want -- he's not for democracy,"" Allawi told CNN in Baghdad on Tuesday. He said the result of such a position is breaking the country apart, allowing forces of extremism to flourish. ""Unfortunately, the country is moving on a sectarian route now, which was very dangerous to start with in the very beginning. And I warned all the leaders in the world and the region that unless this is averted, then Iraq really is on the -- has started a civil war, but hasn't reached the point of no return. ""Once they reach the point of no return then, unfortunately, all the whole region will burn up,"" he said. The war in Syria and sectarian tensions have played a part in the recent surge in violence in Iraq. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. Critics of Iraq's current government argue that al-Maliki failed to usher in a political era of inclusion and reconciliation, as promised. They say the Sunni minority, which ruled Iraq via the iron fist of Saddam Hussein, is at the political and social mercy of al-Maliki's Shia-dominated government. Today, they say, ""inclusiveness"" never materialized, Sunnis have been marginalized and resentment has festered in a divide-and-conquer political climate. As one local put it, ""It's like if you're against us, you're a terrorist and we'll arrest you."" This resentment, aided by the violent government shutdown of Sunni protest camps, provided an opening for the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to move into the Sunni heartland of Anbar Province in force. When asked about the United States' backing of al-Maliki's government, Allawi stressed that such support should be qualified. ""It's up to them,"" he said. ""But they should also clarify to Maliki that their support is conditional, on inclusivity of the political process, and respecting the Constitution, and respecting human rights."" The former prime minister spoke the same day police officials reported at least 10 people were killed and 32 wounded in bombings in the nation's capital. The deadliest attack was in western Baghdad's Ghazaliyah neighborhood, where a car bomb detonated in the evening, killing at least six people and wounding 13. Earlier, a car bomb exploded in Baghdad's predominantly Shiite area of Sadr City, killing at least four people and wounding 10. At least nine people were wounded in a roadside bombing in Baghdad's predominantly Shiite district of Kadhimiya.","The former prime minister takes aim at his successor, Nuri al-Maliki .

"Washington (CNN) -- The great government shutdown of 2013 is about Obamacare and budget priorities, but it also is about respect. In short, conservative House Republicans don't think they get enough of it from President Barack Obama and the Senate. ""Republicans are now in a position where they don't want to cave in because it sets a bad precedent that the Senate would be somewhat dictating how the House runs,"" GOP Rep. Michael Grimm of New York said this week. Conservative Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana went further, telling the Washington Examiner that ""we're not going to be disrespected."" ""We have to get something out of this,"" he said. ""And I don't know what that even is."" Stutzman's office confirmed that he said it but issued a statement Thursday in which the congressman said he ""carelessly misrepresented the ongoing budget debate."" Obama, however, said Stutzman's comment reflected ""reckless"" tactics by House Republicans pursuing a purely partisan agenda instead of fulfilling the basic responsibility of Congress to fund the government. ""If you're being disrespected, it's because of that attitude you've got, that you deserve to get something for doing your job,"" Obama said at a campaign-style event Thursday in Rockville, Maryland. At issue is a short-term spending plan that would fund the government in the new fiscal year that started Tuesday. The congressional stalemate pits a conservative GOP wing that wants to abolish the Affordable Care Act against Democrats trying to protect Obama's landmark health care reforms passed in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Add to that the longstanding resentment by GOP conservatives who say their constituents and views are ignored by Democrats and the mainstream media, which also motivates their stand to link funding the government to dismantling Obamacare. In particular, they want to halt the pattern of the Republican-led House being forced to accede to the will of Obama and the Democratic-led Senate, as occurred in the past year over emergency funding in response to Superstorm Sandy and when Congress voted to raise tax rates on high-income Americans despite a conservative pledge against any tax increases. However, Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have rejected GOP efforts to use the government funding issue and upcoming debt ceiling deadline as leverage in seeking partisan goals such as dismantling the Affordable Care Act. An unclear GOP strategy also has opened conservatives to criticism that their demands created a path to the shutdown without a way of getting out. Reid told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash on Thursday that tea party conservatives he described as ""anarchists"" were setting the GOP agenda, with Boehner going along because he feared that he would otherwise lose his leadership post. Not true, countered Republican Rep. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who said Boehner was ""in charge of the House."" ""The House is supposed to be boisterous,"" Lankford said. ""It's the area closest to the people. It's a boisterous place, and it has definitely become that as all these voices have to work together to find a coalition."" Now, House conservatives take umbrage with the heated rhetoric from Obama and Reid as frustration has risen with the government shutdown. Reid also said Boehner lacked courage for refusing to hold a House vote on the Senate-passed ""clean"" spending plan -- one with no anti-Obamacare provisions -- that would end the government shutdown. Obama also challenged Boehner on the issue, saying Thursday that the shutdown would end immediately if Boehner allowed such a vote. ""Put it on the floor and let every individual member of Congress make up their own minds, and they can show the American people are you for a shutdown or not,"" Obama said, adding that House Republicans need to stop what he called careening from crisis to crisis instead of fulfilling their congressional responsibilities. Grimm said Thursday that such criticism harms the prospects for negotiating some kind of agreement. ""If you want a deal done in the boardroom, you don't assault people before you walk in,"" he said, adding that ""you're talking about human beings"" and noting, ""The speaker is a human being, too.""","Conservative Republicans want their voices heard in Congress .

"(CNN) -- U.S. transportation officials shut down 52 bus companies and 340 vehicles Thursday as part of as an eight-month effort targeting unsafe motor coach operations, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Called Operation Quick Strike, the sweeping action from New York to California involved companies in 22 states and the District of Columbia. The companies were put out of business after more than 50 specially trained investigators conducted detailed reviews of safety practices at the 250 most at-risk motor coach companies based on roadside inspection and safety data, according to a statement from the agency. ""Bus travel is increasingly popular because it is a convenient, inexpensive option for students, groups and families,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said. ""But it must also be safe."" Thursday's announcement comes weeks after the National Transportation Safety Board expressed concerns with the thoroughness of FMCSA investigations, citing four deadly crashes involving operators who were already on the radar of the oversight agency. ""While FMCSA deserves recognition for putting bad operators out of business, they need to crack down before crashes occur, not just after high-visibility events,"" NTSB Chairwoman Deborah A.P. Hersman said in a statement last month. Two deadly bus accidents in the last year prompted the investigations. FMCSA shut down the U.S. operations of Mi Joo Tour & Travel of Coquitlam, British Columbia, after an accident in Oregon in December 2012 that killed nine and injured 39. The driver had far exceeded the 70-hour work limit, the investigation found. The agency also shuttered bus company Scapadas Magicas after an accident in which eight people were killed -- seven bus passengers and a driver in another vehicle -- and dozens were injured. The February wreck occurred east of San Bernardino, California. The company failed to maintain its buses and ensure that its drivers were licensed, the agency said. ""In the aftermath of two deadly crashes earlier this year, FMCSA re-examined the way we investigate passenger carriers to make our methods even more effective at preventing crashes,"" agency spokeswoman Marissa Padilla said. ""Using safety and roadside inspection data, FMCSA identified 250 high-risk carriers for top-to-bottom investigations designed to uncover any patterns of unsafe behavior or faulty bus maintenance."" FMCSA administrator Anne Ferro said Thursday, ""I think the most important thing to point out is that we didn't wait for NTSB to tell us we had to re-examine the way we were carrying out investigations. That's exactly what we did early this year, which then led to this thorough sweep of 250 of the highest risk companies."" Dan Ronan, spokesman for the American Bus Association, a Washington-based trade group representing the motor coach, tourism and travel industry, praised the federal initiative. ""The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has done the right thing by finding companies running illegally or in an unsafe manner,"" he said. ""More than half the fatalities and injuries in the industry were caused by a small group of providers. There's no shortage of bus companies. There are plenty of good ones out there."" As a result of the investigation and inspections, 52 motor coach companies were put out of business and shut down for safety violations such as failure to maintain their buses adequately, inadequate drug and alcohol driver testing and overwork of drivers. Tour bus safety should get same treatment as aviation, advocate says . Other companies took action to correct the safety violations, and 28 avoided being shut down, the agency said. In all, 340 vehicles of the more than 1,300 inspected were taken off the road for safety and maintenance violations, according to the report. Additionally, inspectors looked into more than 1,300 carriers that had little to no inspection history with the safety agency, and more than 240 were will be investigated further. ""This year we evaluated and enhanced our investigation methods to dig deeper than ever before and uncover dangerous patterns of unsafe behavior and business practices,"" said Anne S. Ferro, administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Tour bus company shut down .

"(CNN) -- Lots of love for ""12 Years a Slave."" A big push for ""American Hustle."" Nothing for ""Lee Daniels' The Butler."" The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the little group (about 100 members) with the outsized influence, presented the nominations for the 71st Annual Golden Globes on Thursday morning, and some trends quickly became obvious. Given that the Globes are often used as tea leaf samples with which to forecast the Big Daddy of awards shows -- the Oscars -- what do they indicate? 1) ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""American Hustle"" are the front-runners. ""Slave,"" the Steve McQueen film about a free man taken into slavery in 19th-century America, dominated the proceedings among dramatic films. (The Globes spread the wealth by having categories for both film dramas and film comedies, and do the same for television shows.) It received seven nominations, including nods for best drama, best director, best actor in a drama (Chiwetel Ejiofor), best supporting actor (Michael Fassbender) and best supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o). ""Hustle"" matched that number, earning nominations for best comedy or musical, best director (David O. Russell), best actor in a comedy/musical (Christian Bale), best actress in a comedy/musical (Amy Adams), best supporting actor (Bradley Cooper) and best supporting actress (Jennifer Lawrence). Expect a lot of the same when the Oscar nominations are announced January 16. 2014 Golden Globe nominations: The list . 2) You call these comedies? Of the five films nominated for best comedy or musical, none is an out-and-out laugh riot. In fact, a couple are as dark as they come -- and probably richer than the nominated dramas. ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" the Coen brothers film about a struggling folksinger in early-'60s New York, features an unpleasant lead character who mooches off some friends and alienates others. ""Nebraska,"" directed by Alexander Payne (""Sideways""), stars Bruce Dern as a curmudgeonly old man convinced he's won a big cash prize; like all of Payne's films, it has plenty of bitter with the sweet. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a three-hour Martin Scorsese film about a crooked financial trader on a headlong rush to trouble. There's no ""Bridesmaids""-like film in the bunch -- nor, for that matter, a ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty."" Special coverage of Awards Season 2014 . 3) ""The Butler"" got shown the door. In the Screen Actors Guild nominations, announced Wednesday, ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" did surprisingly well, earning nominations for ensemble (the equivalent of best film) and performers Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey. None of them were nominated for a Globe -- and this despite the fact that the Globes often appear to hand out nominations based as much on star power as quality. Sorry, Oprah: You'll have to be invited like any other guest. Also getting short shrift from the Hollywood Foreign Press: Scorsese, who missed out on a directing nod; ""August: Osage County,"" which picked up two acting nominations but nothing for film, director or screenplay; and Woody Allen, though two of his ""Blue Jasmine"" stars got nominated. Not that Woody would have shown -- the awards-show curmudgeon, who never goes to the Oscars either, will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the HFPA, but Diane Keaton is scheduled to accept on his behalf. 4) No SAG Award nomination? No problem! OK, so ""The Butler"" got stiffed by the Globes. Not so for ""Rush,"" which earned a nomination not only for Daniel Bruhl -- who did get a SAG nod -- but also for the film itself. And how about Kate Winslet? There's been little chatter about Jason Retman's ""Labor Day,"" but she earned a best actress (drama) nomination. Robert Redford also got tabbed. The venerable 77-year-old actor, who's a one-man show in ""All Is Lost,"" picked up a best actor nomination. His snub by the SAGs may have been Wednesday's biggest surprise. 5) Watch out for ""Gravity."" Alfonso Cuaron's film has a spare screenplay and a small cast. Indeed, its lack of a true ensemble could have possibly hurt it with the SAGs. But Sandra Bullock got an acting nod (as she did from the SAGs), and the film also earned Globe nominations for drama, director Cuaron and its score. Oscarologists still consider it a front-runner for best picture, and the Globes did nothing to dispel that belief. Incidentally, for all the attention paid to the Globes, their real attraction is as a raucous, celebrity-studded party. The liquor flows freely and there's generally a loose, devil-may-care vibe from the winners. (No surprise -- this is the award that once gave Pia Zadora a ""new star of the year"" honor for the immortal film ""Butterfly."") The hosts, once again, will be Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, so expect a good time -- and terrible singing. The Golden Globes will be broadcast on Sunday, January 12. The program will air on NBC.

"(CNN) -- Despite spending more per person on health care than any other country, Americans are getting sicker and dying younger than our international peers -- a problem persisting across all ages and both genders, according to a new report. In 2011, the National Research Council found life expectancy in the United States was increasing at a slower rate than in other high-income democracies. Shortly after, the NRC and Institute Of Medicine convened a panel of experts to investigate why. The panel was given 18 months to review recent health studies from 16 ""peer countries"": Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The panel released its report, titled ""U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health,"" on Wednesday. ""Our panel was unprepared for the gravity of the finding we uncovered,"" chair Steven Woolf wrote in the report's preface. ""We hope that others will take notice."" Lagging behind . This is not a new problem, Woolf noted on a conference call about the report. ""It's been going on since 1980 and it's getting progressively worse."" Data from 2007 show Americans' life expectancy is 3.7 years shorter for men and 5.2 years shorter for women than in the leading nations -- Switzerland for men and Japan for women. As of 2011, 27 countries had higher life expectancies at birth than the United States. ""The tragedy is not that the United States is losing a contest with other countries,"" the report states, ""but that Americans are dying and suffering from illness and injury at rates that are demonstrably unnecessary."" America does rank well in some health measures, according to the panel. The United States has higher cancer survival rates, lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lower smoking prevalence rates than many of its peer countries. Those Americans who make it to age 75 will survive longer than their peers in the comparison countries. Global report: Obesity bigger health crisis than hunger . But that's where the good news stops. The report outlines nine health areas where the United States lags behind other rich nations, including infant mortality, homicides, teen pregnancy, drug-related deaths, obesity and disabilities. Americans have the highest prevalence of AIDS in the group. Seniors are at a greater risk of developing and dying from heart disease. And our children are less likely than children in peer countries to reach their fifth birthday. ""Many of these conditions have a particularly profound effect on young people, reducing the odds that Americans will live to age 50,"" the report states. ""And for those who reach age 50, these conditions contribute to poorer health and greater illness later in life."" Why? ""The sheer systemic nature of the problem, that affects so many health outcomes across the whole lifespan, surprised all of us,"" said panel member Ana Diez Roux. ""It seems to be a whole bunch of things acting together."" It's easy to point a finger at our health care system, which unlike comparison countries' does not provide universal coverage. As a result, lower income and less educated people often receive poorer care. ""The U.S. health system is highly fragmented, with limited public health and primary care resources and a large uninsured population,"" the authors wrote. ""Compared with people in other countries, Americans are more likely to find care inaccessible or unaffordable."" Opinion: Finding the jugaad for U.S. health care . But the panel says that's not all that's to blame. Studies show even white, insured, college-educated Americans are sicker than their peers in Europe. The experts gave three other possible causes for the country's growing health disadvantage: . Though Americans know what's ""good"" for them, few act on it. Although we are less likely to smoke and drink heavily than our peers, we consume more calories, have higher rates of drug abuse, are less likely to use seat belts and are more likely to use guns in acts of violence, according to the report. Most high-income countries report income and education disparities in their health care system. But the panel said Americans benefit much less from social programs that could negate the effects of poverty. ""In countries with the most favorable health outcomes, resource investments and infrastructure often reflect a strong societal commitment to the health and welfare of the entire population,"" the report states. Our environment is also a big contributor to Americans' poor health, the panel said. U.S. communities are built around automobiles, discouraging physical activity and increasing traffic accidents. Contraceptives are only available by prescription, instead of over the counter. Even stress could play a role -- adding to our waistlines, substance abuse and criminal behavior. Moving forward . ""It would be a mistake for people to respond to this by saying we need to spend more money on health care,"" Woolf said. He noted that our peer countries spend significantly less, but appear to be spending it more effectively. Where in the world can you get universal health care? With ""lives and dollars"" at stake, the report made several recommendations for the future. The experts asked the National Institutes of Health to join with international partners to improve the quality of research that could be used to compare peer countries around the world. They also recommended the NIH commission research on health policies that have been successful in our peer countries that could potentially be used in the United States. Waiting for more research isn't the answer, Woolf said. Individuals can make changes now, listening to advice about healthy diets and exercise, or making sure to wear their seat belts. As for policy, the panel hopes this report will open a broader discussion about what we value as a nation.","As of 2011, 27 countries had higher life expectancies than the United States .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In the midst of Wall Street's agonizing slide last week, there was at least one place in Manhattan where the liquor was flowing, the cigar smoke was billowing and the theme of the evening was simple: Work hard. Play hard. ""I was a crook,"" says Jordan Belfort, once a Wall Street fat cat who made $1 million a week before going to jail. ""It's like fiddling. Nero fiddled while Rome burned,"" said Thomas Graf, vice president and producer of Northmarq Capital. ""We're smoking cigars while we're losing our shirts, literally."" He was among hundreds of mid-level Wall Street executives and traders gathered for a party thrown by Cigar Report magazine, published by New York-based Doubledown Media. And if they seemed a little tone-deaf about how this kind of event could be perceived as millions of dollars were lost, at least on paper, most did not seem especially concerned. ""It is a great time,"" said Adam Marsh of Empire Capital Partners. ""I think for at least a couple of hours in the evening, we can kind of sit back, have a few drinks, forget what's facing us on the Street tomorrow."" Few of the men and women at the party earned millions in Wall Street bonuses on top of their salaries. But nearly all did very well, they say, at the top of the Wall Street bubble. And their bosses, along with those who managed Wall Street hedge funds, did even better. ""These guys were spending more than $250 billion a year,"" Robert Frank said. ""They bought mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach. They bought art for $100 million a painting."" Frank, author of ""Richistan,"" says the enormous amounts of money earned by Wall Street elite made them practically a nation unto themselves. ""They just looked at the guy with the bigger house, the nicer Ferrari, the better artwork,"" he said. ""And it was all competitive spending."" One prominent example is the CEO of Lehman Brothers, Richard Fuld. In 2007 alone, according to the executive compensation firm Equilar, he earned total take-home compensation of more than $45 million in salary and bonuses. Congressional researchers said he earned nearly $500 million from 2000 through 2007. Fuld told Congress that the failure of his company centered on inaction on the part of government and a loss of confidence in the financial markets. ""This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life, regardless of what comes out of this committee, regardless of when the record books get written,"" Fuld told Congress during a recent hearing. Not every Wall Street executive played by the books. Jordan Belfort was once chairman of a brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont. In the early to mid-'90s, he called himself the Wolf of Wall Street. He was jailed on federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering. He spent 22 months behind bars and was released in 2005. ""I was a crook,"" Belfort said. At one time, he says, he was earning more than $1 million a week. Now, he has been ordered to pay back $110 million to his victims, and he said he is working on that. Even the man who first chronicled Wall Street excess to a national audience can barely believe what has happened. Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the film ""Wall Street"" 21 years ago, says the main character in his story, unprincipled stockbroker Gordon Gekko, has been overtaken by reality. ""I never thought it would go to this level,"" Stone told CNN's Larry King. ""I thought the Gordon Gekkos of the world would die out. But they got worse."" So what exactly did the new Gordon Gekkos do to earn those fabulous sums? ""What they really did was to figure out new and clever ways of investing,"" Frank said. ""Of creating financial products that very few of us could understand."" ""On Wall Street, there's no cost. The only cost is the employees, the executives,"" said Andy Serwer, managing editor of Fortune magazine. ""So if a firm is creating a financial product that it can sell for $5 million, the person who sells it will get $2 million."" But people who earned relatively little on Wall Street are now paying the price as well. Win Hornig, a 25-year-old Minnesotan who worked at both Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan, is now out of a job. He's launched a Web site called BankerGoneBroke.com to talk about it. ""My life was basically a disaster,"" Hornig said. ""I was working all the time, didn't have a lot to show for it. I came to the conclusion that there was more to life than money."" While it lasted, the good times on Wall Street made money for traders and, of course, for Americans who had invested in the stock market, mainly through their 401(k) contributions. But there is a ""new normal"" these days. ""The party is over on Wall Street -- until it comes back again,"" Serwer said. ""I've been around long enough to see that we have these cycles. These guys get their cigars and champagne. They have a great time. The whole thing blows up. But then they re-emerge years later. This one is a really, really bad one. But I don't think Wall Street is dead.""","Wall Street elite earned enormous amounts of cash, author says .

"(CNN) -- If you follow scientific developments as if they were football games, this would be a good time to cheer ""Tick-tick-tick-tick! Tick-tick-tick-tick! Go, clock, go!"" The reason for such enthusiasm? Researchers have released a study in the journal Science describing what they believe is the world's most precise clock. You'd never need this level of precision for getting to work on time, but the clock could be used for scientific exploration and technological advancements in areas such as navigation systems, said study co-author Andrew Ludlow, researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado. The rate of ticking of this timepiece -- known informally (and awkwardly) as the ytterbium optical lattice clock -- does not change by more than one part in 10^18, Ludlow said. In other words, if there is any variation in how a second is measured, it would be in about the 18th decimal place. ""The ytterbium optical lattice clock has demonstrated a groundbreaking, new level of clock stability,"" he said. ""One could say that this is like measuring time over a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds."" In order to understand what's so special about this table-sized clock, it helps to have a little background: . How clocks work . Inside a clock is a mechanism that changes in some regular way, called an oscillator. Imagine, for example, a grandfather clock, whose pendulum swings back and forth denoting time. In a wrist watch there is often a crystal with an electrically oscillating signal. A particular number of ""back and forths"" corresponds to one second. An atomic clock makes use of an electromagnetic signal -- in other words, light emitted at an exact, known frequency. At the core of the system, there is an atom. The light is used to excite an electron in the atom. In this model, the excitation and de-excitation of an electron corresponds to a pendulum swinging right to left, but in an atomic clock, the ""tick"" denotes an unimaginably tiny fraction of a second. The current gold standard for time is the cesium clock, a type of atomic clock that an international body of experts has used to define what is the unit of one second: About 9.19 billion oscillations. In this clock, a microwave light source is used to excite electrons in cesium atoms. But the new atomic clock at NIST, described in the Science study, uses a different element: Ytterbium, atomic number 70. Optical light -- specifically, yellow light from a laser with a wavelength of 578 nanometers -- is used to excite the electrons of ytterbium atoms. Whereas scientists talk about billions of oscillations per second in the cesium clock, oscillations per second in the ytterbium clock approach one quadrillion per second, Ludlow said. The new clock is akin to a ruler that has markers for fractions of inches, compared to a ruler that only delineates inches. The first instrument would make more precise measurements. ""You divide time into finer and finer intervals,"" Ludlow said. In order to establish the precision of this clock, the scientists had to make two of them, to confirm agreement in the measurement of time. The devices won't fit on your wrist, or even on your wall. Because of all the laser equipment and technology necessary for this level of precision, the atomic clock and all of its components occupy a space about the size of a dining room table, Ludlow said. Efforts are under way to shrink the technology, however, particularly so that a version of it might be sent into space. Potential uses . Researchers studying Einstein's theory of general relativity could make use of this clock to more precisely measure how time is different depending on the surrounding gravitational force. Global positioning systems (GPS) already take this into account. Because they are farther from Earth than we are, and therefore experience less gravitational pull, their measurement of time as they orbit Earth is slightly different from what we perceive on the ground. A more precise atomic clock could measure the correctional factors even better. Such clocks could also test alternative theories about the relationship between time and gravity. There could be other applications for navigation and communications systems. But you probably won't want one for your alarm clock. Ludlow said the total cost ranges on the order of a half-million dollars. Accuracy . Although scientists have proclaimed that this is the world's most stable clock, they do not yet know as much about its accuracy. This is a subtle but important difference: The ytterbium clock has demonstrated incredible stability of measurement -- it always measures a second in the same way -- but we do not yet know if what it is measuring is a ""true"" second. So, we'll have to wait to find out whether these clocks could be the most accurate in the world. More research is needed. It's a story we hear time and time again.

"(CNN) -- After a Boeing 747 Dreamlifter landed at a small airport in Wichita a couple of months ago -- the pilot having mistaken the runway for a much longer and wider one in a similar orientation at a nearby military base -- I made the prediction that it wasn't the last time we'd see such a blunder. I just didn't think it would happen again so soon. But on Sunday, a Southwest 737 crew mistook a runway at a small local airport in Hollister, Missouri, for the much larger runway at nearby, Branson Airport, and landed at the small strip by mistake. To make matters more hair-raising, the 737 touched down on a relatively short runway even for light planes, never mind for airliners. To their credit, the crew members of the Boeing jet got it stopped short of the end of the runway, where an embankment separated it from U.S. Highway 65, without doing any damage to passengers or the plane. The question arises: ""How did a professionally trained crew manage to screw up so badly?"" The answer is it's very easy to do. Take the accidental landing of a C-17 at a small Florida airport in 2012, for example. The crew's intended airport was MacDill Air Force Base, but it instead touched down the giant jet on the much, much shorter, 100-foot-wide runway a few miles away. Military personnel had to work for hours after the mix-up to lighten the airplane's load so it could take off from the short strip. The fact is that any pilot with a lot of experience who claims to have never at least lined up to land at a runway other than the intended one is probably fibbing. I've been flying everything from light propeller planes to big jets for more than 30 years, and I've aimed for the wrong runway three times and a really big taxiway on a different occasion. The problem is there are two distinct modes of operating an airplane, by reference to the instruments and by visual reference. With very, very few exceptions, every flight ends with the pilot turning off the autopilot (if it was engaged), taking physical command of the plane through the flight and power controls, ""acquiring"" the runway visually and landing. Sometimes that process happens in the last 10 seconds of a flight, sometimes in the last five minutes. It's that visual acquisition of the landing runway that's the trap. When pilots see what they believe is the right runway, they're going to land there unless some big alarm goes off in their head. It's simply human nature, and pilots are humans. They proceed to disregard the instruments and simply ""hand fly"" the airplane to a landing, that is if the co-pilot doesn't alert them to the flub. All the while the navigation instruments ""know"" the plane is headed to the wrong airport, but the pilots don't pay attention because in their mind they've already found the right runway, so why even bother to look at the instruments? Why don't more of these wrong airport episodes end in disaster? It's luck that most of them don't. Tragically, there are exceptions. In 2006, a regional jet took off from the wrong runway in Lexington, Kentucky. The runway was too short and the jet crashed, killing 49 people in the process. Landing at the wrong airport or choosing the wrong runway can be catastrophic. Had the 747 in Wichita tried landing on a runway as short as the one the much smaller 737 touched down on over the weekend, I don't think it could have stopped in time to avoid going off the end and at the very least wrecking the airplane.

"(CNN) -- Iranian officials said Sunday that the Middle Eastern nation will create a court focusing on ""media crimes,"" according to state-run media reports, a move that has fueled fears Tehran is further intensifying its crackdown on journalists. Abbas Zagholi, the head of Iran's Government Employees Court, said the new judicial branch ""was necessitated by the special media crimes,"" according to a report in Khabar, a conservative publication run by backers of parliamentary Speaker and Tehran Mayor Ali Larijani. ""For certain reasons, such as great developments in mass media, the Tehran prosecutor felt the need to create a more independent court to deal with media affairs,"" Zagholi said. Omid Memarian, a native Iranian and U.S.-based freelance journalist who said he talks regularly with journalists in Iran, said the new apparatus could spell greater attention, and prosecution, of those who don't mimic Tehranian government positions. ""The fear is that the media ... will be watched more intensely than in the past,"" said Memarian. ""They will have more money, more judges and more people to focus on the media and target journalists."" According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 34 journalists were detained at the end of last year in Iran -- tying it with China for the most imprisoned journalists of any country. They include Mohammad Davari, editor of the news website Saham News, who landed behind bars after reporting on detainees who were raped and tortured in Kahrizak Detention Center. Just last week, the advocacy group delivered a petition signed by 1,102 people to Iran's ambassador to the United Nations urging Iran to end what it called its ""unjustifiable crackdown"" on the media. Memarian said that, in the present system, journalists cannot publicize any information -- especially if it could be construed as critical -- unless it is from a government source or ran on a state-sponsored media outlet first. He himself was editor of a publication in Iran from 2003 through 2005, the same year that he won Human Rights Watch's Human Rights Defender Award. ""You cannot criticize government policies ... If somebody says something inappropriate, you cannot report that,"" said Memarian, whose work has appeared on the website Huffington Post, in the Los Angeles Times and elsewhere. ""The government has an official narrative (and) no one can challenge that."" Currently, cases involving journalists are tried in Iran's Government Employees Court. But Zagholi told Khabar that the explosion of mass media, including the Internet and satellite communications, prompted the judicial system change. Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran's chief prosecutor, said ""cultural and media crimes"" will be addressed exclusively in the new court ""so that they can be dealt with by specialists,"" according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. ""The intention is not to replace the country's cultural organizations with this court,"" Dolatabadi said. The new media court will likely start on or around March, Al Akbar Kasaian, secretary of Iran's supervising media board, told the semiofficial Fars News Agency. Zhagoli predicted its judges will do a ""great job (to) protect the rights of those working the media and will bring about judicial justice."" ""It is now much easier for people to connect with each other and, therefore, certain new crimes are being committed that cannot be overlooked,"" he added, according to a translation of his remarks from Khabar. Sunday's announcement comes days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The head of Iran's National Security Council and other Iranian authorities had lauded this development, comparing ""the Egyptian Revolution with the victory of Iran's Islamic Revolution,"" according to Iran's state-run media. But while publicly praising the Egyptian revolution, the Iranian government has rounded up activists after Iran's two leading opposition figures called for a rally Monday in support of the uprising in Egypt. On Saturday, Iranian authorities had blocked key internet searches in an apparent effort to obstruct access to sites touting the rally, according to an opposition website and two Tehran residents. Iranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold a rally. Revolutionary Guard Cmdr. Hossein Hamedani told the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency, ""We definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies, and we will confront them with force."" The White House says such threats to stifle dissent and mass communication suggest that Iran's government is not willing to let its people voice their views and embrace freedom. ""They are scared,"" press secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday, hours after Mubarak stepped down. ""That's why they threatened to kill anybody that tries to do this. That's why they have shut off all measure of communication."" Even with restrictions on journalists, Memarian said many Iranians have been able to track recent developments in Egypt and elsewhere in forums beyond state-run media, including watching news reports from international media and viewing stories online. He said independent journalists still exist within Iran, even after a massive crackdown following popular unrest after the 2009 elections. Their accounts may become important if, as he predicts, opposition forces find renewed strength and voice their views publicly in the coming days. ""We challenge the narrative of the government,"" Memarian said, noting that reports get out funneled through journalists like himself and posted online more anonymously. ""They do their role, even if they don't go public in that role.""","Iranian officials say a new special court will focus on ""media crimes,"" state media say .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of San Diego's goodbye concludes Friday at 5 p.m., when his resignation -- submitted last week after a string of women accused him of sexual impropriety and boorish behavior -- becomes effective. A spokeswoman for Bob Filner did not immediately return a call, and the city website -- still showing his photograph -- did not outline what he planned to do on his final day at the helm of the country's eighth-largest city, which has 1.38 million residents. But attorney Gloria Allred, who represents several of his 19 accusers, held a news conference with ""some of his victims."" ""San Diegans will finally be free of Bob Filner and all the shame that he has brought to the city,"" Allred told reporters. ""This is a day for celebration and a day for congratulation."" The former nine-term Democratic congressman began what was to have been a four-year term last December, but resigned last week as the accusations grew. An apology and promise to seek help, delivered on July 11, failed to save his job. ""I have diminished the office to which you elected me,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""I have reached into my heart and soul and realized I must and will change my behavior. As someone who has spent a lifetime fighting for equality for all people, I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them."" He added, ""I am also humbled to admit that I need help. I have begun to work with professionals to make changes in my behavior and approach."" Opinion: No room for lecherous mayors . But the City Council accepted his resignation on August 23 in a 7-0 vote, after which the 70-year-old mayor offered a ""deep apology."" ""The city should not have been put through this,"" he said. ""And my own personal failures were responsible."" Still, he insisted, he had ""never sexually harassed anyone."" While he was ""trying to establish personal relationships,"" the mayor said, ""the combination of awkwardness and hubris, I think, led to behavior that many found offensive."" He added: ""Not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court."" ""But the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob,"" Filner said. Politicians and the news media had ""unleashed a monster,"" and the resulting ""hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo."" City Council President Todd Gloria, a fellow Democrat who had called on Filner to resign, is to serve as interim mayor, and a special election is scheduled for November 19. ""Obviously, the biggest deal is just to clean up City Hall,"" said Katie Keach, the incoming interim mayor's deputy chief of staff. He will also review all of the city's departments ""to find out what's working and what's not and what might have been hidden over the last nine months,"" she said. Gloria will work to ""restore some of the trust of San Diegans."" The city website, which displayed a smiling picture of Filner, ""will be switched around five today,"" she said. ""I know that IT is on it."" The agreement does not affect a lawsuit brought against Filner by Irene McCormack Jackson, Filner's former communications chief. Though she remains a municipal employee, Jackson left her job in July, when she sued the mayor, saying he had subjected women to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching. She has been offered her old job back, Keach said. The city's liability does not end with his departure. And Filner himself is hardly out of the woods. He faces one lawsuit, and a spokesman for the state attorney general said a criminal investigation is under way. Numerous public officials, including all nine City Council members and the state's two U.S. senators, had urged Filner to step down. So, too, did most locals, according to polls. Some of them voiced that view to City Council members last week. Others rose to support Filner. Scott Andrews said that ""everything but due process has occurred,"" while one woman called the political machinations ""a circus to get a good man out of office."" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Bob Filner's resignation becomes effective at 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET)

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Armed militants on motorcycles in southwest Pakistan ambushed and set ablaze a convoy of tankers contracted to NATO forces in Afghanistan on Sunday night, police said. The gunmen opened fire after forcing the convoy of eight oil tankers to stop in an area 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, police official Abdul Qadir said. The militants killed one of the truck's drivers and set the tankers on fire before they escaped, Qadir said. Fuel and supply trucks contracted to supply NATO have been left stranded in Pakistan by Islamabad's decision to block its two NATO supply routes to Afghanistan. Pakistan closed the routes to protest a NATO airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last month. The airstrike plunged Islamabad and Washington into one of their worst diplomatic crises ever. In a television interview on Sunday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said the blockade of Pakistan's NATO supply routes could continue for weeks until ""new rules of engagement"" were established with Washington. The blockade leaves stranded supply trucks vulnerable to militants in Pakistan who have increasingly targeted the convoys in an effort to undermine the NATO mission in Afghanistan. Sunday's attack was the second of its kind in four days. On Thursday, militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons attacked and destroyed more than 20 NATO-bound oil tankers just outside Quetta. Roughly 40% of supplies for NATO operations in Afghanistan traveled through Pakistan before the supply routes were shut down.","Gunmen on motorcycles force the convoy to stop and then open fire .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic sat out the doubles and saw his Serbian team fall 2-1 behind in the Davis Cup final Saturday as the Czech pair of Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek outplayed Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic in Belgrade. Berdych and Stepanek silenced the home crowd to win 6-2 6-4 7-6 in two hours and 12 minutes as the holders took a crucial advantage against Serbia, the 2010 champions. Serbia captain Bogdan Obradovic kept faith with Bozoljac and Zimonjic, who became the oldest man to play in a Davis Cup final at the age of 37, resisting the temptation to field ATP World Tour Finals winner Djokovic. The home pair had beaten the No.1 ranked Bryan brothers as Serbia beat the United States earlier this year, but failed to repeat that form against a formidable Czech pair. Berdych and the 34-year-old Stepanek, outstanding on the day, took their record to 14-1 in the Davis Cup and were only threatened in a tense third set, which went to a tiebreak. They eventually took it 7-4 to leave their fans celebrating wildly in the Belgrade Arena, with Berdych, who plays Djokovic in the first reverse singles Sunday, saying all the pressure was on the World No.2 with his team trailing. ""We just put all the pressure on them and we are in the best possible position after Saturday. I have nothing to lose. It's a huge challenge to play Novak on his own court,"" he told the official Davis Cup website. If Djokovic does level the scores at 2-2, Stepanek will face a deciding singles match against inexperienced World No 117 Dusan Lasovic. ""I have full belief in Tomas that he can do it tomorrow. He has a shot. Novak will be under pressure tomorrow,"" believed Stepanek. His captain Vladimir Safarik, standing in for the ill Jaroslav Navratil, was overjoyed by their victory. ""I am crying. These guys are unbelievable. Their record is amazing. We are 2-1 up and it's just one step tomorrow,"" he added. Serbia have been weakened by the loss of key players Janko Tipsarevic, through injury and Viktor Troicki, who is serving a reduced one-year doping ban, but Djokovic, unbeaten in 23 matches since the U.S. Open, will be favorite to level the tie Sunday then hope Lasovic can pull off an upset.","Czech Republic take 2-1 lead in Davis Cup final in Belgrade .

"(CNN) -- One of Mexico's most important seaports is now under the control of the military in a show of force as the government fights corruption and drug cartel violence. The port of Lazaro Cardenas lies on the country's Pacific coast, in the troubled state of Michoacan. While violence has tapered off in some parts of Mexico, Michoacan continues to be a hot spot of violence between cartels and, more recently, vigilante groups. The Mexican navy, army, federal police and attorney general's office swept into both the port and city of Lazaro Cardenas on Monday, relieving local law enforcement of its duties, a government spokesman said. The objective of the operation is to ""strengthen the rule of law, as well as the legality of the daily commercial activities of the port,"" government spokesman Eduardo Sanchez said. The use of the military is notable because it is strikingly similar to the approach favored by the previous administration. President Enrique Pena Nieto has been critical of his predecessor's military approach to combat crime, but his own drug strategy keeps many aspects the same. The Knights Templar cartel has long terrorized residents of Michoacan as it expanded its activities from methamphetamine production to extortion. The cartel has been known to go on the offensive against police. In one series of attacks this summer, 22 people were killed. Given the violence in Michoacan, Pena Nieto has had little choice but to follow the strategy of former President Felipe Calderon, said George W. Grayson, a professor of government at the College of William & Mary and expert on drug cartels. A number of factors have made Lazaro Cardenas an attractive port for smuggling. For one, many of the young men who worked for the port and found themselves unemployed during the recession became prime recruits for the cartels, Grayson said. A selling point for legitimate commerce -- that the port is in a central location -- also attracted smugglers, he added. Corruption has grown to the point that Michoacan became a ""sewer of corruption and violence,"" Grayson said. According to Sanchez, the navy will be in charge of the port, and the army will provide protection on the city's streets, with the aid of federal police. The problem's facing the port and city are not limited to criminal groups. As the military moved in, the city's entire police was disarmed and detained, Sanchez said. The officers will all be evaluated. All of the public servants who oversee the port will be gradually replaced, he said, in order to ""prevent collusion by and between officials.""

"(CNN) -- In a defeat for the Obama administration over executive privilege, a federal judge has ordered the release of a secret government document dealing with foreign aid that President Barack Obama has refused to make public. U.S. District Judge Ellen Huvelle, in a ruling dated Tuesday, rejected as ""troubling"" the sweeping White House contention that a single unclassified directive was within the so-called presidential communications privilege. ""The government appears to adopt the cavalier attitude that the President should be permitted to convey orders throughout the Executive Branch without public oversight -- to engage in what is in effect governance by 'secret law,'"" the Huvelle said. ""Such a position conflicts with the very purpose"" of the Freedom of Information Act. The ruling stemmed from a court challenge, citing FOIA, filed by the non-profit Center for Effective Government. Executive privilege is a claim made by the President or other executive branch officials when refusing to give Congress, courts, or private parties certain information, including records and testimony. National security, pending appointments, and internal advice given to the President by aides are areas where such a privilege is often invoked. There was no immediate reaction from the White House, which can appeal.","A federal judge in Washington ordered the release of a document on foreign aid .

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- They're cramped, loud and seem to care little about the rules of the road -- more than just a mode of transportation, riding a ""tro-tro"" is an experience of its own, a roller coaster ride that any self-respecting visitor to Accra should check off their list. The crammed, hot and often rickety minivans, also called ""troskies,"" are the most popular way of getting around in the Ghanaian capital. They can be picked up from a station or by the roadside and they typically seat around 15 squished passengers, sometimes even more, as they swerve, zigzag and rush through Accra's busy streets. Read this: Forget Paris, fall in love with Accra . But while tro-tro rides might not be the ideal travel option for the claustrophobic, they're certainly more appealing to anyone looking to navigate the city cheaply. Just like ""matatus"" in East Africa, and many other similar means of transport in urban centers across the continent, tro-tros fill the public demand for affordable trips -- the fee a tro-tro ride around Accra is never more than a few cents, paid before or on arrival. ""If you really want to get to know a city, don't take a taxi -- take a tro-tro,"" says Accra commuter Maximillian Effah. So how does the tro-tro system work and what can you expect once you catch a ride? Tro-tros might have set routes but in the absence of a fixed schedule -- the vans depart only once they're full -- waiting times can be lengthy. Boarding the right one can also be confusing, especially if you're picking it up from the roadside. Read this: Artists take epic Africa road trip . In those cases, what's needed is a mixture of cunning and alertness, coupled with determination and some insider knowledge. As the tro-tro approaches, the fare collector, or ""mate,"" hangs out the right side door, shouting the destination and making a sign to indicate the van's direction. You do the same and, with a little a bit of luck, the driver stops so you can hop on. Sometimes, however, securing a spot requires a more physical approach. ""When you have a situation with 10, 15, up to 20 people trying to enter the same door at the same time, that's when you see the magic happening,"" says Effah. ""People opening up the top of the car, sliding in the side screen and then jumping into the car. Then you'll see the car start to move with someone halfway in the car, with their legs dangling outside of the car, and that is just crazy!"" Once en route, forget about seat belts or spacious seating; you can expect, however, a bumpy ride that's often made easier by the inevitable mix of shared laughs, heated debates and social commentary -- as well as a bit of singing. ""The driver of the tro-tro was singing the entire time, it could actually be that his part-time job was in the choir because he was singing a lot of hymns,"" recalls Accra commuter Francis Kweku Ansah of one memorable journey. ""He was really entertaining for everyone in the car -- people started singing along and it was actually a really fun journey for me."" ""Trotro Diaries"" At least four million people live in and around Accra, making it one of Africa's largest cities. Its infrastructure is like many other African urban centers: aged from the colonial era and unable to keep up with the demands of a burgeoning population. As more Ghanaians jump behind the wheel -- thanks to a growing middle class and cheaper imports from overseas -- the city's streets are often clogged with snail-paced traffic. Read this: Africa's new skyscraper cities . ""You have an experience where you sit in a tro-tro tightly packed and it's just before work so you can imagine the kind of pressure it puts on you,"" says Yaw Odoom, the creator of Trotro Diaries, an online platform where people share their often-funny stories about their daily transport woes. ""We realized people go through so much stress to get to their offices, which might affect their output,"" says Odoom. ""We put a bit of humor in there, where people in different tro-tros all over Ghana and even in other parts of the world share their experience. Now what this will do is it will help to lighten their mood, so when they get to the office they actually get there in a happier mood and be able to deliver."" Encouraged by friends, Odoom, a 27-year-old business development manager at an automotive company, created a blog and a Facebook group and today more than 1,000 people use the Trotro Diaries platform to sound off. ""Aah, I really hate it when people are in singing in (the) troskie,"" reads one comment. ""I'm like, this is not your car, dude!"" ""She has been talking for about 30 minutes non-stop!"" says another Trotro Diaries user. ""I guess the radio stations need her talent!"" Odoom says he now plans to also create a Trotro Diaries app that will also serve to help commuters find their way easier around the city. He believes that creating information networks for Ghanaians on-the-go, as well as making them laugh with each other, can have a positive impact. ""(The future of Ghana is) in the hands of the youth and we're already taking it,"" he says. ""We are crazy for change and we want to put that change into Ghana because Ghana is for all of us and we need to make things work.""

"Dubai, UAE (CNN) -- Many of the pilots assembled at the Dubai Airshow can boast breaking the sound barrier, but only one man in the world can say he's done it both in the sky and on the ground. That privilege belongs to former fighter jet pilot Royal Air Force (RAF) Wing Commander Andy Green. As the driver of Thrust SSC -- the fastest car on the planet -- he broke the sound barrier in 1997 with a world land speed record of 763mph. Despite the roar of the display jets passing overhead, he remains focused on more terrestrial matters: the quest to drive a car over 1,000 mph with The Bloodhound Project. ""As with everything I do in life, being able to do difficult things and do them well is hugely satisfying,"" he says from the roof of the Eurofighter chalet at the event. Read more: The Bloodhound that wants to run at 1,000mph . With a name that could be a code word for a covert Second World War operation (it's actually named after a missile), The Bloodhound Project has plenty of challenges up ahead. ""Basically we're trying to do what no one has done before,"" he says. ""I've got five supersonic runs, which is five more than anybody else. That gives me a unique perspective on the challenges facing the new car and how we're going to take it a lot further."" The design of the car took years to perfect and while it still generally resembles a rocket on wheels, there are plenty of things that make it much more than just a fighter jet without the wings; one of the biggest challenges is dealing with the shockwaves caused by the wheels traveling at such high speeds. Something that the car does have directly in common with a fighter jet is the engine. It uses an EJ200 engine normally found on a Eurofighter Typhoon jet. It was one of the test-and-development engines donated by Eurofighter. It's as close as Green gets to a jet engine these days; the 51-year-old flew missions over Bosnia and Iraq and was in charge of running the RAF's air campaign missions over Libya in 2011. During that campaign he says that the success rate of the engine was 97%, which means he has no concerns about sitting in front of one and hurtling across the ground at previously unimaginable speeds. Read more: 15 ways drones will change your life . Thrilling though it may be for Green, the greater aim of the Bloodhound Project is to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists. The project is clearly quite attractive to the British scientific community as well, as it's backed by the British government's engineering and sciences agency, universities, the armed forces and a number of other organizations. In order to garner as much interest in science and engineering as possible, the project is mostly open-source (some technical points about engine performance are withheld). It also aims to broadcast the test runs and record attempts live. ""That's almost as big a challenge as getting a car over 1,000 mph,"" says Green. With a chassis built, the aim is to roll out the vehicle for its first tests at the Aerohub in Newquay, southwest England. If everything goes well, the car will be transported to the Hakskeen desert in South Africa where Green and the team will test the vehicle and push it past the speed of sound. ""The idea is to then go back in 2016 and get it above 1,000mph."" It took three years to clear a 12-mile stretch of desert to make a test-run-ready track -- an enormous undertaking that perhaps reflects the ambitions of the project itself. Green was finally given the green light this month. Ironically, the fastest man on earth doesn't have much time to actually sit back and appreciate the experience. ""[When driving], the ground is terribly close, going past terribly fast, and that's just one of those background things where you have to say, 'Yup, that should be a mind-blowing sensation.' But I can't afford for it to be, I have to concentrate on doing my job.""","In 1997, Andy Green and broke the world land speed record driving the Thrust SSC .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain has won a major victory in its long court battle with a Florida-based deep-sea salvage company over rights to an estimated $500 million in silver and gold coins, officials said Wednesday. The treasure was recovered in 2007 from a 19th century sunken ship off the Spanish coast. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Tuesday turned aside another motion from the U.S.-based company, Odyssey Marine Exploration, and Spanish officials said they now expect the coins -- nearly 600,000 of them -- to arrive in Spain soon. ""With the ruling by the appeals court, the process begins to recover all of the coins taken illegally"" from the sunken ship, Spain's Culture Ministry said in a statement. Odyssey, which can still appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, said in a statement, ""Currently, no final order has been issued in the case and it would be premature to comment at this time."" The battle royal began after Odyssey announced in 2007 it had found the sunken treasure. It quickly laid claim to the coins, put them in crates and said it flew them to a discreet, well-guarded location in the United States. Spain soon filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure. Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The Mercedes, a 34-gun frigate, left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes exploded after being hit in its power magazine, according to the Spanish government's filing to the Florida court. The federal court in Tampa in 2009 ruled in favor of Spain's claim to the treasure, but Odyssey took the case to the federal appeals court in Atlanta, which ruled last September to uphold the lower court's ruling. At the end of that 53-page ruling, the three-judge appeals panel wrote, ""For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not err when it ordered Odyssey to release the recovered"" items to the custody of Spain, according to a copy of the order viewed by CNN. Since then, Odyssey has filed various motions at the appeals court to overturn or delay the ruling, said James Goold, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who is representing Spain in the case. But on Tuesday, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, the court's chief deputy clerk, Amy Nerenberg, told CNN by phone from Atlanta. Goold, who spoke to CNN by phone from Washington, said it appears that Odyssey's only possible appeal now would be to the U.S. Supreme Court. That court agrees to hear only a tiny portion of the cases presented to it. The appeals court is expected to send the case in the coming days back to the federal court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said. Spain believes that the main part of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in Florida, Goold said. Spain's Culture Minister, Jose Ignaico Wert, told CNN in Madrid on Wednesday that the case was never really about the money. ""We're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such,"" Wert said in an interview. He said the coins would be exhibited in Spanish museums. Peru has also followed this case. The silver and gold came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony. ""Formally, they haven't claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums,"" Wert said. The treasure includes a vast trove of coins, included fabled ""pieces of eight,"" some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials said at a 2008 news conference. The treasure already has crossed the Atlantic ocean twice -- by ship in 1804 and then by plane in the other direction just a few years ago. Spanish officials hope it might finally arrive now for the first time on the Spanish mainland.","The treasure is 600,000 silver and gold coins .

"(CNN) -- Those who know Curtis Reeves are stunned by news the former police captain is accused of fatally shooting a man after an argument over texting in a Wesley Chapel, Florida, movie theater. The Reeves they know is a friendly fellow, they told CNN affiliates. ""I thought it just can't be. He's just not that kind of person,"" said Elnora Brown, who told CNN affiliate WFTS she has been a Reeves family friend for 45 years. Brown described Reeves as a good Christian and loving grandfather. ""I can't imagine what happened that he would do that,"" she told the station. Bill Costas told CNN affiliate WFLA that the man described in news reports sounds like ""a completely different guy"" from the neighbor he has known for years. Reeves was a ""very nice guy, always smiling. I've never seen him angry,"" Costas said. ""Very helpful. If I needed help with something, he was there to help."" The 71-year-old was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the Monday shooting of Chad Oulson, 43, who was at the theater to watch ""Lone Survivor"" with his wife. Oulson's wife, Nicole, was shot in the hand as she tried to defend her husband, according to reports. The 6-foot-1, 270-pound Reeves also was with his wife for the Monday matinee, and after arguing with Oulson about him texting his daughter, left the theater apparently to complain to management, police said. A witness said Reeves returned ""irritated,"" the argument continued and popcorn was thrown. Reeves then shot Oulson, sat down and put the gun in his lap, the witness said. ""The defendant advised that the victim turned and stood up, striking him in the face with an unknown object,"" a police report said. ""The defendant advised that he removed the .380-semi-auto handgun from his pants pocket, firing one round, striking the victim, and that he was in fear of being attacked."" Reeves appeared Tuesday before Circuit Judge Lynn Tepper in Pasco County via video conference, standing at a podium wearing an olive-colored padded vest and handcuffs. Appearing dejected, he spoke only when questioned and made no statement about his actions. A sensational crime that strikes many chords . Defense attorney Richard Escobar told the court that Reeves has close ties to the community, posed no danger to residents and was no threat to flee. A standing-room-only crowd in the courtroom included many friends, family members and colleagues who stood ready to tell the court that Reeves had no propensity for violence and was a man of ""great character,"" Escobar said. Tepper was unswayed. She ruled that Reeves be held without bond and remanded him to custody. Later, outside the courtroom, Escobar told reporters his client was ""heartbroken"" that a life was lost in the Monday theater incident. Reeves served in the Navy and the Navy Reserves and joined the Tampa Police Department in 1966, where he was a commander for 16 to 17 years and also held posts as a homicide detective, property crimes detective and instructor, Escobar told the judge. Reeves retired in 1993 as a captain with the Tampa Police Department, according to documents from his tenure as a Tampa police officer. Tampa police told CNN that Reeves was instrumental in establishing the department's first tactical response team. Throughout his career as a Tampa police officer, he consistently got solid evaluations praising his work ethic and leadership. His file contained many letters praising his interaction with the community, driving record and problem-solving skills, according to more than 350 pages of documents provided by the Tampa Police Department. ""Capt. Reeves is highly adept at recognizing potential problems and utilizing available information to achieve positive results. He is frequently called upon to develop and implement department-wide programs concerning firearms and civil disorder,"" a 1992 evaluation states. He also worked on several high-profile security details, including those of presidential candidate Ross Perot, Vice President Dan Quayle, President Ronald Reagan, Vice President George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who was president-elect at the time. Among the rare negative remarks about his performance were two from earlier in his career. In 1971, his supervisors demanded a ""marked improvement"" after he demonstrated a ""get-by attitude"" and told bosses of his shortcomings, ""I just goofed."" Years later, a 1979 evaluation cited problems with his temperament. ""His demeanor is generally very professional. He has, however, occasionally allowed his temper to detrimentally affect his manner of dealing with his supervisors,"" the evaluation states. After his retirement, Reeves served as director of security for Busch Gardens Tampa until 2005, said spokesman Travis Claytor, who would not comment on why Reeves' employment came to an end. A hunter who has held licenses in Georgia and Ohio, Reeves moved in 2005 to Brooksville, Florida -- in Hernando County, adjacent to the county where the theater is located -- and WFLA reports he served as president of the county Crime Stoppers program from 2006 to 2007. Reeves is a Jacksonville native who moved to Tampa as a child, Escobar told the court. He suffers from numerous ailments, including arthritis, bursitis, hypertension, high cholesterol and low oxygen levels in his blood. He has been married to his wife, Vivian, since 1967 and has two children, Jennifer and Matthew, both in their 30s, and one grandchild, Escobar said. According to CNN affillate WTSP, Reeves' son, Matthew, is a Tampa patrol officer with more than a decade of service.

"(CNN) -- More French troops are on their way to the Central African Republic ahead of a United Nations Security Council vote on peacekeepers for the nation ravaged by persistent violence, sources in the African Union mission to the Central African Republic told CNN on Wednesday. The additional troops are coming through Cameroon while military supplies have already been flown into Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, the sources said. Late last month, France pledged to send 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 already there. The current troops in the nation, it says, are there in a noncombat mission to protect French nationals and help secure the airport in the capital. An African Union force is already in the nation. The U.N. has suggested its peacekeeping force should eventually augment the African-led mission. That potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel, the U.N. says. A vote should take place this week, officials have indicated. France to send 1,000 more troops to Central African Republic . Former leader Gen.

"(CNN) -- The unsavory issue of racism in Italian football could be tested like never before following the news that former Netherlands international Clarence Seedorf is to take charge of AC Milan. Even though Milan has yet to formally confirm his appointment, the 37-year-old is in line to become the first black manager in Serie A in nearly two decades. The last black coach to guide a leading Italian side was Brazilian Jarbas 'Cane' Faustinho, who took joint control of Napoli in the 1994-95 season alongside Vujadin Boskov. Seedorf announced his appointment at a news conference in Brazil while simultaneously retiring as a player following a stellar career -- with Rio de Janeiro's Botafogo proving to be the well-traveled midfielder's last club. ""All the experience I have gained in this year and a half at Botafogo is going to help me in my next venture, which will be as coach of Milan,"" Seedorf told reporters in Brazil on Tuesday. He takes the Milan job despite boasting no previous coaching experience. The former Real Madrid and Ajax Amsterdam star's agent said a two-and-a-half-year contract has been signed to replace Massimiliano Allegri, who was fired on Monday following a dismal run of results. At the halfway stage of the Serie A season, the seven-time European champions stand eleventh in the table -- six points off the relegation zone and a worrying 30 behind league leaders Juventus. Seedorf, who won two Champions League and two Serie A titles with Milan as a player, must not only try to arrest the team's worrying slump but also run the potential gauntlet of racism in a country whose football has been plagued by it in recent times. In 2013 alone, leading sides Lazio, Roma and Inter were all sanctioned following racial abuse by their own supporters. The incident that attracted the biggest headlines came twelve months ago as Kevin-Prince Boateng led Milan in a walk-off after the Ghanaian international was subjected to racist abuse in a friendly against lower-tier side Pro Patria. Juventus president Andrea Agnelli recently told CNN that Italy was some 40 years behind a country such as England in terms of its attitude towards black people. However, Seedorf had more immediate challenges to wrestle with as he took a phone call from Milan chairman Silvio Berlusconi on Monday. ""The call came in the middle of the training session. Obviously, it's a place where I spent 10 years of my life and I have a very close relationship with the president so when he asked me I couldn't say no,"" explained the Dutchman, who said he pondered overnight the wrench of retiring from playing. ""After 22 years, it was a difficult night. But I am very satisfied with what I've done in my career."" The powerful midfielder made his debut for local side Ajax way back in 1992, prior to joining a host of Europe's top sides: Sampdoria, Real Madrid, Inter and Milan. During this time, he became the first man to win Champions League titles with three different clubs - triumphing with Ajax in 1995, Real in 1998 and Milan in both 2003 and 2007. In 2012, he left Milan to join Botafogo as the veteran Dutch international sampled football outside of Europe for the first time in his career -- going on to further embellish his trophy cabinet with a Rio league crown. His displays helped Botafogo qualify for the Copa Libertadores for the first time in 17 years, as one of Brazil's most famous clubs finally returned to form. SAN SIRO RETURN . On Tuesday, a man with over 400 appearances for the Rossoneri rejected the idea that he would find it difficult to lead players alongside whom he once lined up. ""Being in charge of former teammates won't cause a problem -- on the contrary, I know them,"" said a man chosen above former striker Filippo Inzaghi, with Milan's youth coach having been linked with the job. ""I am very happy to have this dream chance to go back."" The Surinam-born star had reportedly been working on his coaching badges while in Brazil and will need all his years of experience to turn around a club that has lost the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva and Seedorf himself in recent years. The trio were all part of Milan's last Scudetto, delivered by Allegri in his maiden season in charge in 2010-2011. Seedorf must now improve the 18-time Italian champions' chronic form, with the likes of Mario Balotelli, Kaka and Stephan El Shaarawy having won just five of their 19 league games this season. Next month, a man who once dominated the Champions League on the pitch must negotiate his first match in charge as Milan meet high-flying Spaniards Atletico Madrid in the Round of 16.","Veteran international ends playing career to take charge of Milan .

"(CNN) -- California Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Donnelly took to CNN's Spanish-language airwaves recently to deny accusations that a campaign ad he shot with Cuban-Venezuelan actress Maria Conchita Alonso is racist. The candidate, who is also a state assemblyman, touted his Filipina wife as evidence that he's not prejudiced. ""If I am a racist, I'm not a very good one,"" Donnelly said Thursday on CNN en EspaÃ±ol's ""Directo USA"" show. ""I must have gone to the wrong school where you learn how to be a racist because I married a woman with dark skin. As a matter of fact, her skin's darker than Maria Conchita's."" Alonso agreed, saying, ""Tim is married to a Filipina. His daughter-in-law is Mexican. He is not a racist and neither am I, as we are now being accused."" The three-minute video, released January 13 on YouTube, has come under fire by some Latinos and Latino groups. In the video, Alonso cradles a small, sweater-clad lapdog she calls Tequila as she translates, and oftentimes reinterprets, Donnelly's views on a wide range of issues. At one point, Alonso makes a somewhat crude allusion to Donnelly's boldness. In the ad, Donnelly says, ""I want a gun in every Californians gun safe. I want the government out of our business and our bedroom. I want to bring the film industry back where she belongs, Hollywood."" To which Alonso responds, ""Los tiene bien grandes y esta enojado"" meaning, ""He has really big ones, and he's angry."" The candidate said the exchanges are meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but to some Latinos, who have taken to Twitter to express their outrage, the spot comes across as bizarre and ridiculous and as a stereotypical attempt to connect with Latino voters. Alonso, in particular, has drawn sharp criticism for endorsing a Tea Party favorite and immigration hard liner who in 2011 tried to gather enough signatures to repeal California's so-called Dream Act, a law that allows undocumented college students to use state financial aid programs. Donnelly also founded a local chapter in 2005 of the armed civilian border patrol group The Minutemen. In a series of tweets, Mexican-American cartoonist and immigration activist Lalo Alcaraz called Alonso a vulgar Spanish term for idiot or stupid. Tony Hernandez, co-founder and producer for the Immigrant Archive Project, an independent initiative dedicated to preserving the life stories of America's immigrant population, tweeted that he was shocked to see the Latina actress supporting the perceived anti-immigrant gubernatorial candidate. Over the weekend, the 56-year-old former beauty queen turned telenovela and Hollywood star said the resulting fallout forced her to resign from a San Francisco production of ""The Vagina Monologues."" ""Of course she has the right to say whatever she wants,"" producer Eliana Lopez told local CBS affiliate KPIX. ""But ... doing what she is doing is against what we believe."" Alonso, however, said on ""Directo USA"" that she firmly stands by her decision to support Donnelly for two reasons: Donnelly's proposed plan to create more jobs and his desire to raise the minimum wage to $20 an hour, something the candidate has said he would do by unleashing California's natural resources. ""We ought to be fracking and drilling our way to prosperity rather than sitting on an ocean of oil and importing it from our enemies,"" Donnelly told ""Directo USA"" anchor Juan Carlos Lopez, noting what occurred in North Dakota. In that state, McDonald's restaurants offered employees about $15 an hour, plus signing bonuses after the discovery of the Parshall Oil Field in 2006, which boosted the economy and led to a labor shortage. As to Donnelly's stance on immigration, Alonso offers a few explanations. ""After 9/11, he told me that he organized a group of civilians to go protect the border from the invasion, not of Mexicans,"" Alonso said. ""A lot of Arabs and drugs enter through the Mexican border, so what he did was protect us from the people who wanted to come attack us."" Alonso also said Donnelly ""today supports the idea of helping immigrant children who came to the U.S. at the age of 3 or 5 with their college education."" However, Donnelly said in the ""Directo USA"" interview that the Dream Act ""is an open-ended entitlement that will invite and incentive more people to come here illegally. ... I'm not upset at people for coming here. I'm mad at my government for inviting people to come the most dangerous way possible and putting their lives at risk."" A spokesman for California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown dismissed Donnelly's campaign ad. ""What this video lacks in terms of logic and sanity, they make up for it in pure entertainment value,"" said Dan Newman, a political strategist and adviser to Brown. Even some fellow Republicans have taken issue with Donnelly's latest spot. In a statement, CafÃ© Con Leche Republicans, a Latino group, said the ad is so bad it's almost laughable. And, the group said, rather than appeal to Hispanics, the ad insults their intelligence. ""Maria Conchita Alonso is no doubt a great actress, but as we've seen time and time again, movie stars often lack common sense,"" the group said in a release. The actress is known to be politically provocative. She is an outspoken critic of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and of deceased Venezuelan President Hugo ChÃ¡vez, whom she once described as a Hitler-like dictator and upon his death said she was not sad about his departure but that ""ideally he would be alive with cancer, in jail."" But this endorsement surprised many people, leading some to wonder whether she was paid to support Donnelly. The actress said she was not. The pair has found some support on social media, where some people have tweeted that Alonso should not be attacked but should be free to exercise her First Amendment right to free speech. However, the overwhelming sense among Latinos appears to be that invoking ethnic stereotypes and vehemently opposing immigration reform might not be the best strategy to win the governorship of a state where about 38% of its residents are Latino.","Cuban-Venezuelan actress Maria Conchita Alonso makes ad with candidate .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Here's a scary thought: There's a country where officials are suggesting that the visas of gay partners of U.S. diplomats be revoked and these individuals be put in jail -- not because the country recently outlawed same-sex relationships but to crack down on Americans. In that country, the government is also curtailing the privileges traditionally granted to U.S. consulate staff, taking down protective barricades in front of the U.S. consulate and snubbing U.S. diplomatic officers. Where do you suppose you'll find this anti-American backlash brewing? North Korea? Cuba? Iran? Surely, it must be a place where the citizens hate the United States. Perhaps it's a political adversary with which relations have never been particularly good. Nope. All this is happening in India, which has long been a good and dependable friend and ally to the United States, most recently during the war on terror. These are tense times in U.S.-India relations. And it's all because of how agents with the U.S. Marshals Service treated Devyani Khobragade when she was recently arrested and detained. The 39-year-old deputy counsel general of India was taken into custody in New York on December 12 after she dropped her daughter off at school, and she was charged with visa fraud for allegedly lying on the application that she filled out to get permission for her nanny to legally work in the United States. Court documents allege that she stated on the application that she was paying the nanny the minimum wage in New York -- $9.75 per hour, when she was really only paying her what worked out to be about $3.31 per hour. Even that part of the story is fuzzy. Imagine someone coming into your home and calculating what you're paying a housekeeper or nanny or gardener by the hour, when you're paying them a flat rate for the day. I know friends who have live-in nannies, and those baby sitters are essentially on-call around the clock. They're probably making less than minimum wage as well, but with room and board thrown in. Anyway, what happened next isn't being disputed by either side. Khobragade was put in a holding cell with other female detainees and strip-searched. She eventually posted bond, and she was released. She is now staying at India's Permanent Mission to the United Nations. The U.S. Marshals Service claims that a strip-search is standard operating procedure and that none of its policies were violated in this case. A spokesman says that Khobragade was treated just like anyone else. That's the problem. Khobragade is not just like anyone else. She is a diplomatic officer with limited immunity. She's in the United States representing a proud country filled with reserved and modest people, many of whom consider a strip-search to be, as one Indian official said, ""barbaric."" This is a country that in recent years has had good relations with the United States and where we have foreign officers stationed who we expect to be treated fairly and humanely. Besides, she is not a violent criminal or a terror suspect, and she doesn't appear to be a threat to public safety. If there is a labor law violation here, it would a civil crime, not a criminal offense. And if the U.S. government is going to throw the book at people who mistreat workers, I could -- as someone who writes about the immigration issue -- provide dozens of names of U.S. citizens, from farmers to soccer moms, who belong in a lineup. Lying on a visa application is no small matter, but we're still not sure that is what happened given how wages are sometimes arrived at. Either way, it does seem that U.S. marshals might have overreacted in this case. Like other law enforcement officers, many federal agents already get what is referred to as cultural sensitivity training. But, it turns out, what they really need is a crash course in International Relations 101. The Indian government is incensed, and it has a right to be. There are questions about the procedure that agents followed in this case, and they need to be answered. Those policies need to be reviewed. Indian officials also want an apology, and they should get one. Secretary of State John Kerry should deliver it himself, going beyond what the State Department said in a statement is Kerry's ""regret"" over the incident. Questions of Khobragade's guilt or innocence can wait for another day. Yet, decency and common sense can be dealt with now. Those things tell us something went wrong in this case. It's up to the Obama administration to make it right before this diplomatic crisis gets any bigger. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","India is retaliating against the U.S. over treatment of consular official who was strip-searched .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people have been evacuated from China's resort city of Sanya, in Hainan Province, as Typhoon Haiyan continued to wreak havoc in south Asia Monday morning. The storm, which has already claimed up to 10,000 lives in the Philippines, moved through the South China Sea over the weekend toward southern China, hitting Vietnam. Government agencies have advised for extra vigilance if traveling to Vietnam or China, with the storm expected to continue for the next few days, moving northeast into Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China. Philippines recovery . Flights and airports have started to reopen in the Philippines. ""All airports except Tacloban have resumed normal operations already,"" tweeted the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. The airport at Tacloban, the most badly affected town in the Philippines, has started to receive and send limited commercial flights too, according to the CAA. The storm, a category five as it moved over the Philippines with gusts of up to 235 miles per hour, shut down at least a dozen airports and hundreds of flights, crippling the travel industry in the central part of the country. China and Vietnam prepare . It is not expected to affect Vietnam or China as badly, though preparations are underway to limit damage as what is now a category one storm arrives. Some 17,300 passengers have been affected by canceled or delayed flights at Sanya Phoenix Airport in Sanya on the resort island of Hainan in southern China, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Thousands more have been evacuated, the agency said. But the airport has stated that by the end of Monday, November 11, all stranded fliers will have departed. In Vietnam, flights were canceled in the central region around Thua Thien in Hue Province yesterday, while 86 domestic flights from Vietnam Airlines, VietJet Air and Jetstar Pacific to at least 10 central airports were canceled, according to local news reports. All international flights to the affected region were also canceled. Typhoon Haiyan . Referred to locally as Typhoon Yolanda, the monster storm is one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded. Some of the Philippine's most popular islands for tourists, including Boracay and Bohol, were in the storm's projected path, and tourists and residents were evacuated. A number of governments warned against travel to certain areas of the Philippines because of the typhoon, including Britain, Australia and Canada. The U.S. Embassy in Manila issued an emergency message to U.S. citizens, advising them to monitor the storm on TV, radio or websites including PAGASA (the government's weather forecasting agency) or the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Undersecretary Abigail Valte, deputy presidential spokeswoman in the Philippines, had this advice: ""Follow instructions of the local authorities especially when they give the signal to evacuate to higher ground/designated evacuation areas. ""Limit unnecessary travel and stay inside your hotel. Weather updates and advisories are constantly disseminated by @dost_pagasa."" The Official Gazette posted a list of emergency hotlines. Twitter hashtags #RescuePH and #ReliefPH were set up to share information or tweet calls for help. A number of government agencies were also active on Twitter: @dswdserves, @ndrrmc_opcen and @govph.

"(CNN) -- Days after Russia and the United States reached a deal on getting Syria to give up its chemical weapons, world powers are quarreling over the details. The agreement, reached by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry over the weekend, calls for a U.N. resolution demanding that Syria turn over its chemical weapons to international control in a specific time frame. Russia won't support any resolution that would authorize the use of force against Syria if it doesn't comply, Lavrov said Tuesday. But the United States and France want to keep the threat of force on the table if Syria doesn't comply. Those allies say they are convinced that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime was behind a chemical weapons attack in opposition areas that, according to U.S. estimates, killed more than 1,400 people. Representatives of those three powers and the two other veto-wielding permanent Security Council members met behind closed doors at the United Nations on Tuesday to hammer out a draft resolution, a meeting a U.N. diplomat called ""constructive."" ""For the first time there was a discussion of the actual text,"" said the diplomat, who didn't want to be named discussing ongoing private negotiations. ""There are well-known different views on some of the elements, but we are trying to resolve those issues."" The meetings were likely to resume Wednesday, the diplomat said. U.N. weapons inspectors reported Monday that an August 21 attack outside Damascus had been carried out using the nerve gas sarin. Tuesday, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the findings should spur member states to bring the bloodshed in Syria to a halt, urging both Washington and Moscow to ""demonstrate their leadership."" ""Let us be clear: the use of chemical weapons in Syria is only the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""The suffering in Syria must end."" Though the inspectors did not assign blame for the attack, a U.S. analysis of their report shows the Syrian regime was responsible for the August 21 massacre outside Damascus, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters in Washington. ""Based on our preliminary review of information contained in the report, several crucial details confirm the Assad regime's guilt in carrying out this attack,"" she said. One of the munitions identified in the report, a 120-millimeter improvised rocket, has been linked to previous attacks by the al-Assad regime, and ""we have no indications that the opposition has manufactured or used this style rocket."" In addition, the environmental, chemical, and medical samples collected by U.N. investigators ""provide clear and compelling evidence"" that the rockets used in the attack contained sarin gas, a nerve agent, she said. ""We know the regime possesses sarin; we have no evidence, however, that the opposition possesses sarin."" She added that the United States reserves the right to take military action. Though diplomacy is the preferred option, ""I don't want to predict what the end result will be,"" she said. Still, she was willing to predict that that end result would not include the status quo in Damascus. ""We don't see a future for Assad, a future in Syria that includes Assad,"" she said. International inspections of Syria's declared chemical weapons storage sites are to begin next month and all chemical weapons are to be eliminated by June 30, 2014, she said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius shared Psaki's view that the Syrian regime was responsible for the massacre. But, at the same news conference, Lavrov brushed aside a question about blame. He noted that the U.N. inspectors in Syria were not tasked with figuring out who was responsible and that that was not the point of the U.N. report. Russia has suggested Syrian rebels may have been behind the attack, though critics have said rebels did not have the means to unleash chemical weapons. A scathing report . Inspectors found ""clear and convincing evidence"" that the nerve agent sarin was delivered by surface-to-surface rockets ""on a relatively large scale"" in the August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb, Ban said Monday. ""It is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988,"" Ban said, referring to the chemical attack against Kurds in northern Iraq that killed thousands, mostly civilians, ""and the worst use of weapons of mass destruction in the 21st century,"" Ban said. ""The international community has a responsibility to ensure that chemical weapons never re-emerge as an instrument of warfare."" But on Tuesday, Ban said it was ""for others to decide whether to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility and accountability."" The diplomatic quarrel over just who may have been responsible for the chemical weapons attack came as the toll from conventional weapons continued to mount.

"New York (CNN) -- A guitar once owned by music legend Bob Dylan sold for $965,000 Friday at Christie's, setting a new world auction record for any guitar, according to a statement from the auction house. The 1964 Fender Stratocaster was purchased by an unidentified bidder, said a Christie's spokesperson. Dylan, now 72, played the electric guitar in his famous performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, during which he was backed by an electric band for the first time, according to the statement. He was 24 years, and on the road to establishing himself as a music icon, the statement said. ""A tremendous amount of international interest was generated at the time of the sale's announcement, and today's result justifies the mythic status of this guitar in the annals of music history,"" said Tom Lecky, Christie's specialist and the sale's auctioneer. Along with the guitar and original Fender case, newly discovered song lyrics by Dylan were also auctioned, according to Christie's. The items were left behind on a private plane months after the 1965 performance. In 2011, the daughter of the plane's pilot submitted the items to the PBS show ""History Detectives"" for authentication, according to the statement from Christie's. The selling price of the guitar almost doubled the estimated range of $300,000 to $500,000, according to Christie's. Previously, Eric Clapton's Fender ""Blackie"" held the record for a guitar sold at an auction, going for $959,500 in 2004, Christie's spokeswoman told CNN. A month after receiving France's most prestigious medal, the Legion d'honneur, Dylan is now being investigated in Paris on suspicion of inciting racial hatred, according to French prosecutors. The investigation was prompted by comments he made in Rolling Stone magazine in 2012.

"(CNN) -- If you live in the Northeast, there is a good chance you used a snowblower this weekend. Mounds of snow are piled throughout New York and New England after a blustery storm swept through, leaving behind more than a foot of snow in some areas. Albany, New York, got at least 12 inches, said one iReporter. ""We usually get these big snow storms in January and the snow on the ground usually stays until springtime since it's always cold here in Albany,"" Zeynep Rice said. ""Last year was a bit weak in snow until end of February actually. So we're happy to have a solid snow covering on the ground earlier than usual this season."" The storm spared major metropolitan areas like Boston and New York, but some areas in Maine and along the U.S.-Canada border saw significant snow, the National Weather Service said. The Maine cities of Biddeford (16.5 inches total) and Kennebunkport (14 inches) topped the list, while Exeter, New Hampshire, received 13.5 inches of snow over the weekend. The good news for New Englanders and New Yorkers was that the storm quickly moved out of the Northeast. Queens resident Lia Ocampo posted photos on CNN iReport showing a snow-covered subway platform at New York's Queensboro Plaza station Sunday morning. Ocampo told CNN she's braced for more snow and a colder Christmas than last year. ""We can't do anything about the weather,"" she said. ""Just bundle up, warm up with hot coffee, cocoa or tea and stay positive."" By Sunday afternoon, 350 flights into, out of, or within the United States were canceled, according to flightaware.com. Highway traffic may be treacherous, with the problem compounded by high winds. CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported that Massachusetts expects to use 10,000 tons of salt and 2,000 vehicles during the storm. Frank DePaola of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation told CNN that speed limits on major roads had been lowered to 45 mph. Those snowed in might watch the New England Patriots on TV -- they're in sunny Miami, facing the Dolphins on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- RIA Novosti, Russia's state-run news agency, reported on its own demise Monday after a decree by President Vladimir Putin created a new agency called Rossiya Segodnya. The new agency, whose name means ""Russia Today,"" combines RIA Novosti and state-owned Voice of Russia radio. According to the report, the move is ""the latest in a series of shifts in Russia's news landscape, which appears to point toward a tightening of state control in the already heavily regulated media sector."" RIA Novosti was founded in 1941, just after Nazi Germany invaded Russia, and has grown to a network of reporters in 45 countries and services in 14 languages. The Kremlin says the changes are necessary to save money and make state media more effective.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A co-founder of the Pinkberry yogurt chain was found guilty on Friday of beating a homeless man with a tire iron near downtown Los Angeles, prosecutors said. A jury deliberated a little more than one day and found Young Lee, 49, guilty of assault with a deadly weapon, said the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. ""The jury of six women and six men also found true the special allegation that the assault caused great bodily injury to the victim, who sustained a broken left forearm and several cuts to his head during the June 15, 2011, attack,"" the district attorney's office said in a statement. Lee faces up to seven years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for January 14. The victim, whose name wasn't released Friday, was panhandling on an off-ramp of U.S. Highway 101 near downtown when Lee thought the homeless man had disrespected him by exposing a sexually explicit tattoo, prosecutors said. Lee parked his car near the off ramp, gave chase and beat the victim on his head and arm, prosecutors said. Lee was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and carrying a loaded firearm in 2001.

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, Apple announced a pretty mind-boggling stat: The 25 billionth song had been downloaded on iTunes. That's billion. With a b. Since launching the iPod in 2001, and iTunes in 2003, Apple has been a leader in digital music, virtually defining the space for competitors like Amazon and Google. Here are five interesting facts about the milestone: . 1. Who did it? Phillip Lupke of Germany was the lucky downloader. For happening to click at the right nanosecond, he'll be getting a 10,000-Euro ($13,528) iTunes gift card. And it was no easy task. According to Apple, users download an average of 15,000 songs every minute. 2. What was the tune? You've probably never heard of it. Sorry. Hipster moment over. We hadn't heard of it either. ""Monkey Drums (Goksel Vancin Remix)"" was the jam in question. It's by Chase Buch, a British DJ and producer who's well known in the house-music scene. It's not so big on lyrics. Which is to say, it doesn't have any. And it probably comes across better when you're shaking it in a crowd of sweaty club kids than, say, sipping coffee and doing the New York Times crossword. 3. Other iTunes milestones . 25 millionth song -- ""Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"" Frank Sinatra, 2003 . 100 millionth -- ""Somersault (Danger Mouse remix),"" by English electronica band Zero 7, 2004 . 500 millionth -- ""Mississippi Girl,"" Faith Hill, 2005 . 1 billionth -- ""Speed of Sound,"" Coldplay, 2006 . 10 billionth -- ""Guess Things Happen That Way,"" Johnny Cash, 2010 . Alex Ostrovsky, from West Bloomfield, Michigan, was the luckiest of downloaders. For the billionth download, he scored a 20-inch iMac, 10 fifth-generation iPods and a $10,000 gift card, not to mention a scholarship set up by Apple at the Julliard School of Music in his name. 4. 25 billion is a lot . Obvious, right? But how much is it? Well, it's roughly equal to three-and-a-half songs for every person on Earth. By way of comparison, the Guiness Book of World Records lists ""White Christmas"" as the top-selling song of all time at around 100 million copies. Multiply that by 250 and you get 25 billion. Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" is the No. 1 selling album of all time with more than 42 million certified sales. It would need to do that again almost 600 times to hit 25 billion. For a little more tech industry-specific comparison, Google's Play Store hit 25 billion downloads in September for mobile apps running on its Android operating system. 5. More iTunes by the numbers . More than 350 million -- number of iPods sold . 119 -- number of countries where iTunes is available . 26 million -- number of songs available on iTunes .

"(CNN) -- The U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan said Friday that it ""deeply regrets"" an airstrike that, it says, killed a child. The strike took place Thursday in southern Afghanistan's Helmand Province, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The attack targeted ""a known insurgent riding a motorbike"" who was killed along with the child. Two women were also injured. ""ISAF is committed to ensuring that all measures are taken to prevent civilian casualties,"" the coalition said in a statement released Friday. ""Coalition officials will work with Afghan officials to determine what happened and why."" U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, who leads ISAF in Afghanistan, called Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Thursday night after Karzai spoke out following the attack, a NATO official said. In addition to expressing regrets, Dunford promised a joint investigation into the incident. There was a message on Karzai's website strongly condemning the attack and calling it another sign of disregard for civilians. The official said the target was a Taliban sub-commander linked to the killings of Afghan troops and civilians. Two airstrikes were launched against him. The first one missed and may have caused civilian casualties, while the second killed the insurgent, according to the official. Such attacks are a sensitive matter in Afghanistan. U.S.-led forces have maintained a presence there since soon after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, going after al Qaeda and Taliban fighters as a new government emerged. The attacks also have stirred animosity among some locals, given the number of civilians who have been killed, injured or otherwise affected by coalition military actions. A vast majority of Afghan elders -- in a meeting called a loya jirga -- recently gave their approval to a new U.S.-Afghanistan security agreement that would allow American troops to remain in the south Asian nation beyond 2014, albeit in more of a support role. But Karzai has said he won't sign the deal until some conditions are met. These include promises from the United States of no more raids on Afghan homes and that Afghan prisoners will be released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Washington has resisted such changes. U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice, for instance, has said what the Afghan leader is asking for are new provisions added to a deal that was already agreed upon.","NEW: The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan calls President Karzai .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen launched grenades and used machetes against Muslims being evacuated in a truck convoy in Central African Republic, killing at least three children and 19 adults, a humanitarian group said Saturday. At least 23 more people, including children, were injured in Friday's attack and were being treated in a hospital in Bouar, in the northwestern part of the country, said Michael McCusker with Save the Children in Bangui, the nation's capital. The African country has been wracked with such serious religious and ethnic violence, including between Muslims and Christians, that the United Nations has said it fears a genocide could be brewing, and aid groups warn of a humanitarian crisis. The convoy was carrying mostly Muslim families from the village of Vakap when a grenade was launched into the trucks, said officials with Save the Children, a U.K.-based aid group. Attackers hacked many victims with machetes, the group said. Nearly a million flee violence . The mostly Muslim families in the convoy were being evacuated from violence and were ultimately destined for refuge in neighboring Cameroon. ""It is a sign of the still fraught and highly dangerous situation in the Central African Republic that children and their families have been attacked and killed while trying to evacuate to safety,"" said Robert Lankenau, the group's director in the country. The Bouar hospital treats both Christians and Muslims, the group said. Security has deteriorated since the country's interim leaders, President Michel Djotodia and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, announced their resignation at a regional summit in Chad this month. Chaos struck the Central African Republic last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, the latest in a series of coups since its independence. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Djotodia, one of the Seleka leaders, then became interim president in a coup. Since then, political turmoil and violence has spread. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition. To counter the attacks on their communities, Christians assembled vigilante groups and fought back. The violence prompted U.N. fears about a genocide brewing. Children beheaded as violence grows . At least 1,000 people have died in the violence, and some 958,000 more people, many of them children, have been forced from their homes within the Central African Republic, according to the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR. There are also more than 86,000 refugees in Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo who fled the Central African Republic in 2013, the UNHCR said Friday. Some 100,000 people have gathered at a makeshift camp by the international airport in Bangui, seeking refuge from the violence. French troops have deployed under a U.N. mandate to assist African peacekeepers.

"Singapore (CNN) -- With all the attention on the Facebook IPO, people have been wondering ""Where in the world is Eduardo Saverin?"" The co-founder of Facebook, whose falling out with CEO Mark Zuckerberg was immortalized in the film ""The Social Network,"" moved from the U.S. to Singapore in 2009. It was also recently revealed that Saverin, who was born in Brazil, gave up his U.S. citizenship a few months ago and became a permanent Singapore resident. Why Singapore? According to his spokesman, Saverin's move was just ""practical"" as he plans to invest in companies ""that have strong interests in entering the Asian markets. Accordingly, it made the most sense for him to use Singapore as a home base."" One other glaring possibility? Singapore has no capital gains tax. So depending on the size of his actual stake in Facebook, Saverin stands to realize substantial tax savings on any stock sales. According to Singapore- based ""Wealth-X"" which gathers information on ""ultra high net worth individuals,"" Saverin's estimated tax savings are ""at least $39 million as a result of renouncing U.S. citizenship."" Saverin's spokesman denies the move was done for tax reasons. Whatever drew him to Singapore, Saverin can find lots of ultra-rich company here. The tiny country is a playground for the super rich, with plenty of fast cars, luxury shopping, high priced gourmet restaurants and trendy bars. And Singapore's stable government and tax benefits have also drawn the wealthy from the region. Singapore has one of the world's highest number of millionaires per capita and a good share of billionaires, like Saverin. And Saverin is known to like the good life in Singapore, driving a Bentley and partying at several local clubs, including a members only nightclub. He's also appeared in ""Singapore Tatler,"" the local leading society magazine. Singapore is eager to attract wealthy investors like Saverin, and offers plenty of tax incentives and even permanent residency for big investors. Angel investors in local start-ups enjoy reduced income tax -- and in some cases, pay no income tax. Saverin has invested in a few Singapore mobile app companies, including Anideo and Perx, which has an increasingly visible customer loyalty reward program in Singapore. Still Singapore is a good place to live if you are seeking privacy. Most of the media is government backed and keeps a fairly tight lid on private lives, and while the internet has plenty of gossip, Saverin won't likely find paparazzi chasing him in Singapore.","Eduardo Saverin, co-founder of Facebook, moved to Singapore in 2009 .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Lasting wealth is not found in the numbers flickering from the ATM screen. It's built on the foundation of who you are, how you act, and what you believe in. Follow these steps over the next 10 years to ensure financial security: . 1. Take an oath of financial honesty. A crushing credit card balance caused by your need to impress others is a costly lie. Living within your means is living honestly. Find ways to save $25 a week and you'll free up $100 a month. Invest it and in 25 years you could have $80,000. 2. Stop settling for what the world offers. You need to be your own best advocate. If there's no raise this year because of the economy, meet with your boss to determine grounds for a raise next year. If you're self-employed and haven't increased your rates in years, I have to ask, why are you putting yourself on sale? I say it's fear. Recognize that this fear is keeping you from having more in your life. Oprah.com: 9 small financial steps that will pay off big . 3. Avoid debt bondage. Yes, debt is necessary; it's how you own a home or get a college degree, but the trick is to respect it. Take on only what you can afford. Have a credit card balance? Use the $100 from step one to increase your minimum payment on a $10,000 balance that charges 18 percent interest and you could save almost $24,000 in interest fees. 4. Make your financial life work within the new normal. The best move you can make today is to let go of what was and focus on what has been dubbed the new normal: a period of more moderate growth. That means, for instance, you need to expect that your house will appreciate at roughly the rate of inflation. 5. Get in great credit shape. I've always said a high FICO score is a key component to security -- but it's even more important now that lenders are so circumspect about making loans. A FICO score of at least 700 is your best defense. And if you find yourself in the job-hunting pool, a good score could distinguish you from others. (Yes, many employers check FICO scores. It's considered an insight into your sense of responsibility.) 6. Remember that every no leads you that much closer to a yes. The pain and anxiety of shocks like layoffs or divorce are unquestionably destabilizing. But you make things worse when you see these events as major setbacks, instead of starting points for you to re-imagine and reclaim your life. I also believe you can reduce the pain by adopting a ""hope for the best, plan for the worst"" mind-set (i.e., have an emergency fund). Oprah.com: Suze's easy financial to-do list . 7. Open up. Most people in financial trouble hold tightly to what they have. To put yourself in position to receive more in life, you must first open your hands -- and your heart -- by giving to others today. If you want to learn about a specific charity, check out the free service CharityNavigator.org. 8. Save for indulgences. Assuming you're on track with your retirement savings, have no credit card debt, and have an emergency savings fund, I'm not going to deny you fun --so long as you've saved up for it. If you want to have $5,000 for a milestone birthday trip in two years, you'll need to put away about $200 a month now, given today's low bank rates. 9. Eliminate the ""I shoulds."" Take care of every major must-have document this year -- a will, a healthcare power of attorney, etc. -- you've sworn for years that you'd get to. 10. Choose your legacy. This is all about the deathbed test. Will loved ones describe you in terms of what you bought for yourself, or will they talk about who you were and how fiercely you loved?

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters has been lured out of retirement once before and if anything is going to encourage the former world no. 1 out for a third stint on tour it's the thought of playing at the Australian Open. Speaking with world no. 14 Ana Ivanovic on CNN's Open Court, the 30-year-old Belgian admitted to a few pangs of jealousy as her Serbian friend prepared to jet off to Melbourne for the year's first grand slam. ""Yeah I'm a little bit jealous when you told me that you're leaving tomorrow,"" said Clijsters, who won the last of her four grand slam titles at Melbourne in 2011. Read more: Full coverage of CNN's Open Court . ""A lot of people ask me do you miss being on the road or do you miss playing tennis or the competition? And that's what I kind of miss the most last year was being in Australia at the start of the year."" The Clijsters, who retired for the second time in 2012, won't be the only European pining for a bit of summer sun to soothe the winter blues. But while most visitors would flock to the beach or lounge around a pool, it's clear that the former world no. 1 still misses the more active outdoor life that Aussie life affords. ""The first morning when you wake up with a huge jet lag, four, five o'clock in the morning and everybody is running or swimming, you can go outside and they are on their bikes and that's what I love,"" she says. ""I think if I would do that here in Belgium people would think I'm going crazy. Then again, the weather is not suited to living that kind of life style. I miss that."" However, the mother of two -- Clijsters has a five-year-old daughter, Jada and gave birth to a son, Jack last September -- isn't about to make a comeback like she did in 2009. ""I don't miss the competition. I don't miss the heavy work out schedule. It was getting harder with Jada to combine it and now with Jack. I enjoy working out still but I enjoy doing it when I feel like doing it."" Living an active life is a habit Clijsters is keen to pass on to her children, but she's not about to become another one of tennis' pushy parents. ""I'm not the kind of person where I want (Jada) to be like me and want her to have a career like me,"" Clijsters told CNN in December 2012. ""She plays a bit, she's at the club that I own with a friend every Wednesday, she goes there just for the social side of things ... ""It's just fun to see her have a social life and be among friends while playing sports. Whether it's swimming, track and field or tennis, I'll support her whatever she wants to do.

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, January 12 2010, the world watched in horror as Haiti was struck by a catastrophic earthquake. At least 100,000 people lost their lives in the devastation. In the aftermath, many people around the world sent financial aid to help support survivors. But one young entrepreneur was so affected by the tragedy that he sat down at his desk to try to lend his professional skills to future relief efforts. Having watched the disaster unfold on TV, Francisco Aguilar, a graduate from MIT Sloan and the Harvard Kennedy School, began working on a tool that could be used to help in emergency response situations around the world. ""If you remember the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, you saw hundreds of thousands of people buried under the rubble. After an earthquake most people die in the first 48 hours. People who are trapped tend to die in the first 48 hours. And the international rescue teams came with their very sophisticated equipment, and did a fantastic job when they got there, (but) they didn't get there for 48 hours. And their tools, their fiber optic scopes, and all the kinds of equipment that they have, cost $50,000, and are very hard to use. So, despite their very valiant efforts, they pulled out a few hundred people, but most of the damage was already done,"" Aguilar says. The device Aguilar invented is called the Bounce Imaging Explorer -- a small black probe about the size of a baseball, fixed with an array of sensors and cameras that can be thrown or dropped into dangerous environments. ""The initial thought was, how could we create something that was easy to use, that could allow a first responder, or even a volunteer, to easily look inside a space to determine whether it was safe to enter it, to see if there was a victim inside,"" Aguilar says. ""And that moved from search and rescue, to police who often face hostage situations: aggressive shooters, or terrorism. To fire fighting applications, where people often want to search different rooms in a complex, before having to enter or decide whether there is a fire or not. So there's a common problem across first responders of having to decide whether to enter a house or a space. And we are trying to make it cheap and easy to get images while they are out of there."" To develop the product Aguilar partnered with David Young, an entrepreneur who spent four and a half years as a US Army infantry officer. The Bounce Imaging Explorer's cameras and sensors can quickly take panoramic images after being thrown into an inaccessible space. The impact resistant shell can also house heat sensors, Geiger counters, vibration antennae or smoke detectors to provide different information in different kinds of emergencies, such as natural distasters or SWAT team hostage rescues. The ball then broadcasts its findings back to a mobile device to give users information on whether there are hazards (or indeed survivors) around a corner, or buried beneath fallen debris. The company, Bounce Imaging, won a gold award of $50,000 at MassChallenge, and was named one of TIME Magazine's Best Inventions of the year. Gianfranco Zaccai, CEO of design consultancy Continuum, said: ""I think that the concept is really great in its simplicity ... There's a lot of potential there, and there's a lot of potential for doing good with it, because if you think about, the dangerous world that we live in, we need simple, robust, usable ideas that are embedded in great products."" Aguilar hopes to begin producing the Bounce Imaging Explorer next year, and says he aims to keep the cost between $500 and $1000.","U.S. graduate Francisco Aguilar invents throwable camera called the Bounce Imaging Explorer .

"(CNN) -- A blustery winter snowstorm swept into New England on Saturday night, creating hazardous highway conditions across the region and disrupting air traffic throughout the nation. The snow started falling heavily Saturday night and was expected to continue into Sunday. When Bostonians wake up Sunday morning, they may find 8 to 14 inches of snow on the ground, with the same amount forecast north and west of the city and in New Hampshire. Areas south of Boston will see 3 to 6 inches. The storm was so bad that Newark Liberty International canceled 168 outbound flights on Saturday and Chicago O'Hare, which was hit by snow earlier in the day, canceled 102, according to the website Flightaware.com. At 9:30 p.m., the website reported that 1,003 airline flights had been canceled in the United States on Saturday; Boston Logan Airport has already canceled 35 Sunday flights. Highway traffic may be treacherous, with the problem compounded by high winds. CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported that Massachusetts expects to use 10,000 tons of salt and 2,000 vehicles during the storm. Frank DePaola of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation told CNN that speed limits on major roads had been lowered to 45 mph. Football fans shouldn't feel sorry for the New England Patriots, however. They'll play in sunny Miami against the Dolphins on Sunday. The eastward moving storm dropped snow earlier across the Midwest and western Pennsylvania, with 9 inches reported in Urbana, Illinois, and 3.9 inches at O'Hare Airport outside Chicago. Detroit reported 5.5 inches of snow, Cleveland 4.2, Toledo 5.7 and Pittsburgh 2.7. Millions of people will experience the big chill as the system drops snow on an area of more than 1,000 miles. FedEx said winter weather and high winds caused major disruptions at the company's Memphis hub that could delay shipments across the United States. Chicago has already been hit hard. The snow that fell there Saturday afternoon was wet, making it heavy and difficult to shovel. Areas south of Chicago could see 4 to 6 inches of snow. New Yorkers could see 3 to 5 inches of snow Saturday afternoon and evening, followed by sleet and freezing rain overnight. The nation's capital will see a mix of rain, snow and sleet, and further to the south, the same system will bring cold and rain. There was a slight risk of severe storms Saturday for parts of Florida, Georgia and Alabama.","A winter storm is affecting an area from Kansas to Maine .

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal budget has always been a tool for partisanship, but never more so than in the past few years. Like the awkward and irreverent distant relative at the dinner table, the Senate tried for several years to ignore it. But everyone knew it was in the room, helping to create a permanent state of partisan gridlock. But the government shutdown in October caused so much political fallout that most Republicans and Democrats in a Congress already rated poorly by the public didn't want to go through it again with midterm election campaigns just getting off the ground. Passing a budget became an imperative. Two ideologically opposite lawmakers agreed to the same spending plan -- a notable feat considering Congress has lurched from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis since President Barack Obama took office, deeply at odds over taxes and spending. Perhaps more miraculously, the House, which has been the hotbed of partisans, passed the two-year budget plan last week overwhelmingly before leaving town for the holidays. Republicans and Democrats supported the deal, even though neither side swooned. Some of the most liberal and conservative members opposed it. But for the first time in years, a core of the House came together to support federal spending. The vote was 332-94. The proposal then traveled across the marble corridor of the Capitol to the Senate, where bipartisanship is usually more common. But this is where the whole thing gets more difficult due to arcane rules of the Senate, political realities ahead of midterms and the 2016 presidential race, concerns about spending, and a bruising fight over how the Senate operates that has sharpened partisan feelings. Senate supporters think they have votes . Most insiders believe the bill that aims to avert a possible shutdown in mid January, relax sweeping spending cuts under the so-called sequester, and give everyone some political breathing room from the issue for two years, will ultimately pass and be sent to Obama for his signature. Those chances seemed to improve by the hour on Monday as supporters gained some conservative backing needed to clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle on Tuesday. Still, there are a number of Republicans who oppose the measure and nothing's certain yet. A confluence of factors -- both relating to the budget and not -- will influence the outcome. Here's how things look: . 1. 2014 reelection worries . The numbers tell the story. Seven of the 12 GOP Senators running for re-election next year are facing primary challenges from the right. And that list includes the top two Republicans: Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Minority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. McConnell will not vote for the agreement. Cornyn appears skeptical. Some major conservative groups have criticized the budget agreement, including Americans for Prosperity, Club for Growth, Heritage Action for America, Freedomworks, and Senate Conservatives Fund. They are influential with tea party activists and other grassroots advocates who vote in big numbers in the Republican primaries -- aka, the kind of voters these Senators will need to win reelection. ""Yes. I think the primary challenges and the threat of future primary challenges is a factor when Senators go to the floor to vote. It may not be the biggest factor, but to ignore the impact of primaries would be silly,"" said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. One other factor that could be at play when it comes to Senators in the GOP leadership: This is not their deal. There is not Senate equivalent to the agreement struck by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Senate counterpart, Democrat Patty Murray. 2. 2016 politics . Sentiments of those same Republican primary voters could be why three GOP Senators not up for re-election in 2014 quickly opposed the deal last week. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Ted Cruz of Texas are all considered possible contenders for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Because of that, just about every vote they take will be scrutinized by outside conservative groups influential with core voters in presidential primaries and caucuses. Durbin says 2014 and 2016 politics is a factor when it comes to Senate Republican opposition. ""A handful of members of the Senate are vying for the presidency in years to come and thinking about this vote in the context. And others are frankly afraid of this new force, the tea party force, the Heritage Foundation force, that is threatening seven out of the 12 Republican senators running for re-election,"" Durbin told ""Face the Nation."" Don't expect Boehner to totally change his tune . 3. Read the bill . Members on both sides of the aisle aren't enthusiastically supporting the budget deal -- a good sign that it is a true compromise. On the left, some are opposed to the fact that it doesn't include an extension of unemployment benefits, cutting off 1.3 million Americans three days after Christmas. ""It's really unconscionable,"" Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa said on Radio Iowa last week. On the right, Republicans oppose the amount of government spending. It preserved about 60% of the automatic sequester cuts that went into effect in March, reducing them by about $45 billion. With proposed federal spending at $1.012 trillion for this fiscal year and $1.014 for next, some Republicans say that's too high. ""I'd really like to stay within the (spending) caps,"" complained Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican about limits imposed by a 2011 budget law. Others oppose cuts to military retiree pensions as a way to save money. ""We need to find a better way to save $6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, who said he would vote against the bill. Opinion: Obama's very tough year . 4. Filibuster fallout . After Democrats changed the Senate rules to weaken the ability of minority Republicans to block presidential appointments, the GOP may not be in the mood to play nice. The Senate was locked in fierce partisan bickering over this while the House was passing the budget. Angry over the rules change, Republicans took advantage of Senate procedure and forced two consecutive all-night sessions, an attempt to prove a point and annoy Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid responded to Republican tactics by telling them he can't ""heal hurt feelings"" and said he would press forward to pass the budget and other items before the waning time left before Christmas. ""I understand that Republicans are still upset,"" Reid told reporters last week. ""I can't wave a magic wand and heal hurt feelings, but I can appeal to my colleagues to be reasonable and work with us and to schedule votes in a timely manner on the important work we have left to do."" Republicans, who don't love the budget deal, might feel like making things a little more difficult. 5. Fears of another shutdown . The 16-day government shutdown was a political disaster for the GOP. Conservative Republicans triggered the political debacle by insisting that money to fund the government be tied to defunding Obamacare, which they despise. The public mainly blamed them, and their poll numbers quickly dropped in the so-called generic ballot, a key 2014 metric in the battle for control of Congress. Republicans currently control the House and Democrats, the Senate. Many Republican lawmakers are quietly worried the GOP brand would suffer further damage if they take the blame for another shutdown even though Democrats and Obama have their own problems with voter sentiment on their job performance. Opinion: Democrats lose on budget deal . Ryan, in touting his deal on Sunday, highlighted that ""we're preventing two government shutdowns from possibly occurring."" Republicans say they plan to campaign against the Obamacare health reforms under the Affordable Care Act as they work next year to try and regain the Senate, which Democrats hold by 10 seats and keep their double-digit majority in the House. Another government shutdown would sidetrack them from their mission. ""Democratic political strategists would like nothing more than for the GOP to take the focus off Obamacare again and to shoot themselves in the foot with another government shutdown,"" said Brian Walsh, a GOP strategist and communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. ""This agreement takes that scenario off the table and keeps the Democrats firmly on defense with their disastrous healthcare law heading into 2014."" 5 reasons why Congress might (finally) pass a budget .

"(CNN) -- Iraq veteran turned pro-gun activist Adam Kokesh was arrested on two charges, including having a gun while in possession of an illicit drug, police said Wednesday. His arrest comes after authorities late Tuesday searched the suburban Washington home of Kokesh, who recently made headlines with his July Fourth video posted to YouTube in which he loaded a shotgun in the middle of the national capital's Freedom Plaza. He also used Facebook to call for an armed march in Washington for the same day but called off the event in May. It is illegal to carry firearms in the District of Columbia. Kokesh spent Tuesday night into Wednesday at Fairfax County Adult Detention Center in northern Virginia, U.S. Park Police spokeswoman Pamela Smith told CNN. He was still there as of Wednesday afternoon. He faces two charges -- illegal possession of a schedule I or II drug and having a firearm while in possession of such a drug -- Smith said. Under Virginia law, schedule I drugs such as heroin and LSD have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, and schedule II drugs such as PCP, cocaine and methamphetamine are addictive, have a high potential for abuse but have accepted medical uses. Smith earlier told CNN that authorities had executed a search warrant on Kokesh's home in Herndon, Virginia, which is about 20 miles west of Washington. ""It is still an ongoing investigation,"" Smith said then. She declined to comment on what, if any, weapons had been discovered in the search. Kokesh has a long history of speaking out. He was discharged from the Marines in 2007 for wearing his uniform during an anti-war protest. In his now infamous YouTube video, Kokesh states: ""We will not be silent. We will not obey. We will not allow our government to destroy our humanity."" Then, loading shells into the shotgun, he looks into a camera saying, ""We are the final American revolution. See you next Independence Day."" CNN's Steve Brusk and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Kokesh is arrested on 2 charges, 1 of which is a weapons charge .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Flock of Seagulls' friends and fans are watching Craigslist, eBay and pawn shops for band leader Mike Score's stolen amps and instruments. While the singer's signature floppy hair was lost years ago, Score's keyboards, guitars, drums, mics and clothing disappeared last weekend when a thief took the band's van from in front of a hotel in Downey, California, Score said. ""The van itself was found, but all the gear was taken. The van was empty,"" he told CNN Wednesday. Investigators are searching for fingerprints and other clues on the vehicle. ""The word, though, is out and we have lots of other band members scouring eBay and Craigslist for signs of the equipment,"" Score said. Southern California guitar stores have lists of the stolen gear in case someone tries to fence it there, he said. While equipment is replaceable, Score is especially anxious about a hard drive that contained songs for his upcoming solo album. The music ""was just about ready to go"" when it disappeared with the van, he said. A reconstituted version of the 1980s English New Wave band has been playing gigs with co-founder Score as the only original member. Their biggest hit was ""I Ran (So Far Away)"" in 1982. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","The 1980s band's van loaded with instruments and clothing disappeared last weekend .

"(CNN) -- A New Hampshire apartment complex is mandating that residents submit pet DNA samples. Why? To check if any of them are abandoning their dogs' waste on the property. ""Ninety-eight percent do what they're suppose to do,"" property manager Debbie Violette said of her residents with dogs, ""but there are some that don't and you don't know who that is. That'd be pretty foolish if they did that right in front of me."" Timberwood Commons in Lebanon, New Hampshire, says it is among a growing number of apartment complexes implementing PooPrints. That's a program that matches samples of unclaimed dog waste to DNA collected through pets' mandatory mouth swabs in the hope of imposing greater responsibility among pet owners. Violette says her violators will first receive a warning if caught, paying a $60 fee to cover the DNA costs. However, if it happens again, it's a lease violation and the offender will be forced to live somewhere else. ""They have a choice to rent here or not. If you live in that community you have to live by those rules and regulations,"" Violette said. ""It's a privilege."" She said she got the idea from a residential community in Boston. Eric Mayer, director of franchise development with BioPet Vet Lab, says the program is currently assisting rental complexes in multiple states, with increasing interest as far away as Canada and Germany. The tests bought through PooPrints, a subsidiary of BioPet Vet Lab in Knoxville, Tennessee, match the DNA already captured to a sample of each pet's waste. Poop that isn't scooped can then be analyzed. According to Mayer, apartment complexes that impose a pet deposit or fee on residents could potentially cover the testing costs incurred with the initial DNA registration. The cost of the DNA analysis each time a sample is tested could theoretically be paid through a fee on convicted freeloaders. It's a service Violette admits to be potentially costly, but with more than 30 dogs on her property, some as large as a St. Bernard, ""it's really not about the money for us,"" she said, ""it's about having a nice place to live."" And reaction has been positive, she said. ""I did have one resident that thought it was completely over the top, who's not a pet owner,"" Violette said. But after considering the possibility of stepping in a mess he himself didn't leave behind, ""he changed his mind,"" she said. Violette sees long-term benefits in the PooPrints system, saying it could reunite lost pets and owners, especially in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Mayer says he remains focused on both environmental and human health benefits through the system. ""It's a huge problem with growing environmental impact,"" Mayer said of the waste. The PooPrints website estimates a single pet creates 276 pounds of waste per year. ""We want people to be responsible and not leave things behind. Down the drain means it's going into your lakes, rivers and streams,"" he added.","Apartment complexes use PooPrints for residents who don't always scoop .
DNA is taken from swab of dog's mouth .
It's then matched to a sample of their waste ."
"(CNN) -- When preparing to propose marriage, create a moment that's right for her and that accurately reflects -- in a beautiful, emotional and thoughtful way -- what's special about you. If you're a great couple, those two things won't conflict. She loves you, so she'll love you expressing who you are in a moment that's totally focused on her. One of the biggest mistakes people make is thinking that there should be a crowd of strangers as onlookers. For some women, that's just right. But for most, it isn't. It's fine for women to drop hints to their boyfriends about the general kind of proposal they would want, i.e., how public or not. Do not dictate the specifics, and remember it's not just about you; it's about him expressing himself in a beautiful, fragile moment of bravery and humility that's all about love. Celebrate him as much as he's celebrating you. Setting the scene . Sometimes the most magical moment you can create is in a space that you have all to yourselves. I tricked my wife into ending up with me alone on the stage of the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, when it was dark. The spotlight came on, our song played through the room. Magic. Why I proposed marriage in public . I got another couple into a major league baseball park when it was empty. She thought they were on a private tour for just a few members of her family. When they reached the pitcher's mound, her boyfriend went down on one knee, as their song echoed throughout the stadium and a video about them played on the JumboTron. Then the sprinklers came on, getting them just a little wet. No big crowd. Beautiful. Captured on video. Booyah! Who got it right? Of the recent sprinkling of public marriage proposals making the rounds, the ""lip dub"" video speaks to my point. Clearly it thrilled the bride-to-be and was an expression of the future groom's personality. No big crowd of strangers, just, presumably, people they would both want to be there. It's clever, original, positive, adorable. They're not pretending to be all professional and perfect. I'm not worried about something going wrong in a plan like that, because it wouldn't have mattered. It wasn't about a perfect show -- it was about joy and a celebration of love. The problem is that guys see videos like this and feel pressured to do something that's public or viral, and they lose track of the point. Does it have to be public? Your proposal is not a performance! It's not about proving to the world how cool you are. And its value does not lie in how many people witness it, watch it later or hear about it. Its value lies entirely in how special it is to the two of you, and the kind of story it gives you both to share and celebrate for the rest of your lives. What's with public marriage proposals? That's the potential problem with the proliferation of public proposal events, with men trying to outdo each other and create YouTube moments. If you enter that game, you lose the point. There's a high that comes from a magic proposal. And no matter how many people see it, only the two of you get that ""high."" If you're going for magic in that moment, that's the central feeling you want to achieve -- not the ego boost of strangers praising you. Close the deal . Another important note on proposals: Stick the landing! I can't tell you how many guys plan for the buildup and the question, but then ooze awkwardness and have no clue what to do after she says yes! Especially when there's a crowd of people there and the applause is over. Have a plan for what you're going to do at the very end of the magic proposal event. For some couples, the simpler the better. How did CNN's Josh Levs become a proposal expert? Watch his TEDx talk to find out! Would you propose in public or want your partner to do so?

"(CNN) -- Anthony Khoury and his family were in the living room of their home in Washington, Illinois, on Sunday when his father thought he heard a helicopter flying over head. When they turned to look out the window, they saw a tornado barreling through their neighborhood -- one of dozens spawned by a severe weather system that affected several states in the Midwest. ""Everyone started running downstairs,"" Khoury said. As his parents and aunt huddled together against the basement wall, the 21-year-old stood near the window, documenting the ferocious tornado as it swept through the area. ""The tornado happened in my backyard and you can hear people screaming. We were freaking out,"" he said. Khoury started praying as he captured the twister ripping through nearby structures. After the tornado passed, he and his family went outside to survey the damage. He says, to their surprise, their home was not affected by the tornado, but the surrounding neighborhood was left in disarray. Roofs were ripped off of some homes and others were leveled. ""It was complete destruction. There are people in the streets crying,"" he said. ""We're so blessed that our street was untouched. You drive out of my street and all this destruction is there.

"(CNN) -- Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is very softly spoken. The tech titan, now chief executive of mobile payments company Square, is an observer who pays close attention to everything that goes on around him. The 36-year old prefers to listen rather than talk, which may seem ironic for someone who helped re-define how we communicate. But it might explain the brevity of Twitter, the social media phenomenon which distils communication to 140 characters. READ MORE: Dorsey's plans to reinvent shopping . Dorsey, who I meet in a Toronto coffee store, is a little uncomfortable around the media. This is perhaps not a shock given some negative press which has followed his success -- notably from journalist and author Nick Bilton, who painted an unflattering portrait of Dorsey during the early days of Twitter. But he is surprisingly engaging when he is talking to small business owners and Square customers. Dorsey has a real passion for building communities, and that's the common thread between his current venture, Square, and Twitter. They are both about building communities. There are differences: Twitter was wide in scope, while Square is focused on building a community of small businesses. Dorsey, now a billionaire and one of the world's most influential tech brains, grew up in St Louis, Missouri, with parents who were running small coffee and pizza businesses. He's clearly a genuine believer in small companies and their importance to communities and wider economic growth. That's why Dorsey is traveling around the U.S. and Canada, holding Town Hall meetings for small businesses under the banner #LetsTalk. Dorsey wants to talk to business owners about Square, but also connect these local companies to support and mentor each other. READ MORE: Twitter valued at more than $11 billion . Square is the mobile commerce company he set up back in 2009, with the @Square Twitter handle. It began with a credit card reader and has expanded to analytics (Square Register) and service where you can send cash over email (Square Cash). The initial set up is easy and fees are low, which reflects Dorsey's desire for technology to even the commercial playing field. He wants small businesses to have the same shot at success that big businesses have. Dorsey also thinks technology should make the back office administration (billing, inventory, promotions) easier so that the owner or seller can spend more time on the actual business -- in the front of the shop. Ultimately, he wants to revolutionize commerce. READ MORE: Why is Twitter spending so much on R&D? And despite the presence of Paypal, Google and Intuit, Dorsey thinks there is still too much disruption for customers. He refers to a ""frictionless"" experience for customers that releases business to do what it should be doing: Building the economy. Square is in U.S., Canada and Japan already. But Dorsey, in his unassuming way, is pitching to take it around the globe.","Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is promoting his new business, Square, across North America .

"(CNN) -- A North Korean soldier on guard duty at the border dividing the two Koreas defected, telling authorities who received him in the South that he killed his superiors before fleeing across the Military Demarcation Line. South Korean soldiers at their guard posts reported hearing gunfire before he crossed into the South shortly after noon local time, according to a news release from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Soldiers in the South took the defector in on their side of the border and brought him to a safe place for questioning then tightened security in the area. The North Korean said that ""while he was on guard duty, he killed his platoon and squad leaders and defected thereafter,"" the JCS said. Defections over land through the heavily armed and fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) are rare, as most fleeing the communist North prefer the greater odds of success of crossing by sea. ""The last North Korean soldier who defected (over land) was in March 2010,"" said a spokesman from the defense ministry in Seoul. But with his comrades dead and no longer capable of hindering him, it was easy for the soldier to flee south. ""The distance between the North Korean guard post and the South Korean guard post is 500 meters,"" the official said, who asked not to be named, because he is not authorized to speak with the media. More than 24,000 refugees have entered the South from the North since the country's division, according to the Ministry of Unification in Seoul, over two-thirds of them women. The annual number of refugees has climbed steadily from less than 100 in the 1990s to more than 2,000 per year since 2006. North Korea defector living with quarter of a century of guilt .

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- Early morning in a soon-to-be sun-baked cactus garden in Palo Alto, California; as most life yawns into movement, one creature is already darting between the bright red cactus flowers in a blur of electric speed. A three-inch-long Hummingbird hovers -- bristling among cactus spines, drinking nectar -- before breaking backwards, rising effortlessly over a gust of wind, and diving down out of sight. For the Stanford University students covertly watching, each move is executed quicker than a blinking eye. But when they take their high-speed video camera back to the lab and slow down their footage to a snail's pace, the bird's blurred motion becomes clear and the researchers get the information they came for: elusive clues to the secret of the hummingbird's flight. Natural inspiration . Miniature flying robots have come a long way in the last few years, now mastering incredible athletic feats. But when it comes to dealing with the unpredictable world around them, our best man-made flying machines still have a long way to go to match nature's impressive creations. And that's why, to create new flying robots that work in the world outside the lab, these pioneering researchers are looking to birds. ""I study how birds fly and I use it as an inspiration for developing new robots,"" says David Lentink, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University. ""Small micro air vehicles that can fly close to buildings or in cluttered environments or through turbulence, they actually encounter the exact same problems that birds have encountered for millions of years and solved,"" he adds. How to fly . To build the next generation of micro air vehicles, Lentink aims to understand how a bird powers its agile maneuvers, and why a pair of flapping wings gives a bird the power to ease through turbulent skies. But the team is currently being held back by our lack of crucial knowledge. ""We know very little,"" says Eirik Ravnan, a graduate student in Stanford's Lentink Lab. ""We don't know how much force they generate at what part of the wing stroke. We can't explain all of the forces they are generating and we don't know how they move their wings exactly -- so this is something we are starting to look at now."" The video of a hummingbird that Lentink's team captured in the garden was filmed at more than 2,000 frames per second, allowing it to be played back in highly detailed super slow motion. At this speed, some remarkable secrets of the bird's flight were revealed. They observed the hummingbird hovering, reversing and diving, and documented its unique ""insect-like"" wing action (at 42 flaps a second). They have also seen the tiny 3-gram bird shake its body like a dog (for reasons that are still unknown) and detailed its tactic for facing down a wayward gust of wind. ""We have this one shot of a bird -- it doesn't actually do a full flap downwards -- it does half a flap and then goes back up,"" explains Ashley Fletcher, another graduate student in the Lab. ""It is things like that that help stabilize it in the air and help it move really nimbly."" Watch: Flying robots' aerial acrobatics . It's not just cameras that are revealing the secrets of bird flight. Ravnan has been training a miniature parrot (called a parrotlet) to fly between perches. Laser systems monitor the flow of the air behind the bird -- showing a pair of swirling vortices behind the wings -- which could provide more clues to how the bird manages to be nimble as well as robust. Building a 'robobird' The team is putting this knowledge into practice by developing micro air vehicles powered by flapping wings. Graduate student Amanda Stowers is working on a prototype that can morph its wings while flying -- and she's confident she can get it to rival the hummingbird's 42 flaps per second. Built from carbon fiber and mylar, the device weighs just over 20 grams and by folding its wings it can reduce its wingspan from 44 cm to about 16 cm. The aim is to build ""a more maneuverable flapping-wing air vehicle, able to fly through gaps smaller than its wing span without breaking itself,"" Stowers explains. The team admits it could take decades to produce a robot capable of equaling the subtleties of a real bird's swoops and dives. But for Lentink, learning more about bird flight inspires admiration of the ""extraordinary"" creatures. ""(A bird) is such a complicated machine,"" he says. ""If you look at the amount of processing power in its brain, its actuation capabilities -- just all the muscles -- and the capabilities birds have to change the shape of their bodies, it is something that will take many years, tens of years, maybe 20 years to get something like that into a robot.""","Researchers studying bird flight to help build better flying robots .

"(CNN) -- If Sebastian Vettel's efficient march towards his fourth Formula One crown left fans of motor racing's premier competition stifling yawns, things in the top class on two wheels are rather different. Last month, the latest in Spain's prodigious production line of motorcycle racers, Marc Marquez, looked to have the MotoGP title sewn up. Arriving in Australia with a cavernous 43-point lead over compatriot Jorge Lorenzo, it seemed almost inevitable that the 20-year-old would become the division's youngest champion, and the first rookie to win the title since Kenny Roberts in 1978. Instead, the twisting undulations of Phillip Island flipped the season's story on its head. Bridgestone, MotoGP's tire supplier, had been unable to properly test on the newly resurfaced circuit, and the teams quickly discovered that the fresh tarmac was causing their rubber to disintegrate at a dangerous rate. For safety, the race was reduced to 19 laps, and a mandatory bike change introduced at the halfway point. To widespread astonishment, Marquez's Repsol Honda team misinterpreted the strict guidance on pit stops and he stayed out on track a lap too long, leading to his disqualification. The black flag for Marquez may have been harsh -- a tweet from veteran rider Colin Edwards summed up the feelings of many fans -- but Honda's loss was Yamaha's gain. Lorenzo went on to win, and suddenly the championship race was back on. Lorenzo carved further into Marquez's lead the following week, beating his younger rival into second place at Honda's home circuit in Motegi, Japan. Now, as the teams arrive in Valencia for Sunday's season finale, the title is well and truly up for grabs -- with just 13 points separating the top two. The most likely scenario for Lorenzo to defend his title, and claim a third overall, is for the Mallorcan to win the race and hope Marquez is no higher than fifth. The other permutations would require Marquez to either not finish -- which has happened only once this season, in June -- or be lower than eighth. However, he has been on the podium for 15 of 17 races. HervÃ© Poncharal, a former rider who is now principal of the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 team he co-founded, is a big admirer of both men. ""Lorenzo is an incredible racing machine,"" Poncharal told CNN. ""He is so sharp, he is so methodical. I have incredible respect for the rider."" However, he adds that the MotoGP paddock already considers Marquez to be a champion. ""For everyone it doesn't matter the outcome of Valencia, he is the world champ in terms of speed. And this year is really incredible, because this is happening in a year when MotoGP is so competitive (at the top)."" Poncharal also notes Marquez's startling maturity, which has given the youngster the consistency that many rookie riders struggle to deliver. ""He is incredibly aggressive on the bike, but if you look at the record he's not a big crasher. When you look at how aggressive he is, how hard he tries, and the risks he's taking, you can see that already now he's a very mature guy, although he's the youngest."" Former MotoGP rider and double World Superbike champion James Toseland agrees. ""I've been amazed at how he pushes the bike to the limit consistently,"" Toseland, who is now forging a career in music, told CNN. ""At Mugello (the Italian MotoGP, when Marquez fell close to the end of the race while riding in a comfortable second place) you saw an over-enthusiastic 20-year-old, but that's all I've seen of that kind of personality. He's been so consistent and so level-headed since then."" The Briton also sees the two Spaniards as neck and neck in the talent stakes: ""I truly believe that Lorenzo is more than a match for Marquez on the same day, on the same bike, in the same conditions."" MotoGP is not immune to the problems F1 has faced with the dominance of Vettel's Red Bull. While an underachieving Ducati team continues to struggle, the factory outfits of Honda and Yamaha are simply blowing away the opposition, so the fact that this year's title is going to the wire will no doubt please the championship's governing body. Also, while the gap between Honda, Yamaha and the rest may be wide, there is no absence of personal rivalry at the top of the championship. Marquez's relationship with third-placed teammate Dani Pedrosa is not exactly cordial, and he has consistently riled his rivals with his combative and uncompromising style. Marquez was docked a point for a clash with Pedrosa at Aragon in early October, and controversially escaped censure for a rough pass on Lorenzo in Jerez. So while Lorenzo will be fighting tooth and nail for victory, Pedrosa may also be less than willing to help smooth his fellow Catalan's ride to glory. Poncharal doubts that any quarter will be given. ""I'm not so sure Pedrosa is going to help Marquez a lot, but Dani winning the race, that's good news for Marc,"" he said. Intriguingly Valencia is a particularly happy hunting ground for Pedrosa, with a total of six wins at the track, including three in the MotoGP class. While his own hopes of a long-awaited first championship were ended in Japan, the diminutive 28-year-old will be looking to end the season on a high. Lorenzo has also won a MotoGP race at the track, in 2010 -- the year he won his first world title -- while Marquez rode to victory there last season on the way to winning the Moto2 class. Poncharal believes that Britain's Cal Crutchlow, who rides for Tech 3, could also play key role along with Lorenzo's seven-time world champion teammate Valentino Rossi. ""Cal is going to wish to finish the season as high as possible; he was second last year (at Valencia) when he crashed four laps from the end. Valentino is going to be pushing; I'm not sure he will play Jorge's game."" The last time a MotoGP season went down to the final race was in 2006, when America's Nicky Hayden, then riding for Honda, wrested the crown from the all-conquering Rossi. Rossi, in his first stint at Yamaha, fell early in the race and was unable to regain enough places to prevent Hayden clinching what would be his first and, to date, only title. This time around, Marquez will be hoping to avoid any mishaps as he looks to clinch motorcycle racing's ultimate prize. ""It's going to be incredibly tense -- 13 points is good to have, but it's not a lot,"" Poncharal said. ""It looks easier than it will be ... I think it's 50-50."" With Europe heading towards winter, conditions at the track may also play a role. ""Valencia is a special track,"" Poncharal said. ""We know the weather this time will be difficult, there will be a lot of pressure because (in Japan) we saw Marc, for the first time, not being the Marc we know. He will be under more pressure at the last round. ""In Jorge's mind it was game over (before Australia). Now everything has changed, Jorge is going to go out in Valencia not thinking, just pushing -- without any pressure."" For motorsport fans looking for one last fix of excitement before the season ends, Sunday's race should provide it in spades. ""The final is going to be like a dream scenario,"" Poncharal said. ""Let the sport decide.""","Marc Marquez seeking to be first rookie to win motorcycling's premier title since 1978 .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- A five-hour killing rampage in Brazil's southeastern city of Campinas that left 12 people dead is being investigated amid claims it may have been sparked by the earlier death of a police officer. The 12 victims were gunned down in several separate incidents on the outskirts of the city, in what Brazilian media said appeared to be execution-style killings. Authorities say they are looking into all possibilities, including whether the killings were gang-related. But they also say the timing and location of the shootings add weight to a theory that they were revenge killings carried out by police. The slayings occurred between Sunday night and Monday morning, just hours after an off-duty military police officer, Arides Luiz dos Santos, was killed fighting off an attempted robbery at a gas station. According to Brazilian media, in one of the cases, a car pulled up, its occupants told children to go inside and then opened fire. Hundreds of angry residents took to the streets to protest the killings. They attacked buses, burning three of them. Police have stepped up their presence in Campinas, located about 50 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, to prevent further violence. The latest deadly incidents come as Brazil prepares to host the 2014 World Cup in June. None of the venues for the soccer tournament is in Campinas. However, fans from around the world are expected to flock to nearby Sao Paulo, the country's financial and business hub. Hooded men . Fernando Grella Vieira, the secretary of public safety for Sao Paulo, said Tuesday that the civil and military police ""will not rest"" until they have found those responsible for all 13 deaths in Campinas. No possibility is being ruled out during the investigation, he said on a visit to the city. ""These are intolerable crimes and I can guarantee that the police will not rest until we solve these deaths and arrest the perpetrators,"" he added. Grella said it was too early to comment on suspicions raised by witnesses of the alleged involvement of military officers in 12 of the killings. But he stressed that he does not tolerate abuse or crimes committed by state agents. Nine of the victims died in two separate incidents, according to the state-run Agencia Brasil. Hooded men reportedly used pistols to shoot the victims, aged between 17 and 30, in the head. The remaining three were killed in separate attacks, the news agency said. At least six of the victims had a criminal background, with offenses including drug trafficking, murder and auto theft, the news agency cited Licurgo Costa, director of the Judiciary Police department, as saying. Victims 'hit in the head, chest or abdomen' The chief of the Civil Police's homicide division, Devanir Dutra, told CNN affiliate TV Globo that the police will take accounts from at least 20 witnesses beginning Wednesday. ""Let's start with the relatives and friends of the victims,"" he said. According to Dutra, two people were injured and remain hospitalized in Campinas. They may be summoned by the police as witnesses. Dutra said that the number of shots fired signaled executions. ""They (the victims) were hit in the head, chest or abdomen,"" he said. One hypothesis being examined by the Civil Police is rivalry between drug gangs, he said. CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo and Marilia Brocchetto from Atlanta, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Police ""will not rest"" until they find those behind killings in Campinas, official says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A white diamond the size of a small egg has sold for $30.6 million at an auction in Hong Kong, smashing the world record for a jewel of its kind. The flawless, 118-carat oval diamond was sold to an unidentified Asian collector, whose winning bid came at the lower end of the $28 million to $35 million estimate set by auction giant Sotheby's. It was the largest diamond ever sold at auction. David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's Jewelry Division for Europe and the Middle East, told CNN that diamonds could be bought as an investment or simply for the love of a beautiful and rare object. ""Asia has rapidly in the past 20 years become our most important sector of the buying public. They account for more than a third (of buyers)."" However, a rare blue diamond that was expected to fetch at least $19 million during the same sale failed to reach its reserve price. The previous record for a white diamond was set in May at Christie's in Geneva when a pear-shaped jewel sold for $26.7 million. The auction was part of a series of fall sales of art, jewelry and other collectibles held in the city by Sotheby's and its rivals.","Oval diamond sells for record $30.6 million in Hong Kong .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A spokesman for relatives of Nelson Mandela extended thanks Saturday for the outpouring of support they have received since his death Thursday at age 95 and vowed that they would seek to uphold his legacy. ""The pillar of the family is gone,"" Gen. Themba Matanzima told reporters here. ""But in our hearts and souls, he will always be with us."" Matanzima said the family of the man who became South Africa's first black president after enduing 27 years in prison for his role in fighting apartheid would ""be guided by the values he lived for and was prepared to die for."" Chief among the lessons Mandela imparted was that ""a life lived for others is a life well-lived,"" the family spokesman said. ""Though he attained the status of a global icon, he was remarkable for his humility in the family,"" Matanzima said. ""Above all, he believed very strongly in the value and power of education as an instrument to empower children against poverty and helplessness."" Matanzima expressed gratitude to the people of South Africa for their support during Mandela's long bouts with illness, to his medical team and to South Africa President Jacob Zuma. ""Finally, as a family, we are humbled by the message of condolence and support we continue to receive from governments and people of the world."" Using the clan name for the world leader, Matanzima said, ""Clearly, this once more underlines the simple truth that Madiba was not just a citizen of South Africa and the broader African continent, but a global citizen."" Though the past two days have not been easy for Mandela's family, and the coming days, too, will be difficult, ""with the support we are receiving from here and beyond, in due time, all will be well for the family,"" he said. Tributes planned . A state funeral will be held December 15 in Mandela's ancestral hometown of Qunu in the Eastern Cape province. Before the funeral, various events to honor him are planned in major cities. Sunday will be a national day of prayer and reflection, and people will gather in places of worship to pray and meditate, Zuma said. The official memorial service will be Tuesday in First National Bank Stadium in Johannesburg. Several world leaders plan to attend, including U.S. President Barack Obama according to a White House official. And Mandela's body will lie in state at the seat of government in Pretoria from Wednesday through next Friday. Zuma announced the death late Thursday in a nationally televised address. ""Our nation has lost its greatest son; our people have lost a father,"" he said. ""Although we knew that this day would come, nothing can diminish our sense of a profound and enduring loss."" In recent years, Mandela had battled health issues that included multiple hospitalizations for treatment of a recurring lung infection. Man of complexities . Mandela helped South Africa break the practice of racial segregation and do away with white minority rule. Imprisoned for nearly three decades for his fight against state-sanctioned racial segregation, he was freed in 1990 and quickly set about working to unite the nation through forgiveness and reconciliation. ""As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison,"" Mandela said. His rejection of vengeance led him to assume roles that led from freedom fighter to prisoner to a world symbol of the struggle against racial oppression. And, four years after he left prison, he became president, cementing his place in the consciousness of the nation and the world. Zuma has ordered flags around South Africa to be flown at half-staff until the funeral. The U.S. government and Buckingham Palace also lowered their flags. ""Nelson Mandela achieved more than could be expected of any man,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday. ""We have lost one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this Earth. He no longer belongs to us -- he belongs to the ages."" CNN's Arwa Damon reported from South Africa, and Faith Karimi and Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: U.S. President Obama will be at Tuesday service in Johannesburg, official says .

"(CNN) -- Country superstar Alan Jackson is famous alright, but that didn't help his 20-year-old daughter, Alexandra, when she was arrested on Wednesday. According to Metro Nashville Police, Alexandra was charged with assault, underage consumption of alcohol, and resisting arrest during a traffic stop. The 20-year-old was riding shotgun in a Range Rover that a police officer observed was speeding, and when the officer pulled the car over, it was discovered that Alexandra ""had consumed a large amount of alcohol."" Police say Alexandra became ""visibly irate"" while the officer spoke with the driver of the vehicle, and began making demands as she got out of the car. The officer requested that she return to the vehicle, but according to police that only angered Alexandra more. After being threatened with the possibility of being arrested if she didn't get back inside the car, Alexandra struck the officer in his chest. When police tried to arrest her and take her into custody, she put up enough of a fight to require the officer to call for backup. Alexandra eventually complied with the arrest, but police say that while she was being booked she ""made several statements to the arresting officer"" that her dad Alan Jackson ""would do anything"" she wanted him to do. Police then warned Alexandra about making or attempting to bribe an officer. She's next due in court on September 23. As of now, Alan Jackson's reps have no comment. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Alan Jackson's daughter was arrested during a traffic stop in Nashville Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The picture of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer tilted on a lounge chair, hair flowing above her and shot from above has sparked a mini-firestorm among women. A significant number of women, feeling not too distanced from the days when women CEOs were just a fond hope, much less an aspiration, were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a Vogue fashion shoot. The fact that it was kind of sexy added just a little gasoline to the fire. But to be fair, the reaction was far from uniform; other women slammed back and said, "" Why not?"" ""She's earned the right to do anything she wants, and why not be sexy and a CEO? We don't have to wear the same uniform men do, we can do it our way"". Well, I am teetering towards the middle but coming down on the side of the disappointed. On the one hand, Marissa Mayer can't avoid the fact that she's a role model, even if she didn't start out to be one. Her picture seems to say to us, ""Here's a real me that's just as important as being a CEO. Look at how pretty and sexy I am!"" Now any woman can understand that. Sexed up and smart: Women debate Marissa Mayer's Vogue photo . Posing for the camera is always a narcissistic act, and I dare say, most women's first reaction to seeing themselves in a photo that surfaces in a newspaper, or in a private family shot, is ""how do I look?"" I plead guilty. But still, here's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains, does she still need to self-validate by having a beautiful fashion gig? What does that say to all the women who would never be beautiful enough to do that, but might be brainy enough to have her job? Should they feel "" less than Marissa"" because they can't qualify for the Vogue slot? Couldn't Marissa just take pictures that show her as a stylish and good-looking CEO rather than as a babe who is showing her great legs in $1,000 shoes? But then there is the other side. We all do love to look great and be admired. We understand the impulse. And why should she be denied her one month of being a famous fashonista? She's worked hard to gain the prominence she earned, and some girls, even very smart girls, do, just like the song says, ""just want to have fun""... at least occasionally. Mayer turns heads with photo shoot . I get it, and I get why she did it. But she has to take note of how pained a lot of women are about this fashion photo. Not just a few women felt hurt looking at the Mayer layout, wondering silently or out loud if acquiescing to this kind of shot means that for Mayer, and perhaps for other women, that ""making it"" and ""having it all"" needs to include being publicly admired for one's allure. That's a depressing thought for many talented women who are not beautiful or not sexy. They do not have that card to play and this layout could certainly make them wonder if selection for the top job requires being lovely. We women would like to feel that for at least some of us, sheer competence would make looks a non-issue in our lives. We would like to think that a brainiac like Marissa Mayer wouldn't need, perhaps would not want, to have a very public glamor shot as a career capstone. Unfortunately, it is not an exaggeration to say that Marissa Mayer is kind of saying, even though I am sure she did not mean to, that to have it all, sure, you have to be smart, but, let's face it, you also need to be beautiful. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer posed for stylish Vogue fashion shoot .

"Boston (CNN) -- Trying to show a softer, lighter side of accused killer and crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger, his defense lawyers have released photos that they say they would expect to show the jury should Bulger decide to testify. In response to a CNN question, his lawyers acknowledged, ""yes,"" they have prepared Bulger, 83, to take the stand as they would any other witness. ""Every criminal defendant has until the last witness is presented on the defense to make a decision as to whether he or she will testify,"" said the lead counsel, J. W. Carney. Bulger, his lawyers say, is calling the shots and will make the decision Friday after the defense reads testimony from one victim's mother and then calls its last two witnesses, an FBI secretary and admitted former hitman John Martorano. If Bulger does not testify, closing arguments will likely happen Monday. Bulger offers $822,000 to relatives of two murder victims . The 20 photos, released late Wednesday, show Bulger smiling and relaxed. Described as an animal lover, he's seen separately with dogs, a goat and a parrot. In one photo he is seen posing in front of the Stanley Cup. In others, he appears smiling with girlfriend Catherine Grieg, who went into hiding with Bulger in 1995 and who was arrested with him 16 years later in 2011 living under an alias in Santa Monica, California. One of the men featured in a photo with Bulger was identified as a defrocked, formerly high-ranking official of the Boston archdiocese, Frederick J. Ryan, according to the lawyer for two former Catholic Memorial School students who brought sexual molestation claims against the archdiocese in 2002. Attorney Mitchell Garabedian said that one of his clients and another person who worked with Ryan identified the former vice chancellor in the photo Thursday morning, after the images became public. Garabedian's clients' claims were acknowledged, and they received money as part of a settlement. Ryan was defrocked by the Vatican in 2006. ""If the defense were trying to show a kinder, gentler Whitey, it certainly backfired,"" Garabedian told CNN Thursday. Prosecutor Fred Wyshak objected to the photos, saying, ""I don't know if being an animal lover is going to salvage his reputation."" Bulger laughed at the remark. The personal photos are a stark contrast to the numerous surveillance images shown to the jury. Bulger is facing 19 counts of murder as part of a racketeering conspiracy, and 13 counts of extortion, racketeering and money-laundering. Bulger's lawyers have called five retired FBI agents who worked in Boston during Bulger's alleged reign of terror in the late 1970s and 1980s. The defense team has repeatedly raised questions surrounding what the FBI did and did not do in investigating internal corruption and protecting confidential informants. Victim's mother warned FBI about impending murder . Former Special Agent Matthew Cronin testified Thursday about rampant leaks in the Boston office that compromised several of his cases. Suspicion fell on Bulger's handler, agent John Connolly, currently serving 40 years for crimes relating to Bulger. Having worked in New York City, Cronin said of the Boston field office, ""Here everyone was interested in everyone else's business. You learned to keep your cards close to the vest."" On cross-examination, prosecutor Brian Kelly asked Cronin, ""If the FBI does a lousy job, that doesn't give a criminal the right to murder people, does it?"" Judge Denise Casper sustained the defense team's objection. Bulger, pale with a ring of gray stubble around his balding head, sits at the defense table either staring straight ahead or hunched over a pad taking notes. His brother Jackie has been court nearly every day, sitting in the front row reserved for Bulger's family. Nephew Billy Bulger Jr., son of former Massachusetts Senate President Billy Bulger, was also in court Thursday. Prosecutors wrapped up their case last week after calling 63 witnesses over 30 days. Casper is reviewing the defense's motion to include an additional charge of ""accessory after the fact to murder"" in Bulger's final charges. CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- There was a time when my biggest fear was getting my brain munched by zombies. But that childhood fright of Halloweens past has given way to a scare that often grips me as a journalist today -- the fear of failure. Alright, I know I'm not alone here. Many of you know exactly what I'm talking about. It's those moments of workplace indecision, avoidance, or perhaps procrastination all due to the simple fear of making a mistake on the job. So when I sat down with Trend Micro chief Eva Chen for CNN's ""Leading Women,"" I made sure to hit the topic. You see, just months into her job as CEO of the company, she had to manage through an episode of failure. Make that, monstrous failure. In 2005, one of the company's signature files caused computers worldwide to crash. The effects were so far-reaching, the bug even forced ever-timely trains in Japan to grind to a halt. Did that epic fail make Chen doubt herself or her ability to be the CEO? Not at all. Instead, she focused on a solution. ""There were two problems I tried to address,"" she tells me. ""One is external -- how do I help the system quickly recover? My customers' businesses need to continue. ""The second one is internal: how do I make sure that the values of Trend Micro -- innovation and 'dare to fail' -- really stayed."" Chen says the lessons learned from that mistake helped propel Trend Micro from a player in traditional antivirus software to the forefront of cloud computing protection. A company philosophy at Trend Micro reads as follows: ""We drive our growth by innovation; we encourage risk-taking and our management style dares you to fail."" That call to embrace failure, like firewalking or ""trust falls"" at a corporate retreat, can reek of management malarkey. But Chen is a leader who sincerely takes it to heart. To this day, she still doesn't know which employee was responsible for the faulty file that crashed computers across the planet. Nor does she ever want to know. Risk-taking and fear management came early in her career when Chen founded the company in 1988 with her brother-in-law, Steve Chang, and sister, Jenny Chang. Cold-calling potential customers, she found herself reluctant and afraid to speak on the phone. To address her phobia, Chen mined her memories and rediscovered a moment in early childhood when her mother was speaking on the telephone just as lightning struck a tree that fell inside their home and set ablaze the phone's wiring. ""The impression just made me feel that the telephone line would kill my mom,"" Chen tells me. ""So something that you never expect -- that image from my childhood -- actually became an obstacle when I tried to do business."" Chen says once she identified that fear, it went away. ""Every time you overcome one obstacle, you feel you've learned something and you grow. That's the joy of entrepreneurship and taking challenges."" So what is the one obstacle that is holding all of us back? Did you ever turn down a challenging assignment because the depressive realist inside said you couldn't do it? (I know I have.) How many times have you failed to truly speak your mind at a meeting? (Guilty. Many times over.) Instead of sitting on our hands, we should raise them high and dare to ask that question, make that assertion, or take on that new challenge. Like Eva Chen, we must lean into our fear to conquer it.","Eva Chen is CEO of Trend Micro -- a Japanese software security company .

"(CNN) -- When she was healthy, Olivia Wise used to sit in front of her locker at school and sing for her friends. She loved learning new things, and she wanted to be a pediatrician. Olivia is just 16, and she is dying of an inoperable brain tumor. In September, knowing that there was no more treatment available, the Toronto teen went to a recording studio to immortalize her voice -- one that has brought to joy to her family and friends in her short life. She sang Katy Perry's hit ""Roar."" In the video made of her recording, she sits meekly in a wheelchair, unable to stand or catch her breath. And then she gets to the first chorus. "" 'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar."" Her eyes squint, and a smile stretches across her face. Her joy is infectious. People in the studio begin to dance. As the song goes, Olivia sings, ""I got the eye of a tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire."" A few more chords, and the corners of her mouth rise again. ""Olivia is a fighter and has gone through the fire,"" her cousin wrote in the post under the video posting on YouTube. ""In fact, she was going through the fire while she recorded this song, but you wouldn't know it, because she was dancing right through it."" That recording was made on September 6. In the weeks that have followed, Wise's condition has deteriorated, but the response to her video has gone viral. The Liv Wise Fund, started in her name in support of brain tumor research, has raised more than $27,000, and the video got enough attention to prompt a response from Perry about how moved she was by Olivia. ""You sounded great,"" Perry said in a video she sent to the family, which was also posted to YouTube. ""I love you. A lot of people love you. ... Keep roaring."" Wise is at home now, and her family is making her as comfortable as possible. She is only conscious for moments at a time, her family said. ""Her health is really bad, she's at the end,"" her cousin Jeff Kassel said. ""She is still conscious at times and taking it all in."" In May: Teen boy featured in viral video dies . Wise was vacationing in Florida in January 2012 when she had a seizure. She was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of brain cancer. Immediately, she knew the prognosis was bad, but her mother says she has barely complained. ""Every day, she wished for a cure, and rarely succumbed to negative thoughts,"" her mom said. She insisted on keeping up with her studies until just a few weeks ago. ""To tell the truth, her diagnosis didn't change her personality,"" her mom said. ""It only enhanced it. She took the news in a mature, reasonable, responsible way. ... Even in the most difficult moments, she managed to bring laughter and friendship to all that were caring for her."" She woke up each day with a goal to find something bright, to be happy, her mom said. And she wasn't afraid of being vulnerable. So when a family friend with a recording studio offered her the opportunity, she went for it. ""It was spontaneous,"" Kassel said. ""And we didn't know with her health if she would be able to do it, but she did. For a 16-year-old, this is becoming her legacy, and it's such a beautiful thing.""

"(CNN) -- Leanne McCain said she didn't know about Wreaths Across America until her husband, Bryant, was killed in Afghanistan in November 2011. Now she's a big supporter of the program, which places holiday wreaths on his gravestone and the resting places of other war dead at Arlington National Cemetery. ""There are so many people who don't have any family or friends, especially the older veterans,"" said McCain, of San Antonio, Texas. ""For them to get a wreath at Christmas is incredible."" Thanks to a surge in donations, wreaths will cover more than half the gravestones at Arlington this year. Two weeks ago the group Wreaths Across America only had enough money for 95,000 wreaths at Arlington, far short of its goal of 135,000, said Amber Caron, Wreaths Across America spokeswoman. But news stories about the wreath shortage caused a flood of late donations. ""We ended up with more than our goal at Arlington, placing a little more than 143,000 wreaths there today,"" Caron said Saturday. About 25,000 people braved the cold to participate, she said. Donations came from all over. High school students attending School of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri, kicked in $5,000. School spokeswoman Emily Hughes said students were saddened by the wreath shortage because alumnus General Tommy Bell is buried in Arlington. ""The students have a club called Pitch in for Patriots and even though they were out of school due to snow, they used social media to message each other and voted to donate $5,000 of their club money,"" Hughes said. Caron said Arlington has about 240,000 grave markers. Volunteers always make sure to cover Section 60, the area of the cemetery with soldiers from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each wreath costs about $15 to make. The Worcester Wreath Co. in Maine makes the wreaths and trucks them to Arlington where they're fixed to the graves. The tradition started in 1992, when the company donated 5,000 wreaths. Caron said many people don't realize the program is funded by donations, not the government. McCain said she found out about Wreaths Across America through Facebook. ""For this organization to do this is incredible,"" she said. Last year, more than 400,000 wreaths were donated -- 100,000 to Arlington alone -- and placed at cemeteries in all 50 states. This year about 540,000 wreaths were placed nationwide, Caron said. Caron said the ultimate goal is to cover every gravestone in Arlington, which is marking its 150th anniversary next year. Any donations made to the group's website will go toward the 2014 effort, she said. People, groups or businesses can donate or sign up to volunteer at the organization's website.","Wreaths Across America placed 143,000 wreaths at Arlington .

"(CNN) -- In an abrupt 180, a Colorado soldier who tried to blame his identical twin brother for sex crimes pleaded guilty Tuesday to those same charges. Aaron Gregory Lucas, 32, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault on a child, three counts of enticement, two counts of indecent exposure and one count of kidnapping, according to a spokeswoman for the 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A judge in El Paso County ruled this month that Lucas would be allowed to name his twin brother, Brian Lucas, as a suspect in his defense. Sentencing for Aaron Lucas was set for February 28, said Lee Richards, the spokeswoman. ""There is no evidence to suggest that the twin brother of Aaron Lucas was in any way responsible for these crimes,"" said prosecutor Jennie Darby. ""It's unfortunate that his name was even brought into this case,"" added prosecutor Kelson Castain, according to a post on the Facebook page of the district attorney's office. Aaron Lucas is a decorated Army officer assigned to Fort Carson in Colorado Springs. His attorney, Ted McClintock, told the Colorado Springs Gazette that his client pleaded guilty because ""he wanted to do the right thing."" ""He loves his family. He doesn't want to create problems for them,"" the newspaper reported he said. McClintock did not immediately return an after-hours call for comment from CNN. So-called evil twin defenses have been used before in courtrooms. Defendants with an identical twin have sometimes accused the sibling of being the real culprit to try to create reasonable doubt and seek acquittal, but the finger-pointing isn't a sure-fire strategy, said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos, who's also a criminal defense attorney. ""No two of us have the same set of DNA -- with one exception, and that is identical twins,"" Cevallos said.

CNN affiliate KGMB-TV reported that the Honolulu Fire Department recovered the body of Willis Wilson, 21, about 7:30 a.m., three hours after he vanished from the beach. Wilson and two other people were in knee-deep water when the wave hit them, fire officials told KGMB. The other two people, and two more on the beach, could not locate Wilson. After an air, land and sea search, authorities found Wilson's body.

"(CNN) -- In a soft voice, teenager Austin Sigg confessed in gruesome detail how he snatched a 10-year-old girl from his Colorado neighborhood and dismembered her. But what Sigg could not explain to police detectives is why. ""It was a random place, a random time. Random everything,"" Sigg told officers in interrogation video released this week. ""I was just driving and just kind of looking. And I saw her ... found the place to park. And I parked, and I waited. And she walked by, and I grabbed her."" Sigg is going to have a lot of time to think about it. He was sentenced to life in prison last week. The tapes released this week by the Jefferson County District Attorney give a chilling look into Sigg's thoughts. Sigg was 17 when he grabbed Jessica Ridgeway off the street in October 2012. I told her everything would be OK . Sigg told police during the interrogation that he got her into his car. He tied her hands and legs together and drove around for 20 minutes as she frantically screamed and asked him questions. ""I would lie to her,"" Sigg said. ""I would tell her everything was going to be OK. I would just lie to her."" He took the bespectacled, blond girl back to his house. What happened there may have been very graphic. Parts of the interrogation tape were redacted by authorities. Sigg made girls in the area uneasy . Eligible for parole . Sigg will be eligible for parole after 40 years for the murder. But a judge sentenced him to close to 100 additional years for the other charges against him.

Using all those charges against Sigg, the judge said he expects Sigg to be confined to a cell for the rest of his natural life. Turned in by his mother . Jessica Ridgeway was missing for five days and authorities were searching everywhere in October 2012. The break in the case came after Sigg told his mother what he had done.

"(CNN) -- In the last few weeks, the media has been ablaze with news of the government shutdown, the debt limit and health care reform. Missing from most public debate, however, is the cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that will take place on November 1 and will affect every one of the more than 47 million Americans who depend on the program to help meet their basic nutritional needs. When the changes are implemented, everyone enrolled in the SNAP program will see their benefits cut. For example, a family of four that qualifies for the maximum monthly benefit will lose $36 a month -- that's a 5% reduction. While this may not seem like a lot, I speak from experience when I say $36 provides much more than you might think. This past September, I participated in the SNAP challenge. For a week, I stuck to a budget of about $1.50 per meal, the average SNAP benefit for one person. It was a tough week. I found myself drained and constantly thinking of food. When the SNAP cuts take effect next week, benefits will average about $1.40 per meal. I can't imagine the strain this will place on struggling families who are counting every penny and trying to stretch their benefits. Eatocracy: The food stamp challenge . Most families do not have enough to make it through the month already -- 90% of SNAP benefits are redeemed by the third week of the month and 58% of food bank clients currently receiving SNAP turn to food banks for help at least six months out of the year. The upcoming cuts will result in an increased need for food assistance at food pantries and soup kitchens across the nation when many are already stretched meeting sustained high need in the wake of the recession. At Feeding America, we're doing everything we can to prepare our network of food banks for the increased demand, but charity alone cannot make up for the impending $5 billion loss in SNAP funding. The reduced funding will result in the loss of nearly 1.9 billion meals in the next year. That's more than half of Feeding America's total projected output for 2014. The cuts this week are significant and will put a strain on millions of families struggling with food insecurity, hitting them right before the holiday season. Adding to this is the fact that Congress is considering much deeper cuts to SNAP benefits and eligibility restrictions that will affect millions of low-income people as part of the farm bill. In September, the House passed legislation cutting $40 billion in SNAP over the next 10 years, according to a Feeding America analysis. Together with this week's cuts, the pending legislation will result in a loss of nearly 3.4 billion meals for low-income Americans in 2014 alone, according to a Feeding America analysis. These are meals our most vulnerable citizens cannot afford to lose, and food banks and other charities simply cannot fill that gap. While we cannot stop this week's SNAP cuts, we can prevent further cuts from taking place. Call your member of Congress and tell them not to cut SNAP. Helping our neighbors in need is a fundamental American value, and fighting hunger is a public-private partnership. We need a strong charitable system and a strong federal anti-hunger safety net. Working together, individuals, charities, business and government can solve hunger. Do your part to make sure no one in America goes hungry.

"(CNN) -- So what did we learn at Sunday night's Golden Globe Awards? First off, we learned that sketch comedians are so much better at giving acceptance speeches than rock stars, screenwriters and actors who've won Oscars and Emmys for dramatic roles. ""Who knew?"" as Andy Samberg put it when he delivered one of the evening's most compact acceptances, for best lead actor in a TV comedy or musical in Fox's ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" (a surprise winner for best comedy series, by the way.) We also learned that actresses say the darnedest things on TV when they're drinking a lot. (What was that Cate Blanchett said about Judy Garland and barbiturates when she got the Globe for best actress in a drama in ""Blue Jasmine""?) One trusts that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which sponsors the awards, has also learned that when you nominate somebody four times for a Golden Globe over four decades without giving her one, you'd better be prepared for retributive pain when you finally come through. Though I have to admit that as the ceremonies trudged along, part of me was hoping Jacqueline Bissett, who finally won a Globe for best supporting actress in a TV movie, miniseries or series as a lonely dowager in ""Dancing on the Edge,"" would get called back for more ragged stream-of-consciousness and disregard for decorum. The authenticity of her speech, which included a bleeped expletive, somehow burst through the ceremony's glitz -- and, at 69, she still made for a gorgeous-looking train wreck. But did we learn for sure who's going to win the Academy Awards on March 2? Not really. 5 things we learned from the 2014 Golden Globes . It's true that Blanchett came away as big a favorite in her category as she was before the pipes burst earlier that night, flooding the red carpet. But nothing short of a tsunami will stop her appointment with the best actress Oscar for her rendering of a shattered socialite. The rest are not so clear. ""12 Years a Slave"" won the best drama Globe, matching most advance expectations. But it didn't win as many Globes as the best comedy or musical winner, ""American Hustle."" Both Amy Adams' win for best actress in a comedy or musical (which was mildly unexpected) and Jennifer Lawrence's win for best supporting actress (which wasn't) seemed to boost ""Hustle's"" profile in the Oscar race. But both ""Hustle's"" director, David O. Russell, and ""Slave's"" director, Steve McQueen, lost the best director race to Alfonso Cuaron for his orchestration of the harrowing ""Gravity."" Let's face facts: Though some insist on seeing the Globes as an Oscar tip sheet, you can't easily align awards that split their categories between comedy and drama with those that don't. Period. There have been some years where a Globe drama winner gets the best picture Oscar (2001's ""A Beautiful Mind"") and the comedy-musical winner doesn't (""Moulin Rouge!""). Then there are those years when the opposite is true. (1998, when ""Shakespeare in Love"" won best picture while ""Saving Private Ryan"" didn't). And then, too, there are those years when neither of the Globe winners is in the best picture winner at the Oscars (1992, when ""The Silence of the Lambs"" bested both ""Bugsy"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and 1993, when both ""Scent of a Woman"" and ""The Player"" lost to ""Unforgiven,"" and 1991, when ... and we could go on and on ...). So as usual, we're left at the end of another Golden Globes show wondering, what exactly was the point? That is, besides the comedy factor, both intended (hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who didn't have nearly as much to do this year as last) and unintended. Golden Globes: Best moments and GIFs . Maybe it's best to look at the Globes less as tea leaves or portents for future awards and more as shiny paper for the global village to unwrap every January as the true beginning of Hollywood's ritual of self-congratulation. The various film critics awards are (for the most part, anyway) more measured and thoughtful signals as to what will be taken seriously between holiday openings and Oscar night. But the Globes are when the moms, mall rats and reality-show audiences begin noticing what the more serious and solemn movies are doing with themselves as their makers and actors campaign for support from the Academy voters. You can downgrade their importance or dismiss their results as much as you like. But the Golden Globes are, like it or not, an Occasion-with-a-capital-O, much like weddings, Thanksgiving and other rituals that often provoke sentiment and warmth -- and slavishness and inappropriate behavior. So wait for the trade awards to get their results out and hope that whomever's in charge of these awards doesn't take anything Bissett says too seriously. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: What did Golden Globes show? Actress + drinking = interesting speech .
He says Blanchett, Bissett livened things up with frank remarks; hosts had less to do .
He says even with two best picture awards, Globes are flawed predictor of Oscar winners .

"(CNN) -- Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia are seen as the most corrupt nations in the world, according to Transparency International's latest survey, released Tuesday. More than two thirds of the 177 countries included in the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index scored below 50, where 0 indicates the country's public sector is seen as highly corrupt and 100 as very clean. Denmark and New Zealand performed best with scores of 91. Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia tied last with 8 points each. ""All countries still face the threat of corruption at all levels of government, from the issuing of local permits to the enforcement of laws and regulations,"" said Huguette Labelle, Transparency International's Chair in a statement. In Syria, where 100,000 have died in a conflict which began in 2011 and has now exploded into war, people regard its public sector as increasingly corrupt. The stricken nation dropped 9 points from 144th place to 168th. Libya, Yemen, Spain, Australia, Guatemala and Madagascar were among the other countries whose scores declined significantly. Myanmar saw the biggest improvement, rising from 5th last position in 2012 to 19 places from the bottom this year. The change reflects the benefits of introducing more open and democratic rules after years of military rule, according to Transparency International's Asia Pacific Director, Srirak Plipat. Myanmar also ratified an international treaty against corruption in December 2012 and the parliament approved an anti-corruption law in July, although this is yet to come into force. While Greece's score rose four points this year to 40, but remained the lowest ranking country in the European Union in 80th place. Brunei, Laos, Senegal, Nepal, Estonia, Lesotho and Latvia also improved. The UK jumped from 17th to 14th place with a score of 76, two points up from last year. The U.S. did not change from last year, ranking 19th with a score of 73. China's rank did not change. Australia dropped two places to 9th position with a score of 81. The Corruption Perceptions Index is based on perceptions of corruption in public institutions like political parties, police and justice systems according to experts and business people. Strong access to information systems and rules governing the behavior of public officials can help a country improve, while a lack of accountability and weak public institutions damages these perceptions, Transparency International said. The organization called on public institutions and officials to be more open, adding that corruption remains notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute.","Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia are seen as the most corrupt nations in the world .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Pro-independence parties in Catalonia defied the Spanish government Thursday by announcing in Barcelona that they plan to hold a referendum in November on whether the wealthy northeast region should be independent. Madrid staunchly opposes the referendum and Catalan independence, and a Spanish government official rejected the announcement. ""The vote will not be held,"" Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon told reporters Thursday in the hallways of Spain's parliament. Even supporters admit that there is much to be done before the vote can take place on November 9, 2014. ""We expect to open negotiations with Madrid. The Spanish state can't be blind about it,"" said Joan Maria Pique, a top aide and spokesman for Catalan regional president Artur Mas, who had a prominent role Thursday when his Convergence and Union party announced the plan with three other parties. They had previously said only that the vote would be sometime in late 2014. And they also announced the two-part referendum question: . Do you want Catalonia to become a state? And if the voter answers yes, then comes this: Do you want that state to be independent? That's a different formula from the single question that Scottish voters are due to get on September 18: Should Scotland be an independent country?"" Pique said the two-part question in Catalonia was the result of negotiations among the four pro-independence parties, but he noted that Great Britain has agreed to allow the Scottish vote on self-determination, while Spain has not followed suit yet for Catalonia. The Spanish government says that Catalonia, with 7.5 million people, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. And Madrid insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away, even one like Catalonia that has its own flag and language. The four pro-independence Catalan parties hold a majority in the Catalan regional parliament. There have been mass demonstrations in favor of self-determination on the past two Catalan national days on September 11. This year, hundreds of thousands of people formed a human chain -- from northern Catalonia, at the French border, to its southern border with the Valencia region -- to drive home the point. Last year on September 11, an estimated 1.5 million people demonstrated in Barcelona, the regional capital and Spain's second-largest city, for self-determination. Various opinion polls show a very large majority of Catalans want the right of self-determination. But if independence makes it to the ballot, polls show the result could be tighter, with some predicting a victory in the 50% range.","Referendum is set for November 9, 2014, pro-independence parties say .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Already difficult, traveling to Cuba from the United States may soon be getting a lot harder.

The move could severely impact Cuban-Americans' ability to visit family on the island. The U.S. State Department said Wednesday it will try to assist Cuba's bid for a solution. Cubans who spend more than two years away from the island are required by the Cuban government to apply for permission to return, even for a short visit.

M&T Bank, based in Buffalo, New York, did not immediately respond to an inquiry from CNN regarding the matter. The State Department said it was a ""business decision."" ""We cannot force a private bank to provide services to a diplomatic mission,"" the State Department said.

According to Cuban government statistics, nearly 100,000 U.S. citizens traveled to Cuba last year, despite the decades-old U.S. travel ban. The Obama administration in 2009 allowed Cubans with family on the island to make unlimited trips to the island and permitted U.S. citizens engaging in ""people-to-people"" travel with a licensed tour guide to visit the island. ""The [Interests] Section particularly regrets the affect this situation will have on Cuban citizens and Americans,"" the Cuban statement said. ""It will have negative consequences on family visits, exchanges of an academic, cultural, educational, scientific and sporting nature between Cuba and the US.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities early Friday captured a man accused of killing his mother and stepfather who escaped from a South Carolina mental health facility. Jason Mark Carter, 39, was committed after he was found incompetent to stand trial in the killings eight years ago. Carter escaped the mental institution about 10 a.m. Thursday, apparently stealing a van from a state hospital, authorities said. He later purchased a Chevrolet Lumina, and South Carolina authorities pinged his cell phone as he was traveling on Interstate 40 in Tennessee, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said in a prepared statement. Shortly before 7 a.m., a trooper saw Carter's car outside a hotel, where he was taken into custody without incident.

"London (CNN) -- The judge in the fraud trial of two former assistants to celebrity chef Nigella Lawson told the jury Thursday to disregard comments made by Prime Minister David Cameron in relation to the case. The start of proceedings was delayed while the judge considered press reports centering on comments Cameron made regarding Lawson, a prosecution witness, during an interview with a journalist. Judge Robin Johnson said, ""It is of regret when someone in public office comments about a person who is involved in a trial that is in progress. What public officials feel about (a) witness should have no bearing on your own thoughts."" The two former assistants, Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, both deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds from Lawson and her ex-husband, Charles Saatchi. The Spectator magazine article, with remarks by Cameron, was read out in court. In the article published Tuesday, a journalist writes that, since the case is ongoing, he did not expect an answer when he asked Cameron if he is ""on Team Nigella,"" a term her supporters use to refer to themselves on Twitter. "" 'I am,' he (Cameron) says. 'I'm a massive fan, I've had the great pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm person, but I'm also an amateur cook and I like her recipes. Nancy (Cameron's 9-year-old daughter) and I sometimes watch a bit of Nigella on telly. Not in court, I hasten to add.' "" 'White powder, rolled up bank notes' Testifying in her defense at Isleworth Crown Court, Elisabetta Grillo, 41, with an Italian translator by her side, was questioned about allegations of drug use by Lawson. Grillo said she had never seen Lawson take drugs, but that she was aware that she used cocaine and cannabis. She recounted seeing a fake book that was like a box that had white powder inside. She also recounted finding a packet containing white powder in the bathroom, rolled up bank notes and credit cards and CDs with traces of white powder on them. Asked by her lawyer how often she saw signs of cocaine use over the years she worked for the family, Grillo said, ""Every three days, I don't know, regularly."" Grillo said she thought Lawson knew that her assistant was aware of the drugs use but that ""it was not open."" She did not raise it with the chef, Grillo said. Lawson's children told Grillo their mother was smoking cannabis, Grillo told the court. They said it helped her to sleep, she said. In her testimony last week, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user, saying, ""I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem."" Saatchi had said in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in his testimony before the court he backed off that claim. In the e-mail, which was shared with the court by the defense in a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the two assistants would probably ""get off"" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" 'Allowed to use card' Giving evidence Thursday, Grillo said she had been in London since 1999 and had worked for Lawson and her first husband, the late John Diamond, first part time and then as a full-time nanny for their children. Grillo said she'd seen them as a second family and had had a great relationship with Lawson. She described the household as being less happy after Lawson married Saatchi, saying he was ""difficult"" and ""very shouty."" The sisters are accused of spending large sums on luxury goods for themselves on company credit cards they were supposed to use for household expenses. But Elisabetta Grillo told the court that Lawson had allowed her to use the company card, which she was given in 2007, for personal expenses such as clothing, shoes and dental fees. ""Once she sent me to very nice hairdresser in Kings Road, she said, 'You can use Charles' card' to straighten my hair and buy makeup if I go out,"" Grillo said of Lawson. Grillo said she had never been told not to use the card for personal expenditure and that she did not believe she'd done anything wrong. Asked about purchases which the prosecution said were unauthorized, Grillo said each one had been approved. Grillo said she was ""sad"" that the relationship had ended the way it had, after 14 years. The last time she spoke with Nigella Lawson was in June, she said. The chef had asked her to appear in her latest project and, Grillo said, ""sent me a message saying how happy she was that I was in her life."" Grillo's lasagna recipe is included in the chef's book ""Nigellissima,"" she said. Public argument . The trial has been closely followed by the UK media because of its high-profile witnesses, Lawson and Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. The allegations of drug use emerged in June, around the time Lawson and Saatchi were photographed having an argument in a restaurant. In the photos, which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers, Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat and appears to pinch and look up her nose. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon afterward. Lawson, widely referred to as a ""domestic goddess"" in Britain after the title of one of her cook books, has also appeared as a judge on ABC's ""The Taste"" in the United States. A second season of the show is due to air in January. Testimony in the case will continue Friday.","Elisabetta Grillo describes signs of cocaine use but says she didn't see Lawson take drugs .

"(CNN) -- Did you know that buying American seafood could save a whale? A new report from the Natural Resources Defense Council finds that 91% of seafood consumed in the United States is imported and nearly every wild-caught foreign fish product sold in the U.S. violates the Marine Mammal Protection Act, endangering the lives of marine mammals around the world. Countries exporting fish to America are supposed to prove they use safe methods to catch fish destined for the U.S. market. But for decades the U.S. has failed to enforce this law. That means whales, dolphins and sea lions are at risk, and American fishermen who invest in safer methods have a disadvantage in the marketplace. It works like this. Commercial fishing fleets target species for the global market, including American consumers. They go after the seafood we love to eat like shrimp, salmon, tuna, crab, and lobster, setting traps and casting gillnets, purse seines, trawls and longlines. But in the course of catching the target species, they often entangle, trap and hook other animals like non-target fish, seabirds, sea turtles and marine mammals. It's a tragedy for those animals caught in the wrong place and the wrong time -- collateral damage that may cause some populations to go extinct. There are ways to reduce this harm. Until the U.S. enforces the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which requires importing countries to prove they are meeting American standards, consumers can play a role in protecting whales, dolphins and sea lions. When making sustainable fish purchases consider helping marine mammals by buying American-caught wild seafood. In many parts of the world, poor fishing practices are driving populations and species of marine mammals to extinction. Research estimate that more than 650,000 whales, dolphins and other marine mammals are killed or seriously injured every year by foreign fishing fleets after getting trapped, entangled, or hooked in commercial fishing gear. While U.S. fishers and foreign fishers exporting to the U.S. are required to comply with the MMPA to reduce this unintended ""bycatch"" of marine mammals, the U.S. currently enforces the law against U.S. fishers, but lets most foreign fishers off the hook with its failure to enforce the law. After 40 years, the government has indicated it is finally moving to require that imported seafood meets U.S. standards for marine mammal bycatch. We know about whale, dolphin and sea lion populations suffering from bycatch from fisheries that likely export at least some of their product to the United States. We found that North Atlantic right whales, New Zealand sea lions, Mediterranean sperm whales, vaquitas, spinner dolphins in the Indian Ocean, Baltic and Black Sea harbor porpoises, J-stock minke whales and false killer whales in the Western and Central Pacific are threatened by fisheries bycatch and that enforcing the MMPA's provision against imports from these fisheries could force foreign fishing fisheries to adopt better practices that would save the lives of animals from these populations. Enforcement won't be easy and won't necessarily be quick. Motivating foreign fisheries around the globe to adopt better practices that will benefit marine mammals is a tall order. But continued access to the U.S. market is a great motivator. While some fisheries may decide it's not worth the hassle, others will view protecting marine mammals as an opportunity to continue a lucrative relationship with American consumers who love fish, but also want to know that foreign fisheries are working to limit harm to the whales, dolphins and sea lions that they also love. The greatest danger at this point is that the U.S. government will drag its feet and issue enforcement regulations that are too weak or otherwise run afoul of other binding agreements, like World Trade Organization requirements that bar treating countries unequally. The government could also continue the status quo by failing to take any action to hold foreign fisheries accountable. For 40 years, federal watchdogs have failed to enforce a law that could save thousands of whales and dolphins from negligent foreign fishing practices each year. Until foreign fleets see real consequences for failing to abide by the law, marine mammals will continue to be harmed around the world and American fishermen will be disadvantaged. No one wants their shrimp cocktail to come with a side of dolphin, but that's essentially what's happening when we eat imported fish that isn't held to the same standards as American seafood. Next time you order that tuna steak, ask where it was caught and consider voting with your wallet and only buy American, wild-caught seafood. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zak Smith.","Zak Smith: Did you know that buying American seafood could save a whale?
Smith: Much of wild-caught foreign fish product sold in U.S. endanger marine mammals .
He says since 90% of seafood eaten in the U.S. is imported, consumers have a say .
Smith: Demand foreign fisheries use safer methods to avoid catching dolphins, whales ."
"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two attacks carried out against Palestinians in recent days, one in Jerusalem and the other on the West Bank, have prompted some uncomfortable questions in Israel about racism toward Arabs. In one incident, Jamal Julani, a 17-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem, was beaten unconscious by a group of teenagers in West Jerusalem. He spent several days in the hospital recovering from his injuries. On the same day, August 16, a taxi carrying a Palestinian family close to the Israeli settlement of Bat Ayin on the West Bank was firebombed. All six family members were injured, one badly. Three children, ages 12 and 13, have been arrested on suspicion of throwing the gasoline bomb. Seven minors, as well as an adult, were indicted in the Jerusalem case Tuesday. Among the charges they face are incitement to racism, incitement to violence and aggravated assault, and motivated racism. The youth of the alleged perpetrators and the fact they appear to have targeted their victims because of their race, and in the West Bank case possibly also as a result of tensions between settlers and Palestinians over land, have shocked many in Israel. Some believe an environment of conflict and lack of tolerance have combined to create dangerous behavioral instincts in the youth on both sides, undermining the chances of a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Jerusalem city councilor Laura Wharton, who grew up in the United States but has lived in Israel for many years, wrote in her blog that ""apart from sorrow I can only express my shame that such a thing could happen in my country."" In the wake of the attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a strongly worded statement expressing the government's ""complete opposition to racism and violence."" But some, Wharton among them, say this is not enough to tackle the deeper issues at stake. Jamal Julani's cousin, 18-year-old Nu'oman Julani, described to CNN how the pair were in West Jerusalem to shop for Eid when they ran into a group of about 50 Israeli settler youths shouting racist slogans in Zion Square. Nu'oman Julani said they tried to avoid the group, splitting off in different directions. ""All of sudden, I saw a group of these extremist Jews run after my cousin and start beating him up,"" he told CNN. ""I followed to stop the fight and I was personally beaten as well, but not as much as my cousin, who was knocked unconscious to the ground when he sustained a direct hit to the chest and heart."" The beating continued until the police arrived on the scene. ""I thought that my cousin was dead because I saw his eyes rolled backwards and he looked blue, but a man helped in resuscitating him,"" Nu'oman Julani said. ""I have one question, why is this happening? What did we do to deserve this? I hope they get the highest possible punishment for this crime they did."" An Israeli ambulance service spokesman confirmed to CNN that one of its operatives had helped to resuscitate the teenager, whose heart had stopped beating. He said the teenager was taken to hospital but that the lack of visible injuries led medical staff to believe he was suffering from a heart complaint not caused by the incident. Speaking from his son's hospital bedside, Abu Akram Julani said he was relieved that Jamal had regained consciousness, and that he did not remember what had happened that night. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN an incident of a sexual nature between a 15-year-old Jewish girl and an Arab Israeli a few weeks earlier had been a factor in the disturbance. The girl had told her friends about that incident, he said, ""and that's what stirred up all of the tension, and then they started walking the streets and cursing the Arabs and then a brawl and a fight broke out."" The indictment filed with the Jerusalem court describes how on that night a large group of boys had started shouting racist abuse and ""pushing, punching and kicking"" some Arabs who passed them. When they spotted Julani and three other Arabs near Zion Square, they started to run after them, it says. The accused then beat Julani ""until he lost consciousness and his breathing and his heart stopped, so he needed resuscitation and needed hospitalization for several days."" Netanyahu's statement condemning the attacks came five days later, after a weekend in which the story gathered steam in the media. ""In the state of Israel, we are not prepared to tolerate racism; neither are we prepared to tolerate the combination of racism and violence,"" he said. ""This is something that we cannot accept -- not as Jews, not as Israelis. This is not our way; this goes against our way, and we condemn it in word and deed. We will quickly bring to justice those responsible for this reprehensible incident."" Vice Prime Minister and Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Ya'alon also condemned the firebombing as a ""terrorist act"" that ran counter to national values, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper. The hate crimes ""are intolerable, outrageous and must be firmly dealt with,"" he is quoted as saying. Wharton, of the left-wing Meretz party, told CNN Wednesday the statements from Netanyahu and others condemning the violence are welcome -- but the government seems unlikely to take on the deep-rooted issues behind the attacks. She believes the incidents are a symptom of three highly concerning trends. ""One is a question of racism, which is definitely on the rise in Israel and is very worrisome to, I think, just about everyone except for a worrisome combination of extreme right and extreme religious groups,"" she said. A second is the issue of rising violence in Israel, particularly among the younger generation, she said, in contrast to a tradition of low levels of violent crime despite the threat of terrorism. The third has to do with a growing number of ultra-orthodox youth who drop out of school but whose highly religious education and upbringing have left them unable to adjust to regular society, Wharton said. ""Those kids, they leave these schools and they are suddenly exposed to a whole world they haven't seen before. They don't know how to behave, they get involved in drugs or crime,"" she said. At the same time, racism is also increasing in mainstream schools, she said, in part as a by-product of Israel's long history of conflict and the distrust built up following scores of attacks by Palestinian militants. She believes more must be done in schools to emphasize the need for peaceful coexistence, in line with traditional Jewish values, and to warn against stereotyping and violence. On a more hopeful note, several hundred people joined an event in Zion Square two nights after the attack on Julani to demonstrate against racism, Wharton noted in her blog. Naomi Schacter, an associate director of Shatil, an initiative of the New Israel Fund, echoes the sentiment that words of condemnation from politicians are not enough to tackle the problem. ""With racism rising in this country, and chants and graffiti calling for 'death to the Arabs' becoming a distressingly common event, it is clear that such reactive public statements are not sufficient,"" she wrote in an opinion piece in The Times of Israel following the assaults. ""Not only swift and vigorous action against the perpetrators of such criminal attacks, but also a paradigm shift in public rhetoric, are necessary to halt the trend."" The responses posted below her piece attest to the divisive nature of the debate. The latest assaults are not the only incidents to prompt soul-searching in Israel in recent months. A number of so-called ""price tag"" attacks -- a term frequently used to describe acts of vandalism by radical Israeli settlers exacting a ""price"" against Palestinian targets or Israeli security forces in response to actions by the Israeli government -- have targeted Palestinian mosques and property. High-profile incidents involving intolerance toward African immigrants, some of whom have entered illegally after fleeing conflict in Sudan and Eritrea, have also sparked internal debate about whether the country is facing growing racism. While some Israelis accuse the illegal African immigrants of increasing levels of crime, suffocating the infrastructure and changing the fabric of Israel, others ask how a country founded by Jews trying to escape persecution can turn against anyone trying to escape danger in their own lands. The government is seeking to deport tens of thousands of the migrants to their homelands, despite fears for their safety there. At the same time, the thorny issue of whether Israel's ultra-orthodox community, known as the Haredim, should serve in the military or in civil service has come under the spotlight. Netanyahu's government last month lost its main coalition partner, centrist political faction Kadima, over failed attempts to agree on an alternative to the law that exempts ultra-orthodox men from serving in the Israeli army. The prime minister had hoped to reach a consensus with the Haredim, who oppose changes to the law. His Likud party has traditionally aligned with the ultra-orthodox factions as coalition partners. Controversy over attempts by some in the Haredim to enforce a strict form of gender segregation and rules of modesty on females outside of their community also exercised many Israelis this year. The Haredim, who make up approximately 10% of the country according to government figures, are the fastest growing segment of the population -- and tensions between Israel's different communities seem unlikely to go away just yet. This story is based on reporting by Enas Muthaffar and Paul Colsey in Jerusalem. It was written by Laura Smith-Spark in London.","Two recent attacks on Palestinians have prompted questions about racism in Israel .

"(CNN) -- In what is becoming an annual rite of fall, tablet makers are rushing to release a fresh selection of devices this month in time for the competitive holiday-shopping season. Let's start with market leader Apple, which is expected to unveil new iPads on Tuesday in San Francisco. At 1 p.m. ET, Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the stage in front of an auditorium of journalists and announce updated products with the help of some videos, other Apple executives and possibly a live product demonstration or two. We'll be live-blogging the announcement here at CNN.com/tech. The main attraction is expected to be upgrades to Apple's iPad line of tablets. The iPad Mini will likely inherit the high-resolution retina display that came out on last-year's full-size iPad. The fifth-generation iPad will probably get a slight design makeover, slimming down and dropping a bit of weight. Expect to see faster processors speeding up both devices. A fingerprint-sensor security system, like the one on the new iPhone 5S, is also a possibility but is less likely. There have also been rumors, fueled in part by Apple's ""We still have a lot to cover"" invite, about a keyboard cover for the iPad, like the ones on Microsoft's rival Surface tablets. Apple also could include some Mac upgrade news by announcing release dates for the new, redesigned Mac Pro and its latest Mac operating system, OS X Mavericks. (Analysts don't expect to see a refreshed line of iPods this time around. Nor will we likely see a smartwatch or an Apple TV set. Sorry.) But Apple's not the only tablet manufacturer announcing news this week. Microsoft is releasing the latest versions of its Surface tablets, and Nokia is expected to announce new Windows 8 devices on Tuesday. But as rivals catch up to the once-dominant iPad and the marketplace gets flooded with new tablets, it's getting harder for competitors to set themselves apart. ""Tablets are a maturing market; there's not much competitors can do to differentiate at this point."" said Sarah Rotman Epps, a senior analyst at Forrester Research.""Replacement sales are growing much, much faster than new sales worldwide,"" she added. ""You're competing for customers you already have."" Now the companies are going after emerging markets, and that's where price will be a more important factor, Epps said. ""Everyone is looking at Apple as the gold standard ... (and) in that position they don't have to hit rock bottom with their prices to justify their product,"" she said. Touchscreen tablets have become hugely popular since the first iPad was released in 2010. According to a recent study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 35% of all Americans older than 16 now own a tablet, and 24% have e-readers like Amazon's Kindle. The hunger for tablets, which are quickly crowding out the PC, is expected to jump another 79% by 2017, according to research firm IDC. Apple is still the dominant tablet manufacturer, but competing products are steadily nibbling away at its lead. In the second quarter of this year, Apple had 32% of the global tablet market, a sharp decline from the 60% it had the same time a year before, according to IDC. Samsung is the second-largest tablet maker. This year, people will weigh features like price and size -- tablets can start at 6 inches (typically a hybrid between a smartphone and a tablet) and go up to 10 inches or more. Most have only slight differences in exterior design, including variations in weight and thickness, texture and color. But when it comes to giant flat rectangles with one side dominated entirely by a screen, it's the software, speed and screen quality that matter most. Some people are loyal to specific ecosystems, choosing Android or iOS products based on the apps and content they already own or the selection of popular apps available for the devices. Some devices promote unique features, like the new Kindle HDX from Amazon that features live, video-chat tech support available anytime for free. Google released a new version of its 7-inch Nexus tablet over the summer. Samsung also has a line of popular Galaxy Tab Android devices.","Apple is expected to announce updates to its line of iPad tablets on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a mother, ostracized and isolated for years because her son is mentally ill, suddenly receiving thousands of messages of support, thanking her for coming forward and calling her heroic. That's what Stephanie Escamilla experienced after CNN Digital published my story and Evelio Contreras' video, ""My son is mentally ill,"" so listen up. The response has been overwhelming. Thousands of messages via e-mail, Twitter and Facebook have poured in -- from across America and from around the world, including Zimbabwe, the Netherlands and South Africa. Many were from mothers fighting their private struggle with their own children, from fathers, from nurses, from psychiatrists. Others opened up their hearts, describing years of agony dealing with their own mental illness before stabilizing. My inbox was flooded with supportive messages that were forwarded on to Stephanie. Many carried this message: Please know that it can get better. ""I can't thank you enough on behalf of all the mothers out there that deal with mentally ill children,"" one mom e-mailed. ""I admire that woman so greatly for what she does and for the entire family allowing to share their story."" Legislation seeks to improve mental health system . Stephanie risked much in coming forward, especially the fear it could send her son in a downward spiral. One family doctor even objected to her doing so. But she felt that educating the nation about the struggles of raising a child with mental illness was worth it -- and that in so doing, her son could improve, too. Her risk seems to have paid off. Stephanie shared some of the messages sent to the family with her son, Daniel, who suffers from bipolar disorder with episodes of psychosis. His response astonished her: ""Mom, I wanted to tell you that I finally can say that I accept myself for who I am,"" he said. ""I am not my mental illness; I am me."" For Stephanie, that statement marked tremendous progress and underscored why she decided to speak out. Her resolve has only intensified. The family has set up a website, SavingDaniel.com, for people to communicate with Stephanie and Daniel and seek help. Stephanie hopes to create a foundation in the coming months to help change the stigma around mental illness. She also hopes to realize a longtime dream to speak to middle and high school students in San Antonio. Anything to better educate. Mental illness in children: Where to turn . One woman messaged via Facebook that she had endured a similar struggle as Stephanie in raising her son, now a highly functioning 23-year-old. ""My advice to the mom you interviewed: Be a bulldog on britches, never let go,"" wrote Marie Bond. ""It will get better, I promise you that."" Readers also thanked us for our understanding and sensitivity in telling Stephanie and Daniel's story. Many parents raising mentally ill children said they wished they had the courage to tell their story like Stephanie. On Twitter, I received hundreds of messages echoing @crosscutlureRVA's sentiment: ""Thank you for telling her story. Represents so many stories around the country."" ""This was a fantastic article, and I am heartened to see it published on CNN,"" Allison McKenzie said in an e-mail. ""So many families and people are suffering under the incredible burden of dealing with mental illness, and it's particularly difficult when it involves children."" Many called the issue of mental illness the most important story of our time, yet one that is routinely ignored. They pointed out that children can now stay on their parents' health care plans until the age of 26, yet a mentally ill son or daughter can make all their own health care decisions when they turn 18 -- regardless of parental input. That's resulted in our jails and prisons being filled with people with mental disorders, readers pointed out, and all too often our cemeteries, too. ""The problem no one seems to address is when these kids turn 18, we as parents no longer have control,"" e-mailed Mia St. John, a world champion boxer who cares for her mentally ill son. ""The parents will tell the same the story: There was nothing we could do or our hands were tied. I have been fighting the system for years and nothing will change until we are granted rights to help our sick children."" Wendy Sefcik knows the pain of losing a child to mental illness. ""On December 1, 2010, my intelligent, outgoing, athletic 16-year-old-son T.J. died by suicide,"" she wrote. ""T.J. battled depression, but was a master at hiding his struggle. Since losing my son, I have tried to learn everything I can about depression and other mood disorders. I was shocked to find out how many people battle mood disorders and how difficult it is to get treatment."" Sefcik emphasized another key point: Mental illness affects rich and poor alike. The Sefciks had money and resources, yet it wasn't enough. The most poignant outpouring came from those who could relate to Daniel. They shared very private struggles. Most asked not to be identified, but said they wanted Daniel to know there was hope. ""I have a history of mental illness too, but am successfully functioning with medicine and years of support,"" one reader wrote in an e-mail. ""I celebrate all the parents and professionals who quietly, bravely fight for the sick ones. They suffer when they help, but we all suffer if we don't help. ""Stephanie and Daniel are my heroes. I pray that we will be stronger and more compassionate after reading their story."" One of the most touching messages came from a mother who said her 9-year-old son was hospitalized last year for 16 days for delusions, depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. ""I have learned a lot since then about his illness, and even more the startling lack of available mental health resources and treatment options, even in a large city,"" the mom wrote. The mother asked not to be identified, but she said Stephanie and Daniel's story inspired her to put into words what she has been through. She wrote this poem, titled Cherry 784, that she said could be shared with others: . Cherry 784 . We hid the knives . But you really only wanted . To fall from your window . Nine years is enough . I've had a good life . You told me during a visit . The one where you still weren't sure . If I was really your mom . We played basketball in the dayroom . And snuggled on worn bean bag chairs . With our shoes off and our hopes high . That the next day you'd come home . I took weary walks between visiting hours . Through corridors, concrete walkways . And parking decks in the August swell . Texting 1A, 4C, 3D to myself . Digital bread crumbs . For the evening return . The contraband I carry . Fits in an empty locker . Lift the phone . Speak the code . Cherry 784 . Hold for the buzz . Open one door . Wait for it to close . So the other will open . You, always on the other side, anxiously waiting . Reminding me I was 2 minutes late . (As if I didn't know) And squeezing the remaining breath from my lungs . With your little boy hugs . I brought you fresh fruit in labeled cups . Cantaloupe, grapes, oranges, and pineapple chunks . The scent embedded in my flesh from cutting . Something sweet for you, my love . My baby . My boy . My son .","San Antonio woman and her son shared their journey with mental illness .

"(CNN) -- Tony Dorsett recalls a 1984 game against the Philadelphia Eagles when he was streaking up the field and an opposing player slammed into him. One helmet plowed into another. Dorsett's head snapped back, his helmet was knocked askew. ""He blew me up,"" Dorsett told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""I don't remember the second half of that game, but I do remember that hit."" Dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a Volkswagen. These days Dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one Ray Ellis laid on him that day. In the past two years, Dorsett's memory has given him increasing trouble. On Monday, doctors at UCLA told Dorsett, 59, he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the Hall of Famer said. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The only way to definitely diagnose CTE is after death, by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau, which has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players. Opinion: Why I'm saying goodbye to football . However, a pilot study at UCLA may have found tau in the brains of living retired players. Some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the ""holy grail"" of CTE research, providing a means to diagnose and treat it, and the UCLA study may be an important first step. Using a scan called a positron emission tomography, or PET, typically used to measure nascent Alzheimer's disease, researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau. Then, the players' brains are scanned. ""We found (the tau) in their brains. It lit up,"" Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study, said in February. Dr. Joseph Maroon, a neurosurgeon who works with the Pittsburgh Steelers, cautioned Thursday that the CTE diagnoses of Dorsett (and two other living former players) need further study. ""This is very, very preliminary,"" he told Sportsradio 93-7 The Fan in Pittsburgh. ""There are many, many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss, particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age. ... It's something to obviously be concerned about, and the question is what can be done about it?"" Dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings. ""Memory loss, more so than anything it's been my big deal,"" he said. ""Sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that. But my thing was not remembering. I've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden I forget how to get there."" His daughters are afraid, he said. They wonder which father they will get. Will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood. For others known to have had CTE, symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation. In 2002, Mike Webster, a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression and bone and muscle pain. What you need to know about concussions in the NFL . Unlike Webster, who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice, Dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact. He won the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player in 1976 and became an instant NFL star on the league's most popular team, the Dallas Cowboys. He played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards, eighth best of all time. His 99-yard run in 1982 is an NFL record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. Now he looks in a mirror and wonders. ""And I say who are you? What are you becoming?"" he said. ""It's very frustrating to be a person that's been so outgoing, then all of a sudden, I'm like a couch potato."" Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior, such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, 36, who died in a 2004 high-speed chase. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancÃ©e. Opinion: NFL takes good first step to protect players . Some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives, including former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters, who shot himself in 2006; Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze; and Junior Seau, the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43. Dorsett said that won't happen to him. ""I'm going to beat this. Trust me,"" he said. Dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners. He said a $765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the NFL was not enough. ""I can't put a price on my health. The owners knew (about the dangers of concussions) for years and they looked the other way, and they kept putting us players in harm's way."" The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs.

"London (CNN) -- Samsung just launched their next, new, big time product. It's the Galaxy Gear smartwatch. Are you kidding? What the heck is a smartwatch anyway? Who needs it? Are we simply going too far? Do we really need yet one more piece of technology to carry around? Well the answer is yes, and you may be surprised why. I have been an industry analyst following the wireless industry since its beginning. I have have followed and commented on many companies and technologies over nearly 30 years. I have learned quite a bit over this time. One of the key points I have learned is this: The wireless industry reinvents itself every few years. And the smartwatch revolution is getting ready to sweep across and transform the wireless industry once again. Read more: Apple doesn't need to copy Samsung . Years ago the networks transformed from analog to digital, opening the door to all these amazing devices and services we use today. The smartphone was born. Back then, Blackberry and Nokia led. Then, six years ago, the Apple iPhone and Google Android entered the picture and transformed the industry once again. The super-smart-phone was born. The tablet was next. Mixed in all that noise, the cloud was born. Suddenly the marketplace leaders have changed. Today they are Apple with the iPhone and iPad, Google Android and Samsung with the Galaxy smartphones and tablets. The last few years have been quiet. This year will be different. Suddenly we are seeing new thinking and new technology that will be just as popular entering the marketplace and capturing the headlines. The Samsung smartwatch is not a stand-alone device. Rather it connects and communicates with the Galaxy phones and tablets. Read more: The most indestructible meme in tech . Why do we need a watch? Well the smartphone is growing in importance to many of us. Yesterday we wouldn't leave the house without taking our keys, wallet and smartphone. Tomorrow all we'll have to grab is the smartphone. It will open our doors and start our cars, it will have credit card information and drivers license and pictures and all sorts of other goodies. It will let us communicate with our doctors, our car, retail stores and so on. In that world we'll be pulling out our smartphone all the time. It will get to be a real pain in the neck. That's where the smartwatch comes into the picture. Samsung introduced the first smartwatch. It will communicate with their smartphone and their tablet. You can see how many emails, text messages, postings on social sites and more you are getting. You can even read them on the watch if you choose. You'll have access to your calendar and all sorts of apps based on what you want to see on the watch. It's up to you. But it all works together over the cloud. Photos: Battle of the smartwatches . The smartwatch will be your remote control for your smart phone. And your smart phone will be your remote control for your life. What a beautiful world. So let me ask you a question. If you have all these devices, where do you store your data? We used to synch everything with our laptops, but going forward we'll synch to the cloud. That's right, like it or not, the cloud is in your future. It's the center of the universe. Watch more: Could an iWatch make Apple cool again? Sure there are risks. You have to protect your data like you do on your laptop. And you have to hope the bad guys don't invade the cloud services that will start popping up all over the place. But one way or another, the cloud is in your future. So Samsung wants you to buy a Samsung smartwatch to talk with your Samsung Galaxy smartphone that talks with your Samsung Galaxy tablet and you can store all your information on the Samsung cloud or Google cloud. The benefit to Samsung and Google is the more pieces of the puzzle you buy from them, the more they've got you. And they want to get you. What about Apple? They reserved the name iWatch a while back and we expected them to introduce their new device first. This time however Samsung beat Apple to the punch. Will Apple introduce their iWatch? I say yes. Whether it's next week or in the near future I do think Apple will jump into the same smart watch space. It's the next wireless frontier. Then, we have to ask, what's coming next? Quite a bit, actually. And it will all be linked together over the cloud. Can the smartwatch really compete in an already crowded market of mobile devices or will customers reject it? Without hesitation, yes. Is this a gamble on Samsung's part? Well, on one hand, every new innovative idea is a gamble. But I think this will be a big success and get bigger over time. Just like with the tablets. The whole idea here is for companies like Samsung, Google and Apple to build an environment that both captivates and captures their audience. The cloud will be the core technology that will tie all these innovative ideas together. I think customers will love this smartwatch, the same way they love the tablets, smartphones, computers and the cloud. This is just one more piece of the puzzle that attracts and retains more customers. And companies will love it as well because it creates a tighter relationship with each customer. So who needs this new smartwatch? Just wait and see how successful it becomes over the next few years. You will be very surprised.","Samsung has launched its smartwatch which it is calling the Galaxy Gear .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says his Afghan counterpart assured him that an important security pact will be reached with Kabul in a ""timely manner,"" despite a failure so far to forge a deal. Hagel made the remark during a visit to Afghanistan on Saturday. What is known as the bilateral security agreement -- ready to be implemented but still unsigned -- initially has been front and center in Hagel's visit. Hagel met with Afghanistan's officials, including the country's defense minister, as Washington works to get Afghanistan to ink a bilateral security agreement to keep some U.S. and other coalition troops in the country after next year. The Defense secretary said that from what he has heard in his discussions with Afghan ministers, they believe it's in the country's interest to have such an agreement -- which lays out the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014, when the NATO-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave. ""The minister of defense assured me that the BSA would be signed and would be signed in a very timely manner,"" Hagel said, making reference to Defense Minister Bismullah Khan Mohammadi. But failure to forge a security pact with Afghan President Hamid Karzai has generated growing consternation among U.S. officials. The security agreement itself has been endorsed by the Afghan council of tribal leaders, called the loya jirga, but Karzai said he won't sign it until after the country's elections in April and until certain conditions are met. These conditions include an end to U.S. raids on Afghan homes and the release of Afghan prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Washington has resisted such changes, saying Karzai's demands are new provisions added to a deal that was already reached. Hagel said he hadn't planned to meet with Karzai and played down the significance of being in Afghanistan and not meeting with the president. He said the trip had been planned for weeks and its purpose was visiting troops and meeting with Afghan commanders to assess their progress. And, he told reporters, there have been many discussions at the political level with Karzai during recent visits by other others, such as Secretary of State John Kerry. Hagel emphasized the importance of the loya jirga's decision and said ""we are planning for a post-2014 presence here."" But he said NATO -- which commands the multination International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- will eventually need clarity on the security agreement's status so it can properly plan its work in the country. NATO warned it may be forced to withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by the end of next year if Karzai doesn't sign a security agreement with the United States. Karzai, meanwhile, is scheduled to make a visit to Iran on Sunday. Iran's semi-official Mehr News said Karzai will be meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. According to state-run Press TV, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Tehran doesn't believe the security agreement will benefit the Afghan government and nation. Marzieh Afkham said Tehran's position is that the security pact is not ""useful for the long-term expedience and interests of Afghanistan."" and could have a negative impact on regional issues. CNN's Jamie Crawford, Joe Sterling, and Reza Sayah contributed to this report .","Hagel visiting troops in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- A very wise district attorney once gave a piece of pragmatic advice to a young assistant prosecutor investigating a prominent political figure. The case involved evidence that could possibly support a criminal indictment yet was unlikely to result in a conviction. That DA's advice to his young assistant: ""If you are going to shoot at the king, you'd better be able to kill the king."" The wisdom of that literary caveat, self-evident to those who pursue the powerful, is particularly relevant to the Gov. Chris Christie scandal involving traffic delays at the George Washington Bridge. In the days and weeks to come, prosecutors with potential jurisdiction over a criminal investigation of Christie and his political acolytes regarding the agonizing traffic tie-up -- and a possible subsequent cover-up -- will be carefully screening the evidence. They would be wise to consider the pragmatic advice about king-slaying, which has been quietly observed by sensible prosecutors for years. Three prosecutors have potential jurisdiction: Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.; Bergen County, New Jersey, Prosecutor John Molinelli; and U. S. Attorney Paul Fishman, the man who replaced Christie as New Jersey's federal prosecutor. Opinion: A lesson for Chris Christie from Richard Nixon . Vance is a Democrat, known for nonpartisanship. Molinelli was appointed Bergen County prosecutor by Christie's predecessor, a Democrat. And Fishman is the appointee of a Democratic president with the blessing of New Jersey's two U.S. senators, both Democrats. All three prosecutors enjoy reputations for fairness and integrity in the conduct of their offices, but it would be a deft trick for each of the three to reassure residents of New York, New Jersey and the nation that any investigation (and possible prosecutions) will be free of political influence. Though Vance may have a shred of a right to prosecute (because the bridge touches land in New York County), I suspect he is wise enough to know that his Manhattan DA's Office has no business interfering in this Jersey mess. Molinelli, though, has more legitimate concerns -- the individuals most affected were those living in the Bergen County towns he serves. There is even a New Jersey criminal statute entitled ""Official Misconduct"" relating to the abuse of governmental authority by public servants for personal gain that may be relevant to the bridge brouhaha. As a lame duck prosecutor appointed by Christie's predecessor, Democrat John Corzine, Molinelli will face heavy scrutiny if he tries to slay the king -- in this case, the governor. Enter Fishman, the U.S. attorney and potential white knight. Though a registered Democrat appointed by President Barack Obama, he was sworn into office by Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative icon. Opinion: Christie's bogus 'stages of grief' Fishman has sterling credentials and a reputation for fairness. He's vowed since 2009 to keep politics out of his powerful office and to depoliticize it after many prosecutions by his predecessor were criticized as having been political in nature. That predecessor? Chris Christie. The legal bloodlines of this case are more mixed than the contents of a Meadowlands landfill. Fishman, as the ranking Fed, can force local Jersey prosecutors out of the ring through a variety of tactics, if he chooses to do so. Bergen's Molinelli could insist on proceeding -- but, in the face of a potentially more serious federal intervention, most local prosecutors would back off. Why would the locals defer to Fishman? The answer is entirely pragmatic. These prosecutors have to work together on many overlapping cases as they each seek to round up New Jersey's notorious collection of bad guys. And a local DA generally defers to a federal prosecutor who can supersede him in a variety of ways. Politics and pragmatism enters every field in our system, even criminal prosecutions. Given Christie's political prominence -- both in New Jersey and nationwide -- you are certain to see, in coming days and weeks, a steady stream of information discreetly leaked to news media regarding ongoing criminal and civil investigations. Though Christie will endure potentially embarrassing legislative hearings, predictable federal subpoenas, and possible damage to his promising presidential candidacy, I think it's safe to say the governor will not be indicted. There is a greater downside to that scenario: Voters may be convinced it is indeed a political witch hunt intended to cripple a leading presidential candidate. Despite some titillating hints from insiders, the bulk of evidence relating to the bridge fiasco probably remains undisclosed. Christie, as a former prosecutor, is far too smart to have left his fingerprints or interoffice ""DNA"" on any specifics of the bridge fiasco. Even if a former aide or political pal testifies against the governor as part of a prosecutorial deal, most jurors would want to see corroboration. Nobody likes a snitch, even a political one. The case will look like a political hatchet job and the wounded, angry ""king"" may strike back with political vengeance. The public will doubt the integrity of the prosecutor destroying his reputation. Opinion: Christie's choice -- Be seen as a crook or a schnook? More of his political aides may fall as the search for scapegoats continues, but the governor will not be taken away in handcuffs. Why? Because as that wise prosecutor once said, ""If you are going to shoot at the king, you'd better be able to kill the king."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Callan .","Paul Callan: Prosecutors are loath to charge a powerful political figure .
He says it's unlikely that Chris Christie left his fingerprints on the bridge issue .
The rule is that if you charge a powerful figure, you'd better be able to win the case, he says .

"Charleston, West Virginia (CNN) -- Independent tests commissioned by CNN of water supplies from a hotel and home in southwest West Virginia showed the presence of a chemical after a leak in the area last week, but both samples were within levels believed to be acceptable for consumption. TestAmerica, a private company, conducted the test. Samples taken Tuesday showed the presence of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- a substance used in the coal industry -- well below the 1 part per million considered safe to drink. Water in the private residence tested at 0.27 parts per million, or about a fourth of the limit, while water at the hotel tested at .011 parts per million, roughly a hundredth of the limit, according to the testing firm. The hotel had been cleared to resume water use; the private residence had not. More than half of the 300,000 West Virginians who haven't been able to turn on their faucets since last week now have access to safe water again. Water customers in about 70,000 homes and businesses covering well over half of the people originally affected may now use the water, according to West Virginia American Water. Pregnant West Virginia women told to drink bottled water . The problem stemmed from a leak of several thousand gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol from a storage tank belonging to a company called Freedom Industries. That chemical made its way into the Elk River, to a water plant about a mile upstream, and then into the water system. Calls to Freedom Industries for comment were not immediately returned. Residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to Charleston, West Virginia's capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets. With its strong odor as the telltale sign, officials warned that they couldn't say that the water was safe. Living without tap water in West Virginia . Opinion: It's OK, the water's safe to flush .

Is it safe right now? Is it safe in the long term? What is this chemical and what is it going to do?"" asked Crystal Good, a mother of three from Charleston. She spoke to CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. ""Today is Martin Luther King's birthday and he said that if there's an injustice anywhere, there's an injustice everywhere, and I feel that there's an injustice going on in West Virginia and that we don't know the long-term consequences. ""And this is something that, in my opinion, happened in West Virginia, but affects all of America. There are chemicals that are stored in every town, and every state, everywhere, that it could potentially leak."" Jean Casarez reported from Charleston, West Virginia.

"(CNN) -- It's nicknamed ""The Kingdom in the Sky"" -- where blue, chilly skies linger over barren mountains, lush green mountains, snow-covered mountains. This is truly a kingdom of mountains -- the southern African country of Lesotho. But the breathtakingly beautiful landscapes are a tough place to live and some remote highland areas can only be reached on foot or horseback. During winter time, temperatures can drop down to -4 Fahrenheit (-20 C) and bad weather can cut off much of the population for months. The rural mountainsides are where boys as young as five tend cattle and sheep. They are the herd boys of Lesotho, often spending months or even years away from their families. It is estimated that around a third of Lesotho's school-aged boys are shepherds. Becoming a shepherd is a cultural obligation in the country and often deprives young boys of any form of education. Instead, they lead isolated lives. ""I wake up at seven in the morning. I boil some water and take a bath. I clean my surroundings and prepare for the day ahead. Then I take the cattle to the grazing field,"" says 17-year-old shepherd Thuso Leeto, who over time has formed a special bond with the cows that are his only companions and which he considers to be his friends. ""I have (even) given them names and when I reprimand them they listen and respond to their names,"" he says. Read this: Africa's magnificent mountains - seven amazing climbs . The work of the herd boys is both mentally and physically demanding, but their income is often the only means of support for their families. For one year's work, some boys will receive just one cow or 12 sheep. Prince Seeiso, younger brother of Lesotho's King and the country's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, has co-founded a charity called Sentebale, together with Britain's Prince Harry. The aim is to help support some of Lesotho's most vulnerable children, the herd boys included. ""There is not much social security in this country as far as the welfare or wellbeing of the herd boys (goes),"" says Prince Seeiso. Prince Seeiso explains that whilst the tradition of the herd boys goes far back in time, the herding used to be done by older men. ""When the migrant labor began to get into Lesotho when the mines were opening, the older men went into South Africa and then there was a void. Then the kids became the herders,"" he says. Lesotho has one of the world's highest HIV/AIDS rates, with around 23% of adults aged 15-49 being HIV positive, according to UNAIDS. Providing support and information about HIV/AIDS is one of Sentebale's missions, and it is also providing an education for the herd boys through night schools. ""We are looking at the long-term goals of eradicating the need for herding, but in the meantime we try and bring some kind of respite in terms of education, in terms of appropriate clothing, in terms of appropriate technology, introducing them to mobile phones, so that when they are out there, they can be alerted to weather reports,"" says the prince. Improving the lives of young herd boys . It's not only the possibility of floods, or the biting winds that easily find their way through the worn-out, thin clothes of the young shepherds, that threaten them. After rounding their livestock into holding pens and retreating to their own small huts, the herd boys nervously await the impending night. This is peak time for cattle thieves and jackals. Julius Majoro, one of the local night school teachers, became a herd boy when he was 12 years old. He knows the fears these young men face. ""Many thieves come during nighttime and attack the shepherds. They sometimes kill them with a gun,"" Majoro says, recalling the feeling of isolation. ""I used to be lonely because I was just staying with the animals, also not feeling free, during the day and also during nighttime because I was supposed to care for (them)."" The isolation, the hunger (Majoro says he sometimes had to eat food left out for the dogs by the farmer who employed him) and the hard weather conditions motivated him to fight for the rights of the herd boys. ""The word shepherd, it sounds like an insult ... because those people have been abandoned by society, by our nation by everybody. Nobody cares for them,"" he says. ""Now what I always try to tell the shepherd, (being) a shepherd doesn't mean something bad, it means you're doing something special."" Read this: Maasai Cricket Warriors . Going the extra mile for education and a hot meal . As of October this year, Sentebale has three night schools for the herd boys, and Majoro runs one of them, in Semongkong, one of the remotest parts of the country. He has been teaching there for five years now, and this season he has about 30 students. It's winter time, and the classroom is cold. But many shepherds walk for hours after they have finished their work for the day, to get basic education and a hot meal. ""It's very, very cold,"" Majoro says. ""Even if it's worse than now, they will still come. Education is their need. They need love. They want to socialize. And only here at school is where they get what they need."" The lesson plans involve math as well as English and Sesotho --- the language of Lesotho. The young men are also being informed about HIV and AIDS. But it's not only about the education. Their eyelids may be heavy after a long day of working, but here they can socialize. Here, they can break through isolation. ""They don't grow spiritually, they don't grow emotionally,"" Majoro says. ""They don't grow socially, which is part of their life, because if they are not getting those things, they are not well complete. ""That's why we bring them here, teach them how to behave, counsel them. This is just like a big family."" Before returning to their respective cattle posts, the herd boys of Lesotho sing and dance together, forming a community spirit in remote highlands, 1,000 meters above the sea. Then they walk off alone, again.","In Lesotho, around a third of school-age boys work as herd boys .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- It started as a helicopter search for a missing 9-year old boy. About two hours later, the police chopper lay in pieces on a city street, two officers were dead, and hundreds of northwest Atlanta residents had no power. The helicopter with two officers on board crashed late Saturday night, just miles from downtown. It was flying low to enable the officers to conduct a more thorough search, according to Atlanta Police Chief George Turner. Both officers died on impact. Atlanta police: Both officers were fathers . On Sunday afternoon, the police department identified the officers as 48-year-old Richard Halford and 40-year-old Shawn Smiley.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- At least 20 homes in Atlanta's historic Cabbagetown neighborhood were flattened by a tornado that ripped through downtown Atlanta on Friday night, a spokeswoman for the mayor said. Debris from Friday night's tornado litters the street outside CNN Center. Firefighters fear there could be people dead inside the ruins of a collapsed loft complex in the same neighborhood, the spokeswoman said. There have been no deaths confirmed from the tornado, but at least 15 people were treated at two hospitals. Most of the injuries were minor cuts, scrapes and bruises, officials said. The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts, just east of downtown Atlanta, collapsed in a ""pancake fashion,"" Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran said early Saturday. The tornado that ripped through the heart of the  city damaged the roof of the Georgia Dome during a college basketball game, shattered windows and ripped roofs from buildings before continuing into several residential neighborhoods. The building that houses CNN was at the epicenter of the storm -- sitting next to the dome and hotels where thousands of basketball fans attending the Southeastern Conference tournament were at least temporarily displaced.  Watch coverage of damage to CNN Center » . ""It was actually in overtime, and the game was getting exciting, and I thought people from the Alabama side were hitting the bleachers trying to get some noise going,"" said Lucas Shields, who was attending the game between Mississippi State and the University of Alabama. ""All of a sudden the TV went out, the overhead clock stopped working, and you hear that distinctive noise of a train."" Timothy Wood, 30, of Cumming, Georgia, took refuge from rain at Philips Arena.

Police closed several streets in the vicinity of CNN Center because of glass and other debris from the storm.  Audio Slideshow: View the damage » . The storm tracked from the northwest side of the city to the southeast, demolishing buildings and downing trees that crushed cars and ripped through the roofs of homes. At the Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts, damage was extensive. Mahsud Olufani, an Atlanta painter and sculptor with a studio in one of the other buildings, said he rushed to his studio when he saw news of the damage. ""It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III,"" he said. ""It's a disaster area."" The converted lofts also were the site of a massive 1999 fire, during which a dramatic helicopter rescue was televised worldwide. In the neighborhood of East Atlanta, resident Cameron Beasley said he could see four or five homes with storm damage, including trees knocked through their roofs, and several cars crushed by downed trees. ""Something really fierce came down,"" said Beasley, who said he and his wife ran with their two children into their basement about 15 seconds before the storm hit. ""It was just crushing cars, crushing houses."" The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for the area, in effect until 10 p.m. The storm came through at about 9:45 p.m. Inside CNN Center, water poured through damage in the ceiling into the building's atrium. Glass shattered, and parts of the building filled with dust. Virtually all of the windows facing Centennial Olympic Park on the Omni Hotel, which is attached to CNN Center, were shattered, leaving curtains flapping in the darkened windows. Visitors to the hotel were evacuated to the facility's exhibition hall at street level.  Watch survey of damage to Omni Hotel » .

Next door at the Georgia Dome, the Alabama-Mississippi State game was halted. The storm visibly rippled the ceiling of the dome and caused some damage, video of the arena showed. Scaffolding holding the facility's scoreboard swayed 15 minutes after the storm hit. The game resumed about an hour later, but a later game between Kentucky and Georgia was postponed. Joe Bryson, 28, of Cumming, Georgia, was outside when the winds hit. ""When it started to drizzle a little bit, everyone got under some shelter, watching things develop. It started to pick up a bit. When the metal barriers fell over and started skidding along the ground that's when everyone started -- not panicking -- but going inside. ""I saw two fellas who were running to come to shelter and they were getting pushed from the back [by the wind]. They got knocked down but got right back up and followed everyone inside,"" Bryson said. Catherine Niehaus, an iReporter, was inside the Georgia Dome when she said the roof split, scaffolding slipped and the scoreboard started to sway. Slabs of metal and insulation material smothered the streets outside. Cars and emergency vehicles were scattered among the debris as hundreds of people, many of them attending the Southeastern Conference basketball tournament, wandered around talking on cell phones. Heaps of bricks and sheetrock were pushed up against cars. Streets signs were bent in half. At the neighboring Georgia World Congress Center, the storm blew down a wall, allowing water to pool ankle deep inside the building. Further east, heavy damage was reported near Grady Memorial Hospital. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the most recent downtown tornado in the United States hit Jacksonville, Florida, August 12, 2004. There were no deaths. According to the NOAA, the deadliest tornado to hit a downtown area in the 20th century was May 11, 1953, when 114 people were killed in Waco, Texas. Although downtown tornadoes are rare, it's a misconception they can't happen, according to The Tornado Project, a company that gathers and compiles tornado information. ""That more 'cities' aren't struck by tornadoes is probably more coincidence than anything else,"" according to the project's Web site. ""There are very few 'big cities' with skyscrapers in Tornado Alley. In fact, there are only a dozen, and one of them, St. Louis, Missouri, has a long history of tornadoes in its central area.""

"(CNN) -- As the world says goodbye to Nelson Mandela, the task of ensuring his legacy becomes the world's responsibility. His life has been described as an evolution from militant freedom fighter, to prisoner, to unifying figure and eventual elder statesman -- in the process winning the hearts and minds of world leaders and average citizens alike. In his 95 years he accomplished what many thought impossible. Held prisoner for 27 years and later becoming South Africa's first democratically elected president, he practiced reflection, negotiation and incredible stubbornness. His capacity for forgiveness and reconciliation made him one of the most remarkable and respected individuals of modern times. Whether it's battling racism, offering a helping hand or long-overdue forgiveness, here are several practical suggestions to keep Mandela's legacy alive. Make the best of your current situation . ""It is possible that if I had not gone to jail and been able to read and listen to the stories of many people. ... I might not have learned these things,"" Mandela once said in 2000 during an interview with the Christian Science Monitor. He said reading biographies helped him realize problems make some people, while destroying others. His mother and eldest son both died while he was imprisoned. While he had ample reason to remain bitter about his mistreatment, instead he wrote in ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" his 1995 autobiography, ""Prison is itself a tremendous education in the need for patience and perseverance. It is, above all, a test of one's commitment."" Don't judge a book by its cover . ""I have been surprised a great deal sometimes when I see somebody who looks less than ordinary, but when you talk to the person and he (or she) opens his mouth, he is something completely different,"" Mandela said in the same interview about how his prison experience taught him to respect even the most ordinary people. Anthony F. Lemieux, an associate professor of communication at Georgia State University in Atlanta said avoiding the temptation to put people in narrowly fixed categories is one of Mandela's greatest legacies. ""People are complex and dynamic, capable of change and evolving,"" Lemieux said. It would have been easy for Mandela to become and remain jaded after what he had experienced, Lemieux added. Even for the people who kept Mandela locked up, the former president said they weren't bad people. ""Mr Mandela was at pains to point out that not every prison warder or apartheid official was bad. This view was underpinned throughout by his assertion that to get along in life one should see the good in all people,"" said a Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory statement on a collection of writings about his prison time. Use your passion to persuade others . ""If you have an objective in life, then you want to concentrate on that and not engage in infighting with your enemies,"" Mandela continued during the interview. ""You want to create an atmosphere where you can move everybody toward the goal you have set for yourself."" Remaining focused on a goal despite adversity requires a deep level of commitment. Ask anyone whose ever overcome great odds to achieve their version of greatness. Lemieux said different situations are going to draw different things out people, but it's never as simple as distilling the experience down to a ""type of person."" Practically none of us knows how we will react in complex situations and interactions. Change yourself first . ""One of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself,"" Mandela said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman Douw Steyn, who had made his Johannesburg residence available to Mandela as a retreat after his prison release in 1990. While Mandela clearly fought for change in the world he lived in, he also changed himself. While imprisoned, he reflected on his ""wild man"" behaviors. He also said he neglected to show any gratitude to those who had helped him when he was poor, after he experienced some success as a lawyer. Lemieux points out his change from violence to peace was profound. Throughout the violence and chaos, ultimately, ""It wasn't the violent conflict that led to social change."" Don't be afraid to acknowledge weaknesses . ""If you come across as a saint, people can become very discouraged. I was once a young man and I did all the things young men do,"" Mandela told the Christian Science Monitor. ""In his twilight, Mandela was at pains to publish and acknowledge his weaknesses and shortcomings in his family life, in his relationships with women and his first wife, Evelyn,"" John Battersby wrote for CNN. ""He was keen to dispel any notion of sainthood that might be bestowed on him. To this day, Mandela's weaknesses, his turbulent youth and his sometimes tempestuous relationships with women can still detract from the iconic status that Mandela achieved in his own lifetime. ""But, the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized Mandela and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime. It augmented Mandela's greatness."" Get educated -- educate others . ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world,"" Mandela said during a speech at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg in 2003. Mandela failed twice to complete his bachelor's degree and readily admitted he was a poor student. Eventually he earned a law degree. Six weeks after being elected President in 1994, Mandela called on South Africans to solve the country's ""profound education crisis,"" Bloomberg reported this year. ""The task to make South Africa a learning and learned nation belongs to all of us,"" he said in a speech. But the country's schools are near the bottom in international rankings. Unqualified teachers, inadequate training and corruption are among the problems. Still, officials say almost all South African children now attend school, Bloomeberg reported. Look people in the eye and shake their hands . ""Nelson Mandela made such a common gesture something transcendent -- a greeting that crossed all societal barriers, a symbol of reconciliation, even a declaration of victory,"" wrote CNN's Tom Cohen in his piece, ""Nelson Mandela: Man of many handshakes."" Before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five-star hotel conference rooms, Mandela made sure to approach the security guards, servers and other workers outside to shake their hands, Cohen wrote. They went wild when Mandela concluded his final statement during a conference by offering his hand to F.W. de Klerk, South Africa's last apartheid-era president, as an expression of unity, saying that despite their differences, he was willing to work with his adversary. De Klerk had little choice but to grasp it. ""I look at not only how people treat me, but how they treat others,"" Lemieux said. ""Sometimes this (how they treat others) is more important."" A simple handshake, Lemieux said, can convey to others that the person making the gesture is demonstrating the belief that, ""this person has value, has a perspective."" Maintain a sense of humor . ""You sharpen your ideas by reducing yourself to the level of the people you are with and a sense of humor and a complete relaxation, even when you're discussing serious things, does help to mobilise friends around you. And I love that,"" Mandela said in a 2005 interview, published by the Nelson Mandela Foundation. At election rallies in 1994, Cohen wrote, Mandela repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the ""very handsome young man"" -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the ANC. CNN's Robyn Curnow examined Mandela's the importance of his ability to ""charm and cajole."" ""The cult of Mandela had become so pronounced that celebrities, world leaders and ordinary people often became tongue-tied and gibbering when they met him,"" she said. ""Self-mockery was a typically savvy Mandela ploy to ensure that people would relax around him."" Forgive . ""It enables me to go to bed with an enriching feeling in my soul and the belief that I am changing myself [by reconciling with former adversaries],"" Mandela told the Christian Science Monitor about his experiences with Douw Steyn. Steyn was a white businessman who befriended Mandela and began sharing his resources with the poor. ""For someone who had been imprisoned, it (forgiveness) was a fundamentally transformative experience,"" Lemieux said. He explained that people unable to forgive may experience an inability to move forward. Johann Lochner was a Johannesburg police officer from 1986 to 1990. In an essay submitted to CNN iReport, Lochner describes responding to a shopping mall bombing scene and stepping over body parts. ""We suspected that the deceased may have been affiliated with the Umkhonto we Sizwe, the militant arm of the African National Congress,"" Lochner wrote. He describes the police department, as well as the city, as ""greatly divided."" ""Mandela wanted to find a way to unite all the people of South Africa -- something only the power of forgiveness could produce,"" he said. ""To this day, I am so passionate about the role forgiveness played in Madiba's life. I remember so clearly how I had to personally take steps to overcome the ingrained apartheid mentality in South Africa."" ""It's almost like a miraculous, supernatural transformation had taken place in Mandela's life, and consequently, in the whole nation. ""Forgiveness freed Madiba,"" Lochner said, ""and forgiveness freed his country,"" Nelson Mandela from Joel Gautraud on Vimeo. .","Simple changes in everyday behavior can honor Mandela's legacy .

"(CNN) -- California authorities have surrounded a wanted parolee accused of shooting federal and local officers, hitting three and wounding one more with shrapnel fragments, police said. After that initial shooting, Samuel Duran ran and hopped fences in a Roseville neighborhood as members of various law enforcement agencies converged on the scene, police said. Authorities located him at an otherwise unoccupied house in Roseville, which is 20 miles northeast of Sacramento. ""I know he's pinned down,"" Roseville police Lt. Cal Walstad said. Duran has been sought by authorities ""for the last couple of weeks,"" according to Walstad, who did not detail what crimes the suspect had been tied to. After determining where he was in Roseville, local police and a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit went there Friday afternoon. According to Walstad, ""once they made contact with him, shots were exchanged."" The ICE special agent was shot in the leg and transported to a local hospital, the police spokesman said. He was reported to be stable and alert a few hours later, said ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice. The suspect ran, firing at times and jumping fences. Three Roseville police officers ended up wounded at a third shooting site . One was struck in the jaw, one was hit in the shoulder, and the third wounded by bullet fragments, according to Walstad. One of the Roseville officers was in serious condition, while the other two were stable, he said. Chief Daniel Hahn added later Friday that none of the injuries to the officers, all of them men and veterans of the department, are considered life-threatening. Authorities from multiple agencies quickly converged on the scene looking for Duran, who Walstad said had an ""assault-type weapon."" Neighbors were asked not to leave their houses, but they were never evacuated. The scene was later considered ""contained"" -- even though police hadn't said they knew exactly where the suspect was. Now that they do, he's being surrounded by law enforcement. Hostage negotiations are on site as well, though it's not believed that the suspect has taken any hostages. Authorities are talking to the suspect by telephone, Walstad said. Brenda Bell told CNN affiliate KCRA that the suspect is in her house; she went outside after her ""dogs went crazy,"" then she ran into a neighbor's house after seeing him run through her back gate. ""(Police) keep repeating, 'We have the house surrounded. Come out with your hands up,'"" Jim Stewart, the neighbor who invited Bell in, said Friday night. ""They've been doing this for hours now."" Placer County Sheriff Edward Bonner described the situation as ""incredibly dangerous,"" while expressing confidence it'll be resolved as well as possible. ""This is a very tough day,"" Bonner said. ""It's unsettling for all us; no one is immune to this sort of tragedy and criminality. But here it is. ""But I'll tell you what,"" he added. ""We have a great community of law enforcement that is going to deal with this."" CNN's Andy Rose contributed to this report.","NEW: Chief: None of the injuries to law enforcement officers are life-threatening .

"Washington (CNN) -- The IRS paid him $104 million for providing information as a whistle blower to prosecute banking giant UBS AG, and upended centuries of storied Swiss bank secrecy. But for want of a cheap cab ride, former UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld could end up back in prison after being arrested for driving while intoxicated in New Hampshire. Birkenfeld, 48, was arrested July 20 by Portsmouth police conducting a sobriety check point. Birkenfeld, who listed a Rye, New Hampshire, address, is scheduled for trial on Nov. 12. His federal probation officer told CNN that he is aware of the arrest and that if Birkenfeld is convicted it would be a violation of terms of his supervised release after serving 30 months in prison. He was originally sentenced to 40 years after pleading guilty to defrauding the United States, but was released early for good behavior. Under terms of his release, Birkenfeld is barred from ""excessive use of alcohol."" Federal prosecutors are monitoring the DUI case and are weighing whether to recommend Birkenfeld be found in violation of those terms, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. An attorney representing Birkenfeld didn't respond to a request for comment, and Birkenfeld couldn't be reached. Justice Department prosecutors used documents and other information provided by Birkenfeld to prosecute UBS and some of its top bankers for aiding tax evasion by U.S. offshore banking customers. Birkenfeld claims to have provided U.S. authorities hundreds of confidential UBS documents on about 19,000 customers. UBS paid $780 million in 2009 under a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department to settle the charges. Birkenfeld's probation officer said if he is convicted a judge could order that he be sent back to prison or be subject to additional supervision requirements. The probation office hasn't decided what course to take. ""Despite this being a high profile case, we'll treat this like any other case,"" said the probation officer, who asked not to be identified by name.","Birkenfeld paid $104 million by IRS for information on banking giant UBS .

"New York (CNN) -- Social media site Pinterest just received another $225 million in funding. The offering, led by Fidelity Investments, puts the company's valuation at a staggering $3.8 billion. Not bad for a three-year-old social network that has no revenue and is laying the foundations for a business model. Pinterest is the digital equivalent of a scrapbook. Its virtual pin-boards have become a popular place to share pictures and reviews of a wide variety of products -- everything from weddings to home remodels. Bottom line: People come to Pinterest with more of an intenticon to buy than when visiting other networks like Facebook and Twitter. A visit to the makeup room at CNN's New York studios explains it. When the hair and makeup artists aren't freshening up our anchors' faces, you can find the women (and a couple of guys) cruising Pinterest for the latest and greatest in makeup supplies. When one of them finds a great review, you hear her yell: ""Check this mascara out!"" and then the other makeup artists crowd around the computer screen to see. Beneath the photo of the mascara, the user posts details about the product and tips for using it. This makes the California-based site attractive for major companies to create their own pin-boards to promote their products. Rick Heitzman is the Managing Director at FirstMark Capital -- a venture capital firm that has invested in Pinterest -- and he says the strengths are the visual nature of the platform, as well as the size and growth of the social network's user base. Pinterest had nearly 25 million unique monthly users in the U.S. last month, according to comScore. ""People spend a large amount of time on the site,"" Heitzman said. ""That intent is often tied to some commercial experience. Whether it's looking for a place to go on vacation or a wedding, that leads to commercial aspects and that's different from other social networks."" He is also encouraged by how Pinterest is starting to attract revenue. The company is testing out sponsored pins, which will be their way of advertising. But instead of ""flashy banners"" or pop-up advertisements, Pinterest is weaving ads right into the digital pin boards their users see. ""They work just like regular pins, only they have a special 'promoted' label, along with a link to learn more about what that means,"" Ben Silbermann, CEO and Co-Founder of Pinterest, wrote in a blog post in September. Web analytics might also be a revenue stream for Pinterest. Earlier this year it rolled out tools that give the managers of Pinterest pages insights into how people are interacting with pins that link to their websites. Retailers might be willing to pay money to learn how to better curate the experience for the customers using Pinterest to get to their websites. Pinterest says it will use its $225 million, which was first reported by AllThingsD, to continue to expand on mobile and international growth. Meantime, the CNN makeup artists continue to cruise the pin boards for the newest and best concealers.","Social media site Pinterest secures extra investment worth $225 million .

"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) -- A dog's life is fairly easy. It usually involves waking up late, eating some food and then passing out for eight hours in the backyard. I've tried it a few times, myself. Wasn't disappointed. The rest of a dog's day is generally spent whizzing on various plants and mindlessly staring at things that pass by the house. Again, I've dabbled in the lifestyle. And I approve. But there's this one dog in Charleston, South Carolina, who just seems to have it better than most. And I recently got to meet her. I first learned of Belle when I saw a popular picture of her on the website Reddit. It was posted in a section called ""aww"" that is dedicated to all things cute and adorable -- puppies, bunnies, Canadians doing Canadian things in Canada. The photo showed Belle staring out from under a gate, and the title read: Waiting for his family to return in Charleston, SC [OC]. It got dozens of comments. In Reddit parlance, [OC] means Original Content, which is to say the individual who posted the image actually created it. This was helpful when it came to tracking down the whereabouts of this dog (who we now know is actually a female). You see, I was going to Charleston over Thanksgiving and was looking for a pointless adventure -- something that would take me to a particular part of town I may not have otherwise seen. And I figured trying to find this dog from Reddit was as good enough an adventure as any. So, I messaged the guy who took the photograph and learned that his name is Carlos Morales, 31, of Gainesville, Florida. Carlos and his girlfriend, Nia Haynes, were driving home from vacation and decided to stop and spend the night in Charleston. While wandering around the historic neighborhoods near The Battery, Carlos stumbled upon Belle. ""He seemed like the kind of dog quite used to this routine,"" Carlos wrote me. ""But not anxious about his family returning. Just slightly forlorn."" Carlos didn't know the exact location of the house, but he sent me a link to an approximate street view on Google Maps. Eventually, I sorted out the actual address on my own, thus exhausting my brain's entire lifetime supply of deductive reasoning. I treated myself to a nap. Finally, on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, I walked up to Belle's house and knocked on the old door leading into the courtyard. Mind you, this kind of bold, unsolicited introduction is the kind of thing you can do when you're a serious journalist hoping to write a fluff piece on somebody's dog. Otherwise, it's sort of creepy. Though, to be fair, even with my CNN business card in hand, it was still probably kind of creepy. I'm a mouth breather. Nevertheless, Frank Barnwell politely greeted me at the door along with Belle, who was carrying a boot in her mouth. It was Frank's boot. Which is to say, it was now Belle's. Her official name is Belle de la LumiÃ¨re. In French that translates to Belle of the Light. I learned she was actually born on New Year's Eve 2002, just around the corner from Frank's home. This year she turns 11. And speaking of 11, that was the exact number of yellow lab puppies in her litter. Belle was the runt. Frank's daughter, Sally, was friends with one of the children who lived around the corner from where Belle was born. The mother of the friend called up Frank's wife and said, ""I hate to tell you this, but Sally's fallen in love with one of our puppies."" Frank says, ""We knew our goose was cooked."" And right as he told me this, just like clockwork, Sally suddenly emerged through the courtyard door, returning from a jog. Sally, a history student at the University of Virginia, remembers first meeting Belle, and that most of the puppies were named after characters from the hit TV show, ""Friends."" Which, sadly, means somebody out there has a dog named Ross. But when the breeders ran out of ""Friends"" characters, they started using Disney names. Belle, being the runt, was originally called Tinker Bell. And names are important. If you've ever adopted a dog you know how influential they can be. My dog is Mikey, and when I first found him online and saw his name, I figured it was a sign. I'm a big fan of the band Widespread Panic, and their late guitarist also went by Mikey. Clearly, it was meant to be. Of course, Mikey (my dog) was also really cute. So, at the time, I pretty much could've justified any name. ""This is Polio."" ""I'll take him."" But Belle seems to fit this particular dog quite nicely, and these days she spends most of her time in the courtyard of the historic 200-year-old house, looking out at tourists walking down the street. It's pretty much her job. And, though she only recently earned a bit of Internet fame on Reddit, it's certainly not the first time Belle has come under the lens. Frank says, ""Literally almost every day I see somebody taking a picture of her with her nose under the gate."" In the South of Broad neighborhood of Charleston, Belle is sort of a big deal. Everybody knows her, and she's an important member of the community. In fact, Belle recently escaped from the yard during the annual Turkey Day Run 5K, and, just like a local, simply joined all the joggers running down King Street. Another time, she got out of the yard and spent the entire day riding around in a pedicab. ""The guy had her in the back and was trying to figure out where she belonged,"" Sally remembers. ""I don't think she wanted to come back. She made a friend."" Frank chimes in, ""Belle likes all dogs and most people."" Just don't take her boot.

"(CNN) -- It is the place where the ""Air Ball"" chant was invented. It is or has been home to Crazy Towel Guy, Viking Guy and Bunch of Guys. A man once distracted an opponent's free-throw shooter by rising from his seat and dancing while wearing a dark blue Speedo and nothing else. That guy became a pastor. The college basketball fans at Cameron Indoor Stadium, where there are just 9,314 seats, are not only known for being loud, they take pride in getting into opponents' heads. They are a coordinated cacophony that gives the Duke Blue Devils a home-court advantage only a handful of teams have. Duke University has won nearly 84% of its games in Cameron since 1940. The Cameron Crazies are so famous, they were even in a Coke commercial. But recently, the young fans have been the subject of scorn from former Crazies, other basketball fans, the media and even Duke's legendary coach, Mike Krzyzewski. They haven't been their old selves, and they haven't been filling the undergraduate students section, not even to cheer on a top-10 team. Duke has 1,000 spots for undergrads but has sold up to 400 of those seats to other Duke fans this year. As Duke enters the heart of conference play, student attendance has picked up recently, senior Ellie Garrett, one of two student ticket line monitors, said in an e-mail. The smaller undergrad crowds is not a new trend; there have been fewer of them in Section 17 for the past few seasons. But this season, the lack of passion has been noticeable. Coach K had these words after a January victory at Maryland, according to the Chronicle: ""This team is trying to develop and don't just watch them, be with them. They need your support. This Saturday let's be out there at noon [they won against St. John's] and be the Cameron Crazies. If you don't want to do it, then don't, but it will be a mistake. I think sometimes you just take things for granted."" The students responded to the coach's call; Garrett said Section 17 was over capacity. Longtime Duke fan Julian King says there are several reasons Cameron is a different place these days. King -- who grew up in Durham, has seen hundreds of games in Cameron and runs the message board forum Duke Basketball Report -- points a finger at a tech-rich culture, a student body more focused on academics, conference expansion and the team's ""ridiculous success."" No question Duke is one of the most beloved teams and one of the most hated -- in large part because it wins so much. With four national titles and fourth place on the all-time victories list, the Blue Devils are on TV and the front pages of newspapers and sports websites constantly. ""People get spoiled; they get used to (winning),"" King said. ""But the secret of Cameron, and people who haven't been around a while don't realize, but Cameron really became a great place out of frustration."" He explained that in the 1970s, other teams came in with their stars -- David Thompson of North Carolina State, John Lucas of Maryland and Phil Ford of North Carolina -- and whipped Duke's butt. Since there was no beating them on the court, Duke fans turned to making fun of them, King said. And those fans, including the most raucous ones known as Bunch of Guys, were often hilarious and often downright offensive. Caulton Tudor, columnist for the News & Observer in Raleigh, said the fans sometimes crossed the line, but they were spontaneous. ""They've turned into the Mormon Tabernacle Choir,"" he said. ""They are orchestrated. Everybody knows exactly what's next."" At Duke, students will work on a cheer sheet and hand them out to those who attend games. Some students have complained that new cheers are needed. They also say there needs to be better coordination. There are other factors at play, King and Tudor said, and these could affect all schools. In the early 1980s, when Coach K was new to Duke and the Devils were beginning to win consistently again, there were no fans texting on cellphones or updating Facebook pages, Tudor said. Sure, some brought books so they could study during breaks, but their attention spans were longer and more focused on basketball. These days, not so much. There also were no huge TVs in the dorms, where students don't have to wait for hours in cold lines to get into the arena, where they might stand (or jump up and down) in closer-than-close quarters for three-plus hours. Today's students can also watch anywhere on campus on computers or smartphones. And there are now 12 teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference (two more schools join the league next season), and old school rivalries have been diminished as a result, said Tudor, who has seen more than 300 games in Cameron since 1957. Like many superconferences, the ACC has grown so big that schools sometimes play conference opponents only once a year instead of twice. For Duke, it means people don't care about some games as much anymore, King said. It's hard to get worked up about a revenge game if a year separates a loss and the next contest. Things will get better, Jeff Kovacs, a former crazy known as Mullet Man, wrote in a letter to Blue Devil fans on Duke Basketball Report. ""You may think that the Crazies aren't up to the standards of the past, but maybe this current crop is merely going through its own growing pains,"" he wrote. ""Maybe they aren't spoiled and complacent. Maybe they are learning on the job."" Garrett wrote that students were anxious to be part of the tradition. ""People are painting up, making signs, and counting down the minutes until the doors to Cameron open,"" she said. A betting man would probably wager that Section 17 will be full on Saturday when Duke is host to Maryland, which fancies itself one of Duke's rivals (Duke fans feel a little differently). Coming off a miraculous comeback win against the No. 5 North Carolina Tar Heels, Duke and its Crazies have to have their swagger back. If the spontaneity and enthusiasm return with it, the Terrapins might just want to invest in some earplugs. And the Tar Heels, when they come March 3, well, it'll be as crazy that day as ever in Cameron.","There are 1,000 seats for undergraduate students at Duke basketball games .

"(EW.com) -- Every superhero movie is, on some level, an attempt to demonstrate that a godlike being with flabbergasting powers â€” he flies! He wields a megaton hammer! â€” also has an inner life. The success of the film hinges on how well it yokes together the external and the internal. ""Thor: The Dark World,"" a watchable but technologically over-scaled slab of Marvel boilerplate, is far from a great superhero movie â€” it's more like the diagram for one. Having done his time as a magical Norse hunk-out-of-water in ""Thor"" (2011) and ""The Avengers"" (2012), our hero (Chris Hemsworth) now finds himself back on Asgard. There, his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins, serving up his own special brand of highbrow scenery chewing), enlists him in a battle for the cosmos. Muggles rejoice! Butterbeer is now being served at Starbucks . The Nine Realms are about to converge, which means that the Dark Elves, led by the scowling Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), can now finally seize their moment to destroy Asgard. Are your eyes already glazing over? To succeed, the Elves must gain control of the Aether (pronounced ''ether''), a supreme energy force in the form of what looks like a floating spill of red wine. In the film's rather desperate attempt to personalize the plot, the Aether, which requires a host organism, has leaped inside the body of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the astrophysicist who fell for Thor and has been waiting two years for him to return. Portman plays her like a petulant schoolgirl, and that's the movie's notion of a joke: Jane just wants a boyfriend, while Thor, who loves her back, has weightier concerns. Really, though, ""The Dark World"" should have given Jane a better reason for hanging around than the fact that she's playing host body to a glob of extraterrestrial protoplasm. The first ""Thor"" was directed by Kenneth Branagh with an elegant verve that made the special effects at once witty and spectacular. Alan Taylor, who directed this sequel, is a prestige veteran of the small screen (""Mad Men,"" ""The Sopranos,"" ""Game of Thrones""), but he brings little of that avid storytelling tightness to ""The Dark World."" Which 'Star Wars' personality are you? See the characters' Myers-Briggs chart . The new film sprawls, often with more spirit than reason. And though its images can be exciting (the Oz-like palace of Asgard, airships that glide like daggers), the battles have a videogame medieval dazzle that temporarily heightens the senses, then leaves you numb. Hemsworth's Thor is once again a charismatically fast and bold stud-Viking warrior, but now that he's mostly on his home planet (with occasional forays down to London), he somehow seems less super. Only when Tom Hiddleston is on screen, as Thor's dark-souled stepbrother, Loki, does any real drama take hold. Loki has been imprisoned for his treachery, but it turns out that Thor needs his help to defeat the Dark Elves. Can he trust Loki not to betray him?

"(CNN) -- Gourmet cuisine has long been a staple of business class and first-class menus. But a number of airlines are taking the in-flight meal to new heights by bringing chefs on board to serve up a fine dining experience in the sky -- scooping up culinary awards in the process. Etihad Airways has gone as far as to poach expert cooks from a number renowned Michelin-starred restaurants since launching its ""Flying Chef"" service on long haul flights late last year. The concept has thus far proved a recipe for success, with the Abu Dhabi based airline winning the award for best first-class catering at the 2012 Skytrax World Airline Awards earlier this month. But given the cramped kitchen conditions of the airplane galley and the complexities of cooking at altitude, is it really possible to rustle up meals worthy of the masterchefs whilst cruising at 35,000 feet? According to Werner Kimmeringer, head of guest experience and catering at Etihad Airways, unequivocally, yes. See also: The world's best airport restaurants . ""We introduced chefs in our first class cabin so we could offer a five-star restaurant style of service,"" says Kimmeringer. ""Our first-class guests receive unparalleled attention and choice -- for example, the opportunity of having their personal chef tailor-make dishes based on their individual tastes and preferences,"" he adds. Kimmeringer highlights the ""balik style smoked salmon"" and ""pan-seared scallops with a parmesan cheese sauce"" as particular examples of the gastronomic complexity of the Etihad first-class menu. ""The chef can talk (to) and recommend food directly to our guests and make suggestions of what they might like on the menu,"" says Kimmeringer. ""He is able to personally adjust seasonings and recommend menu and beverage choices to each guest. They can also make changes to existing menu items ... changing sauces or taking out particular ingredients."" Some industry experts, however, are less effusive about the possibilities of in-flight chef operations . According to Gottfried Menge, group director of culinary excellence at Gate Gourmet, an independent provider of airline catering services, there are a number of factors that restrict the cuisine chefs can produce whilst airborne. ""Because of the (safety) limitations on the aircraft there are no items like a frying pan where a chef is cooking and tossing things up in a different way,"" says Menge. Knives and other sharp implements are also not permitted aboard airplanes, tying chefs' hands yet further. As a result, most food is still prepared on the ground before being reheated en-masse in a steam pressure oven whilst in the air, Menge explains. The chef can then alter the ingredients slightly or add extra dressings to meet the individual tastes of passengers. On the whole, however, meals are prepared in much the same way as they always have been, he adds. See also: 85 years of airline food . Menge says there are inherent challenges when it comes to preparing food at altitude. ""The cabin pressure of being at 35,000 feet in the air means you lose about 10% of your taste buds,"" he says. ""Therefore the food always has to be stronger or there will have to be a little bit more seasoning, which obviously alters the taste."" But Michael Braun of Austrian Airlines -- one of the first organizations to introduce a chef service aboard its flights -- is adamant that on-board chefs can bring benefits. He says that they can help deliver a superior level of customer service, strengthening the carrier's brand image and differentiating them from competitors flying similar routes. ""We do our best to make a flight with Austrian a high-level experience, which is why we have one chef on board of every single long-haul flight,"" says Braun. ""The menus are ... refined Ã¡ la minute by a chef who will pamper the palates of our guests on board. (This) service is highly valued by our customers,"" he adds. In spite of the many complexities of aerial cooking, Menge agrees with Braun that on-board chefs can still add value to the in-flight customer experience. ""It's much more interactive if the chef can come out and say hello to the passengers rather than the crew just handing out menus and then food,"" he says. ""I think it makes a big difference if a chef with passion is on board to explain the food to customers, for the visual appeal it will also look much nicer. ""This can really help the airline company go the extra mile in presentation and service,"" he concludes.","Airlines hiring chefs on planes to prepare meals for first and business class passengers .

"(CNN) -- When he came to, Gene Penaflor knew he had to do something. He didn't know how long he'd been unconscious; just that he was in the wilderness, a man of 72 who had lost his way while hunting deer. He had to quickly figure out how to survive, what to eat and drink, and how to stay warm. And for almost three weeks, Penaflor did just that: subsisting on a diet of lizards, frogs and squirrels. Penaflor was separated from his hunting buddy on September 24. At first, he tried find his way on foot out of the Mendocino National Forest, a vast nature preserve in northern California. But he was disoriented and quickly gave up. He stayed put in hope that someone would find him. In his 19 days cut off from humanity, it snowed several times, and temperatures dropped to 25 degrees Fahrenheit some nights. Then help came. Penaflor made it to a hospital in the town of Ukiah on the edge of the forest, where his family surrounded his bed. Doctors checked him over and released him. He is back home, his son Jeremy told CNN. ""He's good. He's hanging in there. He looks like nothing changed except he grew a beard."" Lost . Flank the deer on two sides; no matter where it runs, your buddy or you are pretty sure to bag it. It's a common hunting strategy. But it got Penaflor separated from his hunting partner on September 24. They had split up at their base camp, walking over separate ridges, and were going to meet up down the path a few hours later for lunch. Penaflor never showed. A day later, his hunting buddy reported him missing to the Mendocino County sheriff, who sent out a search party a day later assembled from nearly two dozen country and state law enforcement offices. After scouring the mountain range on foot and with rescue dogs, and in the air for four days, they found no clues leading to Penaflor. A hefty storm blew in, and they suspended the search. Woman survives 12 days in the wilds of Canada . The accident . Penaflor had walked out into the woods much farther than he had planned, his son said. He slipped on a steep slope and hit his head. It knocked him out cold, and he has no idea for how long. He still had his hunting rifle, but he told his son that he didn't have the strength to hunt a deer. ""He told me it was mainly in survival mode. He was trying to save energy,"" the son said. Instead, Penaflor focused on small game, foraged for algae in a stream and drank water from a creek. To stay dry, he crouched under a fallen tree, and to keep warm, he made a fire and packed dry leaves and grass around his body. He never stopped trying, and his family did not give up hope. ""We knew he was out there,"" said Jeremy Penaflor. Missing teen, fascinated with 'Into the Wild,' found dead . The rescue . The search party went out again Saturday to look for the 72-year-old, and this time the group was about half the size of the original one. But someone beat them to Penaflor. A hunter called the sheriff's office in the morning, saying he and his large group of friends could hear a man crying for help from down in a valley. The cell phone connection dropped out again and again, before deputies could note his location, the sherriff's office said. They instructed the hunter to call 911, and the operator locked in on his GPS coordinates. Penaflor's cries led the hunting party to him. They cut poles from trees and affixed their coats to them to fashion a makeshift stretcher to carry him out. Rescuers met up with the group hours later, as they heaved him up a steep hill. They called a helicopter to ferry him to Ukiah Valley Medical Center. Hugs and tears . When his family saw him, no one spoke, Jeremy Penaflor said. ""Just hugs. And we were in tears."" He released a photograph to the media, showing his father in a hospital bed, smiling and giving a thumbs-up. No more hunting for now, the son said. ""If he decides to hunt in a couple of years, that's fine. But we joked around and said let's make it a camping trip."" If he goes out again, his son wants to be with him.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- An earthquake shook southern Iran Thursday evening near a nuclear power plant, killing at least eight people and injuring 59 more, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported. Twelve of the injured were in critical condition, Fars said, citing Hassan Qadami, the head of Iran's Crisis-Management Headquarters. The U.S. Geological Survey said the 5.6-magnitude quake was centered about 39 miles (63 km) northeast of the Persian Gulf city of Bushehr, where the nuclear plant is located, and 7 miles (14 km) northeast of Borazjan. The quake struck at a relatively shallow -- and therefore more likely to be damaging -- depth of 10.2 miles (16.4 km) at 5:21 p.m. local time. A reporter for the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency in Borazjan said residential buildings were damaged and electricity was disrupted to several areas, including sections of Borazjan. The city is in Bushehr province, which is the site of a nuclear power plant that went online in 2011. There was no immediate report of how the plant fared in Thursday's temblor. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of the casualties and expressed condolences to the victims' families. A 6.3-magnitude earthquake in May killed 39 people and injured 850 in Bushehr province, but the reactor was not affected, it said. Iran's semi-official Mehr News said people who were afraid of aftershocks were staying out of their homes. Rescue teams were on the scene, Mehr said, quoting the governor of Bushehr Province, Fereydoun Hassanvand. Iran's location atop several major faults leaves it prone to earthquakes. In August 2012, two earthquakes in northwestern Iran struck 11 minutes apart -- the first a 6.4 magnitude, and the second a 6.3 magnitude, killing at least 306 people. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 quake struck the city of Bam in southeast Iran, killing some 31,000 people. A 1990 quake in the northwestern provinces of Gilan and Zanjan killed as many as 50,000.

"(CNN) -- New guidelines for the management of hypertension suggest that people 60 or older might be able to handle higher blood pressure readings than originally thought. Hypertension, which can lead to strokes, heart attack, kidney failure and death, is traditionally treated with medication and diet. The goal of most doctors is to keep their patient's blood pressure below 140 (systolic) / 90 (diastolic). But after reviewing mounds of evidence, a committee of experts now says the systolic number, especially in older people, can be higher at 150/90. And many of these patients who were on medication would no longer need to be. It is not clear how many people would be affected by these new guidelines, but experts are estimating in the millions. The committee was asked to update the guidelines that have been in place for more than 30 years. They were published online Wednesday in the latest edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The group of 17 experts found no reason to change any other section of the guidelines. According to the report, ""There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90. ""However, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 for those groups based on expert opinion.""","Panel of experts publish findings in Journal of the American Medical Association .
Conclusion: People 60 and older might be able to handle higher blood pressure readings .

"(CNN) -- It's the journey of thousands of miles that started with a single step. Two Kenyans, whisked across continents to run a marathon Sunday in Sacramento, California. Their trip funded via a crowdsourcing effort that started with a friend request and a popular book. A few weeks ago, Japhet Koech and Shadrack Chepyego got a Facebook message from Conyers Davis. Davis, a San Francisco resident, had learned about the two men in the book ""Running with the Kenyans,"" by Adharanand Finn. And he had a question for them. ""I sent them a friend request and a note asking if they would be interested in racing in California -- if I could raise enough money to cover their airfare,"" Davis says. Koech, 26, was a little skeptical, but decided to take the risk. ""We didn't really know what to make of it, but didn't want to miss a great opportunity either,"" he says. And so began the process that took the two men nearly 10,000 miles from their tiny running town in western Kenya. The two are from the Eldoret area, where the most elite Kenyan marathon runners hail from. Davis, 35, set up an online fund-raising campaign called Kenyafornia. He urged donors to give $26 each -- a dollar for every mile the two would run in the California International Marathon. They could not afford to pay for the trip. Running is a sport that does not come with a paycheck in Kenya. Koech works at his uncle's gas station while Chepyego is a farmer. ""These guys work so hard and are such hardworking and dedicated runners,"" Davis says. ""I wanted to bridge the divide between talent and opportunity."" He exceeded his goal for funds in a little over a month. Armed with nearly $9,000 from the fund-raiser, he set out to make the trip happen. Local celebrities . After delayed visas and red tape that almost made them miss their flight, the pair arrived in San Francisco last week, and have become local celebrities. More strangers chipped in to ensure they stayed warm during the cold spell. When Davis picked them up at the airport, he thought they had forgotten their luggage. They had one backpack each with running shorts, shoes and minimal change of clothes. ""They didn't have much in the way of warm clothing,"" Davis says. ""Luckily, The Gap heard about the guys and was concerned that they would be cold,"" he says. ""They very kindly opened up their flagship store and gave them lots of clothes to stay warm. It was amazing."" Fleet Feet, a local running supply store, gave them warm racing gear to wear during the marathon in Sacramento. 'Like playing basketball with LeBron James' The two have trained at San Francisco landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge, where residents waved. Others joined in, running along with them. Both will return to Kenya on Thursday. But they'll never forget the kindness of strangers, they say. ""The best part has been meeting the Californians,"" Koech says. ""Everyone has been so friendly. Our experience will inspire many people back in Kenya, especially many of the younger runners."" Davis, who describes himself as a novice runner, works at the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. Though he spent many sleepless nights planning the logistics of the trip, he says it was all worth it. ""I'd do it all over again,"" he says. ""Running with the Kenyans is like playing basketball with LeBron James. These guys are masters of their trade. It has been very exciting and very humbling to watch."" Davis will run his first marathon with his new friends Sunday. The title of the book that started it all will become his reality.","San Francisco man reads book called ""Running with the Kenyans""

"(CNN) -- A former U.S. soldier charged with attempting to join a terrorist group was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday after pleading guilty to destroying records that could be used in a terror investigation, federal prosecutors said. U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz also sentenced the ex-soldier to five years of supervised release after his prison time. Craig Benedict Baxam, 26, of Laurel, Maryland, was arrested in Kenya in December 2011 en route to southern Somalia where he planned to join al Shabaab, according to a summary of the plea agreement in a news release from U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod Rosenstein. ""Baxam told the agents that because of his prior service in the U.S. Army, and specifically his training and experience in military intelligence, he knew of the U.S. government's capabilities in tracing internet protocol addresses and other investigative techniques,"" the plea agreement states. ""Consequently, before leaving the U.S., he destroyed his personal home computer and threw the remains in a dumpster."" The news release continues: ""He told the agents that he did not want any record left behind, and that he wanted to maintain a low profile. He also said that he purchased a round trip plane ticket to Kenya rather than a one-way ticket even though he had no intention of returning to the U.S., in order not to arouse the suspicion of the FBI and U.S. military."" According to a criminal complaint, Baxam departed the United States on December 20, 2011, for Kenya, where he was arrested three days later by Kenyan authorities on suspicion of terrorism. Baxam was interviewed twice by FBI agents while in Kenyan custody and allegedly told them he wanted to join al Shabaab, live under Sharia law and never intended to leave Somalia. Baxam told the FBI he didn't have the names of any contacts in Somalia but that he ""trusted in Allah,"" the complaint said. Baxam said he was ""looking for dying with a gun in my hand"" and said he would be guaranteed a place in paradise, according to the criminal complaint. Prosecutors said at the time of his arrest that Baxam had secretly converted to Islam days before leaving the Army in July. He joined the Army in 2007 and underwent eight months of advanced training for cryptology and intelligence, according to the government. After his training, Baxam was deployed to Baghdad and to South Korea, where he separated from the service one month before the completion of his deployment. The court document did not explain how Baxam left the Army early. A law enforcement official said at the time of his arrest that there was no information to suggest Baxam had compromised any military information. Prosecutors say Baxam cashed out his retirement savings account of more than $3,600. He allegedly planned to give al-Shabaab between $600 and $700 as an offering upon his arrival, authorities said. ""FBI Special Agents in Africa, working alongside our Kenyan police partners, worked together to stop an individual who is now alleged to have been on his way to join a major terrorist group,"" said Richard McFeely, the FBI agent in charge of the Baltimore office. ""This spirit of cooperation in fighting terrorism continues to transcend borders around the world. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness .

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball has dropped its lawsuit against Anthony Bosch and the company the league claims provided performance-enhancing drugs to a number of players, including Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, a league spokesman said Tuesday. Mike Teevan, an MLB spokesman, said, ""We have dismissed our Biogenesis lawsuit."" That suit was filed in March against the South Florida clinic and several men associated with it -- led by Bosch -- for allegedly flouting the league's drug prevention program, the pro sports league said. The lawsuit's dismissal wasn't entirely unexpected. ESPN had reported that MLB might drop the suit against Bosch if he cooperated in its investigation. The investigation led to the suspension of 14 players for violating the league's drug policy. Besides Rodriguez, suspended players included Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, the 2011 National League MVP. Only one of the players challenged his suspension: Alex Rodriguez. After he called out Commissioner Bud Selig and others in his appeal of a 211-game ban, an arbitrator reduced it to 162 games and the postseason. The Yankees third baseman sued Major League Baseball, Selig and the players' union to get the ban overturned, claiming the league engaged in vigilante justice during its investigation of Bosch and his Biogenesis anti-aging clinic. But earlier this month, Rodriguez abruptly dropped his suit and accepted his suspension. After a surge in home runs in the late 1980s and 1990s -- highlighted by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa racing to break Roger Maris' single-season home run record in 1998, followed three years later by Barry Bonds breaking the new record -- Major League Baseball was accused of not doing enough to recognize and combat the use of performance enhancing substances. The league, in conjunction with its players' union, in recent years has beefed up its drug testing programs and penalties. A number of top-level and minor league players have been suspended as a result, including ex-Red Sox standout Manny Ramirez, for 50 games in 2009. Biogenesis became part of the story publicly in late January 2013, when the Miami New Times reported that more than a dozen professional baseball players and other athletes had been named in records kept over several years by the clinic. Two months later, MLB filed its lawsuit against the clinic in Florida's Miami-Dade County. Its 14-page complaint named Biogenesis, its predecessor company and six individuals -- among them program director Bosch, others at the company, someone who worked at a sports agency, a former University of Miami baseball player and a ""self-proclaimed chemist"" who supplied substances. According to Major League Baseball, the accused solicited players, supplied them with drugs and offered dosage recommendations to help them avoid testing positive for banned substances under the league's program. ""(The defendants) knowingly and intentionally caused and/or induced ... players to breach their contractual obligations under MLB's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program,"" the complaint said. CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","Spokesman: Major League Baseball dismisses its lawsuit against the South Florida clinic .
