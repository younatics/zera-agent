"The sale of the old house, the purchase of the new house, the packing, the good-bye parties. It was all so overwhelming for me. I can't imagine what it was like for my toddler, leaving the only home, neighborhood and sitter she had ever known in the city where she was born. Fortunately, I got a little bit of help from the Berenstain Bears to give my daughter some answers. In that classic tale ""Berenstain Bears Moving Day,"" Brother Bear asked the questions about moving that my daughter asked: ""What about my toys?"" ""And what about my friends?"" She'd carry that book around like a teddy bear. The answer for the toys was easy:  ""We'll take them along, of course."" Harder to hear: ""You'll be leaving your friends behind."" ""But you can keep in touch with them. You can write, even visit perhaps. And besides, you can make lots of new friends."" It's no wonder that I could find a Berenstain book for almost any new or difficult situation. When co-author Jan Berenstain died last month, she had written more than 330 ""Berenstain Bears"" books, first with her husband, Stan (who died in 2005), and later with her son, Mike. More than 260 million copies have been sold over the past 50 years, making it one of the best-selling children's book series in history, Harper Collins said. Mirroring all types of families . Growing up in a house filled with books, I turned to children's literature to explore and learn about worlds beyond my experience. Now, I turn to the classics of children's literature for assistance in parenting my way through the basic struggles in our lives, such as feelings, friendships, sharing, courtesy, differences and loss, among others. If the Berenstain Bears didn't have the answers, maybe Dr. Seuss, ""Goodnight Moon,"" ""Ferdinand the Bull"" or ""The Hungry Caterpillar"" could do the trick. The classics explained essential subjects to a young mind better than I ever could, and they reassured me, too. Still, some of the classics didn't represent our experience or the lives of many of the families we know and love. My child has two moms. Her neighborhood friend has one mom who adopted her. Her friend across the street has a mom and dad. ""As families have changed over the past decades, that means that there's opportunity for books to serve families who may not be made up of Papa, Mama, Brother and Sister Bears,"" said John Sellers, children's reviews editor for Publishers Weekly. ""There's certainly a need for books that portray, mirror and show the value in all kinds of families: same-sex families, mixed-race families, stepfamilies, families with grandparents as guardians."" Just as interesting are the children's books that include a diversity of families not as the point of the story but as a reflection of the reality of our world. ""That sort of subtle, offhand inclusion and portrayal of a diversity of families in picture books -- as well as books for older readers -- is, in my view, as valuable, if not more so, as having an increased number of message-focused books out there on those topics, though there will always be a place and a need for those, too,"" says Sellers. Here are some of my family's modern favorites. It's OK to be different . The bright visuals of writer and illustrator Todd Parr's books jumped out at my daughter before we ever guessed the subject matter. In Parr's world, there are different types of mommies, families and feelings -- all of them valuable and filled with love -- without getting hit over the head by the message. ""The Family Book"" shows all the families on my block and beyond, and portrays them as different in appearance but equal and loving and kind. ""The Mommy Book"" teaches my kid that mommies come in all shapes and sizes; some work outside the home, and some work inside the home; some cook, and others order pizza; and some camp, and some shop. A visual learner and slow reader, Parr remembers having trouble learning when schools didn't know how to help him. ""When I started writing books, I based them on my own struggles as a kid and feeling like an outsider,"" said Parr, whose favorite books as child included classics such as P.D. Eastman's ""Go Dog Go,"" Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" and ""The Monster at the End of this Book"" from Sesame Street. ""I wanted them to be silly and fun and simple but yet be something strong that could help kids feel good about themselves. I wanted it to be matter of fact that everyone is important and special and different."" Why not let your child drive the bus? After I became a parent in Brooklyn, my daughter and I loved that we could identify the locations that Mo Willems featured in ""Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale."" Yes, we lived across the street from the actual Laundromat featured in the book. For a city kid, the idea of sitting on a stoop, Laundromats across the street and parks within walking distance made sense in the whimsical pictures drawn by the former Sesame Street writer. ""Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus"" and ""Don't Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late"" play with the neverending asking that a child does for what she wants, with increasingly sophisticated reasons why we parents should give in. It's daytime in China? Really? But children are not trying to drive us nuts, Willems gently reminds the reader. Adults forget how hard it can be to be a child, where nothing is built to your size and grownups demand that you learn new things every single day. Why not throw a tantrum over not getting to drive a bus or go to bed whenever you want? ""I don't see my books as ends but as beginnings,"" said Willems, who as a child loved the work of Dutch illustrator Fiep Westendorp and ""Sneetches on the Beaches"" by Dr. Seuss. ""I put as much air in as possible so kids can put in their own ideas. Draw my characters and put as few words and background as possible so kids can create them themselves."" While Willems is grateful that children identify with his work, he says he writes to understand things he doesn't understand, such as friendship, love and jealousy. (""The Duckling Gets a Cookie!?"" which comes out in April, turns jealousy on its head.) ""I'll write a book and take it very seriously for a year or two,"" he said. In ""Goldilocks and the Three Dinosaurs,"" out this fall,  ""I find my past self telling my present self how to deal with some present relationships in my life."" You don't have a mommy and a daddy? ""Heather Has Two Mommies"" author and poet Lesl√©a Newman started writing children's books featuring families with two mommies or two daddies after a friend stopped her on the street and demanded that she write books featuring families like hers. My daughter had never heard a story with two mommies. She grabbed at the picture book ""Mommy, Mama and Me,"" and memorized all the words. (The companion, ""Daddy, Papa and Me"" works for the two-daddy family.) She gravitated to ""Heather has Two Mommies"" as she got older. Although her books have been attacked as political, Newman says she doesn't write with an agenda or mission. ""I write to tell a story,"" said Newman, who remembers reading Dr. Seuss, Curious George, Babar the elephant and ""Caps for Sale"" as favorites. ""I write to find out what I don't know. If pressed, I'd say my goal would be to produce a children's book that would help any child reading that book to feel good about herself."" We're all connected . A sweet summer day in the life of an interracial family is the setting for Liz Garton Scanlon's picture book ""All the World,"" featuring the art of Marla Frazee (who received a Caldecott Honor for this book). The book is about global connectivity, showing families and partners of all ages and races. As she started writing for children, Scanlon noticed themes of nature and community emerging in her work. ""I also really think about a child's perspective: How would they envision friendship? What would they notice about places or parties or food or trees?"" said Scanlon, whose favorite books growing up were ""Blueberries for Sal,"" ""Make Way for Ducklings"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are."" ""Kids are relatively disempowered. They're just not the big people in charge. So I really try to think about how children's books can give some of the power back to them, just by granting importance to their perspective.""

"(CNN) -- Poachers threaten to drive the majestic African elephant to the brink of extinction, just as they have the long-persecuted northern white rhino. But poachers aren't the only culprits. Very wealthy hunters, mainly from the United States, are picking off elephants in their zeal to bag the biggest tusks and trophies and rise within the ranks of the global trophy hunting fraternity. There's reason to believe that,as a result of meaningful actions taken by African governments as well as the U.S. government to restrain trophy hunters, this intentional killing may subside. Two African countries, Botswana and Zambia, have just outlawed trophy hunting. And the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has temporarily stopped issuing permits for hunters to bring home their elephant trophies from Tanzania and Zimbabwe, where hunting is legal and poorly regulated. Robert Mugabe, the corrupt strongman of Zimbabwe, has allowed so many natural resources within his country to be looted that it makes perfect sense that he cannot be trusted to provide safeguards for the elephants of his country. In 2012, the most recent year for which data are available, hunters received permits to import 204 elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and 36 from Tanzania. Another 261 elephants were shot and killed in Botswana. Now, thanks to the U.S. import ban and the hunting prohibitions in the two African nations, 500 elephants are likely to live this year -- since hunters won't kill them if they can't bring back the parts. Unfortunately, hunters can still import trophies from elephants killed in South Africa and Namibia, an inexcusable gap in the regulatory efforts to curb the ivory trade. It's time that all African nations with elephants join Botswana, Kenya and Zambia in barring trophy hunting. Elephants are much more valuable to the economies of African nations alive than dead. An elephant can be watched throughout his lifetime, and there's an enormous and growing pool of ecotourism customers waiting for that thrilling experience. On the other hand, the creature targeted by the hunter dies after a single bullet tears up his insides, meaning the revenue gained is merely a one shot deal. What's more, the pool of people who want to kill elephants for fun is tiny and declining. The pictures and the memories for the ecotourists will last a lifetime, and it's a trip they'll never be ashamed to recount to their grandkids. Photos: Tourist trophy hunters chase African wildlife . Safari Club International, the lobbying arm of the trophy-hunting crowd, seeks to rationalize such actions by saying that the money derived from such hunts will help animals on the ground, in part by stimulating the flow of money into local communities in their range states and helping to fund conservation efforts. But that twisted logic -- kill them to save them -- does not fit with 21st century reality. If American trophy hunters were sincere, they could invest their wealth directly to fight illegal killing. Anti-poaching teams on the ground need help because poachers, often associated with terrorist groups, slaughtered an estimated 22,000 African elephants last year to sell trinkets in the global marketplace. That number is unsustainable, and wild elephants are plainly in crisis. Alas, American trophy hunters are out to kill elephants for the same reason as poachers. They admit it. Here is what Safari Club International says in its official online record book: . ""An elephant with really good ivory (100 pounds, or 45 kg, per tusk used to be the magic number, though these days 70 pounds, or 32 kg, is considered very good) is generally considered Africa's top hunting trophy. Trophy quality is determined by the weight and beauty of the tusks."" I ask myself: Would a poacher put it any differently? Against tremendous pressure from a small cadre of hunters and others who want to trade in ivory, including the folks at Safari Club International, the United States has taken strong steps against the trade in ivory goods. In February, the Obama administration took aim at poachers by further tightening restrictions on this trade within America's borders. After China, America is the world's largest market for ivory products. The United States and the rest of the world need to do more -- and quickly. At a time when we ask poor Africans to stop killing elephants to trade in ivory trinkets, is it too much to ask rich Americans to stop killing elephants for trade in trophies for display in their homes? Good heavens, isn't this so obvious? Several members of Congress are trying to pressure the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to lift its recently imposed import restrictions on elephant trophies from Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The Obama administration should reject this lobbying effort. Crass displays of hunting conquests shouldn't come by depriving our world of one of the grandest creatures to leave its footprints on the savannahs and in the forests of Africa.","Wayne Pacelle: Poachers, as well as wealthy U.S. hunters, are killing African elephants .

"(CNN) -- The man paces back and forth on a St. Louis street, yelling ""Shoot me,"" as two armed police officers approach him. Less than 20 seconds after their arrival, the officers open fire, killing him. As new cell phone video emerged Wednesday of the fatal confrontation that claimed the life of Kajieme Powell, a 25-year-old African-American man, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson tried to explain the officers' action in an appearance on CNN. The incident took place Tuesday, less than four miles from the suburb of Ferguson where, just days earlier, a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen -- and touched off violent protests. Dotson said Powell was suspected of walking out of a convenience store with two energy drinks and a package of pastries that he didn't pay for. Police said Powell had a knife that he pulled out, although that is unclear from the video. ""An edge weapon, a knife, within 21 feet is a lethal weapon,"" Dotson told CNN. ""The officer just did, what I think you or I would do -- they protected their life in that situation."" 'Drop the knife' The video is graphic. CNN has chosen to freeze the footage right before Powell is shot, but the audio continues. Powell, dressed in khaki pants and a blue sweatshirt, is standing on the side of a street when a police car pulls up on the sidewalk near him. He takes a few steps back as officers get out of the police cruiser and approach him, armed with guns. They yell at Powell, repeatedly ordering him to get his hand out of his pocket. Powell walks towards them, yelling, ""Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me now."" He takes his hand out of his pocket and appears to be holding something in his right hand, but it's unclear from the video what the object is. Authorities say Powell was brandishing a knife. One of the officers says, ""Drop the knife."" Powell looks back over his shoulder for an instant, then steps over a low concrete wall, off the sidewalk, moving closer to the officers as he is ordered again, ""Drop the knife."" Nine shots are heard. (In the unedited video, the man drops to the ground). Onlookers gasp. The man filming the incident exclaims, ""Oh my God."" Questions raised . Dotson said Powell was ""acting erratically, walking back and forth up and down the street."" Asked why the officers didn't use alternate weapons, such as a stun gun, to subdue the man, Dotson responded by saying such defenses can be unreliable. ""So you've got an individual armed with a knife, who's moving towards you, not listening to any verbal commands, continues, says 'Shoot me now, kill me now.' Tasers aren't 100%. If that Taser misses, that subject continues on, and hurts an officer,"" he said. CNN's Chris Cuomo said the officers' actions raise several questions. ""There was no raising, there was no lunge, there was no charge,"" he said. ""They open fire, both officers open fire."" ""The question now becomes, why did they have to do this?"" The two officers involved have been placed on administrative duty, per department policy. CNN's Dana Ford and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Video shows St. Louis Police fatally shooting a man they say brandished a knife .

"(CNN) -- China's Li Na hit the heights earlier this year when she made it to the semifinals of the Australian Open, beating Venus Williams along the way. ""I was so excited after I beat Venus [Williams], because I knew this was a special day... and for Chinese tennis because they had two players in the semi-final. I mean, that's not easy for Asian countries,"" she told CNN. Li and her compatriot Jie Zheng, who also reached the Australian Open semifinals this year, have given the profile of Chinese tennis a boost. But Li, China's first tennis player to break into the top 10 world rankings, actually quit the game at the end of 2002. ""I was feeling really sick, everyday. I never stopped. I didn't want to kill my body. I mean, I have a long life, I don't want it to be only for tennis,"" she said. She was first brought back to the game by a call to play in the Chinese national championships and then returned to the Tour in 2004. ""When I was young [the Chinese tennis authorities] paid a lot of money for me to play in tournaments and do everything for me, so if now they need help I have to give back to them,"" she said. ""The plan was to finish university by 2005 and then finally get some sort of job for life. But after 2005 my ranking was 33 in the world and I thought 'Oh my God, what is going on? I have to continue to play.""' Compared to the more demure Zheng Jie, she's been portrayed as a rebel, sporting a tattoo and once telling Chinese fans to shut up during her semifinal match against Dinara Safina in the Beijing Olympics. ""They kept yelling, 'Kill her!' with every shot... I mean the fans are not bad, I know they just really wanted me to win the match. But maybe next time I will have more experience. I will just keep asking them to be quiet please!"" She also made the decision to leave China's state tennis system after the Beijing Olympic Games. Until then she had to give 65 percent of her winnings to the Chinese government. Today, operating outside of the state system, Li still has to give 12 percent of the winning to the government. ""The Chinese way is different from the Western way, because our government gives you a lot of help and just asks back a little bit... if someone helps you and you never give back, I'd think they didn't want to be friends with me,"" she explained. Li is hopeful that other Chinese players will follow in her footsteps, although it may be a long wait for a Chinese man to emulate her Grand Slam tournament performances. ""I believe that in five year for sure, there will be a Chinese guy coming into the Top 50. They are working so hard. In winter training I was with the national team, so I saw a lot of good players among juniors -- young girls and boys. So I was feeling 'Yeah, after three years maybe China will be like Russia or America' -- they have many people coming to play in tournaments,"" she said.","Li Na is China's first top 10 tennis player, often portrayed as a rebel .

"(CNN) -- Radiation from cell phones can possibly cause cancer, according to the World Health Organization. The agency now lists mobile phone use in the same ""carcinogenic hazard"" category as lead, engine exhaust and chloroform. Before its announcement Tuesday, WHO had assured consumers that no adverse health effects had been established. A team of 31 scientists from 14 countries, including the United States, made the decision after reviewing peer-reviewed studies on cell phone safety. The team found enough evidence to categorize personal exposure as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans."" What that means is they found some evidence of increase in glioma and acoustic neuroma brain cancer for mobile phone users, but have not been able to draw conclusions for other types of cancers . ""The biggest problem we have is that we know most environmental factors take several decades of exposure before we really see the consequences,"" said Dr. Keith Black, chairman of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The type of radiation coming out of a cell phone is called non-ionizing. It is not like an X-ray, but more like a very low-powered microwave oven. ""What microwave radiation does in most simplistic terms is similar to what happens to food in microwaves, essentially cooking the brain,"" Black said. ""So in addition to leading to a development of cancer and tumors, there could be a whole host of other effects like cognitive memory function, since the memory temporal lobes are where we hold our cell phones."" Wireless industry responded to Tuesday's announcement saying it ""does not mean cell phones cause cancer."" CTIA-The Wireless Association added that WHO researchers ""did not conduct any new research, but rather reviewed published studies."" The European Environmental Agency has pushed for more studies, saying cell phones could be as big a public health risk as smoking, asbestos and leaded gasoline. The head of a prominent cancer-research institute at the University of Pittsburgh sent a memo to all employees urging them to limit cell phone use because of a possible risk of cancer. ""When you look at cancer development -- particularly brain cancer -- it takes a long time to develop. I think it is a good idea to give the public some sort of warning that long-term exposure to radiation from your cell phone could possibly cause cancer,"" said Dr. Henry Lai, research professor in bioengineering at University of Washington who has studied radiation for more than 30 years. Results from the largest international study on cell phones and cancer was released in 2010. It showed participants in the study who used a cell phone for 10 years or more had doubled the rate of brain glioma, a type of tumor. To date, there have been no long-term studies on the effects of cell phone usage among children. ""Children's skulls and scalps are thinner. So the radiation can penetrate deeper into the brain of children and young adults. Their cells are at a dividing faster rate, so the impact of radiation can be much larger."" said Black of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. In February, a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, revealed radiation emitted after just 50 minutes on a mobile phone increases the activity in brain cells. The effects of brain activity being artificially stimulated are still unknown. Neurosurgeon and CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta says Tuesday's announcement, ""dealt a blow to those who have long said, 'There is no possible mechanism for cell phones to cause cancer.' By classifying cell phones as a possible carcinogen, they also seem to be tacitly admitting a mechanism could exist."" Manufacturers of many popular cell phones already warn consumers to keep their device away from their body and medical experts say there other ways to minimize cell phone radiation. The Apple iPhone 4 safety manual says users' radiation exposure should not exceed FCC guidelines: ""When using iPhone near your body for voice calls or for wireless data transmission over a cellular network, keep iPhone at least 15 millimeters (5/8 inch) away from the body."" BlackBerry Bold advises users to ""keep the BlackBerry device at least 0.98 inch (25 millimeters) from your body when the BlackBerry device is transmitting."" The logic behind such recommendations is that the further the phone is from the body, the less radiation is absorbed. Users can also use the speakerphone function or a wired earpiece to gain some distance. Users can text instead of talk if they want to keep the phone away from their faces. Finally, cell phones emit the most radiation when they are attempting to connect to cellular towers. A moving phone, or a phone in an area with a weak signal, has to work harder, giving of more radiation. So users can avoid using their cell phones in elevators, buildings and rural areas if they want to reduce their exposure, experts say.","NEW: Experts say there are ways to minimize cell phone radiation .

"Editor's note: This post was created for your reading pleasure as a collaborative effort between the editorial staffs of BuzzFeed and CNN. (BuzzFeed/CNN) -- Rusty the red panda is the most recent zoo animal to prove it truly is a jungle out there. On Monday, the National Zoo in Washington announced that little Rusty had gone missing. Thankfully, by the end of the day, he was back in his enclosure and no longer wandering around the big city unchaperoned. Rusty's adventurous day in D.C. is, obviously, not the first nor the strangest story of an escaped animal running amok. Don't worry, though, all these have relatively happy endings! 1) Evelyn and Jim: The gorillas that escaped, more than once, from the Los Angeles Zoo. These two gorillas were a pretty big headache for the zookeepers at the Los Angeles Zoo. The primates in crime escaped so many times that the zoo received a warning from federal officials, according to ABC News. The zookeepers were housing them in an enclosure originally intended for bears; the gorillas would use vines to climb out, even one time bounding the wall with a running jump. 2) Nala: The lioness that escaped into Disney's backyard. In the late '90s, a 450-pound lioness named Nala -- after a character in Disney's ""The Lion King"" -- escaped from Kissimmee's JungleLand Zoo when handlers were cleaning her cage. The declawed lion prowled the area, much to the chagrin of residents. Thankfully, no one was hurt. After a few days on the loose, Nala was found by a search team and returned to her pen. 3) Virginia: The wolf that escaped from the Los Angeles Zoo and may or may not have been recaptured. The story of Virginia the wolf is one of the stranger ones. The timber wolf escaped from her enclosure three times in the 1970s before she finally got out for good. It's unclear, however, what happened to the antsy wolf after that. 4) The 170+ Rhesus monkeys that took over Long Island in the 1930s. This kooky incident happened at an old-timey exotic animal park run by famous animal collector Frank Buck. According to the original 1935 New York Times article, the monkeys' area was left open one night, they got out and went bananas in a neighboring town. Local law enforcement realized something was up when they started getting more than a few phone calls reporting monkeys crawling around people's houses. Buck's jungle camp even offered a season pass to any resident who returned a monkey. 5) Ken Allen: The ""Hairy Houdini"" of the San Diego Zoo. Ken Allen is easily the San Diego Zoo's most famous -- and successful -- simian escape artist. He became famous in the '80s for his numerous, daring escapes. He even taught another orangutan how to use a branch the way a human uses a crowbar to bust out of their enclosure. In 2000, Ken was euthanized in captivity after being sick with cancer. He was 29. The LA Times wrote an obituary for the beloved orangutan. ""With the solemnity usually reserved for the passing of revered civic leaders, San Diego Zoo officials on Friday announced the death of Ken Allen, an escape-artist orangutan so beloved that he had his own fan club,"" wrote Tony Perry, a Times staff writer. 6) Nikica: The hippopotamus that wouldn't stay put. It's pretty tough to tell hippopotamuses what to do. They're very large and don't exactly take direction. That's what one village in Montenegro learned firsthand. In 2010, after some flooding in the area, Nikica escaped her pen and made her way into a body of water in the nearby village of Plavnica. The villagers didn't mind Nikica swimming around their homes, though, and she ended up being a pretty popular celebrity in the area. She was eventually brought home after floodwaters receded. 7) The nine bison that ran loose in Oakland only to be coaxed back into their enclosure with bread. In 1997, nine half-ton bison made a break for it from the Oakland Zoo. The herd didn't get very far, about 200 feet from the zoo grounds to be exact. The zookeepers lured the roaming bison back with pieces of bread. 8) Satara: The rhino that ran away from home after his mate left him for a younger rhino. It seems like rhinoceroses can go on jealous rampages, too. According to South Australia's The Advertiser, Satara was a two-ton rhinoceros that threw a jealous tantrum inside the Monarto Zoo near Adelaide. The 18-year-old male escaped his enclosure and ventured into another section of the zoo where other rhinos were held before wandering back into his pen. The zookeepers figured it was because of Satara's mate Yhura pairing up with a younger rhino. Scandalous. 9) The penguin that escaped a Japanese aquarium. Last year, a Humboldt penguin escaped from Tokyo Sea Life Park and spent a whopping three months waddling around the city. The 1-year-old fugitive was recaptured after being spotted multiple times swimming around Tokyo Bay. The penguin came back to the aquarium in good condition, apparently fit for big city life. 10) And of course, the clever Bronx Zoo cobra. In March 2011, an Egyptian cobra slithered away from the Bronx Zoo's World Of Reptiles -- and into the hearts of Twitter users. After a few days of searching, zoo officials found that the elusive snake hadn't gotten very far; she was hiding among pipes in a holding area in the zoo's reptile house. They lured the cobra out using rodent-scented wood shavings.","Rusty the red panda was found yesterday after a brief escape from the National Zoo .

"Asked Thursday why President Barack Obama has a hard time in Louisiana -- where his approval rating hovers around 40% -- Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu said a big reason has to do with his race.

""Trust me to do the right thing for the state."" The ""number one"" reason for Obama's unpopularity, she said, was the moratorium by the Obama administration on off-shore drilling following the BP oil spill in 2010.

""When you shut down the whole gulf of Mexico it puts a lot of people here at risk and out of business."" 7 times Democrats wished Barack Obama would go away . Responding to her comments, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal furiously called her answer ""remarkably divisive.""

""Obama's policies, which Mary supports, are unpopular here, and the other 49 states, because they are ill advised, liberal, and don't work."" ""His administration has also proven to be incompetent. Trying to blame it on race is ridiculous,"" he added.

"Sheryl Sandberg is a role model, say her defenders. The chief operating officer of Facebook earned two degrees from Harvard and spent the early part of her career in public service, rising to become chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers during the latter days of the Clinton administration. She helped build Google into a powerhouse; she has led the Facebook team in making the social media site ubiquitous. She's a mother who cares deeply about work-life balance and has been outspoken about women pulling together. Sheryl Sandberg is no role model, say her detractors. She's glided to the top thanks to the help of powerful men, whether it's the patronage of Summers, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt or Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. She's worth hundreds of millions of dollars, lives in an exclusive Bay Area suburb with a staff of minders and knows as much about being a working mother as a Pacific Heights socialite. One thing's for sure: Sheryl Sandberg is in the crosshairs. The myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career . Her new book, ""Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,"" is out Monday, and her arguments, focusing on how women in the workplace can grow their careers and their lives, have attracted both praise and denunciation -- though, as the New Yorker's Anna Holmes has noted, many of the denouncers have jumped on Sandberg in the ""ready, fire, aim"" fashion typical of the commentariat. ""Anyone who had read her book would have known that Sandberg herself is the first to acknowledge the debts she owes to the women who came before her, not to mention her youthful naivete and eventual engagement with gender politics,"" Holmes wrote. So just who is Sheryl Sandberg, and why are people saying such extreme things about her? A woman in Silicon Valley's boys' club . She's a rarity, for one. The Silicon Valley culture, as Ken Auletta observed in a thoughtful 2011 profile of Sandberg, remains male-dominated. As a woman, Sandberg has had to find her way among a boys' club not always friendly to her sex, though colleagues such as Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, once of Google herself, may be helping change that. At its core the tech industry is still a land of engineers -- coders and designers who put in endless caffeine-fueled hours trying to perfect the next cool thing, while the marketers and financial types are one step removed. Indeed, that was one reason Zuckerberg hired her: She ""handles things I don't want to,"" he told Auletta, so he can focus on his strengths. Sandberg, 43, was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in south Florida. Her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother gave up teaching to raise Sheryl and two siblings. The family's passion was supporting Soviet Jews -- the ""refuseniks"" -- and their house became a meeting place for the movement. As a child, Sheryl sent letters to a Soviet ""twin,"" Kira Volvovsky, who developed a network of correspondents. ""I remember feeling when I was writing these girls, and they were writing me, that we had the same issues,"" Volvovsky told CNN last year. ""They wrote about the same stuff I was feeling."" It's that kind of support group that Sandberg stresses in ""Lean In."" How do you balance work and family? Share your story with CNN iReport . In a TED talk that echoes some of the material in the book, Sandberg mentioned that it's hard enough to succeed in a male-dominated world as a female businesswoman. In fact, there was one office, she observed, where she may have been the first woman to pitch a deal to a particular firm; the firm's partner didn't even know where the women's restroom was. Add to that the stresses of motherhood and it's no surprise she wants to offer encouragement to other working women, without sugar-coating the advice. Among the book's chapter titles are ""Sit at the Table,"" ""It's a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder"" and ""The Myth of Doing It All."" University of Michigan business professor Marina Whitman, a pioneer in her own right -- she was a full-time professor and a corporate executive when it was unusual for women to lead companies -- agrees that ""doing it all"" is a mirage. ""I think this thing about 'can women have it all?' or 'can't they have it all?' is kind of a silly argument,"" she said. ""Yes, you may have it all, but not all at once."" Moreover, she adds, success isn't to be measured by how many women become corporate CEOs, but by how much leeway women have to make their own choices. In her TED talk, Sandberg stresses the same point, emphasizing that choice doesn't often come without compromise, the kind that men aren't always asked to make. Women, she said, have ""to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table,"" she said. ""And we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not."" 'I never thought I would write a book' Oh, that's easy for Sandberg to say, say her critics. Sure, she's worked hard, but she's had a gilded life. Indeed, Sandberg has regularly been at the head of her class. Summers, impressed by her work in his Harvard economics class, became her adviser and took her along when he joined the World Bank. She left that job two years later, in 1993, to join the prominent McKinsey & Co. consultancy. She earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, rejoined Summers as part of the Clinton administration, and was recruited by Google's Schmidt to join Google in 2001, when the company was just taking off -- a process she drove by improving the reach of AdWords and AdSense, two of Google's major moneymakers. Now, as COO of Facebook, she has been part of another phenomenon, a company that now claims more than a billion users. Sandberg holds close to 2 million Facebook shares and has options on millions more, according to the company's 2012 stock filing. She and her husband, SurveyMonkey CEO David Goldberg, share a brand-new 9,000-square-foot mansion. So of course she can leave work at 5:30 to take care of her two kids. After all, she's the boss. But for all her apparent wealth and power -- for all her success -- Sandberg appears to remain the rather retiring person she was in high school and college, the kind of person who ""did not speak or raise her hand,"" writes Auletta. ""I never thought I would write a book,"" she says in ""Lean In."" She decided to do so only after years of discussion with colleagues. She defines ""leaning in"" as ""being ambitious,"" and it's an assertion she appears to make hesitantly because the stakes are so large. Now that ""Lean In"" is out, said MIT business professor Lotte Bailyn, Sandberg should use her bully pulpit to push workplace changes -- not just for women, but men as well. The typical workplace is the way it is because we accept our endless days and constant deadlines as the norm. We need less rigidity, more creativity, more room for work-life balance, she said. ""The problem isn't about fixing the women. The problem is about gender roles and dynamics and the expectations and norms that exist in the workplace,"" she said. ""As long as we keep emphasizing how to fix the women, I don't think we're going to get very far."" Michigan's Whitman agreed that Sandberg can help change the dialogue. ""Absolutely Sheryl Sandberg is right to encourage women to have more self-confidence,"" she said. ""But I also think it's wrong to define success for women in terms of how many Sheryl Sandbergs we can produce. What is more critical is what can we change to make the balance less difficult for that much larger host of women who work not for self-fulfillment, but because they have to."" For now, though, Sandberg has made her statement. As for all the criticism? Something she told Auletta two years ago suggests she's probably wondering why all the fuss is about her, and not the bigger issues. ""I feel really grateful to the people who encouraged me and helped me develop,"" she said. ""Nobody can succeed on their own.""

"For thousands of prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine charges, the prison doors will be opening early, thanks to sentencing changes easing the disparity between the penalties for possessing or distributing crack vs. powder cocaine. Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act in August 2010, changing the 100-to-1 disparity between minimum sentences for crack and powder cocaine to 18 to 1. The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted this summer to make the reduced crack penalties retroactive, which means more than 12,000 current inmates are eligible to request reduced sentences. The retroactivity took effect Tuesday. The Sentencing Commission estimates that inmates will have an average of three years chopped off their sentences. An estimated 1,800 inmates became eligible for release immediately because they had already served enough time, and prosecutors did not object to their release. Critics of the old sentencing system say it was unfair to African-Americans, who make up the majority of those convicted of possessing and distributing crack. ""This really has been one of the great stains on our federal criminal justice system for 20 years or more,"" said Michael Nachmanoff, the federal public defender for the Eastern District of Virginia. ""This disparity between the punishment for crack cocaine and powder was really unjustified."" Nachmanoff noted under the old guidelines someone who had just 5 grams of crack cocaine would receive a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. But someone would have to have 500 grams of powdered cocaine to receive a similar sentence. Nachmanoff's district is believed to have the largest number of people in the country -- between 800 and 900 people -- who might benefit from the reduced sentencing guidelines on crack. He said 75 of his clients were expected to be released on the first day of retroactivity. ""A lot of people have been sitting in jail for a long time not because they didn't commit crimes, but because the punishment they faced was too harsh and unjustified compared to other people who had committed similar crimes in similar ways,"" Nachmanoff told CNN. He said reduced sentences will not be automatic. Judges must review the cases and determine whether an early release of an inmate represents a danger to the community. William Johnson, a Virginia man convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in 1997, was one of those released Tuesday. ""It's unbelievable. I'm ecstatic,"" Johnson told CNN."" The 39-year-old father of four said he only found out Monday he would be released the next day. Under the terms of his original sentence, he would have been eligible for release in October  2018, and that sentence was reduced a few years ago so that his revised release date was June 2014. Johnson, who identified himself as an African-American, said there seemed to be a racial component to the different sentences given out in the past for crack and powder cocaine, but he said he wouldn't describe himself as bitter. ""I don't have time for it,"" said Johnson. He said he's concentrating on catching up with family members and making plans to go into business cleaning office buildings. Families Against Mandatory Minimums has fought for changes in mandatory cocaine penalties for years. ""Most mandatory sentences are so high and so rigid that judges can't get around them, so people are going to prison for extraordinarily long times, way beyond what they need to learn their lessons,"" said FAMM spokeswoman Julie Stewart. But even with the changes, there is still an 18-to-1 disparity in sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses. Nachmanoff said now a person with crack will have to have 28 grams before triggering a mandatory five-year minimum sentence. But the person with powder cocaine still must have a much larger amount -- at least 500 grams. ""Ultimately the right answer is 1 to 1, and people in the law enforcement community and the criminal justice system recognize that,"" said Nachmanoff. ""But that just means that there's still more work to do.""","U.S. Sentencing Commission voted to make reduced minimum penalties retroactive .

"India's general election, the largest democratic exercise in history, begins Monday. Voters will elect 543 members to the lower house of parliament, which will then select the country's next prime minister. Here are 11 things you need to know about the world's biggest election: . 1. Its massive scale. More than 814 million voters are eligible to cast ballots over the next month to elect the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, up from 713 million voters in 2009. The Indian voting pool is larger than the total populations of the United States and Western Europe combined. Given the infrastructure in India, an election of this scale can't be done in a day. Voting will take place in nine blocks over the next five weeks, to allow election authorities to tackle the daunting logistics of operating 930,000 polling stations. The vote counting will be carried out and concluded on May 16. 2. It's the economy, stupid. India's flagging economic performance is the election's central issue. After registering Chinese-style growth rates of 8% to 10% in the 2000s, India's economy slowed sharply in 2012. GDP growth now remains below 5%, coupled with persistently high inflation. Indian politicians and academics remain divided over whether the country should focus its energy on first reigniting growth or on alleviating poverty. Even after a decade of rapid growth, India is still home to one in three of the world's poorest people. Unlike other countries, India's poor tend to vote in higher numbers  than the rich. 3. The BJP and the ""Modi wave."" India's main opposition party, the strongly nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, is positioned to win the most seats in the lower house of parliament, though it is not likely to win the outright majority necessary to form a government without coalition partners. The BJP's prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, has gathered momentum by positioning himself as an advocate for economic development and good governance. Many expect Modi's business-friendly campaign to lead his party to its biggest victory ever. 4. Modi's charisma and controversy. Modi has a strong record as chief minister of the state of Gujarat and a ""strong man"" reputation that many see as a welcome contrast to current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. But Modi has also been criticized for his authoritarian bent and ties to right-wing Hindu organizations. Although an investigation set up by India's Supreme Court cleared him of wrongdoing in 2012, some voters remain suspicious of Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, in which 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. The U.S. State Department denied Modi a visa in 2005 because of his alleged culpability, but it changed tack in March, saying it would welcome Modi to the United States if he wins the election. Infographic: India's vote by the numbers . 5. The crisis of confidence in the Congress party. Anemic growth, persistent inflation and frequent corruption scandals have tried the public's patience with the Indian National Congress, the country's oldest party and the core of the ruling United Progressive Alliance over the past decade. Rahul Gandhi, the heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and the party's choice for prime minister, has been portrayed as a reluctant leader, and some believe the Congress will be reduced to its lowest number of seats in history. For its part, the Congress criticizes the BJP's policies as exclusionary and emphasizes its social welfare programs, aimed at helping the poor. 6. Nepotism is here to stay. The competition between Gandhi and Modi has become something of a public referendum on India's entrenched political elite. Rahul Gandhi, who is the son and grandson of previous prime ministers, is depicted by critics as cosseted and out-of-touch, while Modi's campaign emphasizes his humble origins working for his father's tea stall as a child. But despite Modi's popular appeal, research by Patrick French indicates nepotism remains alive and well in Indian politics. Nearly 30% of current members of parliament are from political families; for parliamentary members younger than 40, the figure rises to two-thirds. 7. Criminality among the Indian political class is endemic.  An astonishing 30% of the current parliament faces criminal charges. Judging by the new crop of candidates, it isn't going to be much better in the new parliament. According to research published last week, almost a fifth of the candidates face criminal charges. By contrast, none of the sitting members of the U.S. Congress is facing criminal charges; in 2013, only two members -- or less than half a percent -- were convicted of a crime. Put another way -- and this may come as something of a surprise to those many American readers who hold the U.S. Congress in low regard -- Indian parliamentarians are on average 60 times more likely to be charged with a crime than their U.S. counterparts. Corruption and criminality may prove hard to shake in Indian politics, since the rising cost of campaigns means they are dominated by the wealthy. The Centre for Media Studies estimates that Indian politicians may spend around $5 billion campaigning, triple the sum for the last national poll in 2009. The figure is second only to the $7 billion spent in the 2012 U.S. presidential race, the world's most expensive election. 8. The role of young voters and social media. First-time voters are expected to make up roughly 10% of those who will go to the polls this election. India's population is very young: More than 65%, or nearly 800 million people, are younger than 35, according to the latest census.  This youth bulge is lending weight to candidates who prioritize economic development, as well as increasing the importance of social media in campaigns. Young voters grew up after reforms to liberalize the Indian economy began in 1991, and thus have high expectations for leaders to reignite India's growth. In large part because of the youth contingent, spending on social media advertising during the election may reach $83 million. 9. The rise of the Aam Aadmi Party. An offshoot of the anti-corruption protests in 2011-2012, the AAP galvanized support with its surprise showing in last year's  local elections for the Delhi Assembly.. The AAP won 28 of the legislature's 70 seats and its leader, activist-turned-politician Arvind Kejriwal, was appointed as Delhi's chief minister. But while the AAP has energized young voters and the middle class, it hasn't yet shown it can transition from a protest movement to a governing force. After failing to deliver on key election promises, Kejriwal quit his post in Delhi after only 49 days in office. The AAP is expected to take votes from more established parties in the election and could be instrumental in forming a governing coalition. 10. Women are raising their voices. Long expected to vote in line with the male members of their families, Indian women are becoming an electoral force in their own right. Women account for 48.5% of the electorate, but in some recent polls, they have voted in higher numbers than men. Inflation and safety are likely to be among their most pressing concerns as women control most household budgets and violence against women is an emergent political issue. The gang rape and subsequent death of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi in December 2012 and numerous other cases have sparked widespread protests and precipitated a reckoning of the position and treatment of Indian women. 11. The key role of regional parties. No party has won an outright majority in India since 1989. This year's results are likely to be the same, meaning India's regional parties will likely be instrumental in helping the BJP or Congress form a government. Regional parties control five of India's biggest states -- Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, which together account for more than 200 Lok Sabha seats -- and their wide variety of agendas and proclivities make determining India's future policy direction difficult. Whether elected officials can deliver the decisive governance that India needs will depend in large part on the character and strength of the governing coalition.","World's largest election has begun in India; lower house and next prime minister are at stake .

"The northern Indian city of Meerut was both panicked and intrigued by a leopard on the loose on Sunday, which has eluded captors since. The big cat was found in a local timber shop before being cornered in a nearby hospital, local forest official Sushant Sharma told CNN on Tuesday. Animal control experts were called to tranquilize the animal, which made a daring escape, breaking a window in the room to make its getaway. After breaking out of the hospital it went into a cinema and later also entered an apartment block. Stunning photographs purport to show the leopard leaping across rooftops, squeezing through a hole in the wall of the Meerut Cantonment Hospital, and snarling at a baton-wielding official through a window. Crowds complicate capture efforts . The cat sparked more inquisitiveness than trepidation as onlookers crowded around the site of the cat's incarceration, hampering efforts by the authorities to capture and release the leopard. ""It got agitated and escaped,"" Sharma said. But curiosity got the better of some in the crowd. Seven people were injured by the leopard, including a policeman who needed treatment for a gash on the shoulder. No sightings were confirmed on Monday and Sushant did not rule out the possibility the leopard had retreated into the forests. ""Nothing happened (Monday). So, there are chances it could have gone back to the forests. But we are still trying to track it,"" Sharma said. Leopard suspected of eating 15 people in Nepal . Human encroachment . The incident is the latest in a series of big cat attacks in India, including at least one alleged man-eater, also in Uttar Pradesh, home to one of the world's last remaining tiger habitats. A leopard also mauled a 5-year-old boy to death in the eastern state of Chhattisgarh last week. The increasing number of sightings -- and attacks -- by big cats in India is raising the issue of human encroachment on wild animal habitats. ""There are many cases where human habitats are encroaching on those of big cats, which are getting lesser and lesser over the years,"" said Jimmy Borah, Tiger Coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund India. ""The cats are forced to come out of their habitats to look for food. There is lots of habitat loss and with that food source loss -- it's one of the main problems, which is why they are coming out."" Officials said at least nine people have died from tiger attacks since the end of December. Eight of those deaths have been blamed on a single man-eating female tiger. ""It is possible that the tiger came out (of her habitat) looking for food and the humans accidentally came out in front of the tigers, which would mean she would be bound to kill them. Maybe she was with cubs, and as tigers are very protective they will actively attack threats."" Borah said that in areas where there is no human encroachment, population numbers are stable. However, he agreed that if a particular animal was positively identified as one responsible for human deaths, ""then one option is taking her out.""","Leopard runs amok in Meerut, north-east of New Delhi .

"Before authorities arrested him at O'Hare International Airport and accused him of attempting to provide aid to ISIS, a teen from the Chicago suburbs left behind a letter for his parents. Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, wrote that he was leaving the United States and on the way to join ISIS, according to a criminal complaint. He invited his family to join him in the three-page letter, which authorities found in the bedroom he shared with a sibling in Bolingbrook, Illinois. But he warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans, the complaint said. ""First and foremost, please make sure not to to tell the authorities,"" he wrote, according to the complaint. ""For if this were to happen it will jeopardize not only the safety of us but our family as well."" A round-trip ticket was purchased for Khan from Chicago to Istanbul, authorities said. But the teen never made it to his destination. Once he crossed security at the airport Saturday, federal agents stopped him and executed a search warrant at his home, where documents expressing support for ISIS and jihadists were recovered, the U.S. attorney's office said. Among them, according to the complaint: drawings of the black ISIS flag and a notebook including a sketch of an ISIS fighter accompanied by words in Arabic: ""Come to Jihad."" Now he's charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The teen was taken into custody without incident and made his first court appearance Monday CNN affiliates reported. The charge he faces carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His parents declined to comment after Monday's hearing, The Chicago Tribune reported. ""As Khan was being led from the courtroom by deputy marshals, his father put his arm around Khan's weeping mother and sought to calm her,"" the newspaper said. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? Letter: Teen felt obligated to 'migrate' Details about who purchased the airplane ticket for Khan and whom he was planning to meet in Turkey were not included in the criminal complaint. But the court document does state that the FBI has withheld many details for now, including in the document only enough to persuade a judge to criminally charge Khan. The search at Khan's Bolingbrook home, where he lives with his parents, turned up documents allegedly written by Khan that stated his intentions. In the letter, Khan wrote that there is an obligation to ""migrate"" to ISIS-controlled territory. ISIS, an extremist Islamist group, has been fighting to take over a swath of territory in Iraq and Syria where it wants to establish a caliphate or Islamic state. ""We are all witness that the Western societies are getting more immoral day by day,"" Khan is wrote in the letter, according to the complaint. ""I do not want my kids being exposed to filth like this."" Finally, he asks his family to join him in the ""Islamic State."" During questioning at the airport, Khan waived his Miranda rights and told FBI agents that a person he met online (not identified by name in the court document) had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in Istanbul. That person, Khan told agents, was to take him to ISIS territory. According to the complaint, Khan told authorities he was planning on being in some type of public service -- like a police force -- or providing humanitarian work or a combat role. Turkey, the complaint notes, is a common transit point for foreign fighters from Western countries who travel to join ISIS. Feds: NY store owner plotted to kill U.S. troops himself . Other alleged ISIS recruits in America . Opinion: How to stop ISIS from recruiting Americans . This isn't the first time authorities have accused Americans of supporting ISIS. ""ISIS is smart, and they're using social media to recruit as many Americans or other allies to come to Syria to be radicalized and trained to fight,"" Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, said Monday. ""There are other Americans who are being recruited,"" the congressman told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""It doesn't mean they're going to Syria, but some do."" On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that his agency is tracking a dozen Americans that have joined terrorist groups inside Syria. ""These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way, and so they come across the propaganda, and they become radicalized on their own, sort of independent study, and they're also able to equip themselves with training, again, through the Internet,"" Comey told CBS. ""And then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement."" Last month federal authorities detailed their case against the owner of a New York food store who they accused of funding ISIS and plotting to gun down U.S. troops who had served in Iraq. A law enforcement official told CNN that former Boston resident and U.S. citizen Ahmad Abousamra could be a key player in the ISIS social media machine that's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda online -- messages meant both to terrify and recruit Westerners. And CNN obtained tapes of American terrorists recruiting friends in the United States to join terror groups like ISIS. ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe. A CIA source told CNN last month that more than 15,000 foreign fighters, including 2,000 Westerners, had gone to the civil war in Syria. It was not immediately clear how many had joined ISIS and how many were with other groups opposed to the Syrian government. The foreign fighters come from more than 80 countries, the CIA source said. A top State Department official insisted Monday that American efforts to combat ISIS' powerful online message are working, successfully keeping disaffected youth from joining the extremist group. ""We have evidence that there are young people who are not joining because we have somehow interceded,"" Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel told CNN's Elise Labott on Monday. ""They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing.""

"The U.S. Supreme Court refused Friday to stop the pending release of thousands of California inmates to solve chronic, severe overcrowding in the state prisons. The unsigned order is the latest chapter in a long-running federal lawsuit by prisoners and their advocates against what they called dangerous and unacceptable conditions in 30 state correctional institutions. A judge's order in May required the state to further reduce the prison population by 9,600 inmates by year's end. The state has repeatedly cited public safety in resisting the mandated releases. The state in recent days asked the Supreme Court for an injunction to delay implementation of the order. The high court in 2011 upheld an earlier order setting limits on the prison population and a timetable for the state to follow to meet that ceiling. Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the stay requested by the state. Scalia, in a toughly worded dissent, called the original release order a ""terrible injunction"" and suggested the result would be that many of the released prisoners will commit more crimes. California to challenge court order to release 10,000 inmates by year's end . There was no immediate reaction from Gov. Jerry Brown, but he had called the earlier mandate ""unprecedented."" A three-judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by December 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if it did not report on its progress every two weeks. Until recently, California had the nation's largest prison system and officials have said they have been reducing overcrowding. The case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the federal panel's determination that California's medical and mental health care for inmates fell below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirement was by reducing prison crowding. The justices two years ago found ""continuing injury and harm resulting from these serious constitutional violations,"" including as many as 156,000 people crammed in correctional facilities designed to hold about half that many. Justice Anthony Kennedy at the time noted ""needless suffering and death have been the well-documented result. Over the whole course of years during which this litigation has been pending, no other remedies have been found to be sufficient."" Federal judges in May expressed impatience with California officials, the defendants in the case. They threatened to cite the state with contempt if it did not comply with the release orders. The larger issue is a classic battle over state versus federal authority, focusing on whether U.S. courts can step in and essentially run state prisons when officials have repeatedly violated basic constitutional guarantees afforded inmates. The competing arguments amount to a sharply divided debate between public safety concerns and individual rights, a debate that goes into how the three branches of government should balance competing state interests. Alito had dissented from the 2011 ruling, and warned any mass release of inmates to alleviate overcrowding would be ""gambling with the safety of the people of California."" Prison overcrowding is a nationwide problem, but California's dilemma is unique in its massive scope and time frame. A special federal court in 2009 ordered the state to shrink the prison population from 202% over capacity to a maximum of 137.5%, and to accomplish that in two years. The state was given wide latitude to meet the goal, but the court was adamant the state do it without delay and without excuse. The current high court appeal is Brown v. Plata (13A57).

Satao was shot with poisoned arrows in the sprawling Tsavo National Park in the country's southeast. Wildlife officials found his carcass with two massive holes where his tusks once stood. His face was so badly mutilated, authorities used other ways to identify him, including his ears and the pattern of mud caked on his body. ""Satao is dead, killed by an ivory poacher's poisoned arrow to feed the seemingly insatiable demand for ivory in far off countries. A great life lost so that someone far away can have a trinket on their mantlepiece,"" Tsavo Trust said in statement late Friday. ""Rest in peace, old friend, you will be missed."" Satao was about 45 years old, and a hit among visitors at the national park, where understaffed conservationists monitored him regularly to protect him from poachers. ""When he was alive, his enormous tusks were easily identifiable, even from the air,"" said Tsavo Trust, a non-profit that protects wildlife. Though he mostly roamed within a limited part of the park, he recently started venturing to an area considered a hotbed of poaching activity. The area he moved to in search of fresh water is hard to access due to its thick vegetation and scarce roads. ""With today's mounting poaching pressures and anti-poaching resources stretched to the limit, it proved impossible to prevent the poachers getting through the net,"" Tsavo Trust said. His carcass was found earlier this month, but authorities verified his identity Friday. ""We are left with no choice but to acknowledge that the great Satao is no more,"" the trust said in a statement. South Africa marks worst year in rhino killings . Satao is a victim of an illegal ivory trade that has doubled worldwide since 2007, with the United States among the top markets for illegally acquired tusks because of unregulated ways of purchasing ivory, including the Internet and auctions.  China is the largest market, and other Asian nations such as Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam also drive demand. Conservation groups say the recent surge in the illicit ivory trade has resulted in the killing of 30,000 African elephants annually in recent years.  The tusks sell for thousands of dollars, making it a lucrative trade and endangering already fragile populations in Africa. ""The surge in the killing of elephants in Africa and the illegal taking of other listed species globally threatens not only wildlife populations but the livelihoods of millions who depend on tourism for a living,"" said Achim Steiner, executive director of the U.N. environment program. Armed groups are capitalizing on the increasing value of ivory by killing elephants and trading their tusks for arms and ammunition. Elephants, rangers face growing threats in Chad .

"Witnesses are crediting a family's German shepherd with shielding its owners from gunfire in an Atlanta road-rage incident. The Friday incident began with an altercation on an Atlanta road, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. The driver followed the family to a nearby strip mall and began shooting, according to an unnamed witness interviewed by the station. ""They just rolled right up, they pulled a gun out and started clapping,"" the witness said, using a slang term for shooting. The witness said the dog jumped in front of one of the children and a woman in the car. Surveillance video captured the dog trotting off to die behind a nearby building, WXIA reported. ""They were fired upon and their family was terrorized,"" Atlanta police Sgt.Gregory Lyon told the station. ""They survived that only to find that their pet is now gone. It's sad for the whole family, especially the day after Thanksgiving.""

"On Sunday, a man shot and killed a 14-year-old boy and his grandfather at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and then drove to a nearby Jewish retirement community where he shot and killed a third person. Police arrested a suspect, Frazier Glenn Cross, who shouted ""Heil Hitler"" after he was taken into custody. Cross, who also goes by Frazier Glenn Miller, is a well-known right wing extremist who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Now let's do the thought experiment in which instead of shouting ""Heil Hitler"" after he was arrested, the suspect had shouted ""Allahu Akbar."" Only two days before the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings, this simple switch of words would surely have greatly increased the extent and type of coverage the incident received. Yet the death toll in the shootings in Kansas is similar to that of last year's Boston Marathon bombings, where three people were killed and the suspects later killed a police officer as they tried to evade capture.   (Many more, of course, were also wounded in the Boston attacks; 16 men, women and children lost limbs.) In fact, since 9/11 extremists affiliated with a variety of far-right wing ideologies, including white supremacists, anti-abortion extremists and anti-government militants, have killed more people in the United States than have extremists motivated by al Qaeda's ideology. According to a count by the New America Foundation, right wing extremists have killed 34 people in the United States for political reasons since 9/11. (The total includes the latest shootings in Kansas, which are being classified as a hate crime). By contrast, terrorists motivated by al Qaeda's ideology have killed 21 people in the United States since 9/11. (Although a variety of left wing militants and environmental extremists have carried out violent attacks for political reasons against property and individuals since 9/11, none have been linked to a lethal attack, according to research by the New America Foundation.) Moreover, since 9/11 none of the more than 200 individuals indicted or convicted in the United States of some act of jihadist terrorism have acquired or used chemical or biological weapons or their precursor materials, while 13 individuals motivated by right wing extremist ideology, one individual motivated by left-wing extremist ideology, and two with idiosyncratic beliefs, used or acquired such weapons or their precursors. Opinion: Why do racists and anti-Semites kill? A similar attack to the one that Frazier Glenn Cross is accused of in Kansas occurred in August 2012 when Wade Michael Page killed six people in a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin.  Page was a member of a white supremacist band and associated with the Hammerskins, a white supremacist group. Page committed suicide during the attack. Page is not, of course, the only right wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends. In 2009, for instance, Shawna Forde, Albert Gaxiola, and Jason Bush raided a house in Arizona, killing Raul Flores and his daughter Brisenia. The three attackers sought to use the burglary to finance their anti-immigration vigilante group, Minutemen American Defense.  Forde and Bush were convicted and sentenced to death. Gaxiola was sentenced to life in prison. Also in 2009, Scott Roeder murdered Dr. George Tiller, who ran an abortion clinic in Wichita, Kansas.  In 2010 Roeder was convicted of first-degree murder.  According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Roeder not only had ties to the extreme anti-abortion movement, but he also had been pulled over while driving with a fake license plate bearing the markings of the Sovereign Citizens, a movement of individuals who deny that the government has authority over them. Of course, the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil prior to 9/11 was the Oklahoma City bombing, which was masterminded by Timothy McVeigh, a man with deep ties to far-right militant circles.  McVeigh killed 168 people when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995. Despite this history of deadly violence by individuals motivated by political ideologies other than al Qaeda, it is jihadist violence that continues to dominate the news and the attention of policy makers. Some of this is quite understandable.  After all, on 9/11 al Qaeda's 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in the space of a morning. Since then al Qaeda's branch in Yemen tried to bring down with a bomb secreted on a passenger an American commercial jet flying over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 and al Qaeda's branch in Pakistan tried to launch bombings on the New York subway system a few months earlier. Luckily those plots didn't succeed, but certainly if they had the death toll would have been on a large scale. Yet the disparity in media coverage between even failed jihadist terrorist attacks and this latest incident in Kansas is emblematic of a flawed division in the public's mind between killing that is purportedly committed in the name of Allah and killing that is committed for other political ends, such as neo-Nazi beliefs about the need to kill Jews. Part of the reason for this disconnect might be that when a Department of Homeland Security report warning of violent right wing extremism was leaked in 2009, it generated a substantial political controversy. In a 2011 interview with the Southern Poverty Law Center, Daryl Johnson, the leader of the team that produced the report, argued that following the controversy, DHS's examination of such threats suffered, stating ""Since our report was leaked, DHS has not released a single report of its own on this topic. Not anything dealing with non-Islamic domestic extremism‚Äîwhether it's anti-abortion extremists, white supremacists, 'sovereign citizens,' eco-terrorists, the whole gamut."" The threat from al Qaeda and its associated forces has changed significantly since 9/11. Today, almost 13 years after 9/11, al Qaeda has not successfully conducted another attack inside the United States. And since 2011, no individual charged with plotting to conduct an al Qaeda-inspired terrorist attack inside the United States has acted with more than one accomplice. This demonstrates the difficulties today of forming a jihadist group sufficiently large enough to conduct a complex attack anything on the scale of 9/11, and is a tribute to the success of law enforcement agencies in detecting and deterring jihadist terrorist activity. Today in the United States, al Qaeda-type terrorism is the province of individuals with no real connection to foreign terrorists, aside from reading their propaganda online.  Given this, it becomes harder to explain, in terms of American national security, why violence by homegrown right wing extremists receives substantially less attention than does violence by homegrown jihadist militants.

"Approximately 36,000 deaths are caused by suicide each year in the United States. What if a simple blood test could one day help prevent that from happening? In a new small study, researchers were able to predict who had experienced suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide just by looking at their blood. The experimental test was over 80% accurate. ""With a test like ours, we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe,"" said the study's lead author, Zachary Kaminsky, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine. Kaminsky and his colleagues ran tests on samples of blood, looking for an increase of certain chemicals on a gene called SKA2 that seems to help the brain regulate stress. The gene's instructions are carried out in a region of the brain that controls negative thoughts and impulsive behaviors. Scientists believe people with the abnormal version of the gene have more trouble shutting off the flood of hormones produced by their bodies in response to stress. ""It's good to be stressed if you're crossing the street. You need to be ramped up. You need to be focused,"" Kaminsky said. ""But when you're safely across the other side, you don't want to stay in that mode."" Since the chemicals were also consistently higher in the brains of people who have killed themselves, the Hopkins researchers think the chemicals may be linked to suicide. And these chemicals could, theoretically, be identified using a simple blood test. ""This kind of genetic screening is going to be one way forward to predict who is at high risk,"" said Dr. John Mann, a psychiatrist and neurochemist at Columbia University Medical Center. He was not involved in the study. Experts have to rely on simply asking people whether they're feeling suicidal to assess suicide risk. ""If someone is really committed to committing suicide, they may choose to lie,"" Kaminsky said. But a blood test to gauge a person's suicide risk is at least five to 10 years away from being readily available, he said. Jill Harkavy-Friedman, the vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide, is optimistic about the potential of identifying suicidal patients earlier. ""Just because you have a risk doesn't mean you're destined to kill yourself. It means the opposite,"" she said. ""If you know you have a risk, you can be having conversations with your doctor, your mental health professional, and your family and friends about how to prevent getting to the point of a suicide crisis.""","In small study, researchers accurately predict suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts .

"It is Mother's Day, and let us celebrate single-mother households -- not as half empty, but as half full of strong women. It is a good time to encourage children raised by women to see themselves as resilient, not doomed. And it is time, today and every day, for our culture to stop assigning blame and start offering help. The 19.7 million children in this country with delinquent or absent fathers are not all headed for lives of crime, drugs, poverty and prison.  To begin: Single moms have given us Olympian Michael Phelps, comedian Bill Cosby, Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. I can name many more, from my own life, and I'll bet you can from yours. My sons' good friend, Ellis Coleman, for example -- the 20-year-old superstar also headed for the London Olympics for the U.S., the wrestler recognized worldwide as the originator of the ""flying squirrel"" takedown. The proud son of a single mom. Popular culture routinely offers up hackneyed depictions of struggling single moms and screwed-up kids. And there is no end of studies, many aimed at getting delinquent dads to step up, that show kids of single moms facing an uphill battle when it comes to such things as performance in school, college attendance and earning potential. I am the single mother of three sons -- grown to manhood and doing just fine. And I am here to tell you that the reality for kids from single-mom households can be as good as it is for kids in two-parent homes -- better, in some cases. Particularly with input from different arenas, single mothers can envision the futures of their children in a very positive light. In the recent book, ""Sons Without Fathers: What Every Mother Needs to Know,"" authors James Dickerson and Mardi Allan assert that positive role models and an environment of support are key to a child's success. And several recent studies point to a range of factors -- from a mother's religiosity, external emotional support and a grandparent living in the home -- that can concretely contribute to single mothers' raising productive, happy children. A study of 1,134 single mothers, published in the April issue of Journal of Marriage and Family, found that those who attend religious services are more likely to experience positive developmental outcomes for their children. In a separate report in February, published in Child Trends, data show that regardless of economic status, ethnicity or education, the single mothers who were regularly offered emotional support had ""children and adolescents who were also more likely to display social competence and school engagement,"" compared with single mothers without social support. A 2002 study published in Demography showed that teenagers living with their single mothers in multigenerational homes ""have outcomes that are at least as good and often better than the outcomes of teenagers in married families."" I have been divorced since 1996, when my sons were 7, 5 and 2. I have found that my faith practices, help from my siblings, and reliable and persistent help from my mother kept my sons on the straight and narrow. Of course there are single mothers who fail their children. Of course there are good fathers who make sure their children have a chance to succeed. And children with two loving parents in the home can still encounter big troubles. Beyond that, there are realities that are hard to dispute. A new study, ""Father Hunger: An Economic View of Delinquent Fathers,"" describes the apocalypse caused by single parenting framed in economic terms. This white paper, by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists, describes the education gap, earnings gap and ultimately value lost from direct and indirect labor income to the nation's economy of $60 billion per year. According to the study, children growing up in one-parent homes are 16% more likely to drop out of high school. Only 14.3% of students from one-parent households will attend some college, compared with 17.6% in two-parent households. But that is the bad news. I say let's focus on the other sides of those figures, the kids who succeed and the single moms who get them there. To be sure, single mothers are swimming against the tide in a culture that in its predominant narrative declares our children are liabilities in society, not blessings. For years, screens large and small have been flickering with images of single mothers as seriously flawed and in need of rescue.  In ""Modern Family,"" Sofia Vergara's character, Gloria, needs Jay to financially and emotionally rescue her to help her raise her son.  In ""Act Like a Man, Think Like a Lady,"" the single mother character is trying to date herself out of her parenthood predicament. Robert Townsend's recent ""Diary of a Single Mom"" follows three single mothers who have to band together in order to survive. But beginning next week, ""The Bachelorette"" will for the first time feature a single mother as the sun in the solar system of suitors. That's a kind of progress, I suppose. Let's see more of that. And let's see more success stories.  Here are a few: My oldest son graduated from the University of Wisconsin- Madison in 2011 and is now in Madrid earning a master's in translation in Spanish. My middle son is completing his junior year at the Ohio State University and will graduate next May. My youngest son is headed to the University of Iowa in August. Not bad for a single mom.","Michele Weldon says on Mother's Day, single motherhood should be celebrated .

"SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, California (CNN) -- Beyond the towering trees that have stood here for thousands of years, an intense drug war is being waged. Authorities uncovered more than $1 billion worth of pot plants in Sequoia National Forest this week. Illegal immigrants connected to Mexico's drug cartels are growing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of marijuana in the heart of one of America's national treasures, authorities say. It's a booming business that, federal officials say, feeds Mexico's most violent drug traffickers. ""These aren't Cheech and Chong plants,"" said John Walters, director of the National Drug Control Policy. ""People who farm now are not doing this for laughs, despite the fact Hollywood still thinks that. They're doing it to make a lot of money."" Walters spoke from a ""marijuana garden"" tucked deep into the Sequoia National Forest, a two- to four-hour hike from the nearest road, far removed from the giant sequoias the region is best known for.  Watch Hollywood needs to chill out, get serious about pot ¬ª . Ten thousand marijuana plants, some 5 feet tall, dotted the mountainside's steep terrain amid thick brush, often near streams. This garden's street value is an estimated $40 million, authorities said. Walters clutched three plants he said were worth $12,000 on the streets. ""This is about serious criminal organizations,"" Walters said. ""They're willing to kill anybody who gets in their way. They're taking money back to those who kill prosecutors, judges and law enforcement.""  See photos of pot farm sweep in heart of U.S. national treasure ¬ª . Over the past eight days, a federal, state and county law enforcement initiative called Operation LOCCUST has eradicated 420,000 marijuana plants here worth more than $1 billion on the street. By comparison, authorities eradicated 330,000 plants over the six-month growing season last month, said Lt. Mike Boudreaux of the Tulare County Sheriff's Department. Authorities have arrested 38 people and seized 29 automatic weapons, high-powered rifles and other guns, Boudreaux said. For years, Mexican drug cartels have used the remote forest to conduct and conceal their business. But the pot production has intensified because it has become harder and harder to smuggle marijuana across the U.S.-Mexico border, Walters said. ""They come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others,"" Walters said.  Watch Mexican pot farms in U.S. forest ¬ª . Sequoia National Forest is more than 350 miles from the border, named in honor of its 38 groves of giant sequoia trees dating back thousands of years. The forest covers 1.2 million acres in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Some of the workers have established residency in the United States, Boudreaux said. Most are in the country illegally, he said, many brought for the sole purpose of growing pot, maintaining production and protecting the camp. ""They're using family or very trusted family friends. They don't just use anybody,"" he said. Authorities arrested nine people in one bust recently, all of them brothers or cousins ranging in age from 20 to 27, Boudreaux said. Boudreaux described a sophisticated web in which workers and supplies are delivered to the camps by separate groups of people who don't know all the details about the marijuana operation. ""You're recruited in for that purpose as long as you're trusted. ... Each person has his function."" Once at the national forest, the growers carry with them everything they need: tents, food, guns, fertilizer, irrigation hose and marijuana seeds. Armed men keep watch over the gardens day and night during planting season, officials say. They dam mountain creeks to create pools and then siphon the water into miles of gravity-fed hoses that lead to smaller tubing to irrigate the plants. Nearly all of the marijuana plants have individual drip lines. ""The people that are growing this are good at what they do,"" said Boudreaux. The battle is being waged by a coalition of local, state and federal agencies. They rip up and remove the intricate irrigation systems, eradicate the plants and develop intelligence on the workers. ""The goal is not just to eradicate the plants but to go after the organizations,"" Walters said. What's different this year from years past, officials say, is that they're working to destroy the entire infrastructure of the marijuana grown in this region, from the irrigation systems to capturing the growers to ripping up the plants. And they're trying to get at the heart of the cartels. Walters said they have a ""unique relationship"" with Mexican law enforcement to go after organized crime -- that they will take names of those arrested here and try to work back to the crime families. ""In the past, all we've been able to do is what we call 'whack and stack,' "" said Bill Wittman, sheriff of Tulare County. Wittman says he has had ""well over 200 people in the field every day"" eradicating the plants and removing the irrigation systems as part of the operation. ""We're not just pulling the plants, we're targeting mid-level and upper-management of these trafficking organizations,"" Boudreaux said. How do they find the gardens in such remote areas? They use aerial surveillance, human intelligence and other means. ""Often times, we have people who will lead us to these gardens,"" Boudreaux said. Allen Ishida, a member of the Tulare County Board of Supervisors, said the illegal activity is alarming. ""I want to state that the guys growing the marijuana are not the guys I went to college with,"" he said. ""These are organized drug cartels out of Mexico."" Boudreaux says authorities are furious that cartels are operating in a U.S. forest. ""It's something that's troubling for many of us in law enforcement,"" he said. ""You have illegal criminal activity in the mountain regions not only destroying the natural beauty of the landscape but as well as the potential for this product to reach the children of this community."" CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report from Atlanta.","Drug czar stands in pot garden: ""These aren't Cheech and Chong plants""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Republican House member shouted, ""You lie"" during President Obama's health care speech to Congress on Wednesday, and members of both parties condemned the heckling. Rep. Joe Wilson shouted ""you lie"" after President Obama denied the health care plan would cover illegal immigrants. After the speech, South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson issued a statement apologizing for his outburst. ""This evening, I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the president's remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill,"" the statement said. ""While I disagree with the president's statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the president for this lack of civility."" Wilson also called the White House to apologize and spoke with Obama's Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who accepted the apology on the president's behalf, according to a senior administration official. ""We can disagree without being disagreeable,"" Emanuel said to Wilson, according to the official. ""That was the point of the president's speech."" The outburst came when Obama denied that proposed health care legislation would provide free health coverage for illegal immigrants. Immediately, Wilson shouted, ""You lie!""  Watch the outburst and the chamber's response ¬ª . The outburst caused Obama to stop and look toward the heckler. ""That's not true,"" the president responded. Fact check: Will reform plan cover illegal immigrants? Behind him, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared shocked and turned toward the outburst as Vice President Joe Biden looked down and shook his head. Loud boos echoed through the chamber immediately after the outburst. While it was the most attention-getting, Wilson's shout wasn't the only demonstration of displeasure made by Republicans during the speech. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, wore a sign around his neck that said, ""What bill?"" And when Obama asked Republicans to share their health reform ideas with him, a small group raised up a stack of papers above their heads. After the speech, Republican Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate defeated by Obama last year, called Wilson's outburst ""totally disrespectful"" and said he should apologize. Appearing on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" he said there was ""no place for it in that setting or any other and he should apologize immediately."" Other Republicans also criticized Wilson, along with the expected Democratic condemnation. ""It was crude and disrespectful,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, a top Senate Democrat. ""I think the person who said it will pay a price."" Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, called on Wilson to go to the floor Thursday and apologize. She said Wilson's comment and other GOP tactics ""strike me as odd. ... The minority leader has to get control of his conference."" But Jackson Lee described Wilson as ""a likeable guy, seemingly reserved"" and said it was ""rather surprising"" when saw who shouted the comment. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, echoed the sentiment. ""I was always taught that the first sign of a good education is good manners. I think that what we saw tonight was really bad manners,"" he said. ""And, having a spirited debate is one thing, exercising bad manners is another. That was beyond the pale -- and I would hope that he would publicly apologize on that same floor to the president of the United States for that insult."" Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan and ranking Republican on the Ways & Means Committee, told CNN Radio he wasn't happy with the outburst. ""I don't advise that. ... I think it's important to listen as respectfully as possible,"" he said. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, also denounced the heckling. ""Certainly, I respect the office of the president, and I think that's not the kind of thing that is appropriate in that kind of setting especially,"" he said. ""I don't know who said it, but my sense is most people don't think it was a good idea it occurred. And I happen to be one of those."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN affiliate WIS-TV in Columbia that he, too, was disappointed. ""The president's combative tone did not justify a member of Congress shouting out, 'You lie,' "" said Graham. ""Our nation's president deserves to be treated with respect. It was an inappropriate remark, and I am glad an apology has been made."" South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Carol Fowler took it further, saying Wilson disgraced his home state. ""Once again a South Carolina Republican has embarrassed our state,"" Fowler's office said in a statement that referred to S.C. Gov. Mark Sanford's extramarital affair. ""Never has any member of Congress shown such disrespect for the president during a speech,"" Fowler wrote. ""One would think that as a member of the military, Joe Wilson would have more respect and patriotism than he displayed tonight. When Congressman Wilson insulted President Obama, he also insulted the American public. Joe Wilson is a poor example of a statesman and an American. He owes an apology to the president and the American people."" The Democrat hoping to unseat Wilson in next year's midterm elections also quickly seized on the Republican's outburst. ""Rep. Wilson's behavior tonight exemplifies everything that is wrong in Washington,"" Democrat Rob Miller said in a statement provided to CNN.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Barack Obama did more than thump John McCain in the Electoral College tally; he also handily won the popular vote and redrew the great divide between red states and blue states. Barack Obama addresses a crowd of more than 200,000 at Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois. Riding a Democratic tide that bolstered the party's presence in both houses of Congress, Obama snared about 63 million votes to McCain's 55.8 million, according to totals early Wednesday. According to exit polls, Obama crushed McCain among women voters (56 percent to 43 percent); voters under 30 (66 percent to 32 percent); African-American voters (95 percent to 4 percent); Latino voters (66 percent to 32 percent); first-time voters (68 percent to 31 percent); and voters making less than $100,000 a year (55 percent to 43 percent). ""I think this is the passing of an old order,"" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said as the results rolled in Tuesday night and the outcome became increasingly evident.  Read what analysts had to say about the victory ¬ª . ""I think what we see ... is a new coalition, a new order emerging. It isn't quite there, but with Barack Obama, for the first time, it's won. It is the Latino vote we just heard about. It is the bigger black vote that came out. Very importantly, it's the youth vote, the 18-to-29-year-old,"" said the Harvard University professor and former presidential adviser.  Watch Obama pay tribute to McCain ¬ª . Early voting totals in the East suggested things would go traditionally, with McCain taking most of the Southeast, Obama most of the Northeast. But then things quickly changed, as the senator from Illinois struck -- first in Pennsylvania and then in the Midwest state of Ohio, states McCain had to win in his bid for the Oval Office. Obama then delivered an uppercut in Virginia, a state that had not voted for a Democratic president since 1964. See your state's county-by-county totals . As polls closed from East to West, Obama kept hammering McCain, as he snatched away Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada -- states that had been in President Bush's column in 2004. And Wednesday morning, Obama added Indiana to the list of states he'd turned from red to blue. Indiana hadn't voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. (Missouri and North Carolina were still counting votes Wednesday, but it appeared one or two of them could become blue-state converts as well.) With McCain on the ropes, an Obama victory in Florida sounded the death knell.  What's next for Illinois and Delaware? ¬ª . When Indiana fell into Obama's column Wednesday morning, he had a 349-163 lead over his rival in electoral votes, with only 26 undecided. As he claimed victory Tuesday night, Obama told supporters, ""change has come to America."" ""The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep.

"He is a 9-year-old boy without a country. Menachem Zivotofsky is a U.S. citizen, born in Jerusalem. There lies his dilemma. The State Department, in an unusual exception, will not allow his family to list ""Israel"" as the nation of birth on his U.S. passport. The Supreme Court will decide whether granting this ""small"" gesture on behalf of a child half a world away -- and others like him -- would disrupt the Obama administration's ongoing efforts to secure a binding, lasting peace settlement for the troubled region. Oral arguments in the case are set for Monday. At issue are two questions, one narrow, one broad: May courts intervene to enforce a federal law explicitly directing the State Department how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a passport? And does the law impermissibly infringe on the president's power to recognize a foreign sovereign? ""There have been 50,000 Americans in the last 10 years that were born in Jerusalem, and many of them would like to have Israel indicated as their place of birth in the passports,"" said Sarah Cleveland, a Columbia University Law School professor, and until recently a counselor on international law at the State Department. ""But this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the United States."" The high court case is Zivotofsky v. Clinton, but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world, and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence: Jerusalem.  Its name translates as ""City of Peace"" to some, ""Holy Sanctuary"" to others. It is Israel's largest city and its capital, though that is not recognized by the United Nations and most of the world community. Divided into East Jerusalem (populated mostly by Muslims) and West Jerusalem (populated mostly by Jews), the city spans over 48 square miles, with about 775,000 people. The terms ""East"" and ""West"" come layered with political, social, religious, and geographic questions -- amorphous, often misleading terms, symbolic of the larger struggle for control and recognition of all that this city represents. Some use the terms ""Jewish"" or ""Arab"" Jerusalem to refer to the sections. The Old City is the heart of the region, a holy symbol to the three major Abrahamic religions -- Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. That tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the Temple Mount, Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Dome of the Rock, and al-Aqsa Mosque. It is believed to have been first settled in the fourth millennium BC, and according to the Bible, it was established as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel around 1000 BC by King David. It has been destroyed twice, and attacked, besieged and captured more than a hundred times. Canaanites, Hebrews, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Persians, crusaders, Turks, and the British have all laid claim to the land. Its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive Mideast peace agreement. During the 1948 war, the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of Israel, and the eastern part annexed by Jordan. The eastern part was then captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. It considers East Jerusalem part of its ""undivided capital,"" but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of Palestinian land. The Israeli government is based there, but no foreign embassies. The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky. The couple and their two oldest sons were born in the United States, but the family migrated to Israel a decade ago, and in 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin was born. ""They're both proud American citizens but feel a very strong affinity, religiously too, to the state of Israel,"" said Alyza Lewin, the Zivotofsky's Washington-based lawyer. ""Their son is very proud of the fact that he is the one sibling born in Israel."" Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the United States Congress gave U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says ""Place of Birth."" President George W. Bush signed the bill, but issued an executive ""signing statement"" indicating he would not comply. The law, he said ""impermissibly interferes with the president's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch."" It is not the first time the Congress and White House have clashed over the region. The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections. The boy's mother made the ""Israel"" request about two months after his birth, but embassy officials refused. His passport in fact shows his round, innocent face, and Jerusalem"" is listed as his place of birth. ""That's been the State Department's practice, the general rule for American citizens born abroad is that their passport lists only a country of birth,"" said Alyza Lewin. ""So if a citizen is born for instance in Paris, it says France.  If they're born in Tel Aviv or Haifa, it says just Israel.  If you're born in Jerusalem, instead of saying the country, the city is listed-- just a city-- Jerusalem."" The attorneys for the Zivotofskys have framed their case as a modest request, one that does not implicate the president's foreign policy power. They are asking the high court not to decide a political question, but simply tell the administration to enforce the law, for the sake of a little boy. ""It is a very personal case. What's at stake is their deep personal pride and sense of identification with the state of Israel, and their right, given by Congress, to express that, on the passport,"" said Nathan Lewin, who will argue the family's case before the high court. ""That pride, and the national pride of others, is clearly what makes that region as much front page news as it often is. But I don't think that this case itself is asking for any kind of broader determination than allowing these individuals that opportunity. Congress has recognized that it's part of his self respect, that he should be able to say Israel, and that's all that we're asking for in this case."" The government is thinking of the bigger picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record on a pending case, but President Obama has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions both in that region and in the United States. ""Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state; Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met,"" he said in a May 2010 speech. ""I know that these steps alone will not resolve this conflict. Two wrenching and emotional issues remain: the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees. But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair, and that respects the rights and aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians."" The justices in accepting the Zivotofsky appeal specifically added a legal question not raised by the family's lawyers: whether the congressional law steps on the president's foreign policy power. ""It's one of those issues that people probably find remarkable that it hasn't been addressed before,"" Cleveland said. ""Because, presidents have been recognizing states and governments for 200 years. Congress generally has acquiesced in what the president has done. There has been very little conflict over the exercise of that power traditionally, other than in, for example, the Taiwan [conflict with mainland China] and, in particular, over Jerusalem. This is an issue that has been a festering source of tension between Congress and presidents for decades."" The family plans to attend the court session in Washington next week. Choosing a home, and being able to decide what to call it may seem like a fundamental right. But nothing is so easy when Jerusalem is mentioned. The Zivotofskys say they recognize the geo-political complexity, but think in this case, in this judicial forum, the solution is simple. ""Everybody knows Jerusalem is in Israel. Why is the State Department refusing to recognize this?"" said Nathan Lewin. ""They have this is fear of nonexistent hobgoblins which has caused them to follow this policy, and it's about time -- Congress thought it was about time -- they get rid of that policy ... all that we're asking the Supreme Court to do is agree with Congress, that this is a foolish policy, and ought to be eliminated.""","The case goes before the U.S. Supreme Court next week .

"Iraqi officials insisted Tuesday they were holding on to a key oil refinery while making gains elsewhere against militant fighters. The deputy prime minister for energy affairs, Hussain al-Shahristani, denied media reports that militants had taken the Baiji oil refinery, saying that security forces are still fighting militants at the site. The state-run Iraqiya news agency also claimed that security forces still controlled the refinery. Iraqi special forces killed the militant who led the attacks against the refinery, who goes by the name of Abu Qutada, Iraqiya said. Airstrikes also killed 19 militants, the news agency reported. The reports run contrary to earlier statements to CNN by Iraqi security sources who said militant fighters believed to be from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, had seized the refinery. The Baiji refinery, in northern Salaheddin province, is a crucial resource because it refines much of the fuel needed for domestic consumption. Long lines have already formed at many gas stations across the country. Crisis in Iraq: Latest developments . U.S. officials say they think ISIS now has as many as 10,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria -- including those who have broken out of prisons -- and loyalists who have joined the fight as the group has advanced, several U.S. officials have told CNN in recent days. It is unknown, officials say, exactly how many are in Iraq because it's not clear how many go back and forth across the Syrian border and how many loyalists have joined ISIS as it took over various towns. The group is functioning as an ""increasingly capable military force,"" one official said. But questions remain about whether the group may become stretched too thin as it tries to hold on to its growing territory. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, said that security forces had regained control of two key border crossings after briefly losing them to the militants. In a briefing in Baghdad aired on state TV,  Atta said Iraqi forces, aided by Sunni tribes, retook al-Walid, which connects Iraq with Syria -- as well as the Trebil border crossing between Iraq and Jordan. He also said that all towns between Samarra and Baghdad, 80 miles (129 kilometers) to the south, are in the hands of Iraqi security forces. The al-Qaim border crossing, which is some 217 miles (350 kilometers) to the north of al-Walid, remains under the control of militants. On Monday, a spokesman for Iraq's counterterrorism service told CNN that two senior ISIS figures -- an Algerian militant named Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Hafsa, the self-styled governor of Tikrit -- were killed late Monday in airstrikes in Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The spokesman, Sabah Al-Nouman, offered no evidence of the deaths. CNN cannot independently confirm any of the claims. Meanwhile, in Kirkuk, gunmen killed the head of the city council. Munir Kafili died when they opened fire on his car as he drove. Kerry arrives in Irbil . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Irbil on Tuesday to discuss with Iraqi Kurdish President Massoud Barzani and other officials how Kurds can help the central government tackle security and political challenges. As the two men sat down to meet, Barzani said, ""We are facing a new reality and a new Iraq,"" On Monday, Barzani said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that this may be the time for Kurds to push for their long-sought independence -- saying ""Iraq is obviously falling apart."" ""And it's obvious that the federal or central government has lost control over everything,"" Barzani said Monday. ""Everything is collapsing -- the army, the troops, the police."" Barzani's exclusive interview with Amanpour . Irbil is the seat of the Kurdistan regional government. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government is accused of fostering sectarian tensions by marginalizing the country's Kurd and Sunni Arab minorities. In an interview Tuesday with CNN's Jim Sciutto, Kerry praised Kurdish leaders for their ""organized and focused and disciplined leadership,"" saying it has resulted in economic vitality. ""The rest of Iraq ought to look like this,"" he said. In the interview, Kerry didn't mention Kurdish independence. But he said forming a new government that represents the interests of all of Iraq's ethnic and religious groups is a crucial precursor to whatever action the United States might take to intervene in the crisis unfolding there. ""The key is, if you don't have a viable government that is a unity government that is not going to repeat the mistakes of the last few years, whatever we might choose to do would be extraordinarily hampered,"" Kerry said. ""It would be very difficult to be successful if you were just engaged in some kind of military activity, because there's no ultimately just a military solution there."" He rejected any notion that failure to intervene militarily in Iraq, or before that in the war in Syria -- where ISIS has gained much of its strength -- has led to the current crisis. ""... You've got to have a holistic, comprehensive approach, and the President is trying, as we are, I am, whether or not Iraq is prepared to be part of that,"" he said. The United States is expected to have about 300 military advisers in Iraq. On Tuesday, 90 arrived from outside the country, said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby. They will join the 40 other U.S. troops already in Iraq, who were working at the embassy in Baghdad and have been reassigned. The advisers are expected to assess the situation on the ground and then ""advise and assist"" Iraqi military forces as they counter the threat from ISIS militants, Kirby said. Kerry's comments came amid news reports claiming the United States had launched drone strikes in Iraq. Kirby denied the reports in a statement Tuesday, saying that ""no such action has been taken."" While the U.S. weighs what steps it will take, some Iraqis told Sciutto that they would welcome back U.S. troops three years after their departure. ""America will not accept the presence of al Qaeda and (ISIS) in the region because that will impact on the Middle East region and the Arab states. It will have an effect on America, too,"" resident Ammer al-Shamri said. ""Therefore, I think there is a solution in Kerry's bag to solve the crisis.""

"Mexico City began as the home of an ancient empire and grew into a massive, modern metropolis. With more than 20 million people pulsing through its streets, it's one of the world's largest cities. That big-city bustle brings with it delicious food, massive markets and more cultural events in a day than anyone can ever keep track of. There's lavish wealth, devastating poverty and a lot to discover in Mexico's sprawling capital: . 1. Looking to set a quirky record? Mexico City might be the world's best place to do it. One big perk of having so many people in the same place: It's easy to set a record if you can persuade enough of them to do the same thing at the same time. Records for the most people kissing simultaneously (39,879), the most people dancing to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" at the same time (13,597) and the world's biggest enchilada (weighing nearly 1.5 tons) have all been set inside the Mexican capital, according to Guinness World Records. 2. Gays and lesbians are welcome. For years, Latin America's deep-rooted ties to the Roman Catholic Church meant much of the region tended to take a more conservative tack when it came to homosexuality. But that's started to shift in recent years, and Mexico City has been at the forefront. Same-sex marriage is legal there. So is adoption by same-sex couples. And the city has marketed itself as a destination for gay tourists. In 2010, the city offered a free honeymoon to Latin America's first gay couple to wed. 3. You might have heard about the smog. They're working on it. Pollution in Mexico City used to be so bad that children painting pictures of the sky reportedly would color it gray, not blue. Because of its geographic location -- in a valley between mountains -- and the sheer number of cars traveling its streets, smog is a problem the city is still battling. But with government programs that encourage bike-riding and limit the number of days motorists can take to the streets, longtime residents say the pollution problem is much better than it used to be. Another innovative solution debuted last year: a hospital tower covered with a facade designed to ""eat smog,"" breaking down pollutants when the sun hits it. Designers say the tiles on the facade of the Manuel Gea Gonzalez Hospital neutralize the effects of 1,000 cars every day. 4. The city was built on a lake. It's hard to imagine now, but much of the sprawling concrete jungle that now makes up Mexico City was once a large lake. The Aztecs constructed a massive civilization there, with Tenochtitlan serving as the capital. That city, which started out on an island and expanded to include reclaimed parts of the lake, thrived until the Spanish conquest. After winning the battle for control of the area in 1521, Spaniards destroyed Tenochtitlan and built Mexico City on top of its ruins, using canals and roads from the Aztec city as the basis for new streets and eventually draining the lake. But they didn't entirely erase the past. That's made for some fascinating ancient finds as Mexico City grew into a modern urban metropolis. In 1978, electrical company workers digging near the city's central square came upon an Aztec relic. That led to archaeologists unearthing ruins of the Templo Mayor, an Aztec temple that's now a popular tourist destination in Mexico City. 5. It's sinking. It turns out the dried-out bed of a big lake isn't the best foundation for building construction. If you want proof, take a look at some of Mexico City's most iconic structures. The sloped floor and a swinging pendulum inside the Metropolitan Cathedral show that the building is decidedly tilted. Head up Reforma Avenue to the Angel of Independence, and you'll need to walk up steps that the city built over the years as the area around the 1910 monument sank. Government officials have estimated that the city is sinking at a rate of 10 centimeters (4 inches) per year. A recent government report (PDF) estimated that Mexico City has sunk 10 meters (32.8 feet) in the past 60 years. 6. One of the world's richest men lives here. Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim topped Forbes Magazine's list of the world's richest men for four years. Microsoft founder Bill Gates reclaimed the No. 1 spot this year. But Slim and his family, with an estimated net worth of $71.4 billion, are still sitting comfortably in second place. Slim lives in Mexico City, and many of the companies he controls are based there, too. Even if you're just passing through the city, you're bound to come across his holdings. Talking on a Mexican cell phone? It's pretty likely that it's tied to Slim's company, Telcel, which controls 70% of Mexico's wireless market. Swinging by a department store? If you spend any time in Mexico City, you'll probably find a reason to stop at Sanborns, Slim's ubiquitous chain that contains restaurants, pharmacies and retail goods. Admiring beautiful buildings in the city's historic center? Slim helped finance a major facelift there in recent years. 7. It's safer than some parts of the country. Many Mexicans used to fear traveling to their nation's capital, concerned about crime. Street assaults and kidnapping are still major worries for residents and visitors. And in high-end neighborhoods, you might find a store selling bulletproof glass near a designer clothing boutique. But the city's homicide rate is on par with other major metropolises around the world. And with drug violence plaguing other parts of the country, Mexico City has actually earned a reputation as one of the safer places to go. 8. It's not just tacos and tequila. Don't expect to find much cheesy Tex-Mex fare here. The Mexico City culinary scene is muy caliente, with fancy restaurants in posh hotels and top chefs saying they come here for inspiration. Pujol, a restaurant in the city's posh Polanco neighborhood, ranks among the world's top eateries. But it's not all about fine dining. Market stalls and street stands serve up some of the city's most delicious food. If you're looking for tequila, it's not hard to get it. But if you want to drink like a local, try mezcal or pulque. All three drinks are made from agave plants. Tequila comes from blue agave. Mezcal can be made from different types of agave plants and has become a popular drink for hipsters in Mexico's capital. So has pulque, a 2,000-year-old Aztec drink made from fermented but undistilled agave juice. 9. The subway is fast, cheap and fascinating. While many businessmen and foreigners who live in the city rely on taxis and car services, Mexico City's metro is still the most popular way to get around for the masses. Protests after authorities announced plans to raise fees last year weren't successful. But taking the subway is still pretty cheap: just 5 pesos (about 40 cents) for a ticket. And it's not just a way to get from point A to point B. For some people, stations on the city's 12 subway lines are a destination. There are shops, libraries, art exhibits and even computer labs inside. A pedestrian tunnel between two subway stations in the heart of the city boasts more than 40 bookstores. 10. It's not all loud noise and concrete. If you need a break from the bustle, it takes only a short subway ride in Mexico City to reach places where you'll feel like you stepped back in time. Neighborhoods like San Angel and Coyoacan (where artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo made their home) have cobblestone streets, beautiful buildings and quaint cafes that will give you a chance to catch your breath.","Mexico City's metro area is one of the world's largest, with more than 20 million people .
The huge population makes for interesting record-setting .
There's still smog and crime, but it's not as bad as you think ."
"Michelle Crumrine was out of town when a tornado tore through her neighborhood. She returned to Washington, Illinois, to find pieces of her life strewn about where her house once stood. ""A lot of people have a pile of rubble still,"" she said, ""and I don't have anything. ... It's gone. I don't know where it went."" Nearby, rescuers with flashlights trudged through the neighborhood in the dark of night, searching for signs of life in the wreckage. As a severe weather system slammed the Midwest on Sunday, spawning dozens of tornadoes, flash floods and hail, this town of 10,000 people was among the hardest hit. A neighborhood was flattened, at least one person died and dozens in the area were injured. Across the state, officials said six people were killed in storms. In two communities, storms destroyed at least 70 homes, according to Jonathon Monken, director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Rescuers were trying to reach people trapped in their basements, he said. One hospital in Peoria was treating 37 patients with injuries. The outbreak also forced fans to evacuate the stands for nearly two hours during an NFL game in Chicago. ""It was complete destruction,"" said Anthony Khoury, who lives in Washington. ""There are people in the streets crying."" As a tornado neared his home, Khoury prayed and recorded a video of the dark twister churning toward him. ""The tornado happened in my backyard, and you can hear people screaming,"" he told CNN's iReport. ""We were freaking out."" While his house survived the storm, Khoury said others in the neighborhood weren't as lucky. Video from CNN affiliate WMBD showed one Washington neighborhood where a tornado smashed cars and houses, littering the ground with broken wood beams and flinging furniture and debris onto lawns, sidewalks and streets. ""I grabbed my daughter and ran,"" one storm survivor told WMBD. In nearby Peoria, Mayor Jim Ardis said his city was planning to send aid to help storm recovery in Washington, where a tornado hit what he described as a ""very densely populated area."" ""It's just absolutely unbelievable,"" he said. Jack Lance, who lives in Pekin, said he saw a lot of wreckage in his town. ""We saw trees down, houses with their roofs completely torn off. I saw a lot of people in distress with their homes destroyed,"" he said. ""It wasn't a pretty sight."" Officials delayed the NFL game between the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens for nearly two hours as storms approached Chicago, warning spectators to leave the stands at Soldier Field and head for covered areas. ""The rain started coming, the skies got black, the wind was insane, and they evacuated us to underneath the concrete concourse,"" said Jim Arnold, who was at the game with his 11-year-old daughter. ""We've been through 15-degree-below weather and winds, but never anything like this,"" Arnold said. ""The winds gusted at 70 mph, and the winds and the rain were horizontal and everybody was running. It was just crazy."" Fans returned to their seats and the game resumed mid-afternoon after the storm passed. But for other cities in the region, severe weather was on the way. Throughout the region, at least 67 tornadoes had been reported as of 10:15 p.m. Sunday, the National Weather Service said. ""These storms having been moving so fast today, it's been hard to keep up,"" said storm chaser Tony Laubach, who spoke to CNN as he watched a tornado touch down outside Lebanon, Indiana. In Illinois, two deaths were reported in Nashville; one in Washington; one near Brookport; and one near Unionville, according to officials. Monken said there were at least 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns, and officials there expect the number of storm-related injuries to grow. In Oak Lawn, a wind gust of 86 mph was recorded as a severe thunderstorm rolled through the area. In Washington County, Illinois, an EF4 tornado packing a peak wind of 166 mph hit, leaving a path of destruction that stretched more than three miles, according to a preliminary survey by the National Weather Service. At least six trucks overturned on highways about 80 miles west of Chicago due to high winds, the Ogle County Sheriff's Office said. In a Twitter post, Indiana State Police shared a photo of twisted metal, piles of debris and the shell of a school building. More than 160,000 people are without power across the state, said John Erickson, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security. Storms damaged a mall and a bank and collapsed the roof of a fire station in Kokomo, Indiana, said Larry Smith, emergency management director in Howard County. Some houses had their roofs torn off when a tornado hit the area, he said. Officials in Kokomo declared a state of emergency and closed schools for Monday, according to the city's Twitter account. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is scheduled to tour the storm damage there on Monday, his office said. Teams from the National Weather Service are set to survey damage throughout the region. Incredible footage of a tornado in Washington, Illinois . In Missouri, state emergency officials said a tornado may have hit Scott County, where heavy winds overturned three rail cars, blew over four mobile homes and damaged five fixed homes on foundations. In Michigan, high winds knocked out power to at least 390,000 customers, utility companies said. And in Ohio, more than 75,000 residents were without power after the storm hit, emergency officials said. This is a particularly dangerous situation, the National Weather Service said in a bulletin released Sunday morning. CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the weather outbreak came later in the year than some might expect. ""The primary time for tornadoes, as we well know, is springtime. Then we see a second high that comes in the fall,"" she said. ""Is this late? It is rather late, because the temperatures have been very warm."" A ""very vigorous"" low-pressure system is moving across the Great Lakes, she said. ""On the backside of that, temperatures are dramatically cooler. So that cold air is filtering in behind it, warm air out ahead of it,"" she said. ""And...we get some twisting motion in the atmosphere. And that's why we see this tornadic activity.""","A third person died in Massac County, Illinois, bringing the state total death toll to 6 .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- At least seven pro-Houthi protesters were killed and dozens were wounded Tuesday when demonstrators allegedly tried to raid the Ministerial Cabinet building in the capital, a senior Houthi official said. A government representative gave conflicting figures, saying four pro-Houthi protesters were killed in the attempted raid in Sanaa. The Houthi official said the more than 45 people who were injured were taken to Al-Moayyad house. Hospital officials told CNN that three of the injured are in critical condition. ""The gunshot wounds are mostly to the head, back and chest, resulting in serious injuries,"" a hospital official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the media. The Interior Ministry said protesters -- including some armed Houthis -- attempted to raid the Ministerial Cabinet and attacked the soldiers guarding the gates. ""Troops did their legal duties of protecting government buildings after being threatened,"" the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said the protesters were killed and injured by the armed demonstrators within the crowd, and said several government troops were attacked and injured in the violence. It called on Houthis to seek peaceful solutions for change instead of using force. Houthis, also known as ""Ansarullah,"" have been rallying for almost a month, demanding that a recently approved oil subsidy reform be revoked and that the government step down. Until then, they say, they will not remove their tents from Sanaa and surrounding areas. In a televised speech Monday, top Ansarullah leader AbdulMalik al-Houthi called on supporters to continue protesting and launched a new stage of escalation. ""It seemed that the government downplayed our threats and killed peaceful protesters,"" al-Houthi said, referring to the deaths of some demonstrators Sunday. ""Their blood will not go in vain."" Houthi spokesman Mohammed AbdulSalam threatened the Yemeni government, saying the group was being forced to consider non-peaceful actions in retaliation for the attacks against protesters. ""The government is trying to say that peaceful activities are not accepted. The killing of protesters will not make us take steps backwards, but rather raise our ceiling of demands,"" he said. Earlier in the month, Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi dismissed the government and agreed to a 15% cut in fuel prices, in addition to other economic reforms, seeking to end weeks of tense protests led by tens of thousands of Houthi loyalists. Houthis, who follow the Zaidi sect of Islam, rejected the initiative.","Several Houthis were killed, dozens wounded in violence Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- ""It's easily the most contentious piece of real estate in the world, and there's no hope -- none -- of ever talking about it without pissing somebody, if not everybody, off."" So says Anthony Bourdain about the magnificent, contentious lands of Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. The host and crew of CNN's ""Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"" traveled to this divided land for the Season 2 premiere on September 15 (9pm ET/PT). No doubt the political situation is often tense between all the peoples living in these areas, as Bourdain can simply see by crossing between Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled lands. Even when Bourdain concentrates on the rich history, food and culture of the region, spending time with Muslim and Jewish chefs, home cooks and cookbook authors, the answers are debated over and over. Where does falafel come from? Who makes the best hummus? And a non-food question: Is it a fence or a wall? ""The question of food appropriation or who owns the food is massive here,"" says Jerusalem-born chef Yotam Ottolenghi, now a London restaurateur and co-author of the cookbook, ""Jerusalem."" Ottolenghi escorts Bourdain through distinct neighborhoods of Jerusalem, taking him to a typical falafel stand. ""It can go on forever here."" ""Gaza Kitchen"" cookbook author Laila El-Haddad takes him on a hunt for a watermelon salad made just 30 minutes outside Gaza City, also showing him the three distinct cuisines of Gaza City, its villages and the seafood of the coast. Just outside of Jerusalem in the Judean Hills, he sits at Majda, a restaurant run by a husband and wife team who are a mixed-faith couple. Michal, the chef, is Jewish and Israeli; Yaakov, who grows much of the food, is Palestinian and Muslim. They cook him a meal from their shared food traditions. And it's vegetarian. The same land, often the same ingredients, cooking for family and friends, welcoming Bourdain to the table. Is it fanciful to think that these struggling peoples, ""locked in such an intimate of deadly embrace, might somehow, someday figure out how to live with each other?"" he asks.

"The sights of Paris are among the most familiar on the planet, but now tourists have a ""new"" way to see them -- by helium-filled airship. Airship Paris's zeppelin -- 75 meters long, five stories high and as wide as a four-lane motorway -- made its inaugural commercial flight over a region of villages and woodland northwest of Paris on Sunday. On clear days, the company says, the Eiffel Tower would be visible in the distance. The Chateau de Versailles and Seine River are other sights to be seen on the airship's itineraries. The German-made craft, the first commercial dirigible to fly over the Paris region in 30 years, according to Airship Paris, may have similar dimensions to an A380 superjumbo jet, but it's a little slower at maximum speed: 90 kilometers an hour, at a 900-meter altitude. Tickets on the dirigible will be somewhat more expensive than other Paris tours, such as a seat on an open-top tour bus: prices start at just more than ‚Ç¨200 ($265) for a half-hour flight. Non-flammable fuel . The shadow of the Hindenburg disaster still hangs over airships, even though the hydrogen-fueled craft -- caught forever on spectacular newsreel footage -- exploded over a New Jersey airfield more than 75 years ago, in 1937. Airship Paris is quick to emphasize the safety of its new zeppelin. ""This is probably the most safe aircraft [flying] because the gas inside is helium [which is] completely non-flammable,"" airship pilot Catherine Board, who is half-British and half-Belgian, told the Telegraph. ""If the engines fail, unlike an aircraft, which has to come down, [the airship] can float ... until we find a safe place to land."" Airship Paris hoped its zeppelin would become a familiar sight in the skies above France, not only for carrying downward-peering tourists, but for transporting cargo or for scientific missions. However, one barrier to realizing those plans is simply the lack of existing infrastructure on the ground to cope with such a large aircraft.","Airship takes to skies around Paris for first time in 30 years .

"Comedian Joan Rivers died of ""therapeutic complications"" during a procedure to evaluate her ""voice changes"" and stomach reflux, the New York medical examiner said Thursday. ""The classification of a death as a therapeutic complication means that the death resulted from a predictable complication of medical therapy,"" the report said. Rivers, 81, died September 4, a week after an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. The medical examiner's investigation ruled that the cause of death was ""anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest,"" a medical description of brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen. The arrest happened ""during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation for evaluation of voice changes and gastroesophageal reflux disease,"" the medical examiner's officer said. The complication in this case was laryngospasm -- a spasm of the vocal cords that makes it difficult to breathe, pathologist and surgeon Bill Lloyd told CNN. The situation was compounded when Rivers went into cardiac arrest. ""She stopped breathing and her heart went into arrhythmia because there wasn't sufficient oxygen to maintain the heart muscle,"" said Lloyd, who was not involved in Rivers' autopsy. ""The pump, the heart itself, was unable to move fresh oxygenated blood upstream to the brain."" At first, Lloyd said, Rivers was unable to bring oxygen into her body due to the vocal cord spasm. After a couple of minutes, her heart started to beat irregularly or completely stopped. Finally, her heart stopped delivering fresh oxygenated blood to her brain, which shut down, according to Lloyd. ""The unanswered question is why they did not do a combat (tracheotomy)?"" he asked. ""You've seen in the James Bond movies. You take a ballpoint pen and puncture the thyroid cartilage and create an emergency airway for her. Of course, they would do it with sterile instruments. ... And, after minute two, did anybody say, We need to start doing some CPR for her?"" The initial report did not name the doctor or doctors who performed the procedures. Melissa Rivers posted this on Twitter on Friday afternoon: ""In response to NYC's Medical examiner's report, we continue to be saddened by our tragic loss. No further comment at this time."" Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death . What happened? Several clinic workers told investigators that the August 28 appointment began with Rivers' personal throat doctor, Dr. Gwen Korovin, performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds, a source close to the investigation told CNN last month. Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning after Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness, the source said. Cohen detected something of concern, the source said. Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cutoff of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source. Korovin was authorized only to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said. Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated. But Korovin denied ""performing an unauthorized procedure"" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN last month. Paramedics rushed Rivers from the clinic to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later. E!'s 'Fashion Police' to continue without Joan Rivers . Doctor to the stars . Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autographed photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews. ""I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music,"" Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year. Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN last month in response to reports that questioned whether her actions played any role in Rivers' death. ""Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist.  She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. ""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment.

"(CNN) -- MH370. MH17. Air Algerie 5017. And now AirAsia QZ8501. The disappearance of AirAsia Flight 8501 between Indonesia and Singapore over the weekend -- and discovery of debris from the plane two days later -- caps a bizarre year in aviation. But could 2014 be the worst year in recent aviation history? Yes and no. Depends on how you define ""worst."" Crashes . In terms of crashes, 2014 has seen the lowest number in more than 80 years, says the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, or BAAA. With the AirAsia disappearance now counted as a crash, this year's number totals 111. The last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927. ""If you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes, flying today is safer,"" says Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group. ""However, there are more aircraft in the sky, so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and, in some categories of disaster, higher."" Fatalities . In terms of fatalities, the numbers paint a grimmer picture. Before AirAsia QZ8501, aviation disasters this year claimed 1,158 lives. The AirAsia flight was carrying 162 people; authorities have not issued a statement on whether everybody died. If all the people on board died, this year would have the most aviation deaths -- 1,320 -- since 2005, according to BAAA. Already, 2014 has put an end to a steadily improving global aviation safety record. ""Every 10 years or so, we have a year that is less safe than others. Unfortunately this year was one of those,"" said Ronan Hubert with the BAAA. Last year, 265 people were killed in flight incidents, marking the safest year in aviation since 1945, the Aviation Safety Network said. The Aviation Safety Network and the BAAA track their numbers differently. The Aviation Safety Network says its figures on fatal aircraft accidents include only civil aircraft of which the basic model has been certified for carrying 14 or more passengers. The BAAA includes accidents of aircraft capable of carrying at least six passengers, besides the crew. Another key difference: The Aviation Safety Network doesn't include fatalities from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 because it does not count shoot-downs or acts of sabotage in its safety indicator numbers. The BAAA statistics count ""any event where aircraft suffered such damage that it is not in a position to be used anymore."" Bad year for Asia . Asia has endured a particularly brutal year. Before 2014, Malaysia Airlines had an excellent safety record. Then in March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 aboard. Officials believe that plane is somewhere in the Indian Ocean. But, nine months later, MH370 hasn't been found. In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard. While AirAsia is based in Malaysia, the flight that crashed Sunday was operated by AirAsia Indonesia, an affiliate with hubs in Jakarta and Surabaya. The wreckage was not found until Tuesday, creating a fear that two airliners had disappeared in the same year in the same part of the world. Search teams located AirAsia debris on Tuesday in the Java Sea. AirAsia had a near flawless safety record, with no previous fatal accidents. But now that record has changed. ""This is my worst nightmare,"" AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted as crews searched for AirAsia QZ8501. (Two other disasters claimed dozens of lives, both in July. In Taiwan, 48 died on TransAsia Airways Flight 222. The cause of that crash is unclear. The crash of Air Algerie Flight 5017 killed 116 people while en route from Burkina Faso to Algeria. The plane went down in Mali. The cause of that crash is also uncertain, but the plane changed flight paths because of bad weather.) Still safe . When air disasters happen, they make news. But on the whole, far fewer people die in plane crashes than in cars. About 1.24 million people die each year on the world's roads, the World Health Organization said last year. By contrast, the deadliest year in aviation had 3,346 deaths, the BAAA said. That was in 1972. Since then, technology has improved and airlines, insurance companies and regulators have worked to increase aviation safety levels to get closer to zero risk, said Hubert. ""Accidents are not always avoidable,"" he said, but ""with each accident, we learn something new and improve."" According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the number of commercial flight departures has grown in recent years to 30 million in 2011. Despite the fatalities from this year, Goelz said, ""that's a relatively low rate when you compare it to the massive numbers of people who are flying today."" CNN's Rene Marsh contributed to this report.","2014 has had the lowest number of plane crashes in over 80 years, the BAAA says .

"(CNN)Eating a Mediterranean diet may be your key to living longer. That's according to a new study led by Immaculata De Vivo, associate professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School. The diet involves eating items off a menu that is rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and peas, unrefined grains, olive oil and fish. It keeps dairy, meat and saturated fats to a minimum. And you can have a glass of red wine with dinner without cheating. Can meditation really slow aging? The diet has been consistently linked with health benefits that includes helping you manage your weight, and it can lower your risk for chronic issues such as cardiovascular disease. This new research looks at data from 4,676 healthy middle-aged women involved in the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing study tracking the health of more than 120,000 U.S. nurses since 1976. It found women who ate a Mediterranean diet had longer telomeres. A Mediterranean diet prevents strokes . Telomeres are part of your chromosomes, the thread-like structures that house your DNA.  At the end of these chromosomes are telomeres, a kind of protective ""cap"" that keeps the structure from unraveling. It thereby protects your genetic information. Even in healthy people, telomeres shorten with age. Shorter telomeres are associated with aging, lower life expectancy and age-related diseases such as artherosclerosis, certain cancers and liver disease. Scientists have noticed some lifestyle choices such as smoking, being overweight or obese and drinking a lot of sugar sweetened drinks can prematurely shorten a person's telomeres. Scientists believe oxidative stress and inflammation can also shorten them. How to get super fit at any age . Fruits, vegetables, olive oils and nuts -- the key components of a Mediterranean diet -- have well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The team of U.S. researchers led by De Vivo therefore wanted to see whether the women who stuck with this diet had longer telomeres. ""This is the largest population-based study addressing the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and telomere length in healthy, middle aged women,"" they write. The study included completed detailed food questionnaires and blood tests to measure telomere length. Each participant had a calculated diet score ranging from 0 to 9 points; a higher score signifies a closer resemblance to the Mediterranean diet. Each one point change in diet score corresponded an average of 1.5 years of telomere aging. Telomere shortening is irreversible but healthy ""lifestyle choices can help prevent accelerated shortening,"" says De Vivo. Healthy aging, four keys . This study's results provide ""some insight into the underlying physiologic mechanism behind this association,"" indicating that greater adherence to this diet is significantly associated with longer telomeres, she says. Because of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the Mediterranean diet, following this diet ""could balance out the 'bad effects' of smoking and obesity,"" De Vivo says. These findings further support ""the health benefits of greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet for reduction of overall mortality, increased longevity and reduced incidence of chronic diseases, especially major cardiovascular diseases."" None of the individual dietary components was associated with telomere length. Researchers suggest that means the whole diet is an important element, rather than one item being a kind of superfood. That sweet drink may age you . Dr. Peter Nilsson, a professor of Clinical Cardiovascular Research at Lund University in Sweden, who wrote an accompanying editorial, suggests that the variation in telomere length and dietary patterns may also be because of genetic background factors. While promising, Nilsson believes that future studies ""should take into account the possibility of interactions between genes, diet and sex."" With these results, De Vivo and her research team hope in the future to figure out which components of the Mediterranean diet may be having a bigger impact on telomere length. Next they also hope to study the same thing in men.","Study: Women on a Mediterranean diet had a key biological marker for slower aging .

Next scientists want to see if one particular food had a bigger impact ."
"As New York City thieves steal smartphones and tablets in ever greater numbers, the NYPD has assigned a group of officers to hunt down the devices. The NYPD launched the team about a year ago ""when we saw a spike in (thefts of) Apple products specifically,"" Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. An Apple-picking problem on New York City's streets and subways has worsened in recent years. The overall crime rate in the city increased 3% last year -- but ""if you subtracted just the increase in Apple product thefts, we would have had an overall decrease in crime in New York,"" Browne said. Generally, the NYPD team's first step in tracing pilfered gadgets is obtaining the stolen device's serial number. Then ""we supply it to Apple, and we say, when that product is activated, we want to know who it is,"" according to Browne. The tech giant has largely cooperated with the NYPD's subpoenas. ""I would say we're working with them. They're not fighting this,"" Browne said. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The NYPD's detectives have found that stolen smartphones and tablets don't tend to travel far. About 75% of them stay in the city of New York, Browne said. And those that cross city limits are still likely to be in the state. Browne did not quantify how successful the department has been at tracing stolen smartphones and tablets, but he did cite a few cases that had happy endings. In one, an employee stole three iPads from his workplace, then gave them to two relatives in New York and one in the Dominican Republic. The NYPD was able to return all three to their rightful owners. Sometimes the trail leads back to the person who swiped the iPhone; other times it leads to an unwitting owner of stolen property. While the officers on the NYPD's smartphone squad don't focus exclusively on Apple products, they do spend most of their time chasing stolen iPhones or iPads, ""simply because the number of Apple thefts is a reflection of their general popularity,"" Browne said. Law-enforcement agencies like the NYPD aren't alone in targeting smartphone and tablet theft. The industry is taking steps to address it, too. In a letter to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the wireless industry's trade association last year released details of a voluntary effort to ""help law enforcement deter smartphone theft."" A major plank of that effort is the creation of a database for smartphones that are reported stolen. Phones on the database, which is scheduled to be up and running at the end of November, would be barred being activated or provided service on an LTE network in the United States.","Theft of Apple smartphones and tablets inspires special NYPD unit .

"Remember the dark and brooding Angelina Jolie, the one who wore one husband's blood around her neck and shared an uncomfortably intense kiss with her brother? That wasn't about rebellion, Jolie tells Elle magazine in its June issue. That was a 20-something trying to find herself. ""It wasn't a need to be destructive or rebellious -- it's that need to find a full voice, to push open the walls around you,"" the 38-year-old actress says. ""You want to be free. And as you start to feel that you are being corralled into a certain life, you kind of push against it. It may come out very strange, it may be interpreted wrong, but you're trying to find out who you are."" Interestingly, who she thought she'd become and who she ended up being are two different things. Now a mom of six and engaged to Brad Pitt, Jolie says she once believed she wouldn't have kids or find love. ""I never thought I'd have children, I never thought I'd be in love, I never thought I'd meet the right person,"" Jolie says. ""Having come from a broken home -- you kind of accept that certain things feel like a fairy tale, and you just don't look for them."" Jolie and Pitt's relationship dates back to 2005, the same year their action thriller/romance movie ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" arrived in theaters. At the time, Pitt petitioned to formally adopt Jolie's two kids, Maddox and Zahara, and since then the couple have welcomed four more children: Shiloh, Pax and twins Vivienne and Knox. ""You get together and you're two individuals and you feel inspired by each other,"" Jolie says of her relationship with Pitt. ""(Y)ou challenge each other, you complement each other, drive each other beautifully crazy. After all these years, we have history -- and when you have history with somebody, you're friends in such a very real, deep way that there's such a comfort, and an ease, and a deep love that comes from having been through quite a lot together."" Lately Pitt and Jolie -- who announced their engagement in April 2012 -- are dealing with how to introduce their kids to show business. Vivienne co-stars with Jolie in the May 30 release ""Maleficent,"" with Zahara and Pax also making a brief appearance. The movie is a live-action re-telling of the ""Sleeping Beauty"" story from the wicked sorceress Maleficent's point of view, and Jolie explained that Vivienne was cast as the young Aurora because she was the only child who could withstand Jolie's evil character. ""My little Vivienne -- we call her my shadow, because there's nothing I can do to shake her,"" Jolie tells Elle. ""I can be tired, I can be grumpy, I can be in a terrible mood, and she doesn't care. It's 'Mommy, Mommy,' and she'll cling to me. We knew that she would still do that thing, she'd still smile at me and insist that I pick her up. So we couldn't really cast anybody else."" (And apparently Jolie did try; when she asked her daughter Shiloh ""about being Aurora, and she laughed in my face,"" Jolie recalls. ""She said she'd be a horned creature."") While Jolie and Pitt don't discourage their kids from being involved in their careers, neither of them is eager to see the brood follow in their footsteps. ""Brad and I made the decision that we wouldn't keep them from sets and the fun of making movies, but we wouldn't [glorify it either] -- we wouldn't make it a good thing or a bad thing,"" Jolie says.

"Washington (CNN)Marion Barry was dead, but Ward 8 came to party. Official Washington was across town last Friday, debating federal immigration laws and hashing out details of an enormous spending package that would keep the government funded through next year. But a few miles away from the Capitol, southeast Washington had a different agenda. Adults and school children alike were streaming into the chilly and rain-slicked streets of Washington's Anacostia neighborhood, the beating heart of Barry's African-American political base for almost 50 years, to pay their final respects to the man fondly dubbed ""Mayor For Life."" A funeral procession that began solemnly in the morning at the city council building in downtown D.C. blossomed into a block-party-in-motion as the hearse carrying Barry's body made a slow roll through his neighborhood, past his white clapboard home and en route to a memorial service at his local church. Barry's family members and friends honked their car horns incessantly at the crowd and the cameras. Onlookers waved and cried. Then they boogied in the streets as the marching band from Ballou High School announced themselves with a crisp drumbeat. Neighborhood entrepreneurs hawked hats and t-shirts emblazoned with Barry's portrait and the ""Mayor For Life"" slogan for $10 a pop. And then there were the stories. Everyone in Ward 8 had a tale about Barry ‚Äî how he helped a neighbor land his first job, how he secured clothing and food for a family in need. And, of course, how he liked to have good time -- even when he couldn't actually have a good time. ""The last time I saw Marion Barry was at my birthday party,"" recalled one mourner, Mary Cuthbert. ""That was Nov. 14. He could not dance, so all the woman stood up and danced in front of him. We had a ball."" Margaret Tinker Lee, clutching a framed vintage photograph of herself and a heavier-set Barry, remembered the time she and some friends traveled to Las Vegas for the 1987 middleweight title bout between Sugar Ray Leonard and ""Marvelous"" Marvin Hagler. ""A bunch of us Washingtonians went,"" she said. ""Late in the morning, I am walking across the strip. I see Marion Barry. And I'm like, 'Hey Marion Barry! Hey, D.C. Mayor! Marion Barry!' He says, 'Hey! Don't nobody up here know I'm mayor! You're blowing my cover!"" To many in white Washington, Barry was a scoundrel, a womanizer and a crook who enriched his friends and cronies with contracts and jobs, corrupted the police department, and allowed the drug-ridden city to earn an ugly reputation in the 80s and early 90s as ""the murder capital."" His critics could barely contain their glee when Barry was busted smoking crack cocaine in 1990 with his then-girlfriend in an FBI-led sting operation at the Vista Hotel. ""B-tch set me up!,"" Barry exclaimed over and over again during his infamous on-camera arrest. The girlfriend, Rasheeda Moore, was an FBI informant. The scandal brought an end to a remarkable political run that began in the 1960s. Barry, a young civil rights leader, arrived in Washington from Tennessee, where he worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped organize Nashville's lunch counter sit-in movement ‚Äî all while earning a master's degree in organic chemistry on the side. Once in the District, Barry dove into grassroots politics, launching a popular jobs program for African-American teenagers that many black Washingtonians remember fondly even today. A gifted speaker with an infectious personality, Barry left his civil rights activism behind and became a political creature in full. He ""worked to make friends of his enemies, a trait that would become a trademark,"" Harry Jaffe and Tom Sherwood wrote in their book ""Dream City,"" the definitive chronicle of Barry's political career and the mark it left on Washington. After D.C. established ""home rule"" and the right to elect its own leaders in 1973, Barry rode his popularity in the black community to a spot on the City Council. And four years later in 1978, with early (and now forgotten) support from white voters, he was elected mayor. Flamboyant, resilient and always nurturing his African-American base, Barry was re-elected two more times before the crack bust heard around the world. Much to the frustration of white Washington, Barry launched a stunning comeback after serving time in a federal prison, and won a fourth term as Mayor in 1994. He declined to run one more time, instead securing a place on the City Council until his death last month. Barry's loss last month was felt deeply by black Washingtonians, who celebrated his life with three days of events culminating in a massive memorial service downtown last weekend. For all his flaws, Barry was a civil rights leader from the era of Martin Luther King who gave voice to a populace that lived, often forgotten and impoverished, in the shadow of the monuments and federal buildings that so many tourists flock to every year. ""What a lot of people don't realize was how many thousands of people in this city loved Marion Barry,"" said outgoing Washington mayor Vincent Gray. ""He was always trying to work on behalf of the people, especially those who were in difficult circumstances or were disadvantaged. He was a fighter and people will always remember it."" Barry's death can be mourned another way. The Washington of 2014 looks far different than it did during Barry's political heyday. It's whiter and wealthier ‚Äî and yes, safer ‚Äî than it was during Barry's time in office, when the ""Chocolate City"" was about 70% African-American. Today, that number is around 50% and falling. For all the bike-lines and locally-sourced restaurants and Stumptown coffee proliferating in ""cool"" Washington today, the city had something of a Wild West quality in the Seventies and Eighties that now feels mournfully distant. Barry came to power when some long forgotten but legitimately crazy stuff was happening in Washington. There was the 1976 car bombing of a Chilean dissident on Massachusetts Avenue ‚Äî his was killed by Pinochet's secret police near Dupont Circle. The next year, a dozen Hanafi Muslim terrorists stormed three Washington buildings in 1977, including the D.C. city council office, taking 149 hostages, killing a radio reporter and shooting Barry in the chest. An ex-con radio disc jokey named Petey Greene ruled the radio airwaves. Georgetown went to the Final 4. And yes, the Redskins were good. That era grows more unimaginable by the day ‚Äî and Barry was the final thread binding us to it.","Marion Barry's neighborhood paid final respects to the former D.C. mayor .

"Lake Retba, Senegal (CNN) -- On the edge of Senegal's Cap Vert peninsula, a lush coastal region, lies Lake Retba ... a coral pink lake. Nestled between white sand dunes and the Atlantic Ocean, this unique body of water was once the finishing point of the off-road car race, the Dakar Rally. The three square kilometer fuchsia lake has been a candidate for UNESCO World Heritage status since 2005 and is fast becoming one of Senegal's most popular tourist destinations. While the rally may have shifted to South America five years ago, men and women from West Africa continue to come here for an entirely different reason -- to harvest salt. The salt content of Lake Retba or Lac Rose, as it's locally known, rivals that of the Dead Sea -- exceeding 40% salinity in some parts -- and it is a combination of the sun and a salt-loving micro-algae, dunaliella salina, which has turned the water a brilliant shade of strawberry pink. Men once used to fish in the lake but by the 1970s, in response to ongoing droughts and economic hardship, locals began to collect and sell salt to supplement their families' income. 24-year-old Moussa Fame came from Mali to work in the lake seven years ago. He works alone, chest-high in the lake, for seven hours a day with the most basic of tools -- a basket, spade and stick. To protect his skin from the harsh salinity, Fame rubs shea butter on his body before entering the water. ""As a harvester, if you don't put shea butter on your skin, the salt will damage it and cut you,"" he said. ""The longer you stay inside the lake, the larger the salty water makes your wounds. If you do not cover those wounds with shea butter, they will become worse."" With a depth of only three meters, Fame paddles to his chosen area using a long stick to push against the bottom of the lake. The boat he rents is called a pirogue and is made of wood -- any engine or metal fixture would immediately start to rust. ""I know where to collect the salt from. When the stick I am using touches the salt, I can feel it,"" Fame said. ""If I find a place, I attach my boat and use the shovel to see if there is enough salt in that place. After that, I put the sticks in place and start piling the salt around those sticks."" It is estimated 1,000 people work around this lake -- 600 men and 400 women who collect 24,000 tons of salt each year. ""The people working here as harvesters are Malians, some are Guineans, some Ivorians, Burkinabe and even some from Guinea-Bissau. There are also some Senegalese,"" Moussa said. It is mainly men who work as harvesters, filling their baskets with salt before heaving it over their heads into their boats. ""Sometimes I harvest 10 to 12 buckets,"" Fame said. By the time Fame paddles back, his 21-year-old wife, Mariame, is onshore, awaiting his return to carry the salt from boat to land. Fame makes 60 cents for each bucket of salt he collects. His wife earns five cents for every bucket she transports. In the midday heat, men and women move between piles of salt -- transporting, drying and trading the mineral. Over 70% of it is exported around West Africa, particularly to the Ivory Coast. ""Here, we have two different types of salt,"" said Demba Dieng, a wholesaler who buys and re-sells salt. ""The first is called 'medium salt.' This type of salt is bought by people drying fish or working in the leather industry. ""The 'big salt' is the second type which we use in Senegal in our food,"" he said. ""However, in Europe, they use the 'big salt' to melt ice on the roads."" While most of Fame's salt will be sold on, he has kept some for his family back in Mali in the hopes that one day, he can share it with his father, who also used to be a salt harvester on Lake Retba. ""It will be a gift to my mother that she will cook with,"" he said. More: Souks, sea and surf .","Bright pink lake in Senegal is as salty as the Dead Sea .

"Standing on top of the No. 55 Aarons Dream Machine in victory lane, his fists pumping and the confetti flying, Brian Vickers wasn't just celebrating a victory. He wasn't just celebrating breaking a long losing streak. Vickers was celebrating something much sweeter. Three years earlier he wasn't sure he'd ever race again. In fact, he wasn't sure if he'd ever be healthy again. If he'd known what to look for, perhaps Vickers would have noticed the warning signs. The normally energetic and very fit 26-year-old was tired. Really tired. He struggled to keep up with a friend on a bike ride. A couple of his fingers turned white from lack of circulation. And then on a trip to Washington, where he was actually supposed to visit the troops at Walter Reed Hospital, he woke up several times in the middle of the night with shortness of breath. Yes, perhaps if he'd known what those symptoms were signs of he might have acted sooner. But he didn't. Vickers had no idea what was causing all that. It was only after several nudges from his doctors back home and actually reaching the point where he was struggling to catch his breath that Vickers finally went to the emergency room. ""Luckily I got there in time and then once I got in the emergency room it was trying to figure out what was wrong. At first they thought pneumonia, they gave me antibiotics. I was having a hard time getting through the CT scan. Every time I would lay down, my lungs would shut off and I just couldn't breathe,"" Vickers said. Eventually they did figure it out. Vickers had DVT or deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism‚Äîa clot in your deep veins. The clots were located in his left leg, lungs and also his fingers‚Äîcausing his fingers to turn white. ""The ones in the fingers were the big mystery. We couldn't figure how those got there because the way your circulatory system works, it would have had to have gone through my heart to get to my hand and come to find out, I had a hole in my heart between my left and right atrium and that's how they got to my hand. Well, if a clot goes through that hole it has two places it can go, your left hand or your brain. Typically it goes to your brain. So I got very lucky that I didn't have a stroke,"" Vickers said. In the prime of his career, having just completed his best season, Vickers was supposed to be a championship contender in 2010. But instead, just months into the year,  Vickers underwent  surgery to repair his heart and began blood thinners for treatment of the clots. He had an uphill battle to just get out of the woods and get healthy. But then his thoughts turned to his passion. Could he return to racing? Could he continue to chase his dream of becoming a championship winner? At first he was told he might never race again, which was a tough sentiment to swallow. But eventually there seemed to be a bit more discussion and possibility. ""So as the doctor put it, would you rather take the risk of dying from another clot or just potentially an internal injury and bleeding to death, you know, being on blood thinners. They can't say for sure, but he's like it's 50/50, so you just have to pick. And you know my decision was to be off of blood thinners for a lot of reasons, primarily to race,"" said Vickers. He followed doctors instructions and didn't rush it. Vickers sat out the remainder of the 2010 season as he rebuilt his strength, monitored by his doctors. But he did get back in the car and pushed all fears out the window. ""I certainly thought about it ‚Äî the possibility of having another clot -- but that wasn't what I was thinking about when I was driving into turn one at 200 mph."" But even the massive hurdle of recovery wasn't the only one in his path to return to the track. Vickers raced for Red Bull Racing and they had decided to leave the sport ‚Äî leaving Vickers jobless. Eventually, Vickers took a gamble and settled on a part-time ride with Michael Waltrip Racing. He had other offers for full-time positions but felt this was the right choice for him. ""I wanted to be back so bad but I don't want to be back just for the sake of being in the sport. I wanted to be back to win. So I took a pass and took a chance and then this opportunity came up with MWR and with Aarons,"" Vickers said . Coming into the next season he again chose to stay with Michael Waltrip Racing. ""There were some opportunities, again decent but not championship caliber teams, to go race full time. But I was so happy with the team that I was with and really felt at home there, with the partners and the team, you know, like Toyota and Aarons, the whole staff at MWR, the culture, and I didn't want to give that up. I'd been around long enough to know how difficult that is to find and it wasn't something I was going to give up lightly, even if it meant racing part time again another year."" His patience paid off. Earlier this season Vickers returned to victory lane and soon after that he accepted a full-time deal for two seasons with MWR. He's back on track‚Äîliterally and figuratively. Vickers has had a two-for-one in second chances. He recovered from this near-death medical issue and he's now experiencing a steady professional comeback as well. But Vickers knows it's both luck and hard work that got him here and he also knows there are many others who face similar hardships. He hopes sharing his story helps shine a light on some of these issues for others or simply inspires anyone going through difficult times to ""never give up."" This is the motto Vickers now lives by. He has teamed up with a foundation one of his doctors helped create called Clot Connect. Vickers supports it by donating his money, raising awareness for the foundation by putting its logo on his car and holding fundraisers for the group. ""It was an organization I didn't even know of prior to having clots. You know, I didn't even think about blood clots at all. I'd never even thought about it, and who gets blood clots and why? I just never thought it would be something I would have to deal with."" Vickers hopes to help change that and help Clot Connect not only raise money for treatment and prevention but also to educate more people about how warning signs present themselves. He also views this chapter in his life as a learning experience. ""I think anytime you go through a dramatic experience you're gonna learn a lot: personally, professionally, all of the above. You're gonna learn a lot about who you are and how you handle those situations and going through this experience was no exception for me."" ""You also learn about who's there for you and your family and what they taught you growing up and never give up is one of the biggest things my parents instilled in me. They supported me through the whole process. And not just pushing me to go back racing, you know, they were just there for me no matter what. They just said we don't care if you ever go back, we don't care what you do, we just want you to be OK and we  love you,"" Vickers continued. Vickers also noted that one of the harder lessons he learned was that not everyone will always be in your corner. But he feels this is ""a blessing in disguise""  that no matter the circumstance anyone could relate to. He explained: . ""It's kind of clearing out the weeds, so to speak. Because life's too short to have people in your life that aren't truly engaged in your life and support you no matter what. So as difficult as it is going through that experience, once the dust settles you're glad to have that gone, because now you can focus more energy on the people that really matter.""","Brian Vickers was diagnosed with blood clots in his leg, lungs and fingers .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- At least nine protesters were arrested in a pro-Palestinian rally Sunday afternoon in New York that injured seven police officers, authorities said. Seven police officers were injured Sunday in New York City during a pro-Palestinian rally. The extent of injuries varied from minor to serious, New York police said. Two officers sustained head injuries. Detective Cheryl Crispin said the protesters taken into custody faced charges ranging from disorderly conduct to reckless endangerment. In a statement, the NYPD said the officers were injured when trying to break up a fight between two demonstrators. ""While attempting to separate the males, several others joined in and began to assault the officers,"" the statement said. The demonstrators had gathered on Manhattan's West Side on Sunday afternoon to protest the Israeli incursion in Gaza. The rally began peacefully, but skirmishes between police and demonstrators eventually broke out, witnesses said. iReport.com: Hundreds march, shout at rally . Steve Sherman, coordinator of security for United for Peace and Justice and a demonstrator at the rally, said police maced demonstrators. ""The police pushed us out onto the avenue, and as we were walking down the avenue ... they charged with horses on the sidewalks and they charged with their own bodies and pushed in, and a riot started,"" he said. Mike Eilenfeldt, another demonstrator, said confrontations between the police and protesters appeared to escalate after a police officer had fallen to the ground. ""He's laying on the street, and from that point on it's a police riot where they start attacking the young people,"" Eilenfeldt told CNN. Police denied the allegations of mace being used on protesters.","Seven police officers hurt; injuries range from minor to serious .

"Earlier this week, Cambodia marked 35 years of freedom from the Khmer Rouge regime, whose revolutionary blueprint for an agrarian paradise caused the deaths of nearly two million in the 1970s. But instead of uniting Cambodians, the date perennially divides them. Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party casts the anniversary in the light of victory and liberation. Opposition figures shrug off the festivities as propaganda, a reminder that after the Khmer Rouge leaders retreated in 1979, the Vietnamese who defeated them stayed for 10 years. The diverging perspectives underscore what's happening now. In the name of public order and security, the government commemorating the fall of a regime is leading one of the most aggressive campaigns against dissenting foes in recent memory, according to analysts. ""Cambodia is now at a tipping point,"" said Carl Thayer, a longtime observer of the country's politics and a professor emeritus at the University of New South Wales in Australia. In the past nine days, pro-government security forces have arrested human rights defenders, gunned down five striking garment workers and violently evicted protesters from a designated free speech zone called ""Freedom Park."" At least 3 dead after security forces open fire . Last weekend, the Ministry of Interior temporarily banned demonstrations and the courts have summoned opposition leaders Sam Rainsy, president of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, and his deputy, Kem Sokha. ""Cambodian authorities appear to have given up any semblance of democracy, rule of law or justice,"" said Tola Moeun, head of the local advocacy group the Community Legal Education Center, in a statement earlier this week, after activists were briefly detained Monday in an apparent enforcement of the ban on demonstrations. ""The big questions are what is next and who will be next? This madness must end now."" The United Nations' human rights arm has urged an investigation into the violence, and major clothing manufacturers that conduct business in Cambodia -- including H&M, the Gap and Inditex, the parent company of Zara -- asked in a letter for a peaceful resolution. Seeds of conflict . Seeds of turmoil were sown in July, when Hun Sen's long-ruling CPP lost a chunk of parliamentary seats in the national elections, and Rainsy's Cambodia National Rescue Party, or CNRP, almost doubled its own. But Rainsy and his supporters claimed they were robbed of crucial votes that would have put them in front, ending nearly 30 years of Hun Sen's rule. They demanded an international investigation into the election -- which didn't happen -- and for Hun Sen to step down. Thousands of people took to the streets in protest. While the opposition had floundered at times -- revising its demands to include a new election -- it appeared stronger than ever as 2013 came to a close. The largely peaceful journey of civil disobedience began to veer off course on December 24, when unions, many of which line up politically with the opposition party, called for a nationwide garment worker strike, demanding an immediate monthly wage bump to $160 -- nearly double the $95 that the government first offered, and well above the $100 that was eventually proposed as a final offer. Soon, new groups joined. Tuk-tuk drivers demanded lower gasoline prices. Buddhist monks called for the authorities to find a stolen golden urn believed to contain ashes of the Buddha. All of the anger pointed in one direction. Crackdown country . On the evening of January 2, the crackdown began. In a protest outside a garment factory, authorities arrested 10 people, including garment workers and at least three human rights advocates, according to the Cambodian rights group Licadho. The arrested men face up to five years imprisonment. The next day, anger erupted outside the Canadia Industrial Park in southwest Phnom Penh. Hundreds of garment workers threw rocks at security forces and created burning roadblocks. Some carried Molotov cocktails. Military police responded by firing automatic weapons. Five workers were killed in the bloody clash, the U.N. said this week. Almost 40 were injured, and 13 people arrested, according to Licadho. On the hectic day of the confrontation, young men engaged in a standoff with a phalanx of riot police. One protester, In Chanthan, 26, who works at the park, was undeterred, cupping bullet casings in his hand as evidence. ""Very cruel,"" he said. Authorities secured the area. The sun rose on empty factories, smashed shops looted by demonstrators, mourning families and fearful residents. ""I think Hun Sen believes he's losing control of the situation,"" said Brad Adams, executive director for Human Rights Watch's Asia division. The prime minister has never really accepted the right to protest, he added. The government defended its actions, saying it had allowed the opposition to protest for months. But members of the public complained,  said Phay Siphan, spokesman for the Council of Ministers, a collection of top cabinet posts. ""The third party wants to use the street fairly. An ill person who wants medical attention gets blocked,"" he said. ""It's too much."" The forceful response on January 2 had to occur because a national road was being occupied by demonstrators, he said.  At Canadia Industrial Park the following day, protesters had become aggressive, damaging factories and throwing rocks and using slingshots to project ""iron balls"" at authorities. ""It's not a protest anymore, it became a riot,"" he said, adding that the government feels sorry for those killed. ""We so regret that this happened, but they didn't obey peacefully, to cease all activity."" he said. Rallying point targeted . On the morning of January 4, pro-government security guards and plainclothed thugs wearing red armbands stampeded through the opposition's main protest camp, Freedom Park, in the heart of the city, as tourists ate breakfast only blocks away. Police at the scene did nothing to stop them. ""The military force kicked the protesters,"" said Soeng Piseth, 31, a microfinance worker who managed to escape. City Hall issued a statement justifying the clearing of the park, saying it was an attempt to maintain order and security. The crowd ""protested in an attempt to topple the government, and burned down garment factories,"" said Mok Chito, head of the department of central justice in Cambodia's Ministry of Interior. Siphan justified the subsequent ban on demonstrations ‚Äî which critics say is a crackdown on free speech and freedom of assembly ‚Äî saying ""there has to be a cool-down period. The divisions are so deep right now."" In tandem with the eviction, summonses were dispatched to CNRP leaders Rainsy and Sokha, asking them to appear in court on January 14 to explain the turmoil. Sokha's political activities had landed him in jail before, and Rainsy's brushes with the government caused him to flee to France in 2009, returning last year on the coattails of a royal pardon. By Sunday, January 5, security forces were stationed at various points in the capital. A common refrain in recent weeks has been that the rallies represented the most serious threat to Hun Sen's government in years. But after heavy-handed pressure in the first week of January, garment strikers have largely returned to work and opposition leaders are regrouping. Freedom Park is eerily empty. On Thursday morning, when an opposition-affiliated youth group tried to sing a song inside the park, military police and security guards stopped them from getting into the main area, sending a clear message that the government will enforce its ban on demonstrations. The opposition's staying power and resilience are finally being put to test. ""We have to wait until the environment is a little bit calm,"" said Yim Sovann, a CNRP spokesman, this week. He added that protests in the city would resume, though he didn't say when.","Anti-government protests in Cambodia have recently taken a violent turn .
Protests underscore ongoing tension between Prime Minister Hun Sen and opposition party .

"Federal prosecutors Friday filed felony charges against former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., alleging the illegal misuse of about $750,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and gifts. The formal charges  of conspiracy, making false statements, and mail and wire fraud, were made public  in federal court only days after Jackson had signed a plea deal with prosecutors who were investigating potential financial improprieties. After the charges were filed Friday, Jackson issued a statement accepting responsibility for making mistakes and bad decisions. He did not dispute prosecutors' allegations. The charging document filed in Washington says the Illinois Democrat purchased a variety of luxury items, including furs and Michael Jackson memorabilia with campaign funds. Jackson signs plea deal, wife resigns from Chicago City Council . Campaign credit cards were used to purchase $582,772 for personal expenses, according to the document. Prosecutors contend Jackson and his wife, Sandra Stevens Jackson, tried to conceal conversion of the money for personal benefit. Among the more expensive items listed are a gold-plated Rolex watch valued at more than $43,000 that Jackson purchased for himself. He also purchased nearly $9,600 worth of children's furniture with campaign funds, the court document says. More than $5,000 in fur capes and parkas were bought from Beverly Hills, the prosecutors said. Read the case against Jackson (PDF) If convicted, according to the document, Jesse Jackson Jr. would forfeit $750,000 and a list of specific property that had been purchased. That includes a Michael Jackson hat valued at $3,900; a Michael Jackson fedora, valued at $4,600; a football signed by U.S. presidents, worth $5,000; the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. memorabilia, totaling more than $10,000; and many other items from Michael Jackson and Bruce Lee collections. Jackson will not have to appear in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia until his case is assigned to a judge, who will set a date to take Jackson's plea. Officials say it will be up to that judge to determine whether Jackson will serve any prison time. Under applicable federal laws, he could receive only probation or up to a theoretical maximum of five years. Sandra Jackson was referred to as a conspirator in the charges against her husband. She was identified not by name but by title as manager for the campaign to re-elect Jesse Jackson Jr., beginning in 2011. The long strange saga of Jesse Jackson Jr. Federal investigators charged Jackson's wife with filing false federal income tax returns for the couple from 2006 through 2011. If convicted, she could receive up to three years in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine. In a statement released by his Washington lawyer, Jesse Jackson Jr. said, ""Over the course of my life I have come to realize that none of us are immune from our share of shortcomings and human frailties. Still I offer no excuses for my conduct and I fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made. To that end I want to offer my sincerest apologies to my family, my friends and all of my supporters for my errors in judgment and while my journey is not yet complete, it my hope that I am remembered for things that I did right.""","Purchases include Michael Jackson items, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday implored Sudanese officials to fully implement a 2005 peace agreement and move forward with a referendum that could see Sudan split into two nations. ""At this moment, the fate of millions of people hangs in the balance,"" Obama told world leaders gathered at the United Nations to discuss the country's future. ""What happens in Sudan in the days ahead may decide whether a people who have endured too much war move towards peace or slip backwards into bloodshed."" The vote is scheduled for January. It would allow the autonomous southern region -- which holds a majority of the nation's oil -- to secede from the north. Fears that the process would cause more instability in the war-torn nation have sparked concerns among the international community. ""The referendum on self-determination ... must take place peacefully and on time,"" Obama said. ""And the will of the people of southern Sudan and the region of Abyei must be respected regardless of the outcome."" Abyei is a disputed oil-rich city in southern Sudan. ""The worst-case scenario is war. Nobody wants war, but both sides are preparing for war,"" said John Ashworth, a southern Sudan analyst. ""There are still major stumbling blocks. We have just over a hundred days to the referendum and virtually nothing is in place."" Obama called the stakes surrounding the vote ""enormous."" ""We all know the terrible price paid by the Sudanese people the last time north and south were engaged in war,"" he said. The referendum was part of a 2005 peace agreement that ended two decades of violence between the north and the south. The conflict led to the deaths of 2 million people, many from starvation. ""This is the awful legacy of the conflict in Sudan. The past must not become Sudan's future,"" Obama said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed Obama's comments, saying, ""The Sudanese people cannot afford a resumption of conflict. We must all assist them in finding a peaceful way through one of the most important passages in their country's history."" Analysts say that a failure in Sudan would have broader implications, including sparking instability in the region. International aid agencies are urging world leaders to act as the referendum nears. ""Failure to act risks a new eruption of violence and threatens the future of Africa's largest country, with just over 100 days until the referendum to decide whether the south should remain part of Sudan,"" five international aid agencies said in a letter to world leaders. Oxfam, the International Rescue Committee, Tearfund, World Vision and Christian Aid warned that the next three months will be crucial for Sudan. The aid agencies work in the nation. ""This meeting will show whether they have the commitment to make the financial and political investment needed to help Sudan have a peaceful future,"" said Kirsten Hagon, head of the Oxfam office in New York. ""Today's decisions will affect the lives of millions of Sudanese people."" Obama cautioned, however, that ""no one can impose progress and peace on another nation."" ""Ultimately, only Sudanese leaders can ensure that the referendum goes forward and that Sudan finds peace,"" he said. ""There's a great deal of work that must be done and it must be done quickly."" Ban laid out expectations for the referendum as decided by the international community. ""We expect the referenda to be peaceful, carried out in an environment free of intimidation or other infringements of rights,"" he said. ""We expect both parties to accept the results, and to plan for the consequences. And finally, we expect the parties to adhere to the [comprehensive peace agreement], without unilateral acts on either side, north or south."" Obama said that those Sudanese leaders who follow the path to peace will enjoy improved relations with the United States, including agricultural development, expanding trade relations and ""even working to lift sanctions if leaders fulfill their obligations."" But for those ""who flout their responsibilities ... there must be consequences,"" he said, warning of ""more pressure and deeper isolation."" Meanwhile, Amnesty International called on Sudanese authorities Friday to halt what it described as the intimidation of journalists. The group said journalists are regularly detained for carrying out their work while others have been tortured or tried on politically motivated charges. ""No credible poll can be conducted in an environment where freedom of speech is being so openly violated,"" said Rania Rajji, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher. ""The governments of north and south Sudan must ensure the vote is held in an atmosphere where all Sudanese can freely express their views and halt any further restrictions to freedom of expression."" Currently, Omar al-Bashir is the president of Sudan, while Salva Kiir serves as the president of the southern region and the nation's vice president. At stake in the referendum are Sudan's massive oil reserves, found mostly in the south, but still controlled by the government in the north. Ban said the U.N. mission in the country has trained more than 9,000 southern Sudanese police ahead of the vote. ""U.N. staff will be positioned in every county in southern Sudan during the polling,"" he said. ""I have also established a panel to facilitate a credible, transparent process."" And Ban pledged the United Nations' continued support ""in assisting all Sudanese in fulfilling their long-held hopes for a better future."" CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","The talks come as the referendum vote scheduled for January nears .

"(CNN) -- This week Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, called Anita Hill and left a message on her answering machine inviting her to apologize for testifying during Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings. The call brought back, with surprising immediacy, those 1991 hearings. For those too young to remember, the hearings may be little more than a paragraph in a history text. But it's hard to overstate their importance. For women at the time, Professor Hill's testimony was riveting and unforgettable. The country watched on TV as Hill related her personal story -- describing the sexual harassment she said she endured while working for Thomas as a federal government employee -- before a Judiciary Committee composed entirely of men. Not a single woman senator. (Thomas denied the allegations.) The issue of sexual harassment was out of the shadows. Before Hill's testimony, sexual harassment was viewed as a problem for victims, predominantly women, to solve on their own. Most women suffered in silence rather than jeopardize their careers by complaining, even though sexual harassment had been defined as a form of sex discrimination that could be illegal more than a decade earlier by the courts and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or EEOC). When it first appeared that Professor Hill's allegations might not even be aired, outraged women jammed congressional switchboards with phone calls, and seven women members of the House of Representatives, including Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Rep. Louise Slaughter and then-Rep. Barbara Boxer (who was elected to the Senate the following year) marched to the Senate to demand a serious and respectful hearing. Professor Hill was berated and personally attacked during the hearing. Former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson waited until Anita Hill's testimony was concluded to announce, for example, that ""I really am getting stuff over the transom about Professor Hill,"" without providing any details or substantiation about what he was referring to. Such treatment became the subject of dinner table conversations around the country, as did the problem of sexual harassment itself. And those conversations continued wherever women met. Pundits speculated that the Anita Hill testimony would forever intimidate women from ever coming forward again, but the opposite happened. After the hearings, the number of claims of sexual harassment filed with the federal EEOC (the very agency headed by Clarence Thomas where Anita Hill said he had sexually harassed her) more than doubled between 1991 and 1998 (from 6,883 to 15,618). And women demanded better legal protection. Congress strengthened remedies for victims of sexual harassment at work by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1991, providing damages for the full range of injuries that victims might suffer and giving victims the right to trial by a jury of her peers. Major victories in the courts struck blows against widespread sexual harassment that women suffered in the workplace, from the mines to Wall Street. Employers took notice, so that now anti-harassment policies are more robust and company training programs are commonplace. In the aftermath of Anita Hill's testimony, Justice Thomas was narrowly confirmed to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52 to 48. In what became known as ""the Year of the Woman,"" record numbers of women were elected to Congress: 28 women were elected to the House of Representatives, more than doubling the total number of female representatives to 47, and four new women joined the only two women then serving in the Senate. One of those new female senators from the class of 1992, Dianne Feinstein of California, now sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Anita Hill dedicated her career to combating discrimination, including sexual harassment, and opening equal opportunity to all in the workplace and beyond. The voicemail message from Justice Thomas's wife is a reminder of a moment in time that put a spotlight on sexual harassment. But our country still needs more discussion about the serious harm it causes. Sexual harassment has certainly not gone away. The National Women's Law Center, for example, recently filed an amicus brief in a lawsuit where a female electrical maintenance technician in a male-dominated workplace says she was constantly harassed -- with supervisors and co-workers routinely referring to women with demeaning and derogatory words, displaying provocative photos of naked and partially clothed women in common areas throughout the workplace (and not responding to her repeated requests that the photos be taken down), and excluding her from key daily meetings. Whether bullying and harassment in schools or making women's lives miserable in the workplace, it's time to make sure our laws are strong enough, our institutions committed enough, and our public debate serious enough to give women and girls the protections they need and deserve. There's still work to be done. For example, Congress needs to eliminate arbitrary limits on damages for sexual harassment victims and to change current legal standards that make it more difficult for students to prove sexual harassment than other claims of discrimination in schools. Any less not only does an injustice to women and girls, but to our country as well, which needs the talents and skills of us all to thrive. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marcia Greenberger.","Marcia Greenberger says Virginia Thomas' call for Anita Hill apology recalls 1991 hearings .

""They are actually pretty funky people, most of them are kind of young and all of them have aspirations to move up the social mobility ladder."" Sim said subterranean living is not as squalid as it might sound. Some use dehumidifiers in summer to take away the damp and in Beijing's freezing winter months it's warmer than above ground homes. ""The living space might seem pretty pathetic to us and maybe I went in with this pitying attitude as well, but what I found was the people make the best of their lives down there."" Annette Kim, a professor at the University of Southern California, has mapped Beijing's underground city by studying more than 7,000 online rental ads. She found the median size was 9.75 square meters, or 105 square feet, and the mean rent was $70 a month -- although she believes the rentals she studied were at the higher end of what's available. Kim says it's hard to know exactly how many people live in this type of informal housing. Estimates vary from 200,000 to 2 million. She says 1 million is a reasonable estimate. All buildings constructed in Beijing are required to have basements -- initially a national defense policy that began in the 1950s -- and until 2010 it was perfectly legal to live in these spaces as long as they met building codes. However, the official policy is now to evict people, but it's not being implemented evenly, Kim says. The number of rental ads for underground housing increased during her year researching the phenomena in 2013. Alternative low-cost options include living in ""urban villages"" on Beijing's outskirts. But Kim says: ""They would rather live underground than commute for a long time. It means that sometimes they could have two jobs."" Kim found the ""rat tribe"" had little interaction with those living above them. ""The people above ground preferred to be as separate as possible and that built up fear of who these people are."" Zhang Qiuli, the pedicurist, was the first person Sim befriended and photographed. After years spent living beneath a posh condominium in east Beijing, she has since moved ""above ground."" ""She is one of the success stories,"" says Sim. ""I think for some people there is true upward mobility but for many people the hukou system, whereby migrants can't actually buy homes and settle down, is still a huge barrier to them building lives and families here."" ""Most think they will eventually go home and maybe set up a shop and raise their families.""

"Romance and flying rarely go together anymore, unless you fall in love 35,000 feet above ground and get engaged in-flight. Alexandra Williams and Arvin Shandiz met on a Delta Air Lines shuttle from New York to Chicago in 2010, CNN affiliate WGN reported. ""I was enamored with her from day one and I was like, I'm going to spend the rest of my life with her,"" Shandiz told the station. ""I would joke with her and tell her that when we get engaged, it'll happen on a Delta flight."" And that's exactly what happened. On Friday, in the middle of a flight from Chicago's O'Hare International to New York's LaGuardia Airport, Shandiz suddenly addressed a visibly shocked Williams over the plane's intercom (with the airline's permission) as other passengers looked on. The proposal was captured on a video posted on YouTube. ""From the moment I met her that night, I knew that I never wanted to spend a second without her,"" Shandiz announced as Williams rocked in her seat with emotion. ""Would you marry me?"" The cabin erupted in applause as Williams said yes. Shandiz then presented her with the ring and the couple kissed awkwardly in the cramped cabin. Delta treated all passengers on the flight with champagne to celebrate the engagement. It also surprised the couple with a free trip for their honeymoon, WGN reported. ""It was magical to say the least and it's been a fairy tale from the moment we met. I can't say how elated and lucky I feel,"" Williams said.","Man pops the question on board a flight to New York as passengers look on .

"Complaining on social networks about being sick might annoy your friends and followers, but it can be useful for tools that track the spread of illnesses. A new method for filtering tweets, developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, could make the real-time data pouring in more accurate. The United States is in the middle of one of its most severe flu seasons in years. Tech companies, universities and health organizations are harnessing the wealth of data from social networks and search engines, in addition to the usual reports from vital statics offices, hospitals, doctors and public health departments, to keep the public informed and better prepare public health workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention releases a weekly influenza update for the United States that includes stats on people with flu-like symptoms, hospitalizations and deaths. But the detailed information is about two weeks old by the time it comes out. ""There are a lot of gaps in the system that Twitter can fill,"" said assistant research professor Mark Dredze, who headed up the Johns Hopkins project. Real-time information like tweets are becoming a popular source of public health information. They can be used to do more than just track outbreaks. Dredze's goal is to get ahead of the curve and actually predict where and when illnesses will spread. This information could be invaluable for public health departments, providing them advanced warnings and time to plan with additional doctors, hospital beds or school closings. Thanks to GPS information for each tweet, the location information gathered from Twitter is more finely detailed than the CDC. Early warnings are good for regular people as well. They push people to get vaccinated before they catch the flu, and individuals with health issues who might be more vulnerable can take extra precautions. With an average 340 million tweets a day, Twitter is a firehouse of muddled and misleading information. Taken at face value, keywords would indicate the entire country is suffering from an ongoing fever epidemic of the Bieber variety. Much of the running commentary on Twitter is a reaction to news events, so when a flu epidemic becomes a national news story, the number of people talking about it spikes, regardless of their own health status. ""Most people have just focused on the presence of flu. The very simple thing is you look at Twitter and look at the number of people using the world flu or sick everyday,"" said Dredze. ""The problem with that is if you look a little more closely it doesn't really work."" Dredze's team is using algorithms to correct for these issues, filtering out the noise to isolate the useful information. They were already researching using Twitter to track health issues before this winter's recent outbreak but quickly changed tracks to focus on the flu. The group plans to share the information it gathers with public health officials. Tracking influenza and other illnesses based on social media isn't new. In a 2011 paper, researchers reported being able to accurately track disease levels for the swine flu outbreak two years earlier by searching for keywords such as flu, vaccine, illness, Tamiflu and pneumonia. The University of Rochester has turned research about predicting the spread of diseases with social media into a web application called Germ Tracker. The colorful interactive map pulls up geo-tagged Tweets that contain keywords related to illness. If you find a tweet that's clearly mislabeled (like someone bragging that their new car is ""sick""), click a button to let the app know they're not actually sick. It also allows self reporting with a slider you can set to Awful, Sick, Yuck, Meh or Good and options to share specific symptoms. Sick Weather is a similar project that can pull from Facebook and Twitter to map and show animations of contagious illnesses such as chicken pox, colds and whooping cough, as well as other issues like allergies, stress and depression. Even as researchers get better at filtering tweets, the social network presents limitations. It isn't an accurate representation of the entire population in terms of age or location. Two of the groups hardest hit by influenza outbreaks, the elderly and children, are the least likely to be live blogging their symptoms. Google's Flu Trends looks at search terms to create real-time estimates of where the flu is flaring up. Developed in 2009 in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control, the tool digs through massive amounts of search data (all anonymous) looking for flu-releated searches around the world and maps out the intensity of outbreaks. ""The advantage of using these social media tools and Google is they're much faster than the CDC,"" said Michael Paul, a doctoral student working on the Johns Hopkins Twitter research. ""As an early warning, they're useful to the government when it needs to plan."" Armchair influenza trackers will still get the most detailed information from weekly reports released by the Centers for Disease Control. The reports dig deep into the data gathered from doctors, hospitals and other health officials to outline things like number of deaths, flu-related hospitalizations and a breakdown of strains. The CDC also has its own simple app called FluView that plots the volume of influenza-like illnesses by state. ""Our job is really to figure out what viruses are going around and what effect they're having,"" said Lynnette Brammer, an influenza epidemiologist at the CDC. ""It's more laboratory based; we try to get as close as we can to the viruses."" The CDC teams do check tools like the Google Flu Tracker, and Brammer says that while the results don't always match up, Google is close to the CDC's own findings most of the time. The CDC has slightly different goals than tech tools that track symptoms in real-time. It's drilling down to find out what strains are being reported, see if they are close to the current vaccine and if not, determine if the vaccine needs to be changed to include new virus candidates.","Social media information like tweets is being used to map the current flu outbreak .

"For a year after her journalist son went missing in Syria in 2012, Debra Tice kept calling his cell phone. It would ring and ring. Nothing. She would send Austin Tice messages on Facebook. No response. ""It's excruciating,"" Tice's father, Marc, told CNN on Monday at their Houston home. The void of not knowing what happened to their son or who has him is a ""constant presence."" All they know is that he was abducted in a Damascus suburb. His absence haunts them. When they try to relax and do something normal in life, some small pleasure, there is an immediate feeling that they should be writing another letter, making another call or searching for some thread they haven't pulled that may be hidden in the extensive notes they've accumulated over the years they have searched. When Debra Tice insists that her son will be found, she speaks firmly, her eyes intently fixed, voice firm and clear. ""There has never been a moment of questioning that he's coming home,"" she said. That state of mind keeps despair at bay, and she won't waver from faith. But could ISIS, the vicious militant group that has beheaded two other American journalists, have him? The Tices don't know for sure, but say they don't think that's the case. There has been no communication or ransom requests from the captors to the Tices -- a tactic ISIS has previously used in the abductions of other journalists. That is what leads the Tices to believe ISIS does not have their son. Even contemplating a scenario like that is unbearable to them. ""If we start thinking about that ... the pit of despair has no depth,"" Debra Tice said. ""It's an abyss."" Video of Tice . Only one clue has emerged since the disappearance of the 33-year-old, who is also a former U.S. Marine captain. A shaky 47-second video uploaded to YouTube in September 2012 showed him blindfolded, apparently being walked through rocky terrain by men carrying guns. At that time, the State Department said Tice was believed to be in the custody of the Syrian government -- but the regime of President Bashar al-Assad did not say it was detaining him. His parents said this week that they've been told by the Syrian government that their son is not in its detention facilities. Tice was freelancing for McClatchy and The Washington Post, filing stories for them starting in May 2012. His Twitter posts and pictures on the photo-sharing site Flickr drew thousands of followers. In July 2012, Tice appeared on CNN's ""Global Public Square"" to talk about what he saw in Syria. He was then a law student and spending his summer reporting on the war. He described being embedded with a rebel group fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and seeing that the government's helicopters fly so high it seemed impossible that fighters could aim their missiles. He also said that he witnessed hostile fire that seemed random and badly aimed from al-Assad's tanks and troops. He was last publicly heard from via Twitter on August 11 of that year, saying that he spent the day with Free Syrian Army rebels who were fighting to oust al-Assad from power. Tice tweeted that he enjoyed a good time at a pool party. ""They even brought me whiskey. Hands down, best birthday ever,"" he posted. Parents on a mission . The Tices have traveled, at their own expense, to Lebanon to meet with people who they felt might help them find their son, they told CNN. They made three trips to Beirut, they said, and did not want to specify exactly whom they talked with, referring only to ""folks"" in ""channels that are credible."" They said the most complete information they've received about their son -- including that he is alive -- has come from sources other than those in the United States. They have worked to cultivate those sources. They expressed extreme frustration with U.S. government ""policies"" that they said keep people in the U.S. government from giving them information about their son. The parents have repeatedly been told that they need security clearance to hear information that officials have. ""We don't want to be treated like we're a security risk,"" Marc Tice said. ""Who else has more motivation to be careful about information about our son?"" ""We've asked repeatedly, 'What is it that we need to do to enable you to share this information with us?'"" Debra Tice said she told U.S. officials, without saying which officials specifically. The parents have been told ""we'll get back to you,"" she said. Marc Tice said the process has been ""terribly frustrating,"" adding that he feels that there are many in the U.S. government that the parents have dealt with who genuinely seem to empathize and want to help the Tices. But the Tices want to be clear. They aren't concerned with changing policy. They have a singular focus. ""We want to get our son home safely,"" Debra Tice said. A spokeswoman for the State Department said Wednesday that the family's frustration is ""understandable and heartbreaking."" ""No parent should ever endure the Tice family's anguish. We are in awe of their courage and tenacity in doing everything in their power to bring Austin home,"" Jen Psaki said. ""The government provides all of the information we can to families in these circumstances without jeopardizing our efforts to bring Austin home safely or putting at risk the intelligence sources on which we depend for our national security."" She said several U.S. agencies had been working for Austin Tice's release, though their efforts couldn't be discussed publicly. A 'strong guy' The Tices have talked to people who have been held hostage and freed. The parents are comforted to hear how much it means to those former captives when they realize how hard and constant their families' fight to find them was. ""It's about faith,"" Debra Tice said. Marc Tice said his son is a ""strong guy"" with a ""strong mind, a strong body,"" which gives him confidence that whatever his son is enduring, he will somehow find a way through. Austin Tice loves the people of the Middle East, his parents said. Since he was a child, he has been curious. He wanted to know how people lived. He wanted to explore the world. He felt compelled to go to Syria because he was frustrated hearing time and again, during media coverage of the civil war, that reports could not be verified. Al-Assad often blocked foreign journalists from covering the conflict and many journalists steered away from the war because the violence was so intense and often directed at them. ""He thought, 'Really, I have the ability to stay safe,'"" Marc Tice said. His son, he said, felt it was a ""calling"" to go.","State Department says Washington is in awe of family's courage, tenacity .

"Ninety passengers aboard an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to Kuwait could have used actor Samuel L. Jackson this week after a snake reportedly bit a Jordanian man who smuggled the reptile onboard. Jackson's character in the movie ""Snakes on a Plane"" tries to figure out how to save the aircraft after crates of hyped-up serpents started killing the cast. There wasn't quite that kind of drama on Monday, but the incident forced the pilot to make an emergency landing in the Egyptian resort town of Al Ghardaqa on the Red Sea, according to The Jordan Times. An Egypt Air official told the paper an investigation revealed that the 48-year-old passenger, who owns a reptile shop in Kuwait, had hidden the Egyptian cobra in a carry-on bag. The passenger was trying to control the snake after it bit his hand and started slithering under the seats. The Egyptian daily al-Masry al-Youm reported that the man refused medical treatment, claiming his wound was only superficial. The plane resumed its flight to Kuwait after local authorities confiscated the snake. Doctors told the passenger he should spend 24 hours in a hospital for observation, but the man refused, the Egyptian Air official said, according to The Jordan Times. Egyptian cobras are commonly found across North Africa. According to wildlife experts, the cobra's venom is so deadly it can kill a full-grown elephant in three hours or a person in about 15 minutes. The venom destroys nerve tissue and causes paralysis and death because of respiratory failure. Legend has it that in ancient times, the Egyptian queen Cleopatra used an Egyptian cobra -- also known as an asp -- to commit suicide.","A reptile shop owner smuggled an Egyptian cobra in his carry-on for an Egypt Air flight .

It was christened in 2006, at which point the ship was believed to be the largest cruise ship flying the Italian flag. 2. The ship weighs in at more than 114,000 gross tonnage and measures 951 feet in length. Its maximum speed was designed to be 23 knots. 3. Among the amenities on board: a wellness center, five restaurants, 13 bars, four swimming pools and a giant movie screen. The ship has 1,500 cabins. 4. Its name -- Concordia -- is Italian for concord, or harmony. 5. About 4,200 people were on board the ship when it ran aground. Most of the passengers were Italian, as well as some French and German citizens. CNN affiliate America Noticias, in Peru, said a group of 32 Peruvians were also onboard. Brazil's state-run Agencia Brasil said 53 Brazilians were on the cruise ship.

"The tour bus bounces along one of North Korea's potholed roads, pop music blasting out over the speakers. It's a catchy tune and even though none of the tourists can understand the lyrics, a few are tapping their feet to the beat. The hit song, ""Without a Break,"" is by Moranbong, by far North Korea's most popular band. The driver is clearly a fan and plays the DVD several times a day. Most tourists are busy looking out the window and pay little attention to the video screened at the front of the bus. They don't notice the nuclear missile being launched behind the all-girl band, nor do they see it smash into our little blue planet, blowing up the Earth. ""'Without a Break' is about the nuclear destruction of the U.S.,"" says Australian Mark Freeman, who has visited North Korea four times. ""Tourists dance to it because they don't know the lyrics, they don't know what the song is about."" Travel to North Korea raises a number of sticky issues, not least of all the ethical issue of supporting a repressive regime. For those who opt to go, it's an opportunity to glimpse one of the most isolated, unfathomable and feared countries in the world. ""There have been about 6,000 Western tourists this year -- that's a tenfold increase on a decade ago,"" says Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockerell. But when you sign up to visit the DPRK you have to play by their rules. There are strict guidelines in place about what you can and cannot do. Break with the protocol -- or even be suspected of it -- and not just you but the rest of your group will be sent back early. Or worse, as U.S. military veteran Merrill Newman discovered. According to his family, the Palo Alto, California, resident had gone on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea in October. From phone calls and postcards he sent, the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem, son Jeff Newman said. The day before he was to leave, ""one or two Korean authorities"" met with Newman and his tour guide, the son added. They talked about Newman's service record, which left ""my dad ... a bit bothered,"" according to Jeff Newman. Then, just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang in late October, he was taken off the aircraft by North Korean authorities. More: U.S. 'deeply concerned' about citizens held in North Korea, including Newman . Getting into North Korea . Unless you're invited as part of a business delegation, the only way to visit North Korea is by joining a tour. Depending on the number of tourists and whether or not it includes Americans, two to three trained guides-cum-minders accompany each group. Aside from the hotels where tourists can roam freely between their room, the bar and the restaurant, a guide accompanies visitors at all times. The guides are friendly and accommodating. They go out of their way to keep their charges happy -- singing songs and ensuring there is plenty to eat and drink. The lavish meals, with a big spread put out for every meal, is all part of the package. The DPRK wants Westerners to return home raving about how much they were given to eat. American Kent Rutter, a lawyer, has visited North Korea twice and says he liked the guides and asked plenty of questions, but was frustrated when he didn't get a straight answer. ""Their job was to tell us whatever the government wanted us to hear, even if it contradicted what we could see from the bus window,"" he says. More: Touring North Korea: What's real, what's fake? Florian Seidel, a German localization expert for a computer game company in Japan, says he got a lot more out of his second trip to North Korea because he had a better grasp of what was going on. He did some research -- mostly online, reading blogs and scouring Google Earth images -- ahead of his second visit to the remote North East of the country and was wise on what to look out for in the region. ""Don't worry about being lied to, worry about not getting the interesting information,"" says Seidel. ""Guides repeat certain random things a dozen times, but when you drive right past the entrance to a concentration camp they won't tell you."" If you don't want to bow, stay home . A key aspect of any trip to North Korea is the need to show reverence for past and present leaders. This means not only referring to them with respect, but also bowing in front of the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Pyongyang has a number of statues, so this can mean laying flowers and bowing several times on a week-long trip. For those traveling around the country, there's a Kim Il Sung statue in every city. Koryo Tours, the longest running and most specialized travel company for the DPRK, advises tourists in their briefing notes that they will be expected to bow in front of the statues and warns: ""If you are not willing to behave at some points as expected by the local customs then we recommend you do not visit the DPRK, the potential for offense to be taken by the hosts which then adversely affects the tour is too great."" German tourist Seidel didn't enjoy the obligatory bowing but understood that it was a necessary part of being allowed to visit. ""I felt like an atheist during Holy Mass -- I couldn't relate, but I played along to avoid offending anybody,"" he says. Repeat visitors to the DPRK quickly realize that the best way to get the most out of a trip is to stick to the rules. There's little point grilling the guides about politics or gulags because you won't get a straight answer. Every tour is a carefully choreographed affair, designed to show the country in its best light, but much can gleaned on the drive between approved tourists sites. It's especially interesting when unexpected events force a sudden change of plan. Australian tourist Freeman was on a tour of the north east when road works meant the bus had to take a side road through an old village. ""The guides got very flustered because all of a sudden they couldn't use the road they knew was safe for us to travel,"" says Freeman. ""They even got off the bus and tried to reason with the construction guys, they were incredibly nervous."" More: Behind the veil: Rare look at life in North Korea . He compares a tour of the DPRK to the film ""The Matrix."" The occasional glitches in the tour, say when the bus breaks down and is forced to make an impromptu stop, are like the scene in the film when the cat walks through twice -- a crack in the Matrix. So long as you don't break the rules -- disrespect the leaders, wander off on your own, try to speak to the locals without permission -- then North Korea is a very safe place to visit. Haydon Howlett, a New Zealand tourist who visited Pyonyang for the first time this summer, says it's one of the safest places he's ever visited. ""There aren't many countries where you can leave your bag loaded with cash, cameras and passports and know that it'll be there when you return,"" says Howlett. Travel blogger Earl weighed up the pros and cons of visiting on his site, www.wanderingearl.com. The reasons for not going were fairly convincing: money from the tour would support the regime and it's repressive policies; foreigners are used as propaganda tools by the North Korean government by presenting tourists as people who come to pay their respects to the regime and leaders; it would be a controlled and limited experience; and there would be little interaction with North Koreans. But in the end he decided to go and didn't regret his decision. ""I still believe that the benefits of traveling to North Korea do indeed outweigh the negatives,"" he wrote on his blog. It's quite possible to visit North Korea and buy into the vision of the country that's offered, without question. Many do. Freeman was stunned by two young Australian women who announced at the end of their week-long tour that they were going to tell everyone back home that North Korea was nothing like what the media portrays. ""They were so na√Øve,"" says Freeman. Had they forgotten that there are 300,000 plus people who are going to die in concentration camps?

"An investigation by Chinese authorities into the activities of GlaxoSmithKline has allegedly turned up a bribery network that involves government officials, doctors, hospitals and at least 700 travel agencies. The U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline, one of the world's largest vaccine makers, is now attempting to distance itself from its China arm -- which has been accused of using hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to encourage the use of GSK products and artificially boost prices. As Chinese authorities and GlaxoSmithKline reveal new information, here is an overview of the probe, the parties involved and the potential penalties. What is GlaxoSmithKline? GlaxoSmithKline, headquartered in London, is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The firm is known for its wide range of over-the-counter and prescription medicines and vaccines including its popular anti-depressant Paxil and diabetes drug Avandia. GSK, as the company is also known, says it employs some 97,000 people in more than 100 countries. In the last fiscal year, GSK reported more than $11.5 billion in pre-tax profits and ranked #231 on the Fortune Global 500. What are the accusations? On July 11, China's national police agency accused GlaxoSmithKline of bribing government and medical officials in some of China's biggest cities -- including the country's financial hub of Shanghai and Hunan's provincial capital Changsha -- to encourage the use of GSK medicines and to push prices higher. The bribes totaled nearly half a billion dollars, according to media reports. On July 22, GSK executive Abbas Hussain admitted that some of the company's senior executives in China appeared to have violated the law. Hussain, the company's president of Europe, Japan, emerging markets and Asia-Pacific, had been dispatched to China to contain fallout from the alleged scandal. On July 24, China's state media reported that 39 hospital workers were being punished for taking more than $450,000 in kickbacks from pharmaceutical firms over a three-year period. Nine of the doctors involved had been suspended or had their licenses revoked, and a case involving a trade union official was referred to the judicial system. Who has been caught up in the scandal? Chinese authorities have barred GSK China's Vice President for Finance, British national Steve Nechelput, from leaving the country since late June.  At least four Chinese executives have also been detained. Chinese state media have identified these executives as Vice-President of GSK China's investment company Liang Hong, Vice-President and human resources director Zhang Guowei, GSK China's legal affairs director Zhao Hongyan and the company's business development manager Huang Hong. Chinese state television also broadcast an apparent confession by Liang Hong. It is unclear whether his statement was made under force or duress. Liang explained how conferences were faked in order for travel agencies to create receipts for services never performed. Funds were then used to pay off bribes encouraging the use of GSK products. How have drug prices been affected in China? In Liang Hong's alleged confession aired on Chinese state television, the executive explained that the bribes could have encouraged corrupt government and medical officials to raise prices 20-30%. Liang added the cost for medication would be substantially inflated by the time it reached patients. How important is China to GSK? In the company's just-released second quarter earnings statement, GSK revealed net losses in Europe and Japan, with flat turnover in the United States in the first half of the year. The only regional growth occurred in emerging markets and the Asia Pacific -- of which China is core. As China's investigation into GSK expands, the firm's profits from the crucial emerging growth market are expected to take a hit. ""Clearly, we are likely to see some impact to our performance in China as a result of the current investigation,"" said GSK CEO Sir Andrew Witty, ""but it is too early to quantify the extent of this."" Sine the bribery allegations first surfaced, GSK's share price has slumped 3.5% in London and 2.4% on the New York Stock Exchange. What are the penalties if GSK is found guilty? China's investigation could expose the company to legal action in the U.K., and possibly the United States, under laws relating to the bribery of foreign public officials. GlaxoSmithKline says it has informed the U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office about the bribery allegations but had not yet been asked to provide any further information. The agency, which investigates and prosecutes corruption cases, said last week that it could neither confirm nor deny an interest in the claims against GSK at this stage.","China accuses GlaxoSmithKline of funneling $500bn to bribe gov't, medical officials .

"Options for meat substitutes have come a long way since Seth Tibbott's first few Thanksgivings as vegetarian in the 1970s. Vegetable side dishes and salads were nice but they didn't seem as festive as a turkey, the traditional Thanksgiving centerpiece. The Oregon man tried all kinds of experiments, from a stuffed pumpkin to a gluten roast that took all day to make but was ""unsliceable and indigestible."" After becoming a professional ""soycrafter"" in 1980, Tibbott noticed that sales seemed to slow around Thanksgiving and Christmas ""as people lost their vegetarian ways and guiltily ate traditional fare like turkey,"" he said. Aside from tofu, which was primarily only sold in Asian markets, the only commercially available meat alternatives were made by Seventh Day Adventist companies, and many of these products were canned. ""I subsisted on a diet of homemade items like pressure-cooked soybeans and tortillas, soy grit burgers, bread and granola,"" he told CNN. Over the years, fake meat -- or what some call plant-based meat -- grew to include burgers, hot dogs and ground beef. But poultry was still a relatively untapped niche, especially when it came to holiday centerpieces. With the help of Portland sandwich maker Hans Wrobel, Tibbott came up with the first Tofurky Roasts in 1995 and sold them in the Pacific Northwest. Since then, Tofurky has become a punchline on shows like Jay Leno and ""The X-Files."" In homes across the country, families have begrudgingly ceded space on the table to vegetarian relatives. Seattle's mayor pardoned a Tofurkey named Braeburn this year to kick off a food drive. Tibbott is laughing all the way to the bank as his fake turkey product enters its 20th season this Thanksgiving. The company says that more than 3.4 million Tofurky Roasts have been sold since 1995, and several competitors have emerged, creating more tasty bird-free roast options than ever for the holidays. Don't fear the vegan at your Thanksgiving table . With its torpedo shape and spongy, loaf-like consistency, the Tofurky and its competitors are a far gobble from a real bird. But add some stuffing and gravy and many agree you have an equally worthy Thanksgiving centerpiece. ""It's that traditional centerpiece, that protein source, that acts as the main dish,"" said Bianca Phillips, food blogger at Vegan Crunk and author of ""Cookin' Crunk: Eatin' Vegan in the Dirty South."" ""A roast brings that taste and texture of turkey that we associate with Thanksgiving."" Flavor without the 'questions' To eat meat substitutions or not is a perennial topic of debate among vegetarians and vegans, especially as mainstream demand for meatless options grows. Some meat substitutes contain processed ingredients, additives and preservatives, adding up to a fake hot dog that's not much healthier than a real hot dog. Then there's the question of whether they defeat the point of avoiding meat. Does it send mixed messages about what vegetarians and vegans want? Aren't there enough delicious whole vegetarian foods without having to resort to meat substitutions? On some level, plant-based meat defends the point of a meatless lifestyle, says vegan blogger and cookbook author Kathy Patalsky. Thanks to culinary progress, some meatless options are much more than soy protein, water and flavoring. Gardein, another popular maker of meat alternatives, uses wheat and pea proteins as well as ancient grains that include quinoa and kamut, Patalsky said in a 2010 blog post. And, while some plant-based meats resemble and taste like the products they impersonate, they do it without the saturated fat, hormones, preservatives, antibiotics or the cruelty, she said. ""I didn't stop eating meat because of the taste. I stopped because of the questions."" Fake meat can be especially helpful for people in the early stages of transitioning away from meat -- especially during the holidays. Seeking the 'taste and texture of turkey' Phillips also stopped eating meat because of ethical questions. She went vegetarian the day after Thanksgiving in 1994, and then ten years later, in 2004, she went vegan, the day after Thanksgiving. Coming from the South, it was not easy, she said. ""I loved the taste and texture of meat, but as soon as I understood where meat came from, I could no longer stomach it. Yet I still longed for the taste and texture. And I found the answer in plant meats,"" she said. ""Thankfully, they've improved a great deal since I first switched to plant meats 20 years ago. So many vegan companies now make plant meats with very high-quality ingredients, resulting in a minimally processed product that's actually nutritious."" She points to ingredients in the Gardein turkey substitute she's eating this season: ""Water, soy protein isolate, vital wheat gluten, expeller pressed canola oil, organic ancient grain flour (kamut, amaranth, millet, quinoa), natural flavors (from plant sources), modified vegetable gum, yeast extract, potato starch, sea salt, organic cane sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, pea protein, carrot fiber, beetroot fiber, extractives of paprika and turmeric."" She knows plenty of vegans who'd prefer a stuffed butternut squash centerpiece. To her, it sounds like a delicious side dish. It may not be as healthy as a whole foods-based centerpiece, but come on -- it's Thanksgiving! ""We're supposed to gorge and let go of any food rules,"" she said. ""It's a holiday, and we're celebrating!""","Tofurky celebrates 20 years on vegetarians' tables this year .

"(CNN) -- Virginia's governor declared a state of emergency Friday as a winter storm expected to pummel the East Coast this weekend began dumping snow in Virginia and North Carolina. The storm is forecast to blast a narrow corridor from Richmond, Virginia, to Fredericksville, Pennsylvania, leaving interstates 95, 81, 64 and possibly 80 covered in significant snow, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. Myers said areas like Charlottesville, Virginia, may rake in some of the highest snowfall accumulations, depending on how quickly the storm moves and whether it remains on course. Roads in the Western part of Virginia are already bad, with lots of accidents being reported, said Bob Spieldenner, Director of Public Affairs at the Virginia Department of Emergency. The Virginia State Police said Friday night at around 8 p.m. they were working 335 accidents. The hardest hit area so far was in Roanoke, Virginia, along I-81, a spokesman with the Virginia Department of Transportation said. The Roanoke Regional Airport said it had cancelled all remaining flights for Friday night. An accident on I-26 in Western North Carolina has closed the entire interstate, and some drivers have been stuck so long on the road they have run out of fuel, according to CNN affiliate WSPA-TV. Power lines in the area were also beginning to fall and at least 38,000 residents were without power as of 7 p.m., WSPA reported. The North Carolina State Highway Patrol said it was receiving high volumes of calls for service, either for accidents, stranded motorists or cars that ran off the road. Sgt. Jeff Gordon said that as of 10 p.m. Friday night the highway patrol had received 682 calls in the Asheville area, 623 calls in Newton, 682 calls in Salisbury and 513 calls in the Greensboro, Winston-Salem and High Point areas. I-77 near U.S. 21 was also blocked, Gordon said, because of a tractor-trailer jackknife. Gordon said there was about 8 to 12 inches of snow in Asheville. Snowfall differed across the state, he said, with 6 to 8 inches a couple of hours to the east of Asheville and only cold rain east of Raleigh. ""We have our hands full, but all in all I think we're all working together to try and tackle this,"" Gordon said. ""It's just another example of Mother Nature's wrath."" Depending on residents' locations along the corridor, residents may see no snowfall or 20 inches, Myers said, noting that there may be only a 50- or 60-mile difference between the two. WBTV: Heavy snow causes accidents, school closings . A winter storm warning was in effect for East Coast metropolitan areas including Washington; Baltimore, Maryland; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service. The storm comes at a pivotal time for Washington. The Senate is embroiled in a contentious battle over the health care reform bill. Wintry conditions could delay commutes to work over the weekend. Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty said the city will be enacting a snow emergency plan, which will include 750 staff members working around the clock and 330 trucks out on the streets. ""We think this will be the biggest snowfall since 2003,"" Fenty said during a news conference, referring to a blizzard that dumped about 27 inches in the area. The National Weather Service in Washington increased its projections for the city to between 10 and 20 inches of snow, Myers said. Virgin America Airlines said it was canceling all incoming and outgoing flights to Washington/Dulles Airport on Saturday in advance of the storm. Fenty said workers are already preparing roads with a salt brine solution, in hopes of keeping the snow from piling up and sticking. He also said that as of 7 a.m. Saturday residents will not be allowed to park cars on the city's 100 marked snow emergency routes, which are for the most part the same as the rush hour routes. In Maryland, state highway officials are also spraying a salt brine solution on highways and roads, CNN affiliate WBAL-TV in Baltimore reported. WBAL: Highways prepped ahead of storms . The Baltimore Ravens pushed back the starting time of their Sunday football game from 1 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. because of the storm, according to the team's site. In Asheville, North Carolina, snow covered the roads, making for difficult commutes. Some residents, like iReporter Ed Jenest, figured it was better to stay home. ""It's a great day not to go anywhere,"" he said. ""We're listening to music and we've got a fire going."" Air travelers en route to holiday destinations may face delays, said Tammy Jones, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. With snow expected to cloak much of the Northeast, the FAA may institute a ground-delay program if air travel conditions warrant. In such a case, the FAA informs the airlines at a certain airport that they will have to stay on the ground for a period of time, Jones said. ""Snow's not so significant if you're in the air, but on the ground, it can be problematic,"" Jones said. Several airlines have issued travel alerts allowing for free rebooking of flights because of the storm. Some flights for the weekend have been canceled.  A storm system developing over the northern Gulf of Mexico will move northeast up the mid-Atlantic on Saturday and ""will produce a swath of heavy snowfall,"" the Weather Service said. Is snow headed your way? Share photos and video of the wintry scene . Southeastern New York may get 6 to 8 inches of snow, while Manhattan and central and eastern Long Island may get up to a foot. Blizzard conditions are also possible for Long Island, where winds are expected to hit 50 mph Saturday evening and Sunday morning. Mark Fayer, vice president of Long Island Transit Express bus service, which serves metropolitan New York, said he expected normal operations despite a little snow. ""We will be operating our normal schedules; we don't anticipate any delays that we can't handle,"" Fayer said. Winter storm warnings are in effect for eastern Kentucky, western and central North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland and parts of Pennsylvania. The storm is expected to cause chaos for weekend travelers and Christmas shoppers, but a UPS spokesman said shipped packages shouldn't be delayed. ""The good thing for us and our competitors is that this is happening on a weekend,"" UPS spokesman Norman Black said. He says packages set for Monday delivery are ""on planes that land tonight and that offload tonight."" UPS never has packages in motion on a Sunday, even the Sunday before Christmas. And because Saturday volume is usually light -- because delivering on Saturday is a premium service -- Black expects few problems. That is, unless the roads are still a mess and airports aren't cleaned by Monday. ""That's what we worry about,"" he said. Journalist Craig Johnson contributed to this report.","NEW: WSPA: Accident closes I-26 in N.C.; some motorists stuck so long they've run out of fuel .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Personally, I like my pizza deliveryman to do one thing: bring me my dinner. But mention this guy to a group of women, and, while most of us will think of cheesy pies with tomato sauce, a good number of us will conjure up that hilariously bad porn clich√©, the randy fellow who's always ready to accept sex in exchange for a medium sausage and mushroom. Some pornographers are marketing to women. Notwithstanding how lame the clich√© is, or how simply bad most porn is (and after ten years as a professional reviewer of the stuff, I can report that much of it is very bad), the fact is, millions of women use and enjoy ""explicit sexual imagery."" What's perhaps more surprising, given the latest scientific research, is that more of us don't. In the first three months of 2007, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, approximately one in three visitors to adult entertainment Web sites was female; during the same period, nearly 13 million American women were checking out porn online at least once each month. Theresa Flynt, vice president of marketing for Hustler video, says that women account for 56 percent of business at her company's video stores. ""And the female audience is increasing,"" she adds. ""Women are buying more porn."" (They're creating more of it, too: Female director Candida Royalle's hard-core erotic videos, made expressly for women viewers, sell at the rate of approximately 10,000 copies a month.)  Watch man fired over porn-star wife ¬ª . Meanwhile, science is finally buying into the idea that women are at least as stimulated by porn as men. In a 2006 study at McGill University, researchers monitored genital temperature changes to measure sexual arousal and found that, when shown porn clips, men and women alike began displaying arousal within 30 seconds; men reached maximum arousal in about 11 minutes, women in about 12 (a statistically negligible difference, according to the study). Even more compelling were the results of a 2004 study at Northwestern University that also assessed the effect of porn on genital arousal. Mind you, a copy of ""Buffy the Vampire Layer"" and a lubed-up feedback device isn't most girls' idea of a hot night in. But when the researchers showed gay, lesbian, and straight porn to heterosexual and homosexual women and men, they found that while the men responded more intensely to porn that mirrored their particular gender orientation, the women tended to like it all. Or at least their bodies did. Oprah.com How to feel good naked . But that's the hitch: Even when our bodies respond to what we're seeing, not every woman feels empowered to enjoy the show. For years we've been told that we won't -- or shouldn't -- be turned on by porn, end of story, sleep tight. The message has come from all sides -- from conservative Christian organizations (""Traditionally, women are far more likely to engage in wistful, romantic fantasies than crude scenes of people engaging in sexual acts,"" Kathy Gallagher, cofounder of Pure Life Ministries, has written) to the radical feminist Catharine MacKinnon (who says porn exploits and discriminates against women, and encourages rape). When everyone tells you that what you might be curious about, or even secretly like, is wrong, bad, sleazy, and shameful, you don't have to cast a line very far to land a set of inhibitions. And, indeed, many a smart, strong, sexually self-reliant girl has popped in a porn DVD and ejected it just as quickly because she saw something that offended her or made her uncomfortable. I've heard from many women that they don't like the sense of being ""out of control"" they get from watching porn -- that disconnect between how their body is feeling and what their brain is telling them is acceptable. I like to remind these women that porn won't make you do anything you didn't already want to do before you pressed Play on the ""Edward Penishands"" DVD. Oprah.com: What you still don't know about sex . I've also heard, plenty of times, that porn degrades women. That argument always makes me wonder about gay male porn, which lots of women appreciate for all its hunky hotties in flagrante. If heterosexual porn degrades women, does gay porn degrade men? What about porn made by women -- is that degrading, too? For me, the real problem with most porn is its hokeyness -- the ridiculous costumes, the awful cinematography, the ludicrous story lines, the terrible acting (not to mention how scary the close-ups sometimes look, how fake the boobs are, how some starlets really sound like injured animals...). And yet in my research and experience, the biggest roadblock for women (and men) to enjoying explicit imagery is the fear that they don't ""stack up"" to the bodies and abilities of the people onscreen. Erotic models and actresses bring up a whole range of adequacy issues, from breast size to weight, from what you look like ""down there"" to the adult acne we all periodically fight. But it's worth remembering that if porn performers looked like you and me, they'd be out of a job. They're abnormally thin, they get cosmetic surgery literally (and sometimes frightfully) from head to toe, they have makeup in places you'd be surprised makeup can be applied, they shave and wax everything imaginable, and they're weirdly flexible. They occupy a tiny end of the gene pool, and that's why they're capable of acting out fantasy sex. Oprah.com: 5 secrets of the female orgasm . Though I've sometimes felt that my job as a porn reviewer (for Web sites like FleshBot.com) is akin to being a canary in a bad-taste boys' club mine shaft, I've seen a change in quality in the past few years that I think is a direct reflection of the growing female audience. As more discriminating viewers, we've demanded better porn -- and lo, it is being made. Women are changing the market. Director Maria Beatty's gorgeously shot movies (all of which feature strictly lesbian action) look like 1920s noir films with sex, but not explicit sex -- just a lot of tease and dreamy outfits and music. And Comstock Films, maker of high-quality, documentary-style, real-couples videos, aggressively markets to women with the simple tagline ""Women love real sex."" So just what do we love about it? First, the way it lets us satisfy our very normal, very human sexual curiosity. If you're like me, you're the kind of woman who'll peep at Pam Anderson's new boob job just to see the latest installations. But it's not just what the bodies look like, it's what they look like aroused -- and what they can do. Watching people have sex can be fascinating. Porn is also a fun and versatile toy. Sure, I sometimes feel like I need Google Earth to show me where the good porn is, but once I find it, I can figure out what to do with it faster than you can click Zoom In. Explicit sexual imagery is an aphrodisiac; it sends a direct current buzzing from our brains to our groins. Like a reliable vibrator, it can be a great tool. With porn, women like me get to experiment with making adult choices and trying on new fantasy ideas, just as we might try a different brand of condom for a change. We don't have to think of rationality and animalistic urges as mutually exclusive. If we desire, we can let them play together like tennis doubles. Porn is one more pleasure to add to life's sexual buffet, one that can be enjoyed with a partner or alone.

"Who would you say is more successful: Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, or Academy Award nominee Meryl Streep? In terms of numbers of memorable -- even legendary -- screen roles, it might be difficult to say. And in terms of lasting power, they both have grown in reputation over the years. But in terms of most recent earning for the year 2012-2013, the winner is clear: Leonardo Di Caprio, age 39, earned $39 million in pay while Meryl Streep, age 64, earned only $7 million. (One caveat: Their earnings are also influenced by the box office success of their films.) Sure, that's just one year and those are just two stars. But if we look across the board, we can't help but come to the same conclusion: There's an unfair pay disparity in Hollywood. As we look forward to this year's Academy Awards show on Sunday night, it's worth taking a moment to reflect on the movie industry and what it tells us about ourselves. Research that my colleagues Irene de Pater, Brent Scott and I conducted shows that whereas young Hollywood actors and actresses make about the same in yearly earnings, that parity quickly evaporates as they age. According to our study, for actresses, their pay peaks at age 34 and then drops quickly thereafter. For actors, their pay peaks at a much later age -- 51 -- and just as importantly, does not drop after that nearly as severely as it does for actresses. We measured leading actors and actresses over many years. At age 27, actresses make an average of $3.9 million, compared to $2.6 million for actors. By the age of 51, actors make an average of $5.3 million, more than five times as much as actresses. Why is it that age ravages the earnings of actresses compared to actors? Some might blame Hollywood movie industry -- a field that is overwhelmingly male dominated. Some might argue that female actresses are more likely to take breaks from acting at the potential peak of their careers, as have Natalie Portman, Emily Blunt and Drew Barrymore. While there probably is some merit to these explanations, I think we need to look closer to home. To borrow from Pogo, I've met the enemy, and he is us. Let's face it, we're an appearance-based society and despite social progress on many issues, I don't see much evidence that our obsession with appearance has faded over time. Indeed, some have argued that the growth in online communication and social media has only exacerbated the problem. Some may feel that our obsession with beauty is a problem because it's superficial, it's hard to change, or it isn't related to true intrinsic worth (for example, a job or a mate). Yet we know that we value beauty even though it is hard to justify the value we place on it. It's more insidious than that. Our beauty obsession particularly gets applied to women (who are more likely to be judged by their appearance than men) and against older individuals (people are rated as less physically attractive as they age). We are, therefore, especially biased against older women. Tell me about it, some of you more mature women may say. It's important to remember that this isn't simply about male biases. Those exist, but so do female biases. Both men and women judge others by their appearance, and both genders are more likely to be especially biased against less attractive women and older individuals. Who's really to blame here? Is it Hollywood, or those of us who consume Hollywood culture? There is plenty of blame to go around. Hollywood, like Washington, both leads and follows society. In commenting on this disparity, Tina Fey said, in her characteristically satirical way, ""There are still great parts in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60."" Judging by the current list of Best Actor/Actress nominees, including near-octogenarian Judi Dench, Fey is correct. In fact, some might say the Best Actor/Actress nominees are on the aged side, with none in their 20s, three in their 30s (one woman, two men), four in their 40s (two men, two women), and three older (two women, one man). But the earnings don't follow, and the roles for older females are generally not as available, we found in our study. Even 83-year-old Clint Eastwood recognizes the problem, commenting, ""Roles thin out when (actresses) get to a certain age. ... It's a crime."" The first step toward social change is to recognize the problem. We've got a beauty complex that does us little good and much harm. The sooner we own up to that, the sooner we can defeat that enemy within us. As we enjoy the glamor of Hollywood at this time of year, all those beautiful people dressed to the nines should remind us: There is a lot more to life than looks. Let's confront our own biases that support this culture, and try harder to value the things that really matter.","Timothy Judge: Hollywood actors and actresses make about the same until they age .
Judge: Actresses' pay peaks at about age 34 whereas actors pay peaks around 51 .

"From the start, some passengers knew something was amiss. The flight attendant had asked them if the plane was in Houston. It was in Dallas. Then came dueling announcements from two flight attendants, the first saying the plane had mechanical problems; the second assuring passengers everything was OK. Then, alarmingly, the increasingly excited flight attendant repeatedly declared over the public address system that she was no longer responsible for the safety of the plane, and that it was going to crash. The whole time, the plane continued rolling toward the runway. The Friday morning incident ended only after fellow crew members scuffled with their colleague, and when passengers helped restrain her, according to passengers interviewed by CNN. Authorities said the flight was delayed, and that two flight attendants -- including the agitated attendant -- were taken to a Dallas hospital for treatment. Local and federal officials said they do not anticipate criminal charges, adding to speculation that she may have suffered a mental breakdown. One passenger said the flight attendant described herself as bi-polar, and said she had not taken her medication. The unusual incident put public focus on the nation's flight attendants, who more often are viewed as the people tasked with mediating disputes or dealing with others' aberrant behavior. But on Friday morning, the flight attendant in the forward cabin of American Airlines Flight 2332 -- a Dallas to Chicago flight -- became the focus of attention. ""She was acting weird from the very beginning,"" said Whitney Bessler, a Dallas resident seated in the second row. ""When we first got on the plane she was asking the passenger next to me if we were in Houston and where we were going. We kind of thought she was just making a joke."" But ""before we were even taxiing she was talking about how we needed to do more cross-checks, or we needed more testing, or go back for more security, something like that,"" Bessler said. Bessler and other passengers said the flight attendant got on the public address system, and appeared to be calling the pilots. At first, ""everybody was laughing because it sounded like she (had) accidentally turned on"" the intercom, said Laurie Grabe of Traverse City, Michigan, who witnessed the incident from her ninth-row seat. Then other flight attendants intervened, ""telling her to turn off the PA, not to talk like that,"" Grabe said. The flight attendant continued her disjointed announcements, passengers said. She said, ""OK, if you (pilots) don't hear me, then I give up. I'm not responsible if this plane crashes,"" Grabe said.  She also ""said something about opening the doors."" ""Everybody was starting to look at each other, like 'Oh, my God, What's going on here?' ""Grabe said. Said Bessler, ""Two or three times over the PA, she talks about how the planes is going to crash, how she doesn't want the plane to crash on her watch."" While some of her sentences were clear, others were just ""random gibberish,"" Bessler said. When the flight attendant said the plane was likely to crash, ""the passenger behind me ... said, 'I'm calling 9-1-1,' "" said passenger Bethany Chistakos, who was sitting in the middle of the plane. ""Because ... the plane wasn't stopping. We were already on the runway, we were about literally (to) take off."" Passengers said other flight attendants and an off-duty pilot scuffled with the flight attendant over control of the microphone, and several passengers jumped in to subdue the woman. It took about five people to restrain her, they said. They ""threw her into the first row of seats and held her down,"" Grabe said. Grabe said the flight attendant started ""screaming bloody murder,"" sounding ""demonic."" The attendant was taken to the hospital for evaluation, officials said. A second flight attendant who may have been injured while restraining the first one also was taken to the hospital. An airline spokesman acknowledged the incident but said passengers were not in danger. ""We continue to investigate the details and circumstances,"" American Airlines spokesman Ed Martelle said. ""We will ensure that the affected flight attendants receive proper care, and we commend our other crew members for their assistance in quickly getting the aircraft back to the gate so that customers could be reaccommodated,"" he said. ""Our customers were not in danger at any time."" FBI spokeswoman Lydia Maese said no federal charges were filed and the agency sees no need for further investigation.

"After some of the world's biggest corporations such as Apple and Google have come under pressure over aggressive tax avoidance strategies, now its FIFA's turn to defend its lucrative financial arrangements with 2014 World Cup hosts Brazil. The relationship of football's world governing body with Brazil is under scrutiny following the protests that have gripped the country as the South American country stages June's Confederation Cup -- a test run for the main event next year. Initially disgruntlement of the protesters centered on a 20 centavos (10 cents) rise in bus and train fares. But a violent response from the police, prompted Brazilians of all ages took to the streets. Suddenly the issue was about corruption, poor public services, increasing inflation, lack of security and whether the money being spent on the World Cup might be better invested elsewhere. With a subtext of the rich lining their pockets, while the poor pay more to use crumbling public services, the Brazilian government was left scrambling to deal with what some have dubbed the ""Tropical Spring."" FIFA president Sepp Blatter, for one, was askance at the protests. ""I can understand that people are not happy, but they should not use football to make their demands heard,"" Blatter told Brazil's Globo TV. Tax exemptions . While FIFA argues that Brazil, as well as Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022, will gain benefits from infrastructure development and tourism as well as the kudos of staging a global sporting event, the World Cup is key for the world governing body -- the event is its major source of revenue. ""The exact number I do not know but around $4 billion,"" said FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke earlier in June, referring to what the 2014 World Cup will generate financially for the Swiss-based organization. However, that is a conservative estimate with consultants suggesting the amount could reach $5 billion. ""Of course it's not all profit, it is commercial revenue related to the cycle of not just the World Cup, but the cycle between the 2010 Cup and 2014,"" added Valcke. Three years ago the World Cup in South Africa raised $3.6 billion, incurring expenditures of $1.298 billion. For its latest results, FIFA reported a profit of $89 million for 2012, with reserves of $1.378 billion. The organization had a revenue of $1.166 billion last year and spending of $1.077 billion. As a not-for-profit association in Swiss law, FIFA pays no tax on commercial income from the World Cup. But some critics question whether the relationship between FIFA and its World Cup hosts is mutually beneficial, notably with regard to the lucrative tax exemptions World Cup organizers are prepared to offer for the right to stage the biggest single-event sporting competition in the world. According to Brazil's Internal Revenue Service the tax exemptions will cost $248.7 million, though other reports estimate the figure could be as twice as high for the period between 2011 and 2015. The International Olympic Committee will receive similar exemptions when the South American country hosts the Olympics in 2016. Proponents argue hosting the World Cup brings billions more dollars into the Brazilian economy, but $250 million buys a lot of bus tickets. Brazil in ""FIFA's hands"" Ex-Brazilian star Romario -- now a Brazilian politician --  is one that argues that the money spent on building stadiums would be better spent on constructing houses and schools. ""FIFA will make a profit of four billion reais ($1.8 billion) which should provide one billion ($450 million) in tax, but they will not pay anything,"" Romario said in a video posted on the websites of several Brazilian newspapers. ""They come, set up the circus, they don't spend anything and they take everything with them. ""The real president of our country is FIFA,"" added Romario. ""FIFA comes to our country and sets up a state within a state."" Another critic -- academic and journalist Christopher Gaffney, who lives in Rio -- believes that FIFA's much vaunted ""Fair Play"" slogan should not just apply to on-field behavior. ""FIFA should be obliged to follow the pre-existing tax laws in the host countries that apply to international sports non-governmental organizations and their corporate partners,"" said Gaffney. ""We saw a response in the lead up to London 2012 that the British were revolted that the International Olympic Committee's partners were not going to pay taxes. ""A boycott ensued and the companies agreed to pay taxes on their Olympic related profits. ""There are, of course, always government subsidies to attract businesses, but legislative elements like the General Law of the World Cup in Brazil go far beyond this and effectively redirect public money into Swiss bank accounts."" That analysis drew a swift response from football's world governing body. ""FIFA obtains none of its revenue from public funds of the host country,"" a FIFA spokesman told CNN. ""The host country provide the general infrastructure for the event, which remains as a legacy in the country such as transportation, IT, upgrades on airports. ""Therefore, it is not true that money is generated in the host country for FIFA and that it will go then to accounts in Switzerland."" But the exemptions FIFA insist upon, has surprised one leading European taxation expert, Professor of European Tax Law Han Kogels, who is based in Rotterdam. In bidding for the 2018 World Cup, Russia was up against three other bidders -- England, Netherlands-Belgium and Spain-Portugal. ""In that bid book model of the FIFA as commercial organization, it claimed a privilege of 100% tax freedom (no corporate tax, no income tax, no VAT, no excise duties, no local tax, not any other taxes), irrespective of regular national tax law, European tax law and international tax law,"" said Kogels after examining the Netherlands part of the bid. ""I was (and still am) not aware of any other international commercial sport event being subsidized through full tax exemption at the cost of (other) taxpayers, and did not see any justification for such unequal treatment of FIFA."" Economic benefits . FIFA insisted that tax exemptions needed to be viewed in relation to the overall economic benefits that next year's World Cup potentially might bring Brazil. The world governing body quoted a study by Ernst & Young Terco that estimated that the event would inject R$ 112.8 billion ($50 billion) into the Brazilian economy by 2014, with R$ 28 billion (12.4 billion) spent on infrastructure, generating R$ 63.5 billion ($28 billion) in income for the population. ""It is important to note that tax exemptions are only related to certain areas of the organization, in particular for temporary use of goods and services during the event,"" FIFA told CNN. ""Examples include IT equipment for broadcasters as well as other material mainly broadcasters and participating teams bring with them, the cars used for the official transport, uniforms for volunteers. ""Amongst others the prize money of the FIFA World Cup is taxable in Brazil."" ""Overall, according to the Ernst & Young Terco study it is estimated that the host country will obtain an additional tax revenue of R$ 18.1 billion ($8 billion). ""It should be noted that FIFA also bears the costs related to hosting and staging of the FIFA World Cup, including and not limited to the costs of the Local Organising Committee. This means over $1.3 billion in costs for FIFA."" Cynicism . However, in much the same way that the Group of Eight economies attempted to bring coherence to the issue of closing global tax loopholes earlier this month, Professor Simon Chadwick called on governments and sporting organizations to adopt a more systematic approach to tax. ""One of the problems in Brazil, Britain and, indeed, in many countries across the world is that there is no coherent strategy or policy in place regarding taxation and sport,"" said Chadwick. ""For example, players in this year's Champions League final at Wembley were given exemption from paying tax on revenues earned from the game. ""Whereas in 2015, players in the rugby union World Cup final will not be given the same  exemption. Such a lack of strategy, clarity, consistency and openness creates a climate in which confusion, contradiction and cynicism begin to develop."" Given the scale of the protests in Brazil, does the South American country want to renegotiate the tax exemptions? ""Holding a FIFA World Cup involves agreements that are signed between the organization and the host country in order to receive the event.,"" said the Brazil Finance Ministry. ""The FIFA World Cup has always been seen by Brazil as a major opportunity to spur investments in infrastructure and services and to modernize football management in Brazil.""","Questions raised over what Brazil really gets out of 2014 World Cup .
Should money be spent on football stadiums or health and education?

"Artists tend to occupy the front lines against repression. So it comes as no surprise that the occupation of Egypt's Ministry of Culture protesting the ""Brotherhoodization"" of the ministry under the leadership of Alaa Abdel-Aziz has helped drive the planned massive demonstrations against Mohamed Morsy on Sunday. Once again, the U.S. government appears to be on the fence in Egypt, with Ambassador Anne Patterson expressing skepticism about ""street action"" that could result in violent protests. ""People realize that this is about the identity of Egypt,"" said Hazem Azmy, a scholar active in the Culture of Ministry occupation. With Ultras (militant soccer fans) standing by to protect the growing crowds, nightly performances are held outside the ministry, ranging from ballet to an impromptu concert by pop star Ahmed Saad that even had the police dancing. Artists of Cairo's famed Opera House -- on strike since Abdel-Aziz fired its head, Enas Abdel-Dayem -- have been performing, too. Their repertoire? Excerpts from ""Zorba the Greek,"" including scenes of defiance. Expressing a sentiment increasingly heard in taxis and on the streets of Cairo, the actress Moataza said, ""Our protest at the Ministry of Culture is just part and parcel of the struggle of the Egyptians against the colonization of the Muslim Brotherhood."" The Brotherhood is as an international organization with loyalty to its members, not to Egypt. She speaks for many, including people who voted for Morsy in the last election. However, Patterson, the U.S. ambassador, recently equated protests with ""violence on the streets"" and urged Egyptians to ""get organized ... to join or start a political party that reflects your values and aspirations."" What revolution has ever succeeded in the short term (and 2¬Ω years is a short term) without taking to the streets? Yes, Egyptians need to become better organized politically, but at this early tumultuous stage, that is a long-term goal. Patterson's condescending comments ignore history, as well as the specific situation in Egypt. For example, recently a court sentenced employees of nongovernmental organizations to jail, effectively curtailed activities of these groups that provide advice and support for the kind of political activities for which the ambassador advocated. Patterson's dismissal of ""street action"" as likely only to ""add new names to the lists of martyrs"" not only insults the millions of Egyptians who have marched in the streets to change their country for the better, but it also stands at odds with President Barack Obama's words of praise for the Egyptian revolution of 2011: ""We stand for universal values, including the rights of the Egyptian people to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech. ..."" What was the Egyptian revolution if not ""street action""? It was left to another U.S. ""ambassador"" to lend support to Egyptians. On June 21, Jon Stewart appeared on Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef's popular show, ""Al Bernameg,"" and told the audience: ""Bassem is showing that satire ... can carve out a space in a country for people to express themselves. Because that is all democracy is ... the ability to express yourself and be heard."" Ironically, in targeting cultural leaders, including Youssef, the Brotherhood has helped unify its opposition. For the artists are the canaries in the coal mine, who lead the way in questioning authority and in holding up a mirror to society. As fate would have it, the sit-ins at the Ministry of Culture and the nightly performances of dance, music and street theater coincided with the growth of the grass-roots Tamarrod movement, which says it has collected more than 15 million signatures in order to force Morsy to call for early elections. Just as with the 2011 revolution, this ""second revolution"" began with youth activists, many of them artists, and now has spread like wildfire through the population. Stories abound of traffic stopping in Cairo to accommodate Tamarrod volunteers weaving through cars to gather signatures, often to spontaneous applause. Reflecting the mood of revolution in the air, Youssef recently hosted an Arabic version of ""Les Miserables"" on his show. As the studio audience joined the singing group Fabrika in a rousing finale of ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" to inspire Egyptians with ""the music of the people who will not be slaves again,"" artists and activists outside continued their vigil for freedom of expression at the Ministry of Culture. No one knows what will happen Sunday. Feelings of excitement mix with anxiety about the potential for violence, which the recent thug attack on protesters in Alexandria forebodes. But the energy of the young activists behind Tamarrod, the passion of the artists inside and outside the Ministry of Culture, and the unified opposition to Morsy's rule show that the Egyptian revolution is far from over. ""Street action"" is the kernel of revolution.","Cynthia Schneider: Egyptians plan Sunday protest against President Mohamed Morsy .

"With a quick glance at Dr. Craig Spencer's work history, it is apparent he has an affinity for helping those in need. His work has taken him from hospital emergency rooms in New York to the rural clinics in Africa, where he has worked with limited resources to improve medical care. And now that work in Guinea, where he reportedly was helping treat Ebola patients, has put him at risk. Spencer, 33, tested positive for Ebola on Thursday, a law enforcement official briefed on the matter told CNN. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. While authorities have not publicly identified Spencer, they confirmed earlier Thursday that a Doctors Without Borders physician who recently returned to New York from West Africa exhibited symptoms of Ebola and was undergoing testing. ""Off to Guinea with Doctor Without Borders,"" Spencer wrote on his Facebook page in mid-September. ""Please support organizations that are sending support or personnel to West Africa, and help combat one of the worst public health and humanitarian disasters in recent history."" He also posted a picture of himself wearing protective gear. His last post was on October 16, and it was a check-in from 9Hotel Central in Brussels, Belgium. The Facebook page appeared to have been taken down Thursday afternoon. According to a statement released by Doctors Without Borders, the physician -- who it did not identify -- engaged in ""regular health monitoring."" The doctor checked his temperature twice a day since departing Guinea, said Dr. Mary Bassett, the commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . The doctor showed his ""first actual symptoms"" on Thursday morning, she said. Those symptoms included a high fever. He was then taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for testing. Bassett did not identify the doctor. A law enforcement official previously told CNN the doctor began showing symptoms Wednesday night. The doctor's fiancee and two close friends have been quarantined as a precaution, Bassett said. Spencer, according to his social media posts, claims Detroit as his hometown. He graduated from Wayne State University School of Medicine in 2008, and completed his residency at New York Hospital Queens, according a listing on the New York -- Presbyterian Hospital website. Spencer is board certified in emergency medicine. ""The physician is a dedicated humanitarian on the staff of New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center who went to an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population,"" the hospital said in a statement, without directly identifying Spencer. ""He is a committed and responsible physician who always puts his patients first. He has not been to work at our hospital and has not seen any patients at our hospital since his return from overseas. Our thoughts are with him, and we wish him all the best at this time."" Spencer began work on a number of projects in Africa in recent years, including in Rwanda where he worked to help develop an emergency care teaching curriculum. He later worked in southern Burundi on an infant mortality survey and, more recently, he worked on a neurocysticercosis outbreak investigation -- an examination of seizures and epilepsy -- in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to his professional profile on LinkedIn, he claims fluency in Chinese, French, Spanish and Greek. He attended Henan University in China from 2006 to 2007, where he studied Chinese language and literature, according to his profile.","Dr. Craig Spencer showed first symptoms on Thursday, an official says .

"(CNN) -- In ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the threat from villainous Lord Voldemort is ignored until it's almost too late. ""Harry and his friends start Dumbledore's army to bring awareness to this,"" said iReporter Andrew Slack. ""Meanwhile, our world ignores AIDS, Darfur and global warming."" Harry Potter Alliance members attend a midnight screening in Burlington, Massachusetts. Some Potter fans, under the leadership of Slack, have come together to bring the spirit of ""Dumbledore's army"" to life. Slack is the executive director of the Harry Potter Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging Potter fans in social activism. Slack's group has taken on many issues over the past few years. ""Because we're basing it on a modern myth, you can point to many issues at once,"" he said. In the ""Potter"" books, ""implications toward public policy are profound,"" Slack said. Slack, a former sketch comedian with an interest in building social movements, came up with the idea in 2005 after reading Potter books to children at a Boys and Girls Club, something he said transformed him. ""I saw that the books weren't just empowering personally,"" he said. ""I think the books speak to something that is very unique, because [""Potter"" author] J.K. Rowling has been able to express a story about the importance of love."" Slack founded the group with his friends Paul and Joe DeGeorge, members of a ""wizard rock"" band called ""Harry and the Potters,"" as well as comedian Seth Reibstein and music therapist Sarah Newberry. Slack sees parallels between the magic in the ""Potter"" books and expanding one's mind to come up with solutions in a creative way. One of his mottos is ""Don't ignore the magic of being alive."" One of the group's projects has been to gather thousands of signatures for petitions in protest of the war in Darfur. The alliance also helped hundreds to register to vote last year, according to Slack. Earlier this year, the Harry Potter Alliance conducted a book drive for children around the world, an effort led by ""Potter"" actress Evanna Lynch. Slack said they raised over 13,000 books, 4,000 of which went to youths in Rwanda who were very young at the time of the Rwandan genocide. Slack also sees parallels between Voldemort and world leaders who have supported genocidal policies. ""Potter"" author J.K. Rowling has many times compared Voldemort to Adolf Hitler. On the other hand, Slack compares Potter's mentor Dumbledore to Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Lennon. This has led to the group's ""What Would Dumbledore Do?"" campaign. The campaign takes Dumbledore's ethics and beliefs and translates them to the real world. For the midnight screenings of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" members were encouraged to wear buttons mentioning lessons that Dumbledore taught them. When iReporters were offered the opportunity to ask a question of President Obama, Slack knew exactly what he wanted to ask about: Darfur. Slack thinks Obama's approach so far is ""more than a disappointment. ...There's a great deal of hope for Darfur, if President Obama can move on that."" Rowling herself has praised the Harry Potter Alliance, one of Slack's proudest moments. ""It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character,"" she told Time magazine in 2007. ""What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause."" Rowling has also written personally to Slack about his efforts. Science fiction and fantasy aficionados have translated their fandom into real-world action for years. Recent examples: ""Star Wars"" fans put on a charity auction to benefit victims of the brushfires in Australia, and comic book fans such as ""Crimson Fist"" donned superhero costumes to help the needy. Christopher ""b!x"" Frakonis came up with the idea of screening the sci-fi movie ""Serenity"" for charity as a way of keeping it on the big screen in 2006. This year, 52 such ""Can't Stop the Serenity"" screenings are taking place around the world for charities such as the human rights organization Equality Now!, in response to a challenge by the film's director Joss Whedon. Members of the Harry Potter Alliance, 4,500 of whom make up the most hardcore group, are inspired by what it has done. ""I know I would have loved to have had a group like this when I was a child or teenager, to support me and show that anything is possible if you put your mind to it,"" said 29-year-old Amanda Bolton, from Calgary, Alberta. Bolton first learned about the group when it was mentioned on a fan podcast. She was intrigued by the similarities between the plot of the books and its application to real life as well. In the books, ""muggle-borns and other intelligent nonhumans are discriminated against, treated like scum and forbidden from having equal rights,"" she said, adding that love was the main weapon used against the forces of evil. Like Slack, Bolton condemns the ""Muggle mindset,"" what members call an ignorance of or refusal to act on the important issues facing the world. Some bloggers have criticized the group for taking their fandom too far or using young fans' love of Harry Potter to promote an agenda. Slack denies that he has a partisan agenda. ""I sort of took it as a compliment,"" he explained. At the same time, he hopes that at least some of their causes, such as promoting literacy, are things that all can agree on. Alliance member Bobby Lang says that some within the group have occasionally raised questions about some of their projects. ""There have been some interesting debates over whether or not Dumbledore would be an activist,"" he said, mentioning that some see Dumbledore as ""teaching through living."" Lang adds that such debates usually don't get too heated, since ""we're all Harry Potter fans, we all have that in common."" Noth Lang and Bolton say they are more knowledgeable about world affairs because of the organization's connection to Harry Potter than they would be otherwise. ""There are issues I didn't know much about or hadn't thought about too deeply that I'm now involved in, like Darfur,"" Bolton said. ""It has introduced me to new issues and new ideas.""","""Harry Potter"" fans have formed the ""Harry Potter Alliance"" organization .

"The 43 Mexican students who disappeared in southern Mexico in September were abducted by police on order of a local mayor, and are believed to have been turned over to a gang that killed them and burned their bodies before throwing some remains in a river, the nation's attorney general said Friday. This is the conclusion that investigators have reached, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said, though he cautioned that it cannot be known with certainty until DNA tests confirm the identities. This will be a challenge, he said, as the badly burned fragments make it difficult to extract DNA. ""I have to identify, to do everything in my power, to identify, to know if these were the students,"" Murillo said. Parents of the college students reacted immediately, some saying the evidence is inconclusive and insisting that their children are alive. ""We are not going to believe anything until the experts tell us: You know what? It is them,"" Mario Cesar Gonzalez, the father of one of the students, told CNN en Espa√±ol. Another parent, Isrrael Galindo, said the government is getting ahead of itself in an attempt to get protests over the disappearance of the students to stop and the public to stop demanding answers. ""The government is trying to resolve things its way so that to rid itself of this great problem it is facing,"" Galindo, who lives in California but whose wife and children are in Mexico, told CNN en Espa√±ol. ""My son is alive. My son is alive. My son is alive,"" he repeated. The parents have been highly critical of President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto for his administration's handling of the investigation. A cell phone video from a closed-door meeting with the President, released on YouTube, shows family members accusing Pe√±a Nieto of being out of touch with who the students are. One family member on the recording suggests the President should resign if he can't deliver answers. Describing the federal investigation as one of the most complex in recent times, Murillo outlined what he said befell the students from a rural teacher's college in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero state. Police linked to disappearance . The victims were men mostly in their 20s studying to become teachers at a college in rural Ayotzinapa. On September 26, they traveled on buses and vans to nearby Iguala for a protest about lack of funding for their school. They haven't been seen or heard from since. Three men arrested in connection with the disappearance of the students admitted to having killed a large number of people believed to be the students, Murillo said. Murillo said police officers handed the victims to the three men, who he said belong to the Guerreros Unidos gang. Authorities have arrested Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca, called the ""probable mastermind"" in the mass abduction, and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda. They were captured while hiding out in Mexico City earlier this week. The school the missing students belong to has a history that dates back more than 80 years and is known as a bastion of the Mexican left. Its students are known for their activism. Officials have said that when the mayor and his wife learned the students' protest would disrupt one of his events, the mayor ordered then-Iguala police Chief Felipe Flores Velasquez to stop the demonstration. The former police chief remains a fugitive. Slain Mexican student's friends, family demand justice . Shortly after Murillo announced the latest in the investigation, President Pe√±a Nieto said the findings ""outrage and offend all of Mexican society."" ""With firm determination, the government will continue the efforts for a full accounting of the incident,"" Pe√±a Nieto said. ""The capture of those who ordered it isn't enough; we will arrest everyone who participated in these abominable crimes."" So far, 74 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of the students, the government said. Mexican governor steps aside after student kidnappings . Officials: Men burned at dump . Murillo on Friday repeated the claim that the order to abduct the students came from the mayor. The police confronted the students twice on their journey, killing three in one confrontation, and forcibly taking all of them to a police station the second time, the attorney general said. The students were then moved to a location where they were handed over to members of the Guerreros Unidos gang, he said. The gang members transported the students in various trucks to a garbage dump, Murillo said. Some were dead already, and those who were alive were questioned by gang members about their alleged involvement with other gangs, Murillo said. There is no evidence to show that the students were involved with gangs, he said. The attorney general identified the three gang members who confessed as Patricio Reyes Landa, Jhonatan Osorio Gomez and Agustin Garcia Reyes. The suspects told police they don't remember exactly how many people they killed, but they were told by their leaders that there were more than 40, Murillo said. The abducted men were then burned at the dump in a fire that was kept alive for at least 14 hours by adding diesel fuel, tires and debris, the attorney general said. The next day, the gang members were ordered to further break up the remains and place them in black garbage bags that were tossed into the San Juan River, Murillo said. Scuba divers searched the river and found pieces of the bags and remains. One bag was found intact, with human remains inside, the attorney general said. ""I know the huge pain this information gives the families, a pain that we all share in solidarity,"" Murillo said. The Iguala incident has sparked protests all across Mexico, some of them violent. There have been multiple acts of vandalism in Guerrero state. Protesters have blocked roads and tollbooths in cities like Chilpancingo, the capital. They have also blocked access to shopping malls in the beach resort of Acapulco. The protests spread to the capital, where tens of thousands marched this week demanding that the missing students be found alive. The governor of Guerrero state -- criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions -- has taken a leave of absence.","Mexico's attorney general provides new details on the missing students .

"Fatah, the Palestinian political party, said Sunday it will scrap a series of events to commemorate the death 10 years ago of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The decision comes two days after a series of bombings at the homes of Fatah leaders and highlights rising tensions between the rival political factions, despite their April agreement on a unity government. In a statement Sunday announcing the decision to call off the Arafat events -- which were set to begin this week -- Fatah official Izam al-Ahmad cited bomb attacks which he blamed on Hamas. A number of explosions rocked homes owned by Fatah figures on Friday, according to the Palestinian Authority. No injuries were reported. The explosions took place as Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah was preparing to visit Gaza. The trip has been postponed indefinitely, the Palestinian Authority said. Hamas denounced the attacks, according to the Facebook page of spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. But the Fatah spokesman nevertheless accused Hamas of ""cheap lies"" and said that Fatah officials had ""expected a united government to cater to the interests of our nation."" In April, Hamas and Fatah announced an agreement to form a unity government, a development that Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti hailed as the ""end to the division between the Palestinian people."" The comity was not long-lasting, however. In September, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas blasted Hamas, claiming it was running a ""shadow government"" in Gaza and rendering the unity government ""helpless."" It also follows the conflict between Hamas and Israel in July and August, in which more than 2,100 Palestinians died. And the enmity isn't just one-way: Hamas-hired government workers in Gaza have accused the Palestinian Authority -- in which Fatah is a dominant player -- of failing to pay them.","Fatah scraps events commemorating Yasser Arafat's death in 2004 .

"A change in corporate record-keeping in Hong Kong has turned into a flashpoint for the debate about freedom of information in the Chinese territory. Many in the city take pride in what they say is a transparent and open financial system, in contrast to the situation across the border in Mainland China. Now Hong Kong's government has proposed limiting the information that is available to the public about corporate directors ""to enhance protection of the privacy of personal information."" The plan would remove directors' residential address and their full Hong Kong identification numbers from the Company Registry. The information is regularly used by both investigative journalists and financial firms to help trace who is running a Hong Kong-registered company. A petition declaring ""Secrecy Breeds Corruption"" appeared in the pages of five Hong Kong newspapers Monday morning, followed by the signatures of more than 1,700 journalists, educators and students, who strongly oppose the change. Information from the database was used in two high-profile stories last year that looked into the wealth of the families of China's ruling elite, which appeared in The New York Times and Bloomberg News. A number of stories on property scandals within Hong Kong also relied on information from the database. The petition declared the change an ""infringement of the public interest,"" which would have a ""great impact on professional and citizen journalists' right to conduct investigative reporting."" Members of the business community and investors have also voiced concerns about the proposed change. David Webb, a well-known investor activist and editor of Webb-Site.com, says the change would make it harder for investment banks and IPO sponsors to determine a person's real assets. ""It basically undermines our reputation for free markets, transparency and the rule of law,"" Webb said. Issues like this one often flame fears in Hong Kong about the interference of the Chinese government in the city's affairs. Hong Kong, a former British colony, is part of China but maintains freedom of the press, speech and no Internet controls. Residents are often fiercely vocal in response to anything they see as infringement of these rights.","Hong Kong government proposes limiting corporate information available to public .

"Prosecutors are seeking additional charges against the Cleveland man accused of keeping three women captive in his home for a decade, they told a judge. At a eight-minute hearing Wednesday, Ariel Castro, 52, kept his head down, often closing his eyes and speaking only to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to the judge's questions. Prosecutor Timothy McGinty told Cuyahoga County Judge Michael Russo there is a possibility of more charges. ""We are presenting additional evidence to the grand jury next week and the week after. We expect we are going to request further indictments,"" he said. Castro faces 329 counts, including one count of aggravated murder for allegedly causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy. Castro's lawyers have filed a speedy-trial motion, which would mean the case would have to be tried by August 4. However, that deadline could change if Castro's attorneys change course and ask for more time to prepare for the case. Russo set the next pretrial hearing for June 26 and told the prosecution and defense that any plea deal would need to be in writing. The defense has said in the past that it would be open to a plea deal if the death penalty was taken off the table. This week, Castro entered a not guilty plea to all charges, including 139 counts of rape and 177 counts of kidnapping Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus. Castro fathered a daughter with Berry, according to authorities. Police have alleged Knight was impregnated by Castro five times, but he would punch her in the stomach, resulting in miscarriages and termination of all the pregnancies. Authorities said last week they are conducting DNA tests on evidence to determine if additional victims were inside Castro's Cleveland home, and the state attorney general's office says the crime lab is reviewing additional evidence in the case. Since the case began, investigators have been looking for evidence of aborted fetuses and evidence of any other girls or women who may have been kidnapped or held captive in the house.","Prosecutors say they are seeking more charges against Ariel Castro .

"Euphoria reigned in many parts of Barcelona and the surrounding region of Catalonia on Monday, a day after 1.6 million people there cast symbolic votes to secede from Spain. But the sentiment for Catalan independence was not shared in Madrid, where there was skepticism, as Spain's Justice Minister called the straw vote a ""farce"" without any democratic validity. Even after more than 2 million Catalans voted on Sunday, defying two decisions by Spain's highest court that it was illegal to cast a ballot on independence, the two entrenched sides -- the Catalan government in Spain's second largest city of Barcelona and the Spanish government in the capital, Madrid -- seemed no closer to solving the thorny issue. Catalan secessionists have staged massive street demonstrations in recent years, and they picked up more steam in September around Scotland's referendum on independence. Although Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom, many Catalans insisted Madrid should let them vote, too, as London had done for Scotland. But the Spanish government insists that the constitution does not permit just one of Spain's 17 regions, such as Catalonia, to unilaterally secede. None of that mattered on Sunday to many in Catalonia, in northeast Spain, where the regional government, backed by 40,000 volunteers instead of regular election officials, staged the symbolic vote. The result was heavily in favor of independence, but analysts said many who opposed secession simply didn't bother to vote, since it was non-binding. Turnout was about 32%, far lower than the nearly 70% who voted in regional, binding, parliamentary elections two years ago. Catalonia represents about 20% of Spain's economy and already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. The region also has a long list of grievances with Madrid, including over taxation. The Catalan president, Artur Mas, on Sunday called on Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to negotiate a ""definitive"" referendum. But Rajoy said earlier in the weekend that he could only talk within the bounds of the Spanish constitution and law. With the two leaders seemingly at loggerheads, some analysts predicted the real talks would be about more home rule for Catalonia,. Others said the crisis could mean early regional elections in Catalonia, where polls indicate that a party even more devoted to secession than the one currently in power would win.","Over 2 million Catalans voted on Sunday, defying decisions by Spain's highest court .

"UK spy chief Robert Hannigan called on big U.S. tech companies to do more to help governments combat terrorism Tuesday, as he described social media as ""a terrorist's command-and-control network of choice."" In an opinion piece written for Britain's Financial Times newspaper, Hannigan, the new director of UK government eavesdropping agency GCHQ, said there must be greater cooperation from the private sector to tackle the threat. His comments play into the continuing debate over the conflict between people's right to privacy online and governments' need to ensure national security, intensified by the revelations last year of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden over mass government surveillance programs. In a rare public statement, Hannigan accused U.S. tech companies of being in denial over terrorists' use of the Internet. ""They are exploiting the power of the web to create a jihadi threat with near-global reach. The challenge to governments and their intelligence agencies is huge -- and it can only be met with greater co-operation from technology companies,"" he said. The extremists use such platforms as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to reach their target audience in a language they understand, Hannigan said. Their methods include making use of popular hashtags for other stories in the news, such as Ebola or the World Cup, to disseminate their message, he said. They create slick videos and have learned that showing the full extent of their brutality turns people off, he said -- hence their posting of videos of beheadings that stop short of showing the moment of death. Information requests . Google, WhatsApp, Facebook and Microsoft have not yet responded to a CNN request for comment on the spy chief's call for more cooperation. A public policy communications officer for Twitter, Nu Wexler, said the company was not able to break out how many of the requests for information made to it by governments relate to terrorism, but he said Twitter is suing the U.S. government for the ability to do so. In the six months that ended on June 30, Twitter received 78 account information requests from the UK government, its Transparency Report shows. Some information was produced in 46% of those cases. Over the same period, 61% of all worldwide requests for account information received originated from the United States, with 1,257 requests in total. Some information was produced in nearly three-quarters of cases. 'Noisy channel' for radicalization . Hannigan, who took the reins as GCHQ director on Monday, said that ISIS militants show an alarming ease with new media that presents a new challenge for authorities. ""Terrorists have long made use of the internet. But ISIS's approach is different in two important areas,"" he said. ""Where al-Qaeda and its affiliates saw the internet as a place to disseminate material anonymously or meet in 'dark spaces,'  ISIS has embraced the web as a noisy channel in which to promote itself, intimidate people, and radicalise new recruits."" If Britain's intelligence and security agencies are to combat this effort, private sector firms -- including the largest U.S. technology companies that dominate the Web -- must do more to facilitate lawful investigations, he said. ""I understand why they have an uneasy relationship with governments. They aspire to be neutral conduits of data and to sit outside or above politics,"" he said. But, he said, ""However much they may dislike it, they have become the command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals, who find their services as transformational as the rest of us."" The new generation of extremists is also helped by the additional encryption measures now widely available to users of the Internet and smartphones, Hannigan said. ""These are supplemented by freely available programs and apps adding extra layers of security, many of them proudly advertising that they are 'Snowden approved,' "" he wrote. ""There is no doubt that young foreign fighters have learnt and benefited from the leaks of the past two years."" Recent efforts by Google and Apple to encrypt their latest smartphones in ways that would prevent law enforcement from accessing certain private data have alarmed the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI Director James Comey told reporters in recent weeks that he was ""very concerned"" that the companies were ""marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves above the law."" 'Lost insight' A former top U.S. intelligence official also told CNN last month that ripping the cover off secret U.S. surveillance programs had pushed foreign terrorists underground and out of intelligence services' reach. ""We've lost collection against some individuals, people that we were concerned about we are no longer collecting their communications,"" said Matt Olsen, who until September led the National Counterterrorism Center. ""We lost insight into what they were doing."" Snowden, whose massive leaks on intelligence-gathering programs resulted in espionage charges from the U.S. government, has been living in Russia for the past year. In an interview in May, he said he had no choice other than leaking the highly classified information, since he believed the Constitution was being violated.","New chief of UK spying agency says big tech firms must cooperate in fight against terror .

"A super PAC affiliated with the conservative Koch brothers is spending more than $1 million each in Arkansas and Iowa on a second round of television commercials that feature U.S. veterans and a mother critical of Democratic Senate candidates running in those two states, CNN has learned. The Freedom Partners Action Fund has already dedicated $1 million for an ad in Iowa and nearly $1.2 million for a commercial in Arkansas. And the GOP-friendly group plans to drop an additional $2 million in each of those states in the next six weeks to try to help the Republican Senate nominees win in November. In all, the Koch-affiliated super PAC plans to spend about $4 million in each state on TV ads, James Davis, spokesman for Freedom Partners Action Fund, told CNN. Arkansas and Iowa are two critical contests that will help determine which party controls the Senate in 2015. The latest Freedom Partners Action Fund commercial in Arkansas features six U.S. veterans speaking directly to the camera about their displeasure with Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor. Specifically, the veterans accuse Pryor of failing to help prevent medical negligence at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Freedom Partners Action Fund cites Pryor's membership on a committee to make this claim. Pryor is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, which oversees funding for the agency. Seven Democrats and six Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, sit on this subcommittee. In addition, there is a stand-alone full committee, Veterans' Affairs, that oversees the VA. Democrats' favorite bogeymen fight back . And in an attempt to tie Pryor to President Barack Obama, another veteran says in the commercial that the senator ""votes with Barack Obama 90% of the time."" A recent CNN/ORC Poll shows that Obama's approval rating is 33% in Arkansas. Rep. Tom Cotton, the GOP Senate nominee, is not mentioned in the ad. In Iowa, Freedom Partners Action Fund relies on ""Christina,"" a mom from Urbandale, to criticize Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic nominee, as a poor example for her children to look up to as a role model. ""Christina"" highlights comments Braley made earlier this year that she says were disparaging to farmers, as well as missed votes as a House member. Instead, ""Christina"" touts GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst, a member of the Iowa National Guard, as a person for her children to emulate. The Iowa commercial makes no reference to Obama, whose approval rating is 37% in the state, according to the latest CNN/ORC Poll. The Arkansas and Iowa ads came as the Democratic-aligned political group American Bridge launched two online ads Wednesday criticizing Charles and David Koch for using their fortune to try to influence the midterm elections.

"While reporting in Eastern Libya in November 2011, I came across a black flag fluttering atop Benghazi's courthouse. The flag was imprinted with a yellow moon and the Islamic declaration of belief, ""There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God,"" a design used by some extremist groups, namely al-Qaeda, to represent Islamic culture in the status of war (i.e. Jihad). I quickly took some photographs and sent the images to VICE. An article was posted later that day and drew a fiery response from some corners of the media world, questioning my findings and accusing me of doctoring the photos to serve a hidden agenda. To prove what I'd seen, I paired up with Ray Pagnucco, an American cameraman, and together we began our investigation into extremism in post-Gadhafi LIbya. It would be unfair, however, to claim that the black flag had been the only sign that radical figures were angling for a seat of power in the new Libya. At the capitol, a high-ranking member of the now-defunct Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, Abdul Hakim Belhadj, had been appointed the leader of the Tripoli Military Council. In the early days of the Iraq War, the LIFG had declared their support for al Qaeda and had been reported to share forces with the group for several years. Belhadj, after a stint in the U.S.'s rendition program and Gadhafi's Abu Salim prison, now sits in a miniature throne of power within the National Transitional Council and is running as leader of his own political party in the upcoming elections. See the rest of Waiting for al Qaeda at VICE.COM. Over in Eastern Libya, where we traveled to meet a group of weapons makers and the Muslim cleric Abdul Hakim al-Hasadi, there are concerns that large numbers of the weapons used in the revolution are now being sold to extremist groups like the Tuareg fighters of Mali and al Qaeda in Somalia. And since Eastern Libya is traditionally known as the more radical region of the country, it's feared that powerful religious leaders like Mr. al-Hasadi are encouraging fundamentalist religious groups to take root in these sparsely regulated lands. Our dealings with many of these characters didn't conjure up a nest of card-carrying al Qaeda operatives, but they did confirm that Libya has made itself very vulnerable by not filling the power vacuum created by Gadhafi's ouster. If their transitional government doesn't become a functioning government soon, Libya may indeed be waiting for al Qaeda.","After Gadhafi's ouster, VICE correspondent spots black flag of al-Qaeda in Benghazi .

"(CNN) -- With more than 2,400 Ebola deaths in Liberia alone, the killer virus may not sound like the most obvious subject to write a song about. But health officials are using all means at their disposal to educate Liberians on how to contain the spread of the disease. The United Nations Children's Fund -- UNICEF -- has worked with local musicians to produce a song ""Ebola is Real,"" which urges Liberians to take measures against the disease, such as washing their hands. The chorus runs: ""Ebola is real, it's time to protect yourself, Ebola is real, protect your family, Ebola is real, protect your community."" Near the song's end, the musicians say Ebola is a severe disease that spreads fast. While it can't be cured, they explain, the symptoms of the virus can be treated and explain that the only way of catching Ebola is through direct contact with bodily fluids such as blood, saliva and sweat. ""For our traditional people, when somebody die, don't touch the body with your bare hand -- you can call a health worker closer to you to help you to bury the body but wearing protective clothes and gloves,"" the song continues, saying the message is from Liberia's Ministry of Health and partners. UNICEF spokesman Christophe Boulierac said music is ""an integral part of life"" in Liberia and across Africa. ""Everything from elections to polio campaigns have used songs,"" he said. ""We used songs as a medium of getting out the information to a wide segment of the population, through the best medium available in Liberia -- radio."" UNICEF chose to work with Liberia's cultural ambassador Julie Endee and some well known musicians. The style of music is a popular form in Liberia known as Hipco and the song has been very successful, playing on radios across the country, Boulierac said. ""Some people even use it as a ring tone,"" he said. ""My colleague in Sierra Leone has heard it play in street side stalls."" CNN's Nima Elbagir is in Liberia covering the outbreak. Elbagir recalled hearing ""Ebola is Real"" being played during an earlier visit and said it was very popular and instrumental in getting the public healthcare message across. Susan Krenn, director at the John Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP), spoke to CNN from Nigeria, where she was working on the launch of a weekly television series ""Newman Street."" Newman Street is aimed at addressing the topics of family planning and malaria. ""There is a whole communication science behind this,"" Krenn said. ""One of the things we really emphasize is that the entertainment has to be of very high quality. You really want to attract people to whatever the piece is because it's something they really want to listen to, or want to watch, because it's entertainment,"" she said. ""This type of programing really allows you to use creativity and pull people in for the value of the entertainment, while a communication plan allows us to weave messaging in."" The entertainment vehicle itself could get people talking about an issue and get them to adopt certain behaviors, she said. ""One of the beauties of entertainment education is that your reach is phenomenal ... you're impacting a huge number of people."" The CCP has been involved in entertainment education for nearly three decades. In 1988 it released two family planning songs and music videos -- ""Choices"" and ""Wait for Me"" -- in Nigeria. ""Someone actually made a remake of ('Wait for Me'),"" Krenn said. ""It's incredible to see the long life these things have."" The center has gone on to release many more songs but Krenn said it used entertainment within a wider communications strategy. In the case of ""Newman Street,"" the series was being used as a ""national overlay,"" she said. Krenn said there were a number of family planning and malaria programs in different states and cities in Nigeria's four main languages. At a more local level, CCP's strategy included radio and working with service providers. CCP was also involved in Liberia, Krenn said, trying to monitor and help coordinate the communication interventions there. ""With so many different entities, one of biggest needs is communication. We really need to find out where the gaps are,"" she said.","The Ebola virus has killed more than 2,400 people in Liberia .

"You're attempting to make meringue and your egg whites are a runny mess. What if you could pick up your phone or computer and instantly video chat with a cooking expert who can take a look at your kitchen disaster and tell you exactly what you're doing wrong? Google launched a tool called Helpouts on Tuesday in which people can pay to get help from experts over a live video chat similar to Google Hangouts. Anyone who is a teacher or expert on a topic can trade their services for payment, either by the task, by the minute or for a set window of time. Some Helpouts are scheduled and others are available on demand. To start, Google has more than 1,000 providers signed up to offer things such as music lessons, cooking demonstrations and basic home repair tips. Yoga instructors can give personal lessons and suggest corrections based on what they see over the video. If someone needs help in a program such as Photoshop, they can screen share with an expert who will guide them. The company's biggest competitor in the video-help category is itself. YouTube, owned by Google, is filled with how-to videos for every imaginable subject. There are eyeliner tutorials, cooking lessons and home improvement instructions. There are videos for tech support, self-improvement, learning new skills and changing a light bulb. How-to videos are the second most popular type of online video content, with 56% of adults online watching the instructional clips, according to a recent Pew Internet and American Life Project survey. But some problems and lessons need more than a one-sided demonstration. There is a benefit of having a live video feed and back and forth conversation with the person teaching. The experts can spot issues with their own eyes and bring up questions that clients would never have thought to ask. ""Sometimes all you need is facts, and that's fine. Sometimes you need somebody to look over your shoulder, somebody to show you the way,"" said Udi Manber, Google's vice president of engineering. Manber said Helpouts remove space and time barriers to make getting professional services more efficient and convenient. Google has been testing the service in its own offices for months with ergonomic consultants, nutritionist and regular Google employees who have mastered tasks such as getting the best travel deals. One remote employee gave a nutritionist a look inside a refrigerator over a Helpout to get personal dietary feedback. To show how the Helpouts work, Googlers did some live demonstrations in their San Francisco office on Monday. Osi Imeokparia, director of product management, had a cooking teacher show her how to properly zest a lemon, and a home repair expert talked her through patching a hole in drywall. She held up her phone so the home repair person could see if she had the right tools and point out that her spackle job was a bit lumpy. Experts are not just individuals. Sephora has free makeup advice from its own staff of experts who will tell you how to put on the perfect red lip. Making its Helpouts free is smart marketing for Sephora, which can suggest its own products during the video sessions. Other companies signed up include Rosetta Stone, Weight Watchers and One Medical. To start, Google Hangouts has categories for art and music, computer and electronics, cooking, education, fashion and beauty, fitness and nutrition and home and garden. For now, Google is screening people and companies that want to offer their services through Helpouts. Users review will help control the quality of providers. The category with the most intriguing potential is health services. People can have a counseling session, consult with a dietitian or get advice from a registered lactation support consultant over the video chats. There are partners doing basic triage through registered nurses, and pet care experts available to talk about why Mr. Fluffersons has lost his appetite. Google Helpouts are HIPPA compliant to address privacy concerns, and Google is checking credentials for any providers in the medical field. There is no framework for getting a Helpout session covered by insurance, but Google thinks the category has potential to become a regular part of modern health care. Telemedicine is not a new idea. Companies already offer therapy sessions and one-on-one physician appointments over video. It's great for people who are far from proper medical facilities or who are homebound because of illness. In addition to the website, there is an Helpouts Android app. People must have a Google+ account to sign up. Payment is handled by Google Wallet, and all the prices are set by the experts offing the Helpouts. Kitchit offers a Helpout on how to prepare stuffing for Thanksgiving for $20. Another cooking expert might charge by the minute to help out with emergencies. People who want to share their expertise for free could also flock to Helpouts, according to Manber, who said it could open up a whole new new way to volunteer. It could also benefit people in remote areas who either want to make money for their skills or learn things not offered near their homes. ""People who live in small towns have to make a choice right now. If they're talented and want to learn some special skills, they have to leave home,"" said Manber.

"(CNN) -- The world will feign outrage over the ""revelations"" cited in the newly released Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report. Around dinner tables and coffee shops in the Middle East, North Africa and Southwest Asia, people are probably chuckling over the hype surrounding U.S. interrogation techniques such as sleep deprivation, loud music, and yes, waterboarding. And what do their own governments use? Most likely beatings, mutilations and executions. The report findings may result in protests, but the most damaging consequence may be that it would set back our intelligence services in fighting terrorism. Those captured on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan were surprised when the treatment they received by their U.S. captors was nothing like what they were told by their leaders. They were told they would be brutally tortured and killed regardless of whether they shared information. But they quickly learned that wasn't the case. The mistakes at Abu Ghraib in 2003 by unsupervised night-shift wannabe interrogators mirroring what they thought professionals were doing were wrong, and led to the end of the careers of those involved. The good thing that came out of Abu Ghraib was that despite what Americans thought of the U.S. military, those in Iraq knew the U.S. military would bend over backwards to demonstrate fair treatment. Over time, those who were released told their leaders and U.S captors they would rather be detained by the U.S. than by their own governments. Our humane treatment of prisoners resulted in insurgent and terrorist manuals instructing fighters to wait out American detention and that eventually they would be released much like ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was released in 2004 from Camp Bucca, Iraq. Detainees deemed of high value were sent to Guantanamo. After reforms following the abuses at Abu Ghraib they could play chess and backgammon while drinking tea and watching TV via satellite. At the height of the sectarian fighting in Baghdad in 2006, Sunni insurgents and al Qaeda took the fight to Shia militias. Al Qaeda leaders were able to mobilize fighters assuring frightened Sunnis that U.S. forces would protect their neighborhoods from Shia militias. What? Yes, even al Qaeda leaders knew the United States -- while an adversary -- was not the monster they said it was and would do all it could to protect Sunni areas from Shia militias, and unknowingly freeing up terrorists to go on the offensive. Feigning outrage is being used as a tactic to shift U.S. public support away from intelligence agencies and law enforcement in order to constrain them in the fight against terrorism. Would the easily offended American public condemn those who did everything they could to protect them post 9/11? Sending terrorists back to their own intelligence and security agencies for interrogation or rendition works mainly because they speak the language and know how to use culture and the Quran to deconstruct arguments. They may know the tribe and family relations and use that information to exert pressure to denounce terrorism. And yes, they have more leeway to use interrogation techniques. The fear of the known and unknown in rendition can lead to a detainee providing actionable intelligence before employing any tactic and often negates the use of interrogation tactics. The report states that enhanced interrogation tactics did not provide actionable intelligence -- I have to disagree. While some intelligence can be obtained without using these techniques, ""ticking time bomb"" intel cannot be obtained without them. The Obama administration is retaining the right to use enhanced interrogation techniques in ""ticking time-bomb"" scenarios. The simple threat of sending a terrorist back to his country of origin was often enough to get him to give up information just to stay in U.S. custody where he knew he would be treated humanely. He may even have been able to tell someone to ""wake up and pay attention"" like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed did during a lecture to U.S. intelligence agencies on terrorism. We are making it too easy for terrorists and their supporters to exploit our media and public over this report, which claims that no actionable intelligence came from these enhanced interrogation techniques. For example, did Senate intelligence staffers interview Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? The U.S. intelligence community were able to gleam valuable and previously unknown information on al Qaeda operations and its key leaders from him. The one advantage interrogators have is the ""fear of the unknown."" This is often enough to get actionable intelligence from a detainee within the first 24 hours. The new report takes that away -- there is no fear of the ""known."" In other words, the U.S. will not do anything to you, you'll be fine and there's no need to give out any information ... and if your food is cold, call Sen. Dianne Feinstein.","Michael Pregent: The world will feign outrage over ""revelations"" in the new torture report .
Pregent: The most damaging result may be that the report's findings would set us back .
He says U.S. intelligence agencies fighting terrorism need our support .
Pregent: Terrorists may cooperate less with interrogators if agencies are constrained ."
"(CNN)A young Liberian woman who saved three of her relatives by nursing them back to health after they contracted the Ebola virus is coming to the United States to finish her nursing degree. After a story about Kekula ran on CNN in September, many people wanted to help her. A nonprofit group called iamprojects.org also got involved to try and help finish her education. The news comes as Time magazine announced Wednesday that its ""Person of the Year"" honors go to the Ebola fighters, the ""unprecedented numbers"" of doctors and nurses who responded when Ebola overtook an already-weak public health infrastructure this year in West Africa. Time's 2014 Person of the Year . Fatu Kekula is not named in the article, but she definitely holds a place among those being honored. The 22-year-old, who was in her final year of nursing school earlier this year, single-handedly took care of her father, mother, sister and cousin when they became ill with Ebola beginning in July. And she did so with remarkable success. Three out of her four patients survived. That's a 25% death rate -- considerably better than the estimated Ebola death rate of 70%. Kekula stayed healthy, which is noteworthy considering that hundreds of health care workers have become infected with Ebola, and she didn't even have personal protection equipment -- those white space suits and goggles used in Ebola treatment units. Instead, Kekula invented her own equipment. International aid workers heard about her ""trash bag method"" and taught it to other West Africans who can't get into hospitals and don't have protective gear of their own. Every day, several times a day for about two weeks, Kekula put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves. Then she put on a pair of rubber boots and then another set of trash bags over the boots. She wrapped her hair in a pair of stockings and over that a trash bag. Next she donned a raincoat and four pairs of gloves on each hand, followed by a mask. It was an arduous and time-consuming process, but she was religious about it, never cutting corners. UNICEF Spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said Kekula is amazing. ""Essentially this is a tale of how communities are doing things for themselves,"" Crowe said. ""Our approach is to listen and work with communities and help them do the best they can with what they have."" Two doctors for 85,000 people . She emphasized, of course, that it would be better for patients to be in real hospitals with doctors and nurses in protective gear -- it's just that those things aren't available to many West Africans. No one knows that better than Kekula. Her Ebola nightmare started July 27, when her father, Moses, had a spike in blood pressure. She took him to a hospital in their home city of Kakata. A bed was free because a patient had just passed away. What no one realized at the time was that the patient had died of Ebola. One woman walked in, and the Ebola nightmare began . Moses, 52, developed a fever, vomiting and diarrhea. Then the hospital closed down because nurses started dying of Ebola. Kekula took her father to Monrovia, the capital city, about a 90-minute drive via difficult roads. Three hospitals turned him away because they were full. She took him back to another hospital in Kakata. They said he had typhoid fever and did little for him, so Kekula took him home, where he infected three other family members: Kekula's mother, Victoria, 57; Kekula's sister, Vivian, 28, and their 14-year-old cousin who was living with them, Alfred Winnie. Guilty of Ebola until proven otherwise . While operating her one-woman Ebola hospital for two weeks, Kekula consulted with their family doctor, who would talk to her on the phone, but wouldn't come to the house.

Her father immediately began working to find a scholarship for Kekula, so she could finish her final year of nursing school. But the Ebola epidemic shut down many of Liberia's schools, including hers.

Emory accepted the young woman so that she could complete her nursing degree starting this winter semester. In order to attend, iamprojects will have to raise $40,000 to pay for her reduced tuition rate, living expenses, books and her travel and visa so that she can travel between Africa and the United States.

"The U.S. Government is expanding the number of commercial companies that can legally use unmanned aerial systems, often called UAVs or drones, but efforts to safely integrate them into the national airspace are not moving fast enough for some lawmakers. Wednesday the Federal Aviation Administration granted five new exemptions to four companies to operate the remote controlled aircraft for commercial purposes. The companies that received permission to fly the drones UAS, Trimble Navigation, VDOS Global, Clayco, and Woolpert, will use them to for aerial surveying, construction site monitoring and oil rig flare stack inspections. The drones will be under 55 pounds and must stay within sight of the operator. For decades hobbyists have been allowed to operate the remote controlled aircraft for recreational purposes close to the ground and away from airports, but any legal commercial use requires special exemptions from the FAA. ""Unmanned aircraft offer a tremendous opportunity to spur innovation and economic activity by enabling many businesses to develop better products and services for their customers and the American public,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a press release on Wednesday. ""We want to foster commercial uses of this exciting technology while taking a responsible approach to the safety of America's airspace."" Earlier this year the FAA issued waivers to allow seven motion picture companies to use drones. The agency says a total of 167 requests for waivers have been received in 2014. In a congressional hearing Wednesday lawmakers criticized the pace of the FAA's efforts to integrate the drones into the national airspace. ""Road builders in Germany and farmers in France today are enjoying economic benefits from UAS because safety regulators there have found ways to permit such flights,"" Congressman Frank LoBiondo said. ""I can't help but wonder, that if the Germans, the French and the Canadians do some of these things today, then why can't we also be doing that?"" Earlier this week in a letter to the FAA, obtained the Wall Street Journal, Amazon.com warned it could take its drone delivery development outside of the United States. ""Without approval of our testing in the United States, we will be forced to continue expanding our Prime Air R&D footprint abroad,"" Paul Misener, Vice President of Global Public Policy wrote. In Wednesday's hearing the FAA acknowledged that it was not moving fast enough. ""We all agree that that project is taking too long,"" Peggy Gilligan, FAA Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety told the committee. ""We are moving forward with UAS integration through rule-making, as mandated by (Congress)."" The most significant risk for drone use and the challenge for regulators working to safely integrate them into the national airspace is the potential that one could hit a passenger plane. A drone could strike a wing and cause a fuel explosion or sucked into an engine potentially causing a catastrophic failure. ""We have all seen photos of the damage that can be cause to an airplane when a bird strikes in flight,"" Captain Lee Moak of the Air Line Pilots Association Union told the committee. ""Unmanned aircraft can be much smaller or much larger than birds but they harbored added risk in that they carry batteries, motors and other hard metal components."" Last month in Oklahoma City a drone came within 20 feet of striking a plane, forcing the aircraft to take evasive action, according to FAA reports obtained by Sen. Diane Feinstein. More than 190 incidents were reported over the last nine months, including two dozen near collisions. And just this week it was revealed that a small drone narrowly missed a commercial airliner in July as it approached London's Heathrow Airport. ""I've got a quad copter on Christmas list as I suspect quite a few people do,"" Congressman Blake Farenthold said at Wednesday's hearing. ""I think this is a more dangerous scenario that you guys need to be putting a priority on. There are too many of these out here that are capable of going beyond couple hundred feet but actually going up to 6,000 feet, we've got a problem and our failure to regulate them -- we're going to have a genie out of the bottle issue.""","Five companies received permission to fly commercial drones from the FAA Wednesday .

"Stop worrying about the website and start talking about Obamacare's benefits. That was President Barack Obama's message to the nation on Tuesday as he kicked off a three-week public relations blitz intended to generate more participation in his signature health care reforms. A day after officials declared the previously dysfunctional HealthCare.gov website working smoothly for most users, Obama held a White House event to try to shift the focus of a fiercely partisan public debate to how much help the 2010 Affordable Care Act offers Americans in need. He noted the botched website launch of October 1 set back implementation of the reforms, and encouraged supporters to help him reintroduce the law to a still skeptical nation. ""Our poor execution in the first couple months on the website clouded the fact that there are a whole bunch of people who stand to benefit,"" Obama said. ""Now that the website's working for the vast majority of people, we need to make sure that folks refocus on what's at stake here."" The administration hopes the new ability of HealthCare.gov to handle 800,000 users a day or more without major problems signals a major step forward in getting people to sign up for health coverage now required by law under the reforms. However, officials including Obama, warn that glitches will persist and describe the website as a work in progress. In another potential problem disclosed Tuesday, a Treasury inspector general audit cited possible security weaknesses against potential fraud by people getting government subsidies under Obamacare to lower their health insurance costs. The Internal Revenue Service, which will enforce compliance with the law's mandate to obtain health coverage, responded that it continues to develop systems to detect and prevent fraud involving subsidies when recipients file their 2014 tax returns. Meanwhile, insurance companies say some ""back-end"" aspects of the HealthCare.gov system continued to malfunction. In particular, insurers cite problems with applications from people who signed up through the website, including erroneous or missing information. White House spokesman Jay Carney said tech experts were working on the processing problems, offering assurances they would be fixed in time for enrollment starting on January 1, 2014. ""We're confident that they'll be able to achieve that,"" Carney said. Critics, led by conservative Republicans trying to dismantle the health care reforms known as Obamacare, say the website problems foreshadow deeper failings of the law that passed with no GOP support. ""It's not just a broken website; this bill is fundamentally flawed,"" House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday, later adding that ""when you look at Obamacare, what you see is a government-centered health care delivery system."" Americans don't want that, the Ohio Republican insisted, declaring they instead ""want to be able to pick their own type of health insurance, they want to be able to pick their own doctor and they want to be able to pick their own hospital."" Obama challenged Boehner and other Republicans to come up with something better instead of simply opposing and trying to obstruct the implementation of Obamacare. ""We may never satisfy the law's opponents,"" he told an audience of supporters at the White House, including embattled Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, whose department oversees the reforms. The President listed specific benefits, such as an end to lifetime caps on coverage and denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions. Because of Obamacare, parents can keep their children on family policies up to age 26, and people can get free mammograms and other screening. Now, he said, the 1 million visitors to HealthCare.gov on Monday showed the robust public interest in new health insurance exchanges under the reforms. ""Some have already convinced themselves that the law has failed, regardless of the evidence,"" Obama said, prompting applause when he rejected Republican efforts to delay or dismantle the reforms. ""We're not repealing it as long as I'm President,"" he said, adding ""We're not going to walk away from it. If I've got to fight another three years to make sure this law works, then that's what I'll do."" In a blog post on Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that more than 1.46 million people have been added to Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program rolls due to expanded services under the health care reforms. The Affordable Care Act offered states additional federal funding to offer Medicaid and CHIP coverage to more low-income Americans. So far, 24 states and the District of Columbia have accepted the expansion funding while three others are still deciding and 23 have declined. More events will occur daily through December 23, the deadline for people to get coverage that will take effect on January 1. A new-found confidence . Over the weekend, officials announced they had met their self-imposed November 30 deadline for getting the site working for the ""vast majority"" of users, saying response times and error rates had been slashed while capacity increased. Jeffrey Zients, a former administration official brought in to oversee the website fixes after its launch, compared the hardware upgrades so far to widening a highway on-ramp from two lanes to four. That means chronic breakdowns, error messages and delays users experienced two months ago when the website went live have mostly disappeared, he said, noting the average response time was less than 1 second and the system's ""uptime"" -- a measure of system stability -- was consistently surpassing 90%. It all means that HealthCare.gov can now handle its original intended volume of 50,000 concurrent users for a total of 800,000 visitors a day, according to Zients. A new component that put users in a waiting queue during periods of high volume provided a better-managed delay than the site freezes and error messages of October. The waiting queue also asked users if they wanted to receive an e-mail notifiying them when they could try again at the front of the line. According to an HHS official, 13,000 people requested an e-mail and 60% of them -- roughly 7,800 -- later returned after getting the email notification. Administration: Obamacare website working smoothly . Not all roses in the Rose Garden . Vocal throughout the launch of the program and the successive problems, the GOP stayed vigilant with its critique. ""President Obama and his administration repeatedly claimed the Obamacare website would be fully functioning by the end of November, but this has proven to be just another broken promise,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Monday. ""The Obama administration had over three years to build HealthCare.gov, and all they've produced is a non-functioning website, wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars."" Obamacare site fix: 5 things to look for . Insurers: Site glitches persist . In October, the first month of a six-month enrollment period, just over 106,000 people signed up for Obamacare. Less than 27,000 of them did so through the HealthCare.gov website, which was supposed to be the main enrollment portal. An administration official familiar with the matter told CNN that about 100,000 people signed up for coverage last month on the site. The official cautioned the number was preliminary and final numbers would be released in mid-December. Joanne Peters, a Health and Human Services spokeswoman, said enrollment through alternate channels and successful exchanges in 14 states would help bolster November figures. Initial enrollment figures lower than hoped . Website progress garners muted reaction from Congress . Marilyn Tavenner, the official charged with implementing Obamacare as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of November. The overall enrollment target by the March 31 deadline for 2014 is 7 million. A properly functioning HealthCare.gov is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage. The coming months will show if it was successful. With website deadline met, Obamacare scrutiny increases .","Treasury audit warns of possible Obamacare subsidy fraud .

"In the space of six weeks, with great displays of importance, India's capital will have hosted two world leaders who no longer speak with each other: the presidents of Russia and the United States. India sits uncomfortably between these two adversaries. Pick your geopolitical topic -- Syria, Iran, Ukraine -- and you can be sure that Moscow and Washington will be at odds with each other. New Delhi has been watching from afar, sitting on the fence. It is fair to ask if India's stance is sustainable. Can you simultaneously court close friendships with two states whose foreign policies are designed to hurt the other? In Narendra Modi¬πs worldview, the answer is a resounding yes. When CNN spoke with the Indian Prime Minister earlier this year, in his only interview since assuming office, Modi explained how he saw a changed world order. ""If you look closely, you will see that every country is trying to build relations with other countries,"" he said. They may be part of one bloc, but they also sit with fierce opponents. When pushed specifically on Russia's annexation of Crimea, a hostile takeover New Delhi refused to condemn, Modi pushed right back. ""In the world right now, a lot of people want to give advice. But look within them, and they too have sinned in some way."" The comment could be seen as a subtle dig at Washington's foreign policy missteps. However, Modi's point was not to admonish the U.S., but to suggest that all nations have their own value systems and perceived flaws. India¬πs way of navigating flawed global players was by making friendships and opening channels of opportunity. The subtext to this is simple: economics. The reason why Modi has traveled all over the world in his first few months in office -- Rio, New York, Tokyo, Sydney -- is not because he wants to be a foreign policy leader; Modi wants to bring business to India. So: as you read about and see images of Vladimir Putin¬πs grand reception in New Delhi this week, keep an eye not on the rhetoric, but the outcomes and deals struck. Russia is the world's second largest exporter of arms; India is the world's biggest importer. Russia is one of the world's biggest producers of oil and gas; India is one of the biggest consumers. The two sustain each others' needs. And as long as they do, they will court each other, with the United States watching on.","India sits uncomfortably between Russia and U.S., writes CNN's Ravi Agrawal .

"(CNN)When photographer Fabio Bucciarelli first visited South Sudan, he found a nation filled with hope. He found citizens worn out by decades of war -- but looking forward to an independent, peaceful future. That was two years ago, after the world's youngest country split from its northern nemesis, Sudan. ""I remember the look on people's faces,"" Bucciarelli said. ""Tired but happy, hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war."" His return in February was anything but. This time, Bucciarelli found a nation on the brink of an abyss. Instead of jubilant faces of hope, he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars. Months of ethnic violence had left thousands dead, 1.5 million people displaced and a looming famine, according to the United Nations. Bucciarelli found despair cramped in tent camps, growing sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers. He described the violence in South Sudan as an ""invisible"" conflict. ""It represents one of the longest and most forgotten African wars,"" he said. ""Its apparent stillness leads to hear about it less and less. Given the tragic consequences and repercussions on the population, I find it essential to bring it to light."" His goal, he said, is to tell the stories of people rendered powerless by wars, provide objective images and shed light on human rights issues. ""It's hard to find front-line war photography of the kind we've seen in Libya or Syria,"" Bucciarelli said. ""The images in South Sudan are different. They describe visually the effect of the impending war, lending you a view of the civilian and military populations and providing a glimpse of life inside a murky, not clearly defined conflict."" The latest conflict erupted in December last year, when President Salva Kiir accused his fired deputy, Riek Machar, of an attempted coup. Since then, militia loyal to both have battled each other and targeted civilians from rival tribes. The conflict has wiped out entire neighborhoods and transformed into a full-blown war between two large tribes, the Nuer and the Dinka. Machar belongs to the Nuer community, while the President is a Dinka. Bucciarelli's pictures provide a rare window into a civilian population under siege. ""South Sudan's war represents one of the longest and most forgotten African conflicts,"" he said. ""Its tragic consequences are quietly fading away from the headlines, making these pictures even more crucial."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. That war left 2 million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south. The recent clashes have been a major setback for a country so desperate for a new start. Instead of relishing its independence, residents of areas such as Bentiu, Bor, Nyang and Mingkaman are struggling to survive as communities turn against one another.

"George W. Bush went home to Texas nearly six years ago, but the nation is still working through the contentious national security legacy he left behind. A hotly disputed Senate report on the CIA's brutal interrogation tactics is tearing open barely healed political wounds first opened after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The report found CIA tactics were more brutal than previously known and accused the agency of keeping the Bush White House and Congress in the dark about them. The questions raised by the Intelligence Committee's document -- about how to wage a relentless war on terrorism within constitutional and moral constraints -- seem as intense as ever. And the debate is not nearing resolution. President Barack Obama came to power vowing to turn the page from Bush-era terror policies, which he said flouted core American values. But three-quarters of the way through his own two-term presidency, he is still wrestling with the long shadow cast by the war on terror and the methods Bush chose to fight it. And in some cases, Obama is facing his own criticism for his approach to terrorism, including his decision to vastly expand a drone program bequeathed him by Bush. The reaction of a deeply polarized Congress to the long delayed Senate Intelligence Committee report, not to mention fierce CIA push back, shows how hard it will be to build any national consensus on the proper approach to a threat like terrorism. ""One of the strengths that makes America exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past, face our imperfections, make changes and do better,"" Obama said in a statement. ""Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today's report can help us leave these techniques where they belong‚Äîin the past."" Obama banned ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" like water boarding and sleep deprivation, that were the subject of the report released Tuesday, soon after taking office in 2009. 'Old arguments' But resolving those ""old arguments"" is proving more difficult. The United States, for instance, has transferred prisoners to foreign governments that still employ harsh techniques. And Obama faces questions about his own conduct in the campaign against terrorism, notably the drone expansion. That program, which utilizes drones armed with missiles to pursue terror suspects outside any sort of judicial process in foreign countries, has raised moral questions rivaling those about the torture program. Sen. John McCain made the most passionate case against CIA tactics many see as torture on Tuesday. His remarks were particularly notable because Obama defeated McCain in 2008 in an election that served as a rejection of Bush's national security leadership. ""What were the policies? What was their purpose? Did they achieve it?"" McCain, who suffered torture himself as a prisoner during the Vietnam War, asked. ""Did they make us safer? Less safe? Or did they make no difference? What did they gain us? What did they cost us?"" He added: ""The American people need the answers to these questions."" But as Tuesday's release of the majority report by Democrats on the committee showed, those questions remain deeply divisive. ""It's a pure political piece of crap,"" said the normally courtly Utah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio accused the committee led by outgoing Democratic chairwoman Dianne Feinstein of trying to embarrass the Bush administration by publishing the report. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he had always believed that the CIA tactics were counterproductive. But he said the Obama administration, which has sought to try terror suspects in civilian courts, had gone far too far in repudiating Bush-era methods. ""The policies the Obama Administration has employed, treat terrorists as common criminals, not enemy combatants,"" Graham said in a statement. ""I'm convinced their criminalization of the war is causing our nation to lose valued intelligence which can help protect our nation."" Acknowledgment of crimes . Some critics of the Bush administration anti-terrorism strategy say the arguments will never be resolved without some public acknowledgment that crimes were committed. The Justice Department has twice investigated the issue of enhanced interrogations and decided against bringing charges against CIA operatives who were under intense pressure to avoid additional attacks after September 11. Obama has also made a political decision that despite his belief enhanced interrogation compromised bedrock American values, he will not seek to dredge up the past by backing prosecution for CIA officers opposed by crimes. But Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center For Constitutional Rights, which represents some detainees at Guantanamo Bay, said the CIA had used false claims to cover up ""monstrous crimes."" ""We renew our demand for accountability for those individuals responsible for the CIA torture program,"" Azmy said in a statement. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, called for a special prosecutor to hold the ""architects and perpetrators of the torture program"" accountable. ""This should be the beginning of a process, not the end. The report should shock President Obama and Congress into action, to make sure that torture and cruelty are never used again."" But independent Sen. Angus King, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN that prosecutions are ""not really the point."" ""I am less concerned about prosecutions than I am about ‚Äî let' s not let this happen again."" Senior officials have privately said that Obama sees putting the war on terror onto a more sustainable footing as one of the key tasks of his presidency. ""We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us,"" Obama said in a signature speech at the National Defense University last year. Obama's unresolved questions . But the president looks certain to hand many unresolved questions on how to combat terrorism to his successor, as Bush passed them to him. Obama has yet to honor a promise to close Guantanamo Bay, due to Republican opposition and logistical issues about what to do with prisoners like confessed September 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Spurred by revelations from fugitive intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, Obama has also put new constraints on the National Security Agency's phone record and data trawling programs but declined to end them. And after pulling troops out of Iraq and ending combat in Afghanistan, the president will spend his last two years in office wrestling with a new front in the war on terror ‚Äî ISIS in Syria and Iraq. There was no word on Tuesday from the man back at the center of the debate: Bush. But the former president told CNN's Candy Crowley last week that the United States was ""fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney ‚Äî the architect of many Bush war on terror policies -- told the New York Times that claims that the CIA acted unlawfully were ""a bunch of hooey.""","Bush anti-terror legacy still contested six years after he left office .

"(CNN) -- What if police gave out presents instead of traffic tickets. That would be a nice trick, or maybe an alternate reality. Actually, it was a stunt for UPtv. The family friendly cable channel pulled off the stunt in late November with the help of Lowell, Michigan, Police Department. Officer Scot VanSolkema stopped unsuspecting drivers for minor traffic violations and then chatted them up about what their family would like for Christmas. ""Got all your Christmas shopping done?"" he asked one woman as she pulled out her proof of insurance and registration. ""No, I haven't even started,"" she answered before telling VanSolkema what her daughter and son were asking for. Listening in were Santa's helpers with UPtv, who quickly dashed about a local store buying, wrapping and delivering the presents to the traffic stop within 15 minutes. Surprise! ""Oh my God, can I hug you?"" So, on and on it went, 50 drivers in all, according to CNN affiliate WZZM. VanSolkema handed out some 30 presents worth about $7,000. And no tickets.

""She is stable, but is in a coma. The first responders got Claire to the right place, at the right time, and the doctors and hospital staff are doing a wonderful job taking care of her,"" her family said in a statement. ""We appreciate your continued good thoughts and prayers, and will provide updates as her condition improves."" Among those praying for Davis is the family of Karl Pierson, the 18-year-old senior who police say shot her. In a statement released Monday afternoon, Barbara and Mark Pierson said Davis and her family ""have suffered unimaginably, and we pray for her full recovery."" ""As parents, we loved our son Karl dearly and we are devastated by what happened Friday. We cannot begin to understand why Karl did what he did,"" the Piersons said. They also offered prayers ""for the entire Arapahoe High School community, as we know your lives are forever changed by this horrific event."" Lessons of Columbine and other school shootings helped in Arapahoe . Police say Pierson was looking for revenge against a librarian, but couldn't find the faculty member and killed himself as a school resource officer closed in. Davis was just a random victim, police surmised, and the gunman and victim didn't even know each other. Davis' classmates spoke well of her. They used words like spunky and bright. ""She was just a very sweet girl. She's really smart,"" August Clary told CNN affiliate KUSA. He said Davis loves to ride horses and ""wouldn't hurt a fly.""

"Starvation. Execution. Imprisonment. Rape. Torture. In a human rights report, these can seem like distant concepts or dry statistics, but when told by the people who experience them first hand, they take on new meaning. That is why U.S. officials invited two young North Korean defectors to address a crowd at the State Department on Wednesday -- to share their personal experiences of abuse at the hands one of the world's most notorious regimes. Yeonmi Park's family was part of North Korea's ruling elite. Her early life was comfortable, and her family even enjoyed access to smuggled Hollywood films and South Korean television shows. From these, Park said, she learned how different life could be in other places, and she started to feel more repressed by the government's rules. ""I remember wanting to be like Julia Roberts after watching the Pretty Woman,"" Park said. ""But in North Korea, the regime restricts even what I can wear, so instead I made paper dolls and I made the clothes that I wanted to wear for them."" When she was nine years old, Park remembers that one of friend's mothers was arrested for sharing DVDs and was publicly executed. The experience, she said, shocked her. Many people in her world participated in the underground economy, including her father, a government official. In 2004, he was arrested for illegal trading, and was severely beaten. Park and her mother were ostracized, and fled to China where they underwent further hardships as one of countless North Korean immigrants, and she saw her mother raped. After a harrowing journey on foot to Mongolia, they finally made it to South Korea, where Park is now a university student. Joseph Kim also grew up new the China-North Korea border. After famine hit the region, Kim's family struggled to find enough food to eat. ""Hunger is humiliation,"" Kim told the audience at the State Department. ""Hunger is hopelessness."" He watched his father die of starvation, after which his mother and sister left for China to find work. ""At the time I was so young and naive it never occurred to me that it might -- they might never be able to make it back,"" said Kim. He never saw his sister again. His mother sold his sister to a man in China, thinking her fate there would be less cruel than a life back in North Korea. ""This is my first time saying that in public,"" Kim said Wednesday after relaying the story, ""mostly because I was afraid that people would judge my mom for what she did."" ""But I realized this is an important part of my story, that I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is,"" Kim continued, ""and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision."" The event at the State Department is just the latest in a string of events aimed at drawing attention towards North Korea's dismal human rights record, as the international community works towards shaming, and potentially prosecuting officials there. Last month, a United Nations committee approved a draft resolution recommending the International Criminal Court take action against North Korea over a slew of human rights abuses. That resolution, which is non-binding but symbolically important, is expected to come up for a vote in the General Assembly this month. Earlier this year, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea published a detailed 400-page report documenting abuses, which it submitted to the International Criminal Court for review along with recommendation that North Korean officials face prosecution. That report accused the government of murder, kidnapping, torture, slavery, sexual violence, mass starvation and other abuses. It includes personal testimonies from people who experienced life inside North Korea's infamous prison camps, including that of a woman who claims a fellow female inmate was forced to drown her own baby in a bucket. Testimonies also reveal how prisoners suffered from chronic hunger, and would sometimes resort to eating rodents and lizards to survive. Following the release of the report, Michael Kirby, the committee's chairman, told reporters: ""The suffering and tears of the people of North Korea demand action."" The North Korean government is sensitive to accusations against them, and is quick deny these reports as they emerge. Representatives have claimed the U.S. and its allies are fabricating abuse claims to justify meddling in North Korea's internal affairs. In September, North Korea's Association for Human Rights Studies came out with its own rights report, which proclaims that North Korea has ""the world's most advantageous human rights system,"" and makes no mention of the country's infamous forced labor camps. The North Korean government has also called out the U.S. government for what they see as hypocrisy when it comes to human rights abuses -- particularly in light of a new report released by the Senate on Tuesday, which details how the CIA tortured terror detainees. North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA said the use of such enhanced interrogation techniques is ""inhuman"" and called on the UN to investigate those offenses. And according to Yeonmi Park, the North Korean government views it as essential to control the narrative when it comes to information in the public sphere if it hopes to maintain the image of Kim Jong Un as an all-powerful leader. This was demonstrated recently when North Korea demanded Sony Pictures stop the release of the upcoming movie ""The Interview,"" a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, whose characters are tasked by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. The North Korean government came under suspicion after Sony's systems were infiltrated by anonymous hackers. ""I didn't even see the movie yet,"" Park said Wednesday when she was asked about the film's potential impact. ""But it will be a really big sensation in North Korea if they see that movie.""","International pressure is mounting on North Korea when it comes to human rights abuses .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A brewing Pacific storm will pour desperately needed rain on California's historic drought, but the pending wet wallop promises to carry a high price as schools in San Francisco and Oakland are bracing themselves and will be closed Thursday, officials said Wednesday. The rainfall is expected to be so significant that meteorologists call its source an ""atmospheric river."" Many people in Northern California were bringing lawn items inside. But not everything. ""I'm just trying to bring some stuff down that might blow away. We are not taking down the Christmas decorations though, leaving those up unless it gets real bad,"" Ryan Higgins of Sunnyvale said. Higgins, who owns a comic book store, said he and his family had a ""handful of sandbags"" because their residential complex tends to flood even with a little rain. Already, the fingertips of the storm were ravaging the coast of Washington state, eroding a beachline and threatening homes, according to a CNN affiliate KOMO reporter's tweets. The fire-hose weather system will slam into the West Coast by Thursday, forecasts say. Atmospheric rivers are 250 to 400 miles wide and split off like a tributary from a much larger band of moisture from the tropics. They only come occasionally but are necessary to fill up water reservoirs, the NWS says. ""Up to 50% of annual precipitation on the West Coast occurs in just a few AR events."" On the weather map, the storm looks like a cloud river in the sky flowing straight at the coast, and in combination with the storm system chasing it ashore, it is expected to dump 2-5 inches of rain in many places this week. The highest elevations of Northern California might get 10 inches of rain, forecasters said. San Francisco could see 2 to 4 inches in the city with up to 8 inches in the hills. Schools shuttered . The San Francisco and Oakland Unified School District officials blamed their planned closures on the potential downpour. ""Closing schools is a serious decision,"" said SFUSD Superintendent Richard A. Carranza in a statement, according to CNN affiliate KRON. ""I did not arrive at this lightly. First and foremost, we don't want to risk having our students injured or seriously delayed transporting to and from school. In addition to student absences, the storm could result in large numbers of staff absences, which could then lead to inadequate supervision of our students. Furthermore, power outages could affect the district's ability to feed students' school meals, among many other operational challenges."" In a message to students and staff on the district's Facebook page, Oakland school officials cited ""an extreme and potentially dangerous weather system"" as the reason for the closings. ""We recognize this decision will interrupt the normal routine and require some families to seek other child-care alternatives and we apologize in advance for the inconvenience. We do, however, feel it's our responsibility, given the dire reports from the National Weather Service, that we take this precaution and steps to maximize student and staff safety."" Southern California might get 1 to 2 inches with twice as much in the hilly areas. That much rain may be more common, if you live along the Gulf or Atlantic Coasts, but for parched California, which researchers at the University of Nebraska say is the most drought-stricken state in the country, it's a lot to handle at once. And in many areas, it comes on top of high rains last week. The weather service warned there could be moderate river flooding in California and Washington. Folks in Oregon were expecting high winds Thursday, but in Seaside, 80 miles northwest of Portland, it was already blustery on Wednesday. ""I was waiting for trees just to go blowing right by the beach,"" Denise Abramson told CNN affiliate KATU. ""It was really, really windy. Really bad. And the waves were probably ...15 feet high coming in. The swells are coming in really, really fast."" About 115 miles down the coast in Newport, it wasn't as bad at Jack's Surfboards. ""Right now it's probably 4- to 5-foot (surf). It's picking up for sure,"" employee Connor Heisgen said. And the wind? ""A tiny bit."" Flooding possible . In the Bay Area on Tuesday, public works crews got ready for a downpour. A road crew vacuumed mud and trash out of a storm drain, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. ""This is not the most glamorous work that there is, even with equipment like this. This is still really hard work. Hard and dirty work but something that has to be done to make sure the system functions properly when we do have a big storm,"" Caltrans spokesman Bob Haus told KTVU. The sheriff's department in Solano County, which has a lot of waterfront land, is handing out sandbags to residents. Bay Area power crews cut pine tree limbs hanging over power lines ahead of winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 70 mph. Those howling winds will also drive in high surf up and down the West Coast, with some breakers rising 20 feet high. They are expected to push up water levels in Washington's Puget Sound, which could have residents of Seattle and Tacoma wading through shoreline puddles. The area will live up to its reputation for sogginess, as about half a foot of rain is expected to fall between early Wednesday and late Thursday, the weather service predicts. Nor'easter . The wet maker on in the Northeast looks more like a circular water sprinkler, spinning in moisture from the Atlantic, where it is clashing with cold air. The nor'easter's wet, cold misery -- from chilly rain to snow and ice -- have slushed the Northeast and will continue to as the gyrator drifts north through northern New England. Syracuse, New York, expected more snow on Thursday. The 6-10 inches of snow in Greenville Junction, Maine, on Wednesday will get a glazing of freezing rain more than once this week, the NWS predicts. Winds will be high there, too, with gusts of 40 to 60 mph. They could cause coastal flooding in Maine. Real rainmaker . There were reports of record rain on Tuesday from the New York metropolitan area with nearly 3 inches falling. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, 2.95 inches fell, the most on this date. At LaGuardia Airport, where 2.65 inches fell, the flight delays at one point reached four hours. According to the flight tracking website FlightAware.com, more than 2,600 flights departing from and/or landing in the United States were delayed Tuesday and 1,200 were canceled. CNN's Steve Almasy, Dave Alsup and Tony Marco contributed to this report.","NEW: Business owners in Northern California prepping with sandbags .

"For West Virginians getting their drinking water from the Elk River, the pungent aftertaste from a chemical spill in January has lingered in the legal system, with more than 60 lawsuits filed. On Monday, the FBI added a criminal case against the former president of Freedom Industries, Inc., the company whose storage tank leaked more than 7,000 gallons of a black licorice-scented chemical used to clean coal. Representatives of the company were not immediately available for comment. Gary Southern lied to dodge responsibility for the spill, according to the criminal complaint filed in a West Virginia federal court. Southern, who was arrested on Monday after the filing, was released on bond and can only travel between West Virginia and Florida, where he has homes. Complaint: False impression . Southern lied under oath, saying he had just taken on leadership responsibilities at Freedom only days before the spill, FBI Special Agent James Lafferty wrote in the complaint. He wanted to leave an impression that -- because of that -- he could hardly be held responsible, the complaint said. In reality, Southern had been a leading executive at the company since 2009, when he became chief operating officer, Lafferty wrote. Then there was the matter of the former president's paycheck. In a bankruptcy filing on behalf of the company, Southern made an application to further collect his check using the same justification -- he had not been in charge long, when the tank containing 4-methylcyclohexane methanol (MCHM) sprung a leak. He later withdrew the application to keep collecting the check, according to the complaint. Complaint: Deception worked . But the alleged deception worked, the FBI agent wrote. A committee for creditors swallowed the line, saying it believed Southern had been involved with Freedom for just a short time. ""...Southern's goal in making the false and/or deceptive statement is to protect his assets from legal judgments that may result from lawsuits...,"" the complaint said. Southern faces charges of lying under oath, bankruptcy fraud, and also wire fraud for transferring much of his wealth out of his bank account. Southern, who is also the target of two lawsuits, has $7.7 million in assets, the complaint said, and he moved $6.5 million from his Wells Fargo bank account into an annuity account with Jackson National Life Insurance Company, Inc. Nausea, headaches, rashes . The chemical was discovered leaking on January 9 into the Elk River, which supplies the city of Charleston with water. A do-not-use order was issued to 300,000 residents, some of whom could not drink or bathe in their water for more than a week. MCHM is not directly lethal but can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headaches, diarrhea and skin rashes. A month after the spill, tap water tests in 10 homes detected MCHM still in the water supply, albeit at levels within the state's legal limit. Freedom Industries, Inc., in a settlement reached with plaintiffs, agreed to transfer $2.9 million into a trust fund to be used for ""the greater good.""","FBI: Gary Southern tried to give the impression that he had not been with company long .
The intent was to make it seem like he could not be held responsible .
In reality, he had been with the company for about five years, the complaint read .

"Editor's note: Tomorrow Transformed explores innovative approaches and opportunities in business and society through technology. (WIRED) -- Next month, a giant industry gathering is going to be flooded with virtual-reality experiences: the Birdly flight simulator; something that lets users confront a kaiju attack; an Oculus Rift-enabled spin on combat training; even a VR installation that lets you go to a college party. But this isn't the line-up for CES‚Äîit's the Sundance Film Festival. After bringing a handful of Oculus Rift installations to Sundance in 2014, the festival's New Frontier program, which focuses on innovation in filmmaking, is doubling down and bringing in a much larger slate of virtual reality experiences for 2015. Of the 13 installations in the program, nine feature VR and one of the remaining four‚Äîa videogame-esque piece about the Iranian Revolution in 1979‚Äîcould have a virtual version one day. It's a slate, senior programmer Shari Frilot says, that shows VR is ""a point of conversation that's going to be really relevant to festival audiences and filmmakers."" ""I've never really seen anything like this where a new technology is so muscularly poised to hit the market,"" says Frilot, who has curated the New Frontier program for nine years. ""This is the year that we're really going to get wired into this hardware in a major way. It really has the potential to shift the [filmmaking] terrain quite a bit in a very significant and deep way."" Algorithms Are Great and All, But They Can Also Ruin Lives . Oculus, of course, has been to Sundance before. In 2012, a pre-Oculus Palmer Luckey made the VR goggles for Nonny de la Pe√±a's ""immersive journalism"" project Hunger in Los Angeles. (Pe√±a will be back in 2015 with a piece on children in Syria.) Last January, festivalgoers got a taste of the space dogfighting game EVE: Valkyrie on the Rift, and multimedia artist Chris Milk brought an immersive version of his ""Sound and Vision"" Beck concert that was a hit with fans. He'll also be returning for Sundance 2015. In the months since the last festival in Park City, Utah, Oculus experiences have become the ultimate crowd-pleaser at all kinds of industry events. HBO brought a Game of Thrones experience to South By Southwest in March. Then, after Oculus' $2 billion acquisition by Facebook, Legendary Pictures one-upped HBO with a Jaeger-piloting simulation at Comic-Con International this summer. And, of course, VR made a huge splash at E3 (again) this year. Basically, anywhere there's been a gathering of people interested in any form of media in the last 12 months, there's been a VR experience in the offing. And now that virtual reality is also coming in the form of Google Cardboard and Samsung's Gear VR the demonstrations are just beginning. (Some of Sundance's New Frontier offerings are being presented in Cardboard and on Samsung's device.) What Would Your Ideal, Photoshopped Face Look Like? 14 People Find Out . Part of the appeal of these VR installations, of course, is that the Oculus Rift is still in developer-only mode‚Äîthere's not a consumer version yet. For the time being, it's a cool novelty to tell your colleagues about as you hang up another conference badge and get back to work. But Sundance is a unique case: a lot of the New Frontier projects are made by filmmakers‚Äîpeople who see virtual reality as a new way to experience movies, not just promote them. Creation is the prime mover here, not ancillary marketing. So, what's in the offing? For starters, Chris Milk is back with a collaboration he did with VFX firm Digital Domain and production house VRSE.works called Evolution of Verse, a CGI ""journey from beginning to new beginning"" using Cardboard. Then there's Kaiju Fury!, which puts you in a city as monsters are about to lay it to waste. Pe√±a's Project Syria will explore VR's potential as a documentary tool‚Äîputting viewers on the ground in the war-torn country to show the effects of the conflict there on children. Artists F√©lix Lajeunesse and Paul Rapha√´l will also be showing a series of live-action experiences, including one that lets users sit in the room while a pianist works on music. [Ed.‚ÄîThey brought this to SXSW last year, and it remains one of the most surprisingly intimate experiences we've seen on the Rift.] . And, in what might be the most thought-provoking piece at New Frontier, the program also will get a VR experience from a Sundance vet Rose Troche, who Frilot says ""wanted to make a piece about date rape and do it in a way where there was a lot of gray zones."" The director, who first came to the film festival 21 years ago with the black-and-white lesbian dramedy Go Fish, teamed up with CG whiz Morris May for Perspective; Chapter I: The Party. It's a VR experience that takes a fairly conventional premise‚Äîawkward college students hanging out at a party‚Äîand turns it into a first-hand experience where a girl and guy ""meet, drink, and misinterpreted signals turn into things that cannot be undone."" On paper, Troche and May's piece sounds like the kind of VR effort that could be as emotionally affecting as any film. And the rest of the slate beyond Perspective reads like any independent film festival line-up. Remove the words ""virtual reality,"" and the subject matter has the kind of resonance any indie fest programmer would be proud of: documentaries, a story about a father's time in the military in Chile, a look into the lives of Mongolian yak herders. Sounds like a main competition line-up at Sundance, not specifically the New Frontier one. That's the point. Filmmaking is just filmmaking, VR just gives it a new theater‚Äîone that Sundance's trendy-scarf-clad film nerds might finally be starting to see themselves in. ""Last year people were putting on the DK1 and the first thing filmmakers are looking for is image quality, and that's where filmmakers wondered, 'This is really cool, but what about what it looks like?'"" Frilot says. ""But now the technology has ramped up to a stage where it'll be wholly embraced by filmmakers."" Check out the full line up for New Frontier, which runs Jan. 22 to Feb. 1 during the Sundance Film Festival, below. 1979 Revolution Game . Artists: Navid Khonsari, Vassiliki Khonsari . 1979 Revolution Game presents an innovative approach to non-fiction storytelling. Designed to engage players with an immersive ""on the ground"" experience of the Iranian Revolution, the game integrates an emotionally impactful narrative with interactive moral choices and intuitive touchscreen gameplay while remaining true to history. Assent . Artist: Oscar Raby . This immersive documentary uses virtual reality technology to put the user in the footsteps of director Oscar Raby's father, who in 1973 was a 22-year-old army officer stationed in the north of Chile, on the day when the Caravan of Death came to his regiment. Birdly . Artist: Max Rheiner . Flying is one of the oldest dreams of humankind. Birdly is an experiment to capture this dream, to simulate the experience of being a bird from a first-person perspective. This embodiment is conducted through a full-body virtual reality setup. D√©rive . Artist: Fran√ßois Qu√©villon . This interactive installation uses the audience's body motions and positions to explore 3-D reconstructions of urban and natural spaces that are transformed according to live environmental data, including meteorological and astronomical phenomena. Evolution of Verse . Artist: Chris Milk . Chris Milk, working with visual effects powerhouse Digital Domain and virtual reality production company VRSE.works, has created this photo-realistic CGI-rendered 3-D virtual reality film that takes the viewer on a journey from beginning to new beginning. Kaiju Fury! Artist: Ian Hunter . A dark energy experiment leads to a devastating attack by monstrous Kaiju, and you are standing at ground zero‚Äîall in 360-degree, stereoscopic 3-D cinematic virtual reality. You will ""be there"" as the beasts lay waste to a crumbling city and humanity makes its last stand. Paradise . Artist: Pleix . Paradise is certainly not paradisiacal if you look at it through our eyes. But neither is it totally devoid of humor, melancholy, and absurdity. Perhaps it is first and foremost life as it is, and then a touch exaggerated in the digital overdrive. Perspective; Chapter I: The Party . Artists: Rose Troche, Morris May . A young college woman attends a party with the intention of shedding her ""shy girl"" persona. At the same party, a young man is after a similar reinvention. They meet, drink, and misinterpreted signals turn into things that cannot be undone. Virutal reality simulators let viewers experience both characters. Possibilia . Artists: Daniel Kwan, Daniel Scheinert . Possibilia is a multi-layered narrative experience from acclaimed directing duo the Daniels. The story of two quarreling lovers splits exponentially into more and more possible worlds as their relationship unravels. Project Syria . Artists: Nonny de la Pe√±a . More than one million children have fled Syria and news reports indicate children are being specifically targeted in the violence. By combining pioneering virtual reality technologies with audio and video captured during a real event, audiences feel transported to the powerful scene, becoming witnesses as the intense tragedy unfolds. The VR works of Felix & Paul . Artists: F√©lix Lajeunesse, Paul Rapha√´l . Felix & Paul's groundbreaking live-action virtual reality experiences range from independent documentary to fictional work with major Hollywood studios and stars. These experiences let viewers sit in the room with musicians making music, roam the Mongolian plains with yak herders, and experience an encounter with the afterlife. Way to Go . Artists: Vincent Morisset . It is a walk in the woods. It is an astonishing online and virtual reality interactive experience, a restless panorama, a mixture of hand-made animation, 360-degree video capture, music, dreaming, and code; but mostly it is a walk in the woods, c'mon! Zero Point . Artist: Danfung Dennis . Zero Point, a 3-D and 360-degree documentary for the Oculus Rift headset, creates an entirely new digital dimension. From combat training simulations at the Department of Defense to research labs at Stanford to indie game developers and hackers, this immersive experience highlights the future of virtual reality.

"When I visit Jerusalem and the West Bank, I frequently ask young Arabs about their views on Hamas. In almost every discussion, Christians and Muslims alike refuse to label Hamas as a ""terrorist"" organization. When I raise criticism of Hamas and its targeting of innocent civilians, my comments never register. The responses are some variation of ""Israel has taken over our lands and killed thousands of Arab civilians over the years. Hamas is only resisting occupation and fighting for our rights."" I hear similar sentiments in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and even non-Arab Pakistan. Al-Jazeera Arabic gives prominence to the popular Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who has repeatedly called suicide bombings against Israelis not terrorism, but ""martyrdom."" He argues that since Israelis all serve in the military, they are not civilians. Even children, he despicably argues, are not innocent. They would grow up to serve in the military. Qaradawi is not alone. I can name tens of Muslim clerics, important formulators of public opinion in a region dominated by religion, that will readily condemn acts of terrorism against the West, but will fall silent when it comes to condemning Hamas or Islamic Jihad. Put simply, support for violent resistance against Israel among Arab and Muslim-majority countries -- including allies of the United States such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia -- remains popular. Opinion: How this could be the last Gaza war . Hamas benefits from that support. From radical Iran to moderate Tunisia, Hamas' Prime Minister Ismail Haniyyeh was welcomed by vast cheering crowds during visits this year. In a new Middle East, where popular opinion matters more than ever before, to demand that people condemn Hamas is a political nonstarter. It won't happen. Israel's talk of Hamas terrorism has failed to convince the Muslim and Arab masses. And worse, the label of ""terror"" loses its importance when entire populations, essentially, see nothing wrong with Hamas's violent activities. In short, Israel's strategy has failed to win Muslim hearts and minds. In the long term, it cannot continue to rely on military superiority and Western support in the face of popular hostility. Israel is a nation in the Middle East, and it needs to find a home and place among its increasingly democratic neighbors. The old ideas of ""we do not talk to terrorists"" are not only strategically futile, but also untrue. Timeline: Israel-Gaza conflict . In order to secure the release of kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Israelis (in both official and unofficial capacities) negotiated with Hamas. In spite of the Netanyahu government's bluster about refusing to deal with Hamas now, securing a cease-fire involves doing exactly that with the help of Egypt's new Islamist government. In the past, Israel refused to talk with the PLO and Yasser Arafat, and in 1988, despite Israel's intransigence, the United States opened a dialogue with the PLO and thereby helped steer the organization to its nonviolent politics today. Similar examples abound in recent history from South Africa, where Margaret Thatcher once called the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela terrorists, to Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein. Opinion: Messages of Gaza violence -- Hamas can't be ignored . In short, when the political calculations shift, the actions of terrorists are altered. Lest we forget, George Washington was labeled a terrorist by the British. But that label carried little weight amid his support base in America. Today, Israel's labels of terrorist mean nothing to the people of the region. Newly empowered, their views and attitudes matter. Israel cannot continue to swim against the tide. For its own security, to strengthen the interests of the United States in the region and to show recognition of the changes that are sweeping the entire Middle East, Israel needs to change. It must talk directly with Hamas. The old game is over. Hamas is here to stay. In 2004 Israel killed its founder Ahmed Yassin, and then his successor Abdel Aziz Rantisi Rantissi and now the head of its military wing, Ahmed al-Ja'abar, each time vowing to weaken Hamas, only to see it return stronger. Those mistakes cannot be repeated again. To demand that Hamas abandon violence, change its charter, or recognize Israel is not the beginning, but should be the end results of a peace process that builds trust over a period of time. To impose these as preconditions and thereby exclude Hamas, while also neglecting the Fatah government in the West Bank, is to give a clear message to Arabs that no strategy (that of Fatah or Hamas) is to Israel's liking. Such perceived arrogance further alienates populations in important countries such as Turkey and Egypt, not to mention the Palestinians. The United States needs these newly emerging democracies on its side. Better relations with 300 million Arabs helps secure Israel too. A stronger America in the region is good news for Israel. A tiny nation of seven million cannot be allowed to damage ties between 360 million Americans and 300 million Arabs. Conversely, Arabs have a duty to recognize Israel as home to the children of Abraham, the descendants of Moses. Opinion: Israel's mission in Gaza is not about security . Across the Arab world, from Tunisia to Yemen, we are witnessing turmoil and the rise of violent Salafi organizations. Attacks on U.S. embassies recently served as a potent reminder of the forces that are being unleashed. Israel can help itself, its neighbors and the United States by at least ending its old tactics of war and embracing the Arab peace plan offered since 2002 by Saudi Arabia and endorsed by the Arab League. It is time for Israel to act like the democracy it claims to be and end the siege of Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank.","Ed Husain: In Middle East visits he notes clerics, young Arabs don't view Hamas as terrorist .
Husain: There's support for violent resistance against Israel among Arab, Muslim countries .
He says Israel's might won't bring peace; time to make Hamas part of process .
Husain: Israel should end war tactics, embrace Arab peace plan offered since 2002 ."
"For a country that ditched monarchical rule, America has some of the most intriguing ""castles"" in the world. OK, maybe not castles in the classic sense. To visit a fortress where ancient monarchs slept on stone pillows and knights bickered about grails, you'll still have to fly across the pond. But for a different sort of castle -- the kind redefined by Gilded Age names such as Vanderbilt and Ringling, by proud Polynesian monarchs or by the occasional heartbroken Latvian-Floridian stonemason -- the United States is home to a melting pot of historic domiciles that would blow an 11th-century Scottish king's mind. Here we crown seven favorites whose gates are open to gaping plebeians. King of Cottages: The Breakers (Newport, Rhode Island) Story: In 1893 Cornelius Vanderbilt II, heir to the New York Central Railroad, commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to design this palatial summer home inspired by 16th-century Genoan palazzos. The largest and grandest of Newport's famous ""cottages"" (colossal leisure homes erected by America's turn-of-the-century baron class), the Breakers was created in just a few years by a team of 2,500 craftsmen from around the world. Specs: Located on a 13-acre cliff-side estate overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, the 70-room house covers 126,000 square feet from attic to basement to mezzanine. Standout rooms include a 22-carat gold-leaf-adorned Great Hall stretching 50 feet in every direction (including overhead) and a two-story, alabaster-columned dining room featuring enormous Baccarat crystal chandeliers and a table for 32. Stopping by: Now in the hands of the Preservation Society of Newport County, the Breakers is one of the five most-visited homes in the country. One-hour audio tours cover about 20 rooms on the first and second floors. The Breakers, 424 Bellevue Ave., Newport, Rhode Island; +1 401 847 1000; admission $19.50 . Little Brother Complex: Biltmore (Asheville, North Carolina) Story: George Washington Vanderbilt II clearly had bigger ideas than simply one-upping older sibling Cornelius (of the Breakers) with this massive, 1890s French chateau plunked on the edge of North Carolina's Smoky Mountains. But when you use the same architect to dwarf your big brother's Newport fortress, there's probably some family competition etched into the blueprints. Specs: America's largest privately owned residence occupies 175,000 square feet (or more than four acres) of floor space -- with 250 rooms, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces, three kitchens, an indoor swimming pool, gymnasium and a bowling alley in the basement. Estate holdings include original Renoir paintings, Napoleon's chess set, a 25,000-volume library and a pair of John Singer Sargent portraits of the Hunt and Biltmore landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, the man behind New York's Central Park. Stopping by: The 8,000-acre estate receives more than a million annual guests. Five specialty tours of the house include a ""behind the scenes"" glimpse at some of its lesser-visited areas -- including the butler's pantry and Biltmore's catacomb-like sub-basement. Private bus rides through the property are also available. Biltmore, One Lodge St., Asheville, North Carolina; +1 800 411 3812; admission varies seasonally from $44 to $69 . Forlorn Fortress: Coral Castle (Miami) Story: Heartbroken 26-year-old Edward Leedskalnin would never love another woman after 16-year-old Agnes Scuffs broke off their engagement a day before their wedding. Over the next 28 years, the eccentric Latvian-American artisan would -- as a testimony to lost love, it's been said -- dedicate his life to single-handedly sculpting a massive castellated compound comprised of locally harvested coral rock. Now on the National Register of Historic Places, the place has been called ""America's Stonehenge"" and still leaves engineers wondering how a short, 100-pound fellow with a fourth grade education did all this using homemade hand tools and unrequited love. Spect: Within its eight-foot-high, three-foot-thick walls, Coral Castle uses approximately 1,100 tons of coral rock -- including a stone sculpture garden with Flintstones-style furniture (500-pound rocking chairs that work), a nine-ton gate that moves with ease and a home-carved Polaris telescope. Stopping by: Just north of Homestead in South Miami, the Coral Castle Museum is open every day, with audio stands that broadcast in several languages and guided tours also available. Coral Castle, 28655 South Dixie Highway, Miami; +1 305 248 6345; admission $15 . Auto Heir's Opus: Edsel & Eleanor Ford House (Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan) Story: Edsel Ford, lone son of auto titan Henry, would become president of Ford Motor Company by age 25, posing him the challenge of living up to his father's hulking legacy while setting his own bar over the next quarter century. In addition to legendary cars like the Lincoln Continental, Edsel would build an English Cotsworld-style family estate that -- for sheer style, taste and grandeur -- tops dad's Fair Lane digs in nearby Dearborn. Specs: A bold blend of classic European and modern (1930s) styles, the 60-room, 20,000-square-foot house designed by famed architect Albert Kahn is set on 87 lakefront acres in the heart of southeast Michigan's Gold Coast. An extensive collection of art, period furniture and antiquities includes two Cezanne oil paintings, an original Diego Rivera and stained-glass window medallions dating to the 14th century. Stopping by: Standard 50-minute guided tours explore the home's major rooms, including the English-baronial-style gallery and a contrasting art deco room done by eminent industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague. Behind-the-scenes and special interest tours delve deeper into the property and its stunning grounds. Edsel & Eleanor Ford House, 1100 Lake Shore Road, Grosse Pointe Shores, MI; +1 313 884 4222; admission to all areas $15 . California Headliner: Hearst Castle (San Simeon, California) Story: Hearst Castle's predecessor was Camp Hill, a tract of ranchland on the central California coast acquired by 19th-century mining magnate George Hearst for family campouts. After inheriting the property in 1919, George's son -- newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst -- reportedly told noted architect Julia Morgan, ""We're tired of camping out in the open ... I would like to build a little something."" Specs: More than 28 years and 80,000 square feet later, the estate boasted the 115-room Casa Grande and three Mediterranean Revival-style guesthouses, with 27 acres of gardens. Borrowing from just about every classic European style, castle highlights include the spectacular Neptune pool, an indescribably ornate main library (one of two on the property), Mr. Hearst's private Gothic suite and one of the world's most extensive (and manically collected) stashes of art and artifacts. Stopping by: Now a California State Park, the property offers four separate tours covering various floors of Casa Grande and the areas of the estate. A special Evening Tour (spring and fall only) lets visitors experience the mansion at twilight while docents play out the roles of 1930s houseguests and staff. Hearst Castle, 750 Hearst Castle Road, San Simeon, California; +1 800 444 4445; admissions start at $25 . Greatest Showpiece on Earth: Ca' d'Zan (Sarasota, Florida) Story: Inspired by their favorite Tuscan villas and Venetian palaces, circus tycoon John Ringling and his wife, Mable, built a 1920s Mediterranean Revival-style dream home that would become known as ""the last of the Gilded Age mansions"" -- and the best place for a Gatsby-style party in southwest Florida. Falling into state hands (and some neglect) after Ringling's death in 1936, the huge waterfront mansion overlooking Sarasota Bay entered its second heyday with a recent $15 million restoration effort. Specs: The 36,000-square-foot, five-story (plus full basement) property totals 56 rooms, including 15 bathrooms. It's adorned with Gothic arches, Mexican onyx columns, priceless 17th-century tapestries and a custom-made 1892 Steinway piano in the two-story great court, dolloped with an 81-foot Belvedere tower. Stopping by: Docent-led tours of the mansion's main living space and a special Private Places tour through less frequented areas run daily. After the house tour, you can see the estate's famous art museum, which houses one of the nation's finest collections of 17-century Baroque works.

Royal Relic: 'Iolani Palace (Honolulu) Story: The only former official residence of a reigning monarch on U.S. soil, 'Iolani Palace was Hawaii's grandest symbol when it was completed in 1882. Occupied by Hawaii's last two monarchs before American annexation, the palace would subsequently be used as a Red Cross dressing station and the state's first capitol building. Today, the National Historic Landmark is a museum open to the public. Specs: Filled with imported furnishings, royal gifts and art from around the world, the 34,104-square-foot royal abode featured late-19th-century technological luxuries like electric lighting (installed in 1887, four years before the White House) and telephones. Highlights include the Grand Hall, lined with portraits of Hawaiian monarchs, the crimson-gold Throne Rome where King Kalakaua hosted grand balls and state dinners, and the Blue Room, which features a giant portrait of King Louis Philippe of France received in 1848. Stopping by: Docent-led and guided audio tours let guests explore 'Iolani Palace's first and second floors. Guests can peruse Hawaiian regalia exhibits in the basement gallery and explore the spacious grounds, which include the old royal barracks and Coronation Pavilion where Kalakaua was crowned king in 1883.

"""With a bang,"" George Strother told reporters when asked how his morning started. A BMW sport utility vehicle crashed through the roof of the family's garage in Escondido, California, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. ""My wife thought it was an earthquake, she was really freaked out,"" Strother later said. The Strothers' house sits below street level, so an out-of-control car that careened off the roadway could land on top of the garage. ""The first thing that we saw,"" Strother said to reporters, ""the BMW that had come through the roof had landed on the hood of our (Nissan) Pathfinder."" Police and firefighters stood by while a tow truck pulled the luxury SUV through the ceiling, into the garage, and dragged it out and across the driveway using the tow truck cables. What remains, according to Strother, is ""a hole big enough to drive a BMW SUV through,"" though he believes there is little overall structural damage to the garage. The driver has not been located, Lt. Eric Skaja of the Escondido police told CNN by phone, and the automobile is a dealer loaner car. The person to whom the vehicle was loaned has been identified, but has not come forward or been arrested so far. The police currently are investigating the incident as a misdemeanor hit and run. If it turns out the driver was under the influence, Skaja said the penalty for a DUI is significantly more serious than the penalty for a misdemeanor hit and run. The Strothers, though, were never in danger. Their bedroom is at the other end of the house.","BMW crashes through roof of garage at house that sits lower than street level .

"Vice President Joe Biden is known for his off-the-cuff remarks, and sometimes, they get him into trouble. The latest example came last week when Biden told an audience at Harvard that ISIS had been inadvertently strengthened by Turkey and the United Arab Emirates -- two U.S. allies. Because the two countries had supplied Syrian rebels with money and weapons, Biden said they had essentially funded extremist elements in the region. His comments drew sharp pushback from leaders of those countries, and Biden apologized days later. Here are five other moments when Biden spoke his mind, only to have it come back to bite him. 1. Same-sex marriage: Biden apologized to President Barack Obama in May 2012 after he put the President in a tough position by coming out in support of same-sex marriage ahead of his boss. In an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Biden said he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage. The problem was that Obama was still ""evolving"" on his stance at the time. But days after Biden's remarks, Obama announced his own support for same-sex marriage. He said on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that Biden ""probably got out a little bit over his skis, but out of generosity of spirit."" Obama added that he would have ""preferred to have done this in my own way, on my own terms,"" but ""all's well that ends well."" 2. BFD: Biden's most colorful slip-up was his use of the catchphrase ""big f***ing deal."" That's how he described the passage and signing of Obama's signature health care reform law in 2010. Biden had tried to keep his comment quiet -- he whispered it to Obama at the signing ceremony -- but a host of cameras and microphones in the room were able to pick it up. And with an emerging social media environment that's especially friendly to ever-shorter quotes, the acronym ""BFD"" became even more popular. 3. LaGuardia: As anyone who's traveled through New York's LaGuardia Airport can attest, the transit hub is in dire need of upkeep. Biden famously compared it to a ""Third-World country"" this year. ""If I blindfolded someone and took them at 2 o'clock in the morning into the airport in Hong Kong and said 'where do you think you are?' They would say, 'this must be America. This is a modern airport,' "" Biden said. ""If I took them blindfolded and took them to LaGuardia Airport in New York, he would, like, 'I must be in some Third-World country.' I'm not joking."" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called the analogy ""inappropriate"" and said the vice president's comments were ""not his finest moment."" 4. New catchphrase? ""Isn't that a b----"": While he was offending the Turks and other allies in the fight against ISIS, Biden gave perhaps a Freudian slip on his view about being No. 2 in the Obama administration. During a Q&A segment, a questioner introduced himself as the vice president of the student body. ""Isn't that a b****?"" a smiling Biden said. ""I mean ... excuse me. The vice president thing."" Biden quickly followed up: ""I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking. Best decision I ever made. I'm joking -- that was a joke."" The student told Biden that he hopes he loves being vice president. ""I do, actually. I love the guy I work with,"" Biden said. 5. Obama will be tested: Just weeks before the 2008 presidential election, Biden predicted that Obama would have a bumpy start to his presidency -- not exactly the message that Obama, who was criticized for his lack of experience, wanted to convey. ""Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy,"" Biden told Democratic fundraisers. ""The world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old senator President of the United States of America."" ""Remember I said it standing here, if you don't remember anything else I said,"" Biden continued. ""Watch, we're going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy."" We'll let you be the judge on these: Was he telling the truth, or at least what he thinks is the truth? #awkward: Hillary Clinton might have been a better pick: Not long after Obama chose Biden as his running mate and the bruising battle between Obama and Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, Biden sought to prop up Clinton but may have taken it a step too far. ""Make no mistake about this, Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice president of the United States of America. Let's get that straight,"" he said at a New Hampshire town hall when a voter told Biden he was glad the then-Delaware senator had been chosen and not Clinton. ""She's a truly close personal friend, and she is qualified to be president of the United States of America. She's easily qualified to be vice president of the United States of America, and quite frankly, it might have been a better pick than me,"" he continued. Obama went on to pick Clinton as his secretary of state, and she served during his first four years as president. Clinton and Biden are now considering 2016 presidential reruns, but it's highly doubtful Biden will repeat that remark. But then again, you never know. White boy can jump: At an event this year honoring African-American history month, Biden said he and former NBA star Kevin Johnson, now Sacramento's mayor, could take on the President in a game of hoops. ""I told the President, next game I have him,"" Biden said. ""Just remember I may be a white boy, but I can jump."" He probably regrets this one: In a June 2006 appearance in New Hampshire, Biden talked with an Indian-American about his positive relationships with the Indian-American community in Delaware. With his Hollywood smile, he added a well-intentioned but cringe-worthy assessment of the group's growing population in Delaware. ""You cannot go into a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. Oh, I'm not joking.""","Joe Biden apologized this weekend for yet another verbal slip-up .
He's made several well-intentioned though oddly timed or inarticulate gaffes ."
"House Republicans recognize they have a problem with women. ""Some of our members just aren't as sensitive as they ought to be."" House Speaker John Boehner said bluntly when asked about recent efforts by the House GOP campaign arm to improve how male candidates appeal to female voters. Boehner didn't name names, but much of the damage with female voters is self-inflicted, and stems from some high-profile gaffes from GOP Senate candidates in 2012. Missouri GOP Senate candidate Todd Akin referred to ""legitimate rape"" and Richard Mourdock in Indiana suggested rape was ""something God intended to happen."" Both red-state candidates were favored to win but lost badly. In the presidential race, the already noticeable gender gap between women supporting Democratic candidates over Republicans widened; women preferred President Barack Obama over challenger Mitt Romney by 11 percentage points. Mindful of the damage done, the National Republican Congressional Committee is teaching male candidates who are running against female challengers or incumbents how to respond to specific questions about rape. The effort is part of the NRCC's overall media training it conducts each cycle. A senior House Republican strategist familiar with the training told CNN this is just one aspect of helping candidates effectively talk to voters. But after the Akin and Mourdock missteps, this Republican said GOP candidates must be prepared to answer questions about sensitive subjects like rape. ""First and foremost what we tell them to do (is) talk about yourself as a husband and a father,"" this source told CNN, adding, ""After that we urge a blanket statement about rape is abhorrent: 'Anyone who is charged with this offense should be fully prosecuted, and as a husband and father I am outraged.'"" Boehner also pointed to the obvious issue facing his party: There are a lot more female Democratic House members than Republicans. Only 19 of the 232 House GOP members are women. Earlier this year the House GOP campaign arm launched Project GROW to recruit more female candidates and improve how the party frames issues to female voters. The GOP strategist familiar with the effort said it's not just about avoiding mistakes and improving messaging -- the party also is playing offense. Republicans believe Obamacare gives them the chance to win over women by talking about the premiums their families will pay or the so-called ""marriage penalty"" they believe will hit many people's pocketbooks. The party also encourages GOP members to humanize themselves and stress the impact that fiscal issues have on their own families. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Thursday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor tried to link the GOP's focus on reining in the deficit to his daughter, who is in college. ""She's off now thinking about her next step in life, what kind of career or job opportunities are available for her,"" he said. ""Well, I don't believe that racking up trillions of dollars of additional deficit and debt are a good thing for her because, ultimately, what that does is it mortgages her future."" The NRCC effort is more than messaging -- the party is urging candidates to create and sustain efforts to reach out to women, regardless of whether or not they are facing female challengers. Strategists are suggesting building coalitions of female supporters and regularly attending events such as PTA meetings. As for the advice he would give to his colleagues who are facing off against female candidates next fall, Boehner said, ""Well, I'm trying to get them to be a little bit more sensitive."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who frequently touts the diversity of the Democratic caucus, quipped that Republicans have ""made an art of running against women in ways that we think are inappropriate."" But she added, ""It would be interesting to see what they have in their curriculum."" Iowa Republican Rep. Tom Latham, a close ally of Boehner, is in a competitive race with Democrat Staci Appel, a former state senator. He doesn't think there are major differences on which issues men and women care about, but said it's a matter of emphasis. ""I think there are maybe some priority differences in issues that women are very concerned about -- available time, they are very concerned about budgets, because they run the place. The cost and access to health care is a big issue to them,"" Latham said. But when asked if he thinks there's any continued fallout for GOP members a year after Akin's comments, Latham paused deliberately and then said, ""It's extremely unfortunate what some people will say that may reflect badly on other people who don't share those views."" Tennessee GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn said she's given her Republican male colleagues ""gentle guidance"" for some time on the need to address issues that are important to women and to show how their legislative agenda will make their lives easier. Although she says the effort is overdue, Blackburn is heartened that her party is dealing with the issue head-on now. ""There is an aggressiveness that has not been in there forever,"" she told CNN. ""We've never been this aggressive and I'm glad and I think it's time. We all should be a bit more aware in how we choose our words.""","House Speaker John Boehner said Republican candidates need to be more ""sensitive""

"March 14 is my favorite day to be a nerd. Across the country, math geeks in museums, schools, private groups and elsewhere gather to celebrate the number pi, approximately 3.14. That's why March 14 -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day. What's more, Albert Einstein was born on this day. A quick refresher: Pi is defined as the distance around a perfect circle, or the circumference, divided by the distance across it, or the diameter. It is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences. Throughout history, people have been captivated by this number because there is no way to calculate it exactly by a simple division on your calculator. What's more, its digits go on infinitely, without any pattern in the numbers. 3.1415926535897932 ... etc. Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music. On Pi Day, one number 'reeks of mystery' Math may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day. One might even say -- gasp! -- it's cool to like pi these days. Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009. In countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi. ""And so Pi Day is an acquired taste,"" mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail. Conveniently, ""pi"" sounds like ""pie,"" and pies are round. You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza. If you're in enrolled in school, your math class or math department might be doing something special already. But if you happen to live in a particularly pi-happy place, you might be able to take part in some larger-scale, pi-inspired activities. Where Pi Day began . If you want to go where the day is said to be ""invented,"" look no further than San Francisco's Exploratorium. Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, began the tradition in 1988. Last year was Pi Day's 25th anniversary there. Pi Day began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff. Now it's a public pi extravaganza featuring a ""Pi procession,"" whose attendees get a number -- 0 to 9 -- and line up in the order of pi's digits: 3.14159265 ... you get the idea. The parade ends at the ""pi shrine"" -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year. For those who can't attend in person, the Exploratorium has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes ""irrational exhibits, fireworks, cheerleaders, music, and dancing."" The museum also lists a bunch of educational activities to teach about the concept of pi. On Pi Day, is 'pi' under attack? Where Einstein lived . On the opposite coast, the leafy university town where Albert Einstein spent the last 22 years of his life is showing community-wide exuberance for pi. Princeton, New Jersey, kicks off Pi Day weekend on Thursday night with a reading by physicist Charles Adler, then heads into a full day of activities on Friday, including a walking tour of Einstein's neighborhood and a pizza pie-making contest. The pie-eating contest takes place at McCaffrey's supermarket, while an Einstein look-alike competition will match mustaches and wild gray hair at the Princeton Public Library. Pi fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show off and compete at the library, where the winner among 7- to 13-year-olds can take home a cool pi-hundred (That is, $314.15). The Historical Society of Princeton will have an Einstein birthday party. Tetsuya Miyamoto, inventor of the KENKEN puzzle, will speak at the library as well. Here are 10,000 digits of pi for you to memorize . The ""brainiac town"" residents ""love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are,"" said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009. ""A lot of them get super into it."" Last year about 9,000 people participated, she said. Along with her fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a town-wide Pi Day after she heard that the Princeton University mathematics department celebrates March 14 with pie-eating and pi-reciting (As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006). Even more pi . Chicago is getting into the pi business too. Lots of restaurants and bakeries are offering Pi Day specials. The Illinois Science Council and Fleet Feet Sports are hosting a 3.14-mile walk/run Friday night, with discounts for anyone named Albert, Alberta or Albertina. Philly.com highlights two options for satisfying your pie cravings in the City of Brotherly Love. Bostonians can head to Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Pi Time (3:14 p.m.) for pi-themed activities such as ""Throw Pie at Your Best Friend on High-Speed Camera."" The Museum of Science in Boston has educational Pi Day events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will celebrate too. Even the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as ""Dali loved the irrational numbers Pi and Phi, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art,"" according to the museum. If you live in the area, check out their schedule of math-inspired films and tours throughout the day. There are plenty of online resources too, such as piday.org. Outside of the physical classroom, Pi Day will be celebrated online through Google's virtual classroom project. David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book ""The Joy of Pi,"" is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory. How did Pi Day become such a big thing? Blatner says that Pi Day has become a hit for the same reason the new ""Cosmos"" TV show is getting so much attention. ""People all around the world are hungry to make science and math fun and interesting,"" he said in an e-mail. ""We know math and science is important, we know that it's fascinating, but we often don't know how to make it fun and interesting. Pi Day gives us a great excuse to throw away our fear of math and say 'Hey, it IS kind of neat!' "" If you agree, just wait until 3/14/15 -- or as one popular Facebook group calls it, ""The Only Pi Day of Our Lives."" That's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415, and we're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection. So get ready next year to take a picture of your digital clock on 3/14/15 at 9:26:53 a.m. That'll be worth more than a thousand digits. Follow Elizabeth Landau on Twitter at @lizlandau .

"At least four people have been shot dead and hundreds injured as demonstrators clash with police over new laws limiting the right to protest in Ukraine, the head of the protest movement's volunteer medical service, Oleg Musiy, told CNN on Wednesday. Ukraine's Interior Ministry earlier said it was investigating a death, the circumstances of which are not clear. Local media reports suggest the man may have fallen from a statue or monument. In a statement Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf condemned the growing violence, particularly against journalists and peaceful protesters. ""Increased tensions in Ukraine are a direct consequence of the Ukrainian government's failure to engage in real dialogue and the passage of anti-democratic legislation on January 16,"" Harf said. ""We urge the Government of Ukraine to take steps that represent a better way forward for Ukraine, including repeal of the anti-democratic legislation and beginning a national dialogue with the political opposition."" iReport: Video shows heavy clashes between police, protesters . The leaders of three opposition factions met with President Viktor Yanukovych and a government working group Wednesday to try to resolve the crisis, the President's official website said. They are Vitali Klitschko, leader of the UDAR party; Arseniy Yatsenyuk, of the Fatherland party; and Oleh Tiahnybok, of the Freedom party, or Svoboda. A statement on Yanukovych's website said the first stage of negotiations -- a meeting of more than three hours -- had ended. Klitschko accused Yanukovych's government of having the blood of protesters on its hands. ""We did not receive any answers,"" Klitschko told demonstrators after the meeting, referring to calls for snap elections and the resignation of the government. ""When we talked about canceling the new laws that make each of us here a criminal, we heard that maybe this can be a point of negotiations. I will be with the people. If I have to fight, I will fight.  If I have to go under bullets, I will. I will stand up for the people, because I want to live in a different country."" He added, amid the chants of supporters: ""If tomorrow the President does not make a step forward, we will attack."" Demonstrators have been rallying in the snowy streets since the weekend in protest against the laws that went into effect Wednesday. Televised images Wednesday showed ongoing clashes between police and protesters who've massed around barricades on Hrushevskoho Street, near the burned-out shells of police buses. The Interior Ministry said Wednesday that more than 70 people have been detained since midday Sunday. The ministry said 195 police officers had been injured and 84 hospitalized since the situation turned violent Sunday. The clashes are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead. The European Union and United States have urged all parties in Ukraine to exercise restraint and find a democratic solution to the political crisis. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also warned Tuesday that the situation in Ukraine was ""getting out of control"" and urged dialogue between all the parties. UDAR posted what it said was a joint statement by the three opposition factions saying Yanukovych and Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko bear direct responsibility for the deaths of protesters. The U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, tweeted Wednesday that he was ""watching with sadness"" the events in Kiev. The U.S. Embassy in Kiev said in a prepared statement that it has ""revoked the visas of several Ukrainians who were linked to the violence"" in response to actions taken against protesters in November and December. ""Because visa records are confidential under U.S. law the Embassy will not comment on individual cases,"" it said. ""We are considering further action against those responsible for the current violence."" Masks, helmets banned . The controversial new protest laws have sparked concerns they could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech. They include provisions barring people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies, from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission, and from traveling in convoys of more than five vehicles without authorization. A separate Interior Ministry order allowing riot police to use firearms came into force Tuesday, according to the official Ukrainian legislation website. Ukraine's Institute of Mass Information, an organization promoting media rights and freedom of speech, said 36 journalists had been injured while reporting on the clashes in recent days. Ukraine's national union of journalists called on the Interior Ministry on Wednesday to issue an order forbidding police to use violence against journalists. 'Deep crisis' EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who visited protesters in Kiev last year and met with Ukraine's leaders, condemned the escalation of violence overnight and urged restraint. ""The use of force and resort to violence is not an answer to the political crisis. All acts of violence must come to an immediate end and be swiftly investigated,"" she said. ""Those responsible will have to be held to account. Ukrainian citizens' rights of assembly, freedom of expression and media must be fully respected and protected. I am deeply concerned about attacks on journalists and about reports of missing persons."" The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said he was ""shocked"" by news of protesters' deaths and called on all sides to refrain from violence. ""I would like to explicitly underline the fundamental responsibility of the Ukrainian authorities to now take action to deescalate this crisis and in particular the need for them to engage in a genuine dialogue with the opposition and with civil society on the ways to overcome this deep crisis,"" he said in a news release. ""We are also following with great concern the recent restrictions on fundamental freedoms including freedom of expression and freedom of the media."" Ukraine's future ties . In December, despite weeks of protest by anti-government demonstrators, Yanukovych agreed to a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin for Moscow to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas. The tumult in Ukraine goes to the heart of its future ties with Russia and the rest of Europe. Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. The protests have unfolded since November 21, when Yanukovych changed his stance on the EU trade pact, which had been years in the making. The demonstrators say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. Ukraine's government says the terms needed to be renegotiated to protect Ukrainians better.","Interior Ministry says more than 70 people detained since midday Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama never really had a chance when dealing with issues of race in America. From the moment he ran for office, critics questioned whether he was ""black enough"" or an ""angry black man."" As the first African-American president of the United States, Obama is supposed to prove America is post-racial, be the president of ""all of America"" and show a special empathy for African-Americans, all while battling institutional racism but not calling it out. While these debates are largely philosophical and symbolic, the nationwide protests in the wake of the non-indictments of police officers responsible for killing Mike Brown and Eric Garner have shown that race can no longer just be an academic subject for presidents and presidential contenders. The crowds marching across America protesting the ugly intersection of racism, law enforcement and economics are some of the largest, most diverse groups of protesters seen in American history. These issues are going to be laid at the doorstep of all serious 2016 contenders. So while many are grappling with the events of the last several months, we're left to wonder: Where's Hillary Clinton? We all know that, barring some bizarre unforeseen event, Clinton is running for president in 2016, and it's only a matter of time before she announces. She will not march smoothly to the nomination; there are questions about how much she connects with the middle class, her muddled book rollout this spring and of course, for those who still care, ""Benghazi."" But the most serious problem for Hillary 2016 is the perception that she's an overly cautious politician who is afraid to take tough stances on anything, especially those issues the Democratic base might be passionate about. And nowhere is this more evident than in her almost utter silence on the recent protest marches across the nation. Hillary Clinton took almost 19 days before she said anything about the violence and rioting in Ferguson, Missouri, and that was after Democrats and pundits called her out for her silence. At the time she said: . ""Imagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers were three times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop as black drivers instead of the other way around. If white offenders received prison sentences 10% longer than black offenders for the same crimes. If a third of all white men -- just look at this room and take one-third -- went to prison during their lifetime. Imagine that. That is the reality in the lives of so many of our fellow Americans in so many of the communities in which they live."" Which was fine, at the time -- better late than never. Mind you, she slipped these comments in at a tech conference where the majority of her comments would focus on other issues. Clinton seemed to have learned her lesson after a New York grand jury did not indict officers in the killing of Eric Garner. She only waited two days to say something about the result : . ""Each of us has to grapple with some hard truths about race and justice in America, because despite all the progress we've made together, African-Americans, most particularly African-American men, are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to long prison terms."" But again, these comments were tagged onto a speech she was giving at a women's conference in Massachusetts and hardly echoed beyond the walls of the building where she was speaking. While Republican 2016 contender Rand Paul can come right out and say police militarization is a problem and that the officer who killed Garner should be fired, Hillary Clinton talks about restoring ""balance."" While former President George W. Bush admits that he found the grand jury decision ""hard to understand,"" Clinton is backing limited measures, including police body cameras, contained in Obama's executive actions resulting from the Ferguson controversy. While Obama is sitting down to do a serious interview about race, law and justice on BET, Clinton is doing events with Prince William and Catherine in New York. The point is that while other political leaders who hope to lead this country can take the time out to seriously address the longest-running protests in American history since the Montgomery bus boycott, Hillary Clinton sandwiches her comments in at the tail end of paid speaking engagements and keeps it moving. That seems a little tone-deaf. And this isn't the first time Clinton has shown this penchant for avoiding thorny cultural and racial issues on the not-quite-yet-campaign trail. She assiduously avoided addressing race in a town hall interview earlier this year on CNN. And one has to wonder if she would've said anything about the George Zimmerman verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin if she hadn't been giving a speech at the convention of Delta Sigma Theta (a black sorority) the night the verdict came in. She certainly hasn't said much about it since. If Clinton thinks she's being smart by avoiding thorny race issues on the campaign trail, she's making a huge mistake. Maybe Team Clinton thinks that whatever support she may lose in the African-American vote will be made up for by high turnout among white women. The problem with that logic is that these protests from New York to Chicago to Detroit, to Cleveland, to San Diego, Los Angeles and even St. Louis are incredibly diverse. Take a look at the crowds in Times Square after the Garner verdict and you could see white, Latino, Asian, African-American, old, young and other demonstrators all carrying signs that read ""Black Lives Matter."" A new NBC News/Marist poll shows that 47% of Americans believe that the justice system applies different standards to blacks and whites. In other words, the people out there marching right now are the Democratic base, with a few independents and libertarians thrown in there for good measure. This is the coalition that Clinton needs to win the presidency, and on the most important issue in decades she's not only not '""ready to lead,"" she doesn't seem to have much to say, and when she does speak on these issues it's always as an afterthought to some larger message. America is being wracked by nationwide protests and thousands of Americans of all colors are questioning the fundamental fairness of the American justice system. Boycotts are happening, malls are being shut down and transportation all across America is being affected by protests during the biggest shopping season of the year, because many Americans are unhappy with our justice system. No one expects Clinton to be out in Times Square marching with the #ICantBreathe hashtag plastered across her cheek. But if she decides she wants to be serious about being elected president of the United States, she needs to do more and say more than a few throwaway comments in the midst of her busy speaking and fund-raising schedule. The foot soldiers for Clinton's political future are out marching in the cold, marching toward the change they want to see in America. Clinton might want to catch up to them, because if she doesn't, I'm sure Rand Paul, Elizabeth Warren or Andrew Cuomo would be happy to do so.

"Anyone who rents a car in Iceland is immediately handed a map of the country on which most of the landscape is marked out of bounds. Any attempt to leave the main highway results in splutters of indignation from in-car GPS units. This area, the computer complains, isn't suitable for such a tiny rental vehicle. Turn back now. It's a tough call, because the places they don't want us to go in our little cars are some of the most alluring on Earth. These are the mighty, brooding volcanoes that dominate Iceland's skyline. Some slumbering, some angrily spewing out rivers of lava and cloudy torrents of ash. They're not impossible to reach though. Not if you call in the experts. For me, this means meeting Kiddi, an Icelandic guide who possesses an engaging grasp of deadpan humor, and an understated passion for his country's geological wonders. Crucially, he also owns several enormous 4x4 trucks with tires big enough to crush my whining GPS and the car it came in. Our goal for the day is Eyjafjallajokull, the volcano with the unpronounceable name that in 2010 sent plumes of dangerous silica dust into the atmosphere, disrupting European air travel and stranding millions of passengers. The main show is a couple of hours out of Reykjavik, but there are plenty of warmup acts along the way. We check out Heidmork, a petrified red lava field beyond the city limits where early Icelandic highway builders harvested construction materials in the days when less care was taken over preserving the country's topography. Icy stalagmites . We ascend through clouds of stinking sulfur near a geothermal power plant at Hellisheidarvirkjun, past acres of volcanically heated greenhouses at Hveragerdi and pause briefly for a photo op at Urridafoss, a semi-frozen waterfall surrounded by icy stalagmites. ""Can you see how some of the sheep take bigger risks grazing right on the edge?"" asks Kiddi, pointing to some woolly creatures munching on the precipice leading to the waterfall. I'm expecting some insight into Icelandic fauna at this point, but that's not really how Kiddi rolls. ""Stupid animals,"" he adds. ""The grass tastes the same wherever they eat."" In the shadow of Eyjafjallajokull we pause by Seljalandsfoss, a 60-meter spout of meltwater from the volcano's snow-capped summit. A treacherously icy trail leads behind the roaring curtain of water. Kiddi also takes me to the Gljufrabui, another giant water plume hidden nearby in cavernous mossy grotto. Then we're off the main road and ascending the side of the volcano, powering up above the snowline along a cinder track. Suddenly we veer off into a brilliant wasteland of drifting white powder. Here the enormous studded tires that have been thudding the 4x4 along the road from Reykjavik come into their own, sloshing through iced-over streams and clawing their way up steep banks of snow. When the wheels begin to spin, we stop to let air out of the tires for better traction. ""In the summer, you wouldn't believe how many tourists we find stuck out here,"" says Kiddi, shaking his head. ""They think they can drive here in their little cars."" Geothermal bathing . Prejudices against small vehicles aside, Kiddi's hit on an issue facing Iceland as it encourages more visitors to revive an economy battered by a 2008 banking collapse. The country is gambling on being able to attract millions of visitors in coming years, but there are questions over whether the infrastructure of its wild and sometimes dangerous attractions is capable of handling them. And while roaring up the side of a snow-covered volcano in a bright orange 4x4 might not seem the most ecological of options, in the hands of skilled guide it's a environmentally friendlier option than unsupervised mass roaming. It's crazy fun too, especially when Kiddi lets me have a go at the wheel. There can't be many things more thrilling than driving a monster truck across the side of a snow-covered volcano -- gunning the engine to crest icy ridges and swerving around huge boulders scattered by old eruptions -- and if there are, they've probably been illegal since the late '70s. We reach the limit for the 4x4, with the volcano's conical summit rising in front of us. The rest of the journey, up and over the rim into the now-dormant caldera, requires the use of Kiddi's snowmobiles. Although Eyjafjallajokull is our destination today, itineraries can include other volcanoes reached by thrilling rides across seemingly impassible landscapes. There's Hekla, to the north, overlooking a sea of beautiful black sand and a geothermal bathing pool. ""Hekla has a woman's name,"" says Kiddi. ""And she looks beautiful, but she has a temper, erupting every 10 or 15 years."" Others include Katla, named after a witch and reputedly haunted, and Grimsvotn, Iceland's most active volcano, where a geothermally heated glacial lake sits in a 35-kilometer wide crater. Then there's Bardarbunga. Since August, Bardarbunga has been throwing up a spectacular display of boiling magma, giving the aviation industry palpitations but at the same time making it Iceland's hottest attraction. Jay Z's birthday treat . Due to the risk from toxic gases (and hostile GPS computers), ground access to Bardarbunga is limited. The eruption at the volcano's Holuhraun lava field can be seen from chartered planes or helicopters -- Jay Z and Beyonce reportedly made a flyby ealier this month to celebrate the rapper's 45th birthday. It's such a dramatic sight that an Icelandair pilot earlier this year diverted a flight to give passengers a better look. Turning back to begin our descent of Eyjafjallajokull, Kiddi and I take in the incredible crystal-clear view of Vestmannaeyjar, an archipelago of islands formed off Iceland's southern coast by a series of volcanic eruptions. The youngest island, Surtsey, is only 50 years old and is classed as one of Iceland's several dozen volcanoes. Even on huge tires, it's a bone-jolting ride down to sea level -- but that's OK since I'll be spending the night at Reykjavik's boutique 101 Hotel (Hverfisgata 10, Reykjav√≠k; +354 580 0101), which has considerably more relaxing geothermal attractions (steam room and whirlpool) in the basement. Before we head back to the capital, we call in at a farm nestled against the base of Eyjafjallajokull. Here I meet Gudny Valberg, a retired teacher whose family has built a roadside visitor center to cope with the influx of tourists eager to see the volcano that in 2010 temporarily engulfed their farm in blizzards of ash and brought a large of the planet to a standstill. She tells me why she thinks Eyjafjallajokull exerts such a pull. ""There were 10 million affected when it erupted,"" she says. ""Because of this volcano, many people's lives changed -- they had an extra week of vacation, or they had to rent a car and drive for miles, or they didn't get to a loved one's funeral. ""Now they want to see the thing that made that happen."" The popularity nearly became a problem, she says, hence the need to convert a disused machine shop into a visitor center to keep tourists from driving through her farm and into the valley beyond. ""My husband was always busy, pulling people out when they got stuck in their small cars!"" Back in our gigantic 4x4, Kiddi fires up the engine and we hit the road. Iceland Safari (+354 544 5454) organizes super-jeep tours to volcanoes and other geological attractions across the country. Plane and helicopter flights over Bardarbunga can be arranged from Reykjavik domestic airport via Extreme Iceland (Vatnagardar 12, Reykjavik; +354 588 1300).","Volcano safari tours in Iceland involve driving up Eyjafjallajokull in a giant-wheeled 4x4 super jeep .

"Airplane travelers will soon be able to watch videos and play games with their electronic devices throughout their entire flight -- and not just above a certain altitude -- the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday in a long anticipated announcement. But don't expect to be chatting on your cell phone. A ban on using cell phones for voice communication remains in effect. The FAA, following months of study by a group of aviation experts, said that airlines can soon allow passengers to use portable electronic devices such as tablets, laptop computers, e-readers and cell phones in airplane mode throughout the flight -- with some circumstantial restrictions. Can your cell phone bring down a plane? Until now, passengers in the United States were prohibited from using the devices until their plane rose above 10,000 feet. The timing of the changes will depend on individual airlines, but an FAA statement said it expects ""many carriers will prove to the FAA that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of the year."" ""Each airline will determine how and when this will happen,"" FAA administrator Michael Huerta told reporters at Reagan National Airport. Some fliers admit leaving devices on in flight . The periods of flight in question are fairly short. The ascent of an aircraft to 10,000 feet usually takes 10 minutes or less, depending on the airport and weather conditions, said Patrick Smith, a commercial airline pilot and Askthepilot blogger. Delta Air Lines and JetBlue wasted no time announcing Thursday morning that both airlines have filed plans with the FAA to allow for use of approved electronic devices below 10,000 feet on their flights. Both carriers had representatives on the FAA advisory panel. The FAA said Thursday afternoon that it had already received plans from some airlines. ""The agency is reviewing the plans to make sure they conform to the guidance we released a few hours ago,"" the FAA said. ""Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon."" The FAA also permits the use of in-flight Wi-Fi service if the airline offers and allows it. Delta said its service will continue to be available above 10,000 feet. The FAA had long claimed that using electronic devices during takeoff and landing posed a safety issue and that radio signals from the devices could interfere with an aircraft's communications, navigation and other systems. But a panel the FAA established last year to study the issue concluded that most commercial airplanes can tolerate radio interference signals. Before an airline switches to the relaxed rules, it will have to prove to the FAA that its aircraft can tolerate the interference. Airlines have, over the years, built newer planes with portable electronics in mind, hardening them against electromagnetic interference. The FAA did outline an exception to the new rule: ""In some instances of low visibility -- about one percent of flights -- some landing systems may not be proved PED tolerant, so you may be asked to turn off your device."" An airline pilots union that participated in revising the rules voiced support Thursday for the requirement that airlines prove their fleet's tolerance to signal interference, but expressed reservations about traveler compliance. ""We remain concerned that relying on passengers to selectively turn off their devices in areas of extremely poor weather is not a practical solution,"" the Air Line Pilots Association said in a statement. Enforcing the policy . Flight attendants' hard jobs just got harder, said travel blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala. That's because they'll have to ensure that passengers are only using devices in ""aircraft safe"" mode, not downloading anything from the Internet. ""No one turns their devices off anymore,"" DiScala says. ""I don't say anything (to fellow passengers about turning them off) these days because all the studies have shown that it doesn't cause any problems, and the pilots are now using stuff (iPads and other electronic devices) in the cockpit."" The Association of Flight Attendants expressed some concerns, asking in a statement that testing be streamlined to ensure that ""airplanes can tolerate electromagnetic interference"" from passenger devices.  Development of crew training and passenger messaging is also needed to ensure passengers pay attention to safety messages from flight attendants, the union said. Opinion: Cell phones on planes? For texting, not gabbing . Benefits for travelers, electronics manufacturers . It's no surprise that advocates for the travel and electronics industries cheered the easing of the restrictions on devices during flight. ""We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security,"" Roger Dow, U.S. Travel Association president and CEO, said in a prepared statement. ""What's good for the traveler is good for travel-related businesses and our economy."" Travel blogger Brett Snyder said he expects a lot of consumer satisfaction related to the new policy. ""This is exactly what travelers have wanted,"" said Snyder, the Cranky Flier columnist, via e-mail. ""It will, however, mean people have more distracting them from paying attention during the safety briefing, so airlines are going to really have to step up their game to make sure people understand how to be as safe as possible."" In early October, the Consumer Electronics Association announced support for an FAA committee recommendation that passengers generally be allowed to use typical lightweight electronic devices at all altitudes of flight on airplanes hardened against radio interference. About 69% of passengers traveling with an e-device reported using their devices on a flight, and almost one-third of passengers admitted to accidentally leaving one on in flight, according to a 2013 CEA/Airline Passenger Experience Association study.","FAA says it is reviewing plans it's received from airlines .

"More than 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed an open letter Friday morning urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2016. The letter draws parallels between Obama's come-from-behind insurgent candidacy and Warren, who would enter the race an underdog against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if the latter runs, as expected. Clinton is seen as the likely Democratic nominee if she jumps in the race, and leads every survey of the potential Democratic field by double digits. But the same was true during her first run for president, in 2008, when a then little-known senator from Illinois jumped in and upended what many expected to be a coronation for the former first lady. ""We believed in an unlikely candidate who no one thought had a chance,"" the letter opens. ""We know that the improbable is far from impossible,"" it goes on. The letter declares that ""rising income inequality is the challenge of our times, and we want someone who will stand up for working families and take on the Wall Street banks and special interests that took down our economy."" It's signed by both low-level field staffers and researchers and a handful of more prominent Obama alums, including Rajeev Chopra, who served as chief information officer for both of Obama's presidential campaigns; Judith Freeman, who was new media field manager on the 2008 campaign; and Catherine Bracy, who directed the tech field office for Obama's reelection fight in San Francisco. Most of the more prominent alumni of Obama's presidential campaigns have already signed onto the campaign infrastructure that's building around a likely Clinton run. Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager, has joined the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA as a co-chairman, and White House advisor John Podesta is expected to leave his post soon and is considered a top pick for Clinton campaign manager. The grassroots organizing group geared towards a Clinton run, Ready for Hillary, has signed on 270 Strategies, the firm launched by top Obama campaign aides Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird. Progressives remain wary of a Clinton candidacy, however, and have been urging Warren to run for months. She has repeatedly denied any interest in a bid, and says she has no plans to jump in the race. But progressives aren't waiting for her to make the decision ‚Äî¬†they're taking steps to encourage her into the race in hopes she'll change her mind. Just this week, a major national progressive group, MoveOn, announced a million-dollar effort to draft Warren into the race. The draft efforts are building as Warren continued her ascendance on the national stage this week as a central figure in the government spending fight. She led progressive opposition to a government funding bill, sparked by unrelated policy riders rolling back a key plank of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill and raising caps on donations to parties, and ultimately drove enough Democratic opposition that the funding fight came down to the wire Thursday night. The development was an early, but clear, indication that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is angling to have more influence on activities on Capitol Hill through 2016 and beyond.","More than 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed a letter urging Elizabeth Warren to run .

"Millionaires are ready for Hillary. According to a CNBC survey, Hillary Clinton -- with 31% support -- would be the top choice for people with ""investable assets of $1 million or more"" if the 2016 election were held today. Clinton is followed by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush with 18%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with 14% and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders  with 11%. In the poll, CNBC notes that ""people with investable assets of $1 million or more"" make up the top 8% of American households and their poll was ""evenly split between Democrats, Republicans and Independents."" Among Democrats, Clinton's lead is massive, with 72% of the 500 people polled stating they support the former first lady. Bush, likewise, is the top choice for Republican millionaires with 36% support. Despite the fact that millionaire supporters have outsized influence because of campaign contributions and donations to super PACS, this distinction could be one Clinton doesn't want. Since she last ran 0for president, the Democratic Party has become more populist and in order to win in 2016, many political experts see her needed to reconnect with middle and working class voters. The party has also been overtaken by skepticism of Wall Street and, in some cases, wealth, meaning having the backing of a majority of millionaires may not be a badge of honor in 2016. What's more, the support of more millionaires has not always been indicative of electoral success. In 2008 and 2012, Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney had support of most millionaires in their respective elections. Both went on to lose to President Barack Obama, who had the support of most people with $30 million or more.","A new poll finds 31% of millionaires would vote for Hillary Clinton if the 2016 election were held today .

"The debate over the ""Redskins"" name in sports isn't just at the professional level. Students at an Oklahoma City high school were refusing to go into Capitol Hill High School on Wednesday morning because their mascot no longer has the controversial name, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. Dozens of students stood on the lawn outside the building rather than heading into class. The city's public school board voted Monday to change the name in response to Native American students' feelings that the mascot name was offensive. The vote to change the mascot, which has been in place since the 1920s, was unanimous. School administrators will immediately start phasing out the Redskins mascot and will create a committee of current and former students and community members to pick a new mascot before the end of the spring semester, spokeswoman Tierney Tinnin said in a statement, according to The Oklahoman. In the NFL, Washington Redskins football team owner Dan Snyder has repeatedly defended his team's use of the name and wrote in a March letter that the name ""captures the best of who we are and who we can be, by staying true to our history and honoring the deep and enduring values our name represents."" The support of a handful of Oklahoma City high school students isn't likely to help Snyder's cause. President Barack Obama said last year that he might change the name if he were the team owner. In June, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office found that six team trademarks were offensive and canceled them. The team appealed, and the patent office ruled that the Redskins could use the logos until the years-long appeals process was complete. The National Congress of American Indians has spoken out against the use of ""Redskins"" and other Native American mascots.","High school students protested over removal of mascot name .

"To thunderous and sustained applause, Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai and India's Kailash Satyarthi received the Nobel Peace Prize on Wednesday, an award that a Nobel official said he hopes encourages others to fight for young people's rights. The two learned they would take home the prestigious prize two months ago. Wednesday's ceremony in Oslo, Norway -- attended by royalty, international officials, even some of Yousafzai's classmates from Pakistan -- made it official. Both recipients had much at stake as they battled for what they believed in. In Satyarthi's case, it was to end the exploitation of children for financial gain. In the case of Yousafzai -- the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, at 17 -- it was for girls' right to an education, a quest that nearly cost her her life when Taliban fighters called her out and shot her in the head two years ago. Man arrested after interrupting ceremony . ""We need people like Satyarthi and Yousafzai to show that it helps to fight,"" said Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. Jagland, who is the secretary general of the Council of Europe, added that in addition to bringing attention to children's rights, he hopes the joint award will also bring India and Pakistan closer together. Those neighboring countries have long been at odds, politically and at times militarily. ""While it is in the nature of extremism to create enemies and frightening images, and to divide the world into us and them, the laureates show us something else,"" Jagland said. ""A young girl and a somewhat older man. One from Pakistan, one from India. One Muslim, the other Hindu. Both symbols of the world needs -- namely, more unity."" Satyarthi spoke first after accepting his prize, giving a rousing call to action and a condemnation of the reality in many places worldwide. ""I refuse to accept that the world is so poor when just one week of military expenditures can bring all children to classrooms,"" he said. ""I refuse to accept that all the laws and constitutions and police and judges are unable to protect our children. I refuse to accept that shackles of slavery can ever be stronger than the quest for freedom."" Next up was Yousafzai, from northwestern Pakistan's Swat Valley. The Taliban began establishing themselves there in 2003, bringing with them their conservative views -- including that girls should not be educated. Yet Yousafzai didn't only continue going to school, she blogged about her experiences for the BBC. That led to her being singled out on a bus by the Taliban and shot. After her recovery, Yousafzai has expanded her campaign for girls' education -- speaking all around the world for the cause. Speaking Wednesday, she said the Nobel Peace Prize ""is not just for me. It is for those forgotten children who want education. It is for those frightened children who want peace. It is for those voiceless children who want change."" ""I'm here to stand up for their rights, to raise their voice,"" she said. ""It is not time to pity them. It is not time to pity them. It is time to take action, so it becomes the last time ... that we see a child deprived of education.""","India's Kailash Satyarthi, Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai are awarded Nobel Peace Prize .

"(CNN) -- Interpol, at the request of a Swedish court looking into alleged sex crimes from earlier this year, has put WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on its most-wanted listed. The Stockholm Criminal Court two weeks ago issued an international arrest warrant for Assange on probable cause, saying he is suspected of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force in August incidents. Sweden asked Interpol, the international police organization, to post a ""Red Notice"" after a judge approved a motion to bring him into custody. The ""Red Notice"" is not an international arrest warrant. It is an advisory and request, issued to 188 member countries ""to assist the national police forces in identifying or locating those persons with a view to their arrest and extradition,"" according to Interpol. The Swedish court ordered Assange, 39, formally arrested in his absence, which requires Swedish authorities anywhere in the world to detain Assange if they come across him. Sweden's director of prosecutions, Marianne Ny, had requested the arrest-in-absence. ""The background is that he has to be heard in this investigation and we haven't been able to get a hold of him to question him,"" Ny said at the time. Assange faces five counts that appear related to two incidents, according to the request Ny filed with the court. He faces one count of rape and one count of sexual molestation related to an instance around August 17 in Enkoping, just outside Stockholm. He then faces two counts of sexual molestation between August 13 and 18 in Stockholm, and one count of illegal use of force between August 13 and 14, also in the capital. Assange could be sentenced to at least two years in prison if convicted, according to the document. Assange, an Australian, was rejected for permanent residency in Sweden in October. Swedish Migration Board official Gunilla Wikstrom said his application failed to fulfill all the requirements but declined to give details. On Monday, Ecuador invited Assange to come to Quito to discuss documents leaked on the site relating to Ecuador and other Latin American countries, according to a statement from the country's foreign ministry. The ministry also offered to process a request for residency ""in accordance with the country's current laws."" In a November news release, Assange's British lawyer said the sex-crime charges stem from consensual sexual relationships his client had with two women. ""Only after the women became aware of each other's relationships with Mr. Assange did they make their allegations against him,"" lawyer Mark Stephens said in the statement. Stephens also said neither he nor Assange ""have ever received a single written word, at any time, in any form, from Swedish authorities on the Swedish investigation against our client."" The media has been the only way they've learned substantial information about the investigation, Stephens said. He called it ""a clear contravention to Article 6 of the European Convention, which states that every accused must be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him."" Swedish prosecutors announced over the summer they were investigating Assange in two separate cases of rape and molestation. Ny said then there was reason to believe a crime had been committed, but that more investigation was necessary before she could make a final decision.

"German leaders are furious with Greece. Yet again they have to go back to their electorates asking for more billions to throw down the black hole that is the Hellenic Republic. They have now become so angry that they are even openly proposing that Greece's fiscal affairs be deferred to some European Commissioner, preferably one of a Teutonic disposition. Greek leaders, meanwhile, have seized upon this German ""transgression"" with glee. For it offers them a wonderful excuse to put on domestic display their patriotic fervor at a time when they are running low on legitimacy in the eyes of a battered, demoralized electorate. Beating their chests about the German threat to Greece's national sovereignty, they are hoping that the Greeks will somehow forget that it was they, their leaders, who ceded sovereignty to the so-called troika of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. This is a typical case of a shady coalition of vested interests that is disintegrating under the weight of its collective hubris. For the past 18 months, German and Greek leaders have been working together to deny the truth about three simultaneous bankruptcies: The irreversible bankruptcy of the Greek state, the effective insolvency of many Franco-German banks, and, last but not least, the unsustainability of the euro-system as we know it. To keep these truths from surfacing, German and Greek politicians, each for their own purposes, settled on gigantic loans for Greece that would act as plaster on the festering wounds of the aforementioned bankruptcies. But to get these ""historic"" loans through the parliaments of Berlin and Athens, they had to be portrayed as a form of humanism; as German solidarity to the Greek people. Alas, to extend such ""solidarity,"" German lawmakers demanded subsidiarity; which is euro-speak for the recipient agreeing to a tough reform agenda, complete with strict fiscal targets. In plain language, the huge loans would only be granted if similarly lofty promises were made by the Greek government. Thus, German leaders, unwilling to confront their bankers and the fault lines developing throughout the eurozone, pretended to believe that the problem was Greece and that Greece could be ""cured"" by means of loans and austerity. At the same time, Greek leaders, unwilling to confront their electorate, pretended to believe that they could deliver the targets demanded by Germany. Of course, it was only a matter of time before reality caught up with both sets of leaders. Once it became abundantly clear that the targets Greece had committed to were well and truly unrealistic, the coalition between our German and Greek leaders became testy. The knives are out and, if it were not for an equilibrium of terror at the thought of a euro-system collapse, a disorderly brawl would be plain for all to see. The worst part of this sad saga is that public debate is still failing to keep track with the real issues. Instead of coming to terms with the structural imbalances within the eurozone, the Germans accuse the Greeks of incompetence, corruption and a singular failure to meet ""their"" targets. The Greeks, meanwhile, are replying with references to World War II and yelps of horror at the prospect of violations of national sovereignty. Neither side is willing to admit that the whole rescue package was flawed from the outset. No serious consideration is given to the plain facts: . ‚Ä¢That the cascade of insolvencies in the eurozone should never have been treated like liquidity problems fixable by loans to the bankrupt banks and states. ‚Ä¢That it is always a terrible idea to make large loans to an already shrinking economy conditional on further reduction in the national income from which these loans must be repaid (for this is precisely what hefty austerity measures in the middle of a recession achieve). ‚Ä¢That Greece's agreed targets would be equivalent to my promising, perhaps under duress, to break the world 100-meter sprint record in the forthcoming London Olympics. The punishment of any big lie is its revelation. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. The preordained failure of the Greek ""program"" has not yet exposed our leaders' connivance. It is, instead, generating Teutonic wrath among the hard working Germans (whose living standards have been under constant pressure for a decade, and who are now told they must guarantee even more zillions for the Greek state) and unbearable Sisyphean pain for Greeks caught up in a vicious cycle (from which no amount of hard work or innovative thinking can help them escape). Something must give. If it is not our leaders' insidious lie, it will be the eurozone. It's that simple.","German and Greek politicians are at odds over who should control Greece's budget .

"Foday Gallah saw the sick child was distressed and felt he had to do something. So he picked the kid up to comfort him. And with that act of kindness, the 37-year-old ambulance supervisor in Monrovia, Liberia, contracted Ebola himself. ""Of course, he got vomit all over him and that's how he got Ebola,"" said photographer Jackie Nickerson, who shot Gallah's image for Time's ""Person of the Year"" magazine cover, which honors those on the front line of the Ebola epidemic. They're ""the ones who answered the call,"" the magazine said on its website Wednesday morning. Nickerson expanded on why Gallah was chosen for one of the magazine's five covers: ""He's the shining example of what the right thing to do is. He's a shining example that we should all try to follow. He really did touch me with his story. I don't usually like to use the word hero, but I have to use it here."" According to the latest World Health Organization figures, about 6,300 people have died from the disease, mainly in West  Africa. Health workers are still battling more than 11,000 confirmed cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and more than 6,000 suspected and probable cases loom, according to WHO. Though those countries mark the epicenter of the outbreak, isolated cases have spread wider, penetrating other African countries, Europe and even the United States. Time magazine's editors decided to honor the ""unprecedented numbers"" of doctors and nurses who responded when Ebola overtook an already-weak public health infrastructure, and Time Editor Nancy Gibbs outlined how governments were ill-equipped to respond, WHO ""was in denial and snarled in red tape"" and first responders were accused of crying wolf as the disease spread. Yet many doctors and nurses, especially those from Doctors Without Borders and Samaritan's Purse, responded and worked alongside local physicians, nurses, ambulance drivers and burial teams, Gibbs wrote. Some were driven by God, while others did it for country and some simply had ""the instinct to run into the fire, not away,"" she wrote. ""Ebola is a war, and a warning. The global health system is nowhere close to strong enough to keep us safe from infectious disease, and 'us' means everyone, not just those in faraway places where this is one threat among many that claim lives every day,"" wrote Gibbs. She continued, ""The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight. For tireless acts of courage and mercy, for buying the world time to boost its defenses, for risking, for persisting, for sacrificing and saving, the Ebola fighters are Time's 2014 Person of the Year."" In addition to Gallah, the ambulance driver, Time highlighted on its cover four other Ebola fighters who worked on the ground in West Africa: . -- Dr. Jerry Brown is a Liberian surgeon who converted his hospital's chapel into one of the country's first treatment centers. The center's reception area, where Brown gets dressed, is a bare room, lit by a single bulb, Nickerson, the photographer, said. -- Salome Karwah is an Ebola survivor who lost both parents to the disease and undertook the task of counseling patients in Liberia. Nickerson recalled how the Doctors Without Borders caregiver appeared to be a typical young woman, dressed nicely and a little nervous about being photographed. ""But then, she put on her scrubs. ... She became very calm, a little bit introverted,"" the photographer said. -- Ella Watson-Stryker is a Doctors Without Borders health promoter who has been in West Africa since March. The American was uneasy during the 10 minutes it took to shoot her photo, Nickerson said. ""She was distracted, she wanted to do other things."" -- Dr. Kent Brantly became the first American infected while running a treatment center in Monrovia. Because he is a religious man, Time shot him at his church in Fort Worth, Texas. ""Kent was working in West Africa doing a lot of hard, selfless work to help people out,"" photographer Bryan Schutmaat said. Among the others considered for ""Person of the Year"" honors were Russian President Vladimir Putin, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. Other finalists included singer Taylor Swift, Chinese Internet tycoon Jack Ma, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani. Pope Francis received the title in 2013. The magazine's readers voted for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to receive the title, but the Time editors' decision is based on their view of ""the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year.""","Time names those on front lines of Ebola outbreak as the ""Person of the Year""

"(CNN)The new biblical epic from director Ridley Scott, ""Exodus: Gods and Kings,"" has a race problem. We've known since the moment the full cast was announced: nearly every major role in the movie is played by a white actor. What makes it worse for many observers is that, on the flip side, virtually every black actor in the movie is playing a part called ""Egyptian thief"" or ""assassin"" or ""royal servant"" or ""Egyptian lower class civilian."" In the weeks before ""Exodus"" opens, on December 12, a number of people, from African-American activists to Jewish journalists, have called for a boycott of the potential blockbuster. ""As much as I love a good Bible movie, I'm going to go ahead and boycott this one,"" wrote Sigal Samuel in the Jewish Daily Forward. ""And I invite my fellow Jews to join me."" If ""Exodus"" were a tale set in the antebellum South, such a disparity might be historically justifiable. But this story is set in Egypt (which was part of Africa even back then), with characters of exclusively Middle Eastern origin.  According to the Bible, Abraham, and therefore all subsequent Jews, were of Mesopotamian -- that is, Iraqi -- descent. Before we start skewering Scott too thoroughly, we should probably remember that the whitewashing of Bible movies is a well-established tradition. Cecile B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" should probably get a pass, as it was made in 1956, before Hollywood was integrated to any substantial degree. But the same cannot be said for this past spring's ""Noah,"" which has an even less diverse cast than ""Exodus,"" and with greater racial implications, seeing as how all of humanity is supposed to have descended from Noah and his entirely white family. Nor should we pretend that this is a modern problem, or one unique to film representations of the Bible and its central characters. Every European painting of a biblical scene, from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance and beyond, depicts a whitewashed Bible. Ridley Scott has attributed the casting of his film to pure marketing concerns: ""I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such. I'm just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up."" This is a rationale very much of our time -- including the thinly veiled racism of ""Mohammad so-and-so"" -- but it fails to account for the long history of the bleached-out Bible, in which Scott's movie simply makes up the most recent chapter. The most obvious error in this sort of casting is the historical one: Inhabitants of ancient Egypt and Israel simply didn't look like Christian Bale or Joel Edgerton. The deeper problem is one of conflating whiteness with heroism and power. Is it so hard to imagine our biblical heroes as being nonwhite? Is it beyond belief that one of the greatest empires in world history had authentically dark skin, rather than being white folks just wearing a ton of makeup? Does God have a prayer in Hollywood? When it comes to the depiction of the Egyptians in ""Exodus"" in particular, however, there is a more specific issue at play. News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch, not known as an expert on race or history, weighed in with the rhetorical question (which he then proceeded to answer): ""Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are."" The race of the ancient Egyptians has been controversial for over two centuries. It is a loaded debate that cannot be understood apart from the historical contexts of the scholars engaged in the conversation. The debate was particularly intense during the abolitionist movement in the United States. At stake were the claims of the pro-slavery faction: that black people were inherently physically and intellectually inferior and, thus, well-suited for slavery. If the ancient Egyptians -- world leaders in architecture, engineering, farming, and literary production, as well as documented slave owners -- were not white, then there was a problem. This project reached its apex in the work of ""American School"" of anthropology, founded in the first half of the 19th century by Samuel George Morton, which claimed that God had created multiple hierarchically organized races, with Caucasians at the top. This idea was taken one step further by Southern slave owner Josiah Nott, who repeatedly stated ""that the Ancient Egyptian race were Caucasians."" Nott ominously attributed the inability of Egyptians to recapture power in the Common Era to their mixing with other races. The clear agenda here was to provide a historical basis for American slavery. From the second half of the 20th century onward, anthropologists have largely agreed that ancient Egyptians were indigenous to the Nile region and genetically representative of Northeastern Africa. Egypt has long been a genetic crossroads, because it has long been a political and economic crossroads, since before we have written records. At least one important minority opinion, however, known as ""the Black Egyptian hypothesis,"" emphasizes racial ties between Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa. The theory -- favored by W.E.B. du Bois -- draws upon philology, the writings of historians, and art and architecture to argue that ancient Egypt was a black civilization. How Muslims flipped the script in Hollywood . This controversy over race is something the makers of ""Exodus"" claim to have thought about. ""We cast major actors from different ethnicities to reflect this diversity of culture, from Iranians to Spaniards to Arabs,"" Scott said. ""There are many different theories about the ethnicity of the Egyptian people, and we had a lot of discussions about how to best represent the culture."" Despite this discussion, the tableau produced in ""Exodus,"" unfortunately, is the one favored by 19th-century slave traders. In an important sense, however, the entire debate, down to the present, is essentially moot. The categories of modern America were not relevant to the concerns of ancient Egyptians. Modern anthropologists no longer see race as a fundamental biological or natural category of people, but rather as a biocultural category, intermingling genetic and anatomical data with economic, political, and social data. Historically, skin tone was not the key feature by which society was hierarchically structured. Race is a lived experience, of course, but the distinction between slave and free -- a critical one in the ancient world -- was not drawn along modern racial lines. There were more than a few blond-haired, pale-skinned ""barbarian"" slaves in the Roman empire. In the ancient world it was more important to be free than pale. Still, the image of ancient Egyptians as white has been powerful and destructive. Whitewashing the Bible is problematic both because it is unhistorical and because it reinscribes the dangerous association of whiteness, divine favor and heroism that has plagued modern Christianity. Recognizing the violent and painful history of this idea -- particularly as it pertains to ancient Egypt -- is an important preamble to talking about it.","Critics say the new movie ""Exodus"" has a ""race problem""

"Keren Charles remembers how embarrassed she was the first time she set foot in a thrift store more than 20 years ago to buy black pants for her first job. ""I didn't want anyone to see me,"" said Charles, a 37-year old administrative assistant from Atlanta. ""In high school, there was really a stigma attached to it. People thought you were either poor or homeless."" Now, the fashion enthusiast says, about 97% of her closet consists of secondhand clothes, vintage dresses and all kinds of sequined accessories. Her favorite find is a navy blue Bill Blass chiffon evening gown potentially worth hundreds of dollars that she scored for $5 at Goodwill. Her last visit to a mall -- a rare occurrence -- was months ago, to use a gift card. She proudly flaunts her thrift store finds on her blog, Two Stylish Kays, and social media. When strangers started asking her for fashion advice, she decided to market her love of ""thrifting"" by becoming a part-time personal shopper. She helps clients maintain their wardrobes and advises them on new trends. She even organized Atlanta's first Thrift Fashion Week in the spring. ""I want to encourage people to try it,"" she said. ""When you see other people doing things and you see all the great pieces they find, it kind of motivates you to at least try it."" In fact, more people have been sharing Charles' enthusiasm for secondhand clothing in recent years. Goodwill Industries, one of the most recognizable names in secondhand shopping, says it has experienced an 84% increase in revenue from the sale of donated goods from 2007 to 2012, from $1.9 billion to $3.5 billion. Secondhand clothing and vintage items are showing up in couture, street wear, even everyday office wear. Besides the incentive of saving money, thrifting has also become trendy. Hip-hop duo Macklemore and Ryan Lewis won a 2013 Billboard Music Award for their hit song ""Thrift Shop,"" which brags about ""looking for a come up"" in a thrift shop. More people are discovering thrift store shopping because of the recession, said Maureen McGill, co-founder of Manhattan Vintage, New York's biggest vintage fashion market for more than 30 years. But, she believes that the love of vintage style and the thrill of the hunt will keep people coming even during good economic times. ""Vintage is the root of fashion. This is where fashion comes from. Designers use it as inspiration,"" she said. What is a thrift shop, exactly? There are three types of shops that sell used clothing, according to the Association of Resale Professionals. A resale shop buys merchandise from individual owners; a thrift shop is run by a not-for-profit organization to fund charitable causes; a consignment shop pays the owners of the merchandise a percentage when and if the items are sold. Even thrift stores that have been funding charitable causes for decades are enjoying the popularity. Some days, a line starts forming outside Atlanta's Nearly New Thrift Shop at least 30 minutes before it opens, said Camille Kessler, president of the Atlanta chapter of the nonprofit Junior League, which benefits from the store's proceeds. More customers began coming to the store at the start of the recession almost six years ago, and sales have been steadily increasing, Kessler said. ""We really hope this trend is here to stay."" Growing interest in the trend inspired Charles to organize a fashion show with the help of other local fashion bloggers. All clothes modeled were purchased from thrift shops, and nothing cost more than $20. This year's winner was Neshanta Davis and her two-piece polka-dot short set, which included a matching bow tie. Davis, who is also an avid thrift shopper and stylist, says that not knowing what you will find is the best part about thrifting. ""What I love about thrifting is the thrill of it, the challenge in finding something unique that everybody else isn't going to wear,"" she said. The recently popularity may be great for new shoppers and for business, but it's not so great for longtime regulars like Charles. ""The competition is kind of fierce now,"" she said. ""You're in the thrift stores, and you're seeing so many other people, but it's still better than shopping at a department store.""","Secondhand clothing and vintage finds are showing up in couture, everyday work wear .

"Senate supporters of a bipartisan budget compromise that aims to prevent another shutdown moved close Monday to securing the votes they need to clear a crucial upcoming test vote after several conservative Republicans announced their support. While all the votes are not locked in, Senators and aides in both parties said they expected to break a filibuster Tuesday and that the budget would pass later this week. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Johnny Isakson of Georgia joined four other Senate Republicans who had already said they will either support the bill or, at a minimum, vote in favor of critical procedural motions that require a supermajority of 60 votes to prevail. That should happen if most of the 55 members of the Democratic caucus also vote yes, which is likely. Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, a retiring Republican who spent months attempting to negotiate a deficit deal with Democrats, said he would vote in favor of the procedural motions but hadn't decided what to do on final passage. Democratic leadership aides said they expect to hold all their members on the budget, which was approved by the House last week overwhelmingly and is supported by the White House. But they acknowledged a few liberals might drop off because the deal doesn't include an extension of unemployment benefits or a few moderate Democrats might vote no because the deal doesn't do enough to lower the deficit. Right now no Democrat has announced opposition. Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal, refused to say how she would vote.  She kept her eyes fixed on the ground as reporters asked her several times about her position until the door to the Capitol elevator she was in closed. Sen. Kay Hagen, a centrist Democrat of North Carolina, who is facing a difficult re-election fight, said she would vote for the procedural motions but remains undecided on the bill.  Another moderate, Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, who is also facing a tough re-election, said he would vote in favor of both. Johnson, who was lobbied to support the bill by fellow Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, one the authors of the deal, said, ""I just want to make sure we avoid any additional government shutdowns.The federal government does enough harm to our economy. We don't' need to add additional harm by this crisis management.  In the end this is not the kind of deal I would want to see.  I'm sure it's not the kind of deal Paul Ryan would want to produce."" Hatch said in a statement that ""sometimes the answer has to be yes."" ""Ultimately, his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and, with Democrats controlling the White House and the Senate, it is the best we can hope for,"" he said. If the budget clears the test vote, final passage is expected no later than Thursday. CNN vote count: Budget deal nearing Senate approval, but not there yet . Final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off. It would also avert another government shutdown like the one in October that Americans largely blamed on Congress. ""I think it would be outrageous to shut down the government and I'm not going to do that to my constituents who I represent,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who has said he plans to vote for the bill. ""I hope it will pass the Senate,"" he said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Other key GOP members . Most GOP senators, raising a variety of concerns, are expected to vote against the bill. ""I'm concerned we have once again kicked the can down now a long road,"" said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, who said he is undecided. ""I'm leaning strongly against it,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a veteran lawmaker who opposes some of the fees the bill raises. Democrats wary, too . While Democrats are more likely to vote in favor of the bill, many have concerns. More liberal senators -- like Tom Harkin of Iowa -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal. ""There's over a million people now who cannot find a job, out of work, and right at this time of year their unemployment insurance is being cut off,"" Harkin told Radio Iowa last week. ""It's really unconscionable."" Budget deal struck . The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, on defense and nondefense programs. Don't expect Boehner to totally change his tune . Current federal spending expires in mid-January, raising the possibility of another shutdown at that time if there's not a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled. The strong vote in the House on the budget plan on Thursday -- 332-94 -- brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters, who initially thought it would sail through the Senate, where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided House. But after reading details of the agreement, many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill. ""I'd really like to stay within the (spending) caps,"" complained Sen. John Boozman, R-Arkansas.  ""This busts the caps and as a result I'll vote against it."" ""I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,"" said Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, in announcing his opposition. ""We need to find a better way to save $6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, who said he would vote against the bill. Graham, Wicker, and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, sent a letter to their Senate colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits. It was unclear if the emergence of the politically sensitive issue would increase opposition. One Senator said outside interest groups for service members and veterans were caught off guard by the provision in the agreement and were just now beginning to mobilize against it. Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Nebraska, said he finds the military pension issue ""bothersome"" but remains undecided on how to vote. ""I wouldn't say leaning yes or leaning no.  I'm very concerned about the package but I can also see the merits of a two-year deal. So I want the weekend to think about it,"" he said. Why the deal could happen . The retiring first-term lawmaker predicted the bill will pass the Senate regardless of how he votes. Midterm primaries, and 2016 . The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has hinted strongly he will vote against it. He cites the weakening of the budget sequester as a key complaint. The same is true for his top two lieutenants -- Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota -- both of whom have declared they will oppose the compromise. McConnell and Cornyn are up for re-election and both face primary challenges from the right. That might explain some of their sensitivity to giving up on the budget cuts, which are very popular with conservative voters. Three leading tea party-backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco Rubio of Florida -- also have come out against it for similar reasons.","The House passed a compromise budget bill easily, sending it to the Senate .

"As ISIS continues its campaign in both Syria and Iraq, a group called Samaritan's Purse is hoping shoeboxes filled with gifts might give comfort to refugees of the crisis. On a sunny but windy day on the tarmac of Baltimore-Washington International Airport, volunteers from the group loaded pallets filled with some 60,000 boxes of gifts onto a 747-jet. Those boxes contain everything from hand-written notes of well-wishes to furry toy ponies. They'll end up in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq where they will be distributed to children living in refugee camps in both Iraq and Syria as part of ""Operation Christmas Child."" Children from the U.S., U.K. and Canada filled the boxes. Though exact numbers are hard to come by, the United Nations estimates there are over a million refugees displaced in Syria and Iraq. President and CEO of Samaritan's Purse Franklin Graham says it's important to try and help these refugees who have almost no hope otherwise. ""Most of them are children,"" Graham said. ""About 70% of Syrian refugees are children. And they've fled with just the clothes on their back, they have nothing."" And it's not just Iraq and Syria where Samaritan's Purse has focused their attention. Kids in more than 150 countries have received over a hundred million boxes since 1993. Samaritan's Purse is a Christian organization headed up by the son of one of the most famous Christian evangelists in the country, Billy Graham. Sometimes these packages can have more than just short-term effects. Franklin Graham told the story of then seven-year-old Tyler Wolfe who in the year 2000 sent a Christmas shoebox gift to a child named Joana Marchan in the Philippines.

But he decried the release of what he called a ""partisan Democrat"" report as ""reckless and irresponsible."" ""The international repercussions of this partisan report are just beginning,"" he said, adding that even ""friends and allies across the globe are rethinking"" their relationship with the U.S. Cruz centered his remarks on an indictment of the ""Obama-Clinton"" foreign policy, a term he's used before in criticizing the current administration's policies and a nod to the fact that he's contemplating a potential presidential run ‚Äî¬†which could pit him against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is seen as Democrats' likely nominee. ""The consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy is that our friends no longer trust us, and our enemies no longer fear us,"" Cruz said. ""That is profoundly dangerous for America and is profoundly dangerous for the world."" In particular, he took issue with Obama's handling of Russian aggression against Ukraine, and he argued that the U.S. should offer military support to the country to help it ward off Russia's attempts at annexation. And he slammed the developing Iranian nuclear deal as ""the Obamacare of [the President's] second term."" The criticism was reference to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes' recent comparison of a deal with Iran to health care reform, the crowning achievement of Obama's first term that has faced fierce opposition from Republicans and remains unpopular with the public. Cruz argued the U.S. should drop those negotiations immediately and reinstate tougher sanctions, and that any further negotiations should have ""more stick and a whole lot less carrot."" He also made reference to Clinton's recent remarks that Americans should try to ""empathize"" with the nation's enemies, which Republicans seized on as evidence Clinton has a lack of understanding of the challenges facing the nation abroad. ""In the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, all members of the international community are equal, be they nations are not, and should be dealt with respectfully and with empathy,"" he said, with a laugh. ""Let me be very clear: When it comes to radical Islamic terrorists who are crucifying Christians, who are beheading children, what our foreign policy needs is not additional empathy. It needs clarity and force and resolve to defend the United States of America,"" he said. Cruz concluded by declaring, ""We will see some check, I believe, in the next two years on the President's ill-advised foreign policy"" from the new Congress. ""There is agreement, and in many ways bipartisan agreement, in the Senate that the Obama-Clinton foreign policy is disastrous and is undermining America in the world. And I hope, and expect, the Senate, without Harry Reid as majority leader, will begin to take up commonsense legislation to strengthen our alliances and stand against our enemies,"" he said.","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the release of the torture report will affect U.S. relations with its allies .

"Ukraine's armored vehicles rolled Wednesday, but its attempt to take back eastern towns from pro-Russian militants seemed to stall. In Donetsk, six armored vehicles sent into the nearby city of Kramatorsk in the morning later showed up carrying Russian flags in Slaviansk. Russian Ambassador to the EU Vladimir Chizhov told CNN's Christiane Amanpour those Ukrainian soldiers ""preferred to switch sides and join the people."" Ukraine's Defense Ministry said the vehicles had been seized by militants. In Slaviansk, north of Kramatorsk and about 100 miles from the border with Russia, pro-Russian militants now appear to be firmly in control of the town, according to CNN's Nick Paton Walsh on the ground. On the diplomatic front, President Obama told CBS News that Russia faces new sanctions. ""What I've said consistently is that each time Russia takes these kinds of steps that are designed to destabilize Ukraine and violate their sovereignty, that there are going to be consequences and what you've already seen is the Russian economy weaker, capital fleeing out of Russia,"" Obama said. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Wednesday the alliance had agreed on a package of further military measures to reinforce the Western military alliance's ""collective defense"" in light of the events in Ukraine. ""We will have more planes in the air, more ships on the water and more readiness on the land,"" Rasmussen said, speaking after a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium. He stressed that NATO backs a political solution to the crisis and urged Russia to stop destabilizing Ukraine. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Geneva in preparation for talks on Thursday with the Russian and Ukraine foreign ministers and a representative of the European Union. In the cities of east Ukraine, the atmosphere seemed more relaxed than it was a few days ago, with many residents apparently welcoming the presence of pro-Russian forces and their seized military vehicles. At the same time, on the road toward Slaviansk, CNN's Phil Black encountered a heavily fortified and well organized police checkpoint and saw signs of a large military buildup. Attack helicopters passed overhead while armored vehicles and troop carriers rumbled by. But despite the heightened military activity, there has so far been no effort to move into the town itself, he said, where the pro-Russian protesters are digging in and consolidating their power. The unrest is a major test for the new interim government, as it seeks to hold Ukraine together ahead of elections scheduled for next month and to avoid bloodshed. Infographic: A divided Ukraine . Putin: 'Brink of civil war' The dramatic scenes in eastern Ukraine come a day after armored columns rolled through the farmland of eastern Donetsk province, proudly flying Ukrainian flags as residents watched and wondered what might come next. Putin warned then that the escalating conflict in Ukraine ""essentially puts the nation on the brink of civil war."" Although Ukraine has been more subdued in its characterization -- no doubt in part because of concerns that Russia might use violence as a pretext to intervene directly -- it's clear that the leadership's patience is wearing thin. After days of urging pro-Russian militants to vacate buildings they have seized, on Tuesday they sent in troops. Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, announcing what he called an ""anti-terrorist operation"" to restore order to the country's east, said its aim was to ""stop attempts to tear Ukraine to pieces."" Some success followed; the President's office said Ukrainian special forces had taken control of the airfield in Kramatorsk by the end of the day. Witnesses had reported hearing gunfire and the sound of aircraft apparently coming from the airfield. But the latest events in Donetsk province suggest the government strategy may be losing momentum. Nearly 30 armed people seized the mayor's administration building in Donetsk city on Wednesday, spokesman Maksim Rovinskiy said. They are demanding federalization and a new law that  paves the way for a local referendum, Rovinskiy said, adding that there had been no violence. In addition, two Ukrainian soldiers, one of them an officer, have been taken hostage by ""extremists,"" the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Wednesday. The soldiers were seized Tuesday near the town of Krasny Luch, in the Luhansk area, as they tried to fix a military vehicle by the roadside, the ministry said. It is working to secure their release. Some locals gathered near Kramatorsk airfield Tuesday evening to see for themselves what was going on -- and to voice their unhappiness over the actions of the interim government in Kiev, which took power after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following weeks of street protests. Breakaway Transnistria . Russia's state ITAR-Tass news agency reported that authorities in Moldova's breakaway Transnistria region had asked Russia to recognize the enclave as a sovereign independent state. CNN goes inside Transnistria -- a region caught in a time warp . The request put forward by Transnistria's separatist parliament was addressed to the Russian Federation Council and President  Putin. But Chizhov said Russia did not plan to annex Transnistria ""or any other territory in any other place of the world."" It was not immediately possible for CNN to independently confirm the report. ""Transnistria does not legally differ from the Crimea, and the process of reunification with Russia should be held on the Crimean scenario,"" Itar Tass quoted lawmaker Vyacheslav Tobuh as saying. The report said a delegation of lawmakers from Transnistria would travel to Moscow on Thursday. Until now, Russia has officially recognized Transnistria as being part of Moldova. Landlocked Transnistria is far from Russia, wedged between Moldova and Ukraine, with about 30% of its population ethnic Russian. Diplomatic efforts . The West has repeatedly called on Russia to withdraw some 40,000 troops that NATO says it has massed near Ukraine's border. Moscow insists they are merely conducting military exercises. Asked if Russia was likely to be angry about NATO ground defense measures, Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, told reporters: ""It will be very hard to see them as anything except for defensive measures, and they will be measures designed to assure our allies."" On Wednesday, a bipartisan congressional delegation announced plans to travel to Ukraine next week to meet with Ukranian officials. In the group will be House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-California, and Reps. Eliot Engel, D-New York; Ted Poe, R-Texas; David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island;  Alan Lowenthal, D-California; Lois Frankel, D-Florida;  Jim Gerlach, R-Pennsylvania; and Mike Quigley, D-Illinois. Lavrov: 'They are spreading lies' The pro-Russian uprising in Ukraine's east follows Moscow's annexation of Crimea, a move that emboldened other pro-Russian Ukrainians in the country's east. Russia has said it reserves the right to intervene to protect the rights of ethnic Russians in the region. But Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking Tuesday in Beijing, rejected accusations from the West that Russia is fomenting the unrest and supporting the militants. ""They make up lies to justify their aggressive plans. They are spreading lies, things that Russian Federation intended or not intended to do, alleging that Russia organized it all,"" he said. ""I have never heard such nonsense. What it means is to refuse one's own people the right to express their opinion and protest against lawlessness and discrimination.""

"A proposal to let rich donors give more money to political parties - slipped behind closed doors into a huge government spending bill -- is the latest in a string of setbacks for restrictions on money in politics and will  be a ""disaster for the American people,"" according to good government groups. Campaign finance reform advocate Fred Wertheimer called the provision a ""great deal"" for millionaires and billionaires who can buy influence through big dollar contributions and for the politicians seeking them. Related: Congress reaches spending deal . The $1.1 trillion spending bill, which would fund most of the government until next September, includes provisions that will allow donors to give a lot more money to Republicans and Democrats to help fund conventions, building projects and legal proceedings like recounts. Rather than facing the current cap of $32,400, donors would be able to give up to $777,600 each year to funds and committees run by the parties or their campaign arms. That means individuals could give $1,555,200 per two-year election cycle and couples could give $3,110,400 in a cycle, according to several campaign finance groups who have studied the legislative language. ""If this passes it will be the most corrupting campaign finance provisions ever enacted in the history of the country,"" said Wertheimer, whose non-partisan group Democracy 21 has sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to vote against the bill. ""The campaign finance laws have been left in shambles first by the Supreme Court and then potentially by the Congress if this becomes law."" Related: Here's what's tucked in the spending bill . Watchdog groups see the move to chip away at the limits placed on donors as the latest step in a slow unraveling of the campaign finance rules put in place by landmark legislation like the McCain-Feingold bill. Known formally as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, the legislation, among other things, limited how much individuals and corporations could donate to national parties. But in its April decision in McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court struck down limits on the overall campaign contributions individual donors can make to candidates, political parties and political action committees. That decision followed the court's 2010 Citizens United ruling that the First Amendment allowed unlimited independent political expenditures by corporations, labor unions and certain nonprofit advocacy groups. Citizens United opened the floodgates to massive corporate spending in elections and these latest provisions would be a step in that direction when it comes to individual donors. The fear is that allowing more big money in politics places more power in the hands of big donors, effectively taking it away from individual voters. David Donnelly, the president of the pro-campaign finance reform organization Every Voice, said Americans who care about everything from taxes to the high cost of college to clean air and water should care about changes to campaign finance rules, because Congress plays a role in all of those areas. ""Every single one of those decisions is impacted by money in politics,"" he said. ""It's about who does Congress work for and Congress right now is changing the rules so that they are going to work even more than they are today for the wealthy and well connected."" Wertheimer said if the language makes it to President Obama's desk, he should veto it to avoid enabling the campaign scandals that are sure to follow. Lisa Gilbert, Director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch Division, agreed that the administration should make campaign finance reform a veto issue to send a message to the new Congress. ""This is a pretty scary foreshadowing of what's going to be on [Sen. Mitch] McConnell's list of to dos in the next Congress and certainly dismantling the campaign finance system is high on his priority list,"" Gilbert said. McConnell filed a friend of the court brief in the McCutcheon case that the argued overall limit placed individual contributions ""offends the First Amendment."" ""Contribution limits restrict the rights of speech and association of both the contributor and the recipient of the contribution,"" he wrote. Meredith McGehee, policy director at The Campaign Legal Center, a non-partisan organization that analyzes campaign finance laws, said she hopes there are enough provisions in the bill that raise the ire of enough Democrats and Republicans to stop it, otherwise it candidates will now be in the business of asking for even larger donations than they already are. While the new language would not change the limits on contributions to individual candidates, it is often the politicians themselves who solicit donations on behalf of their party committees. ""What you're now doing, if this provision goes into effect, is putting candidates out there soliciting for contributions of $1 million plus and that's the nexus for these contributors; they want the credit,"" said McGehee. ""They are businessmen. This is a return on investment."" The House is expected to vote on the bill Thursday, but Democrats in Congress have already raised alarms about the provision, with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi saying it ""would work to drown out the voices of the American people and massively expand the role of big money in our elections."" House Speaker John Boehner argued that these and other provisions were ""worked out in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion or they wouldn't be in the bill."" One campaign finance reform advocate noted that if these provisions become law, mega-donors who would have maxed out on individual contributions will have to hold onto their seats in the face of a flood of new ""asks"" from politicians and parties.","Political donors will be able to give a lot more money to political parties if a massive spending bill passes Congress this week .
Provisions were tucked into the bill during closed-door negotiations ."
"For many hotel guests, paying for Wi-Fi is an outdated charge that you only get wind of when you're up in your room. Now that mobile phones have rendered hotel room phones largely obsolete, Wi-Fi is the new bugbear for today's traveler. ""A lot of hotels lived well off telephone income,"" says Kurt Ritter, president & CEO of Rezidor Hotel Group. ""Telephone income was a big part of -- I don't want to say cheating -- but overcharging the customer. ""Everyone wants to make money, but I think you should make it in a reasonable way and internet, it's not a good idea to charge. It's like the air you breathe, the water you turn on -- it should be for free."" The Rezidor Group owns mid-tier chain Radisson Blu and has offered free Wi-Fi since 1995, which is now available in more than 50,000 rooms worldwide. ""If I use the 60% (Wi-Fi) usage that we have over the chain and the median figure that travelers pay, we would have roughly $10 million more income a year,"" Ritter says. But he adds that even though the revenue from Wi-Fi could fill the international phone-charge void, he isn't tempted to charge. See also: Marriott mogul's 55 years of hotels . For hotel guests there's the added frustration of inconsistency. Some hotels charge for Wi-Fi per device, others offer it free only to loyalty members; some chain hotels offer free Wi-Fi at their budget brands but charge for it at their luxury ones; sometimes Wi-Fi is free in the lobby. With no set rules, hotels charge as much or as little as they like. Take five-star hotels in London as an example: The Hilton Mayfair's daily rate is $32, and it also charges $120 for five days or $150 for a week, while Hilton Gold and Diamond members get it for free; the Haymarket hotel also charges $32 a day or 50 cents a minute; Four Seasons offers complimentary Wi-Fi for basic use, like emailing and social media, but charges $32 a day for a premium level with faster Wi-Fi. Other charges range from $15 a day at The Savoy to $41 a day at The Ritz Hotel. Joe Germanotta, chief executive of GuestWi-Fi, Wi-Fi provider to hotels such as Crowne Plaza and the Intercontinental Hotel Group, doesn't see a problem with Wi-Fi rates. ""When you have to pay for it as an amenity they guarantee you the reliability and speed and the security,"" he says. ""And it's becoming a very expensive proposition for the hotel to maintain these services, so it makes sense that they have to charge for it."" Germanotta says it costs a hotel roughly $375 per month to pay for Wi-Fi, which is why not all hotels charge for it. So when some budget and luxury hotels, along with bars and cafes, offer it for free, it's hard not to raise an eyebrow at the hotels that don't. But some argue the real cost for hotels comes in keeping up with ever-changing Wi-Fi specifications. ""What's been happening over the years is the bandwidth, the internet size requirement, has gone up tremendously and that number keeps growing and growing -- and that's where the hotel has a problem,"" Germanotta says. See also: Richard Gere's boutique hotel . The Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge, London, charges $10 an hour or $25 a day, allowing for up to six devices, but guests can use Wi-Fi for free in the lobby and bar. ""Given the constant re-investment and the constant drive with new technology coming in much faster than most of us can adapt ... we're at a point where we take any bit of profit and continue to re-invest in the technology,"" says Monika Neger, chief information officer for the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. She adds that if hotels charge for Wi-Fi, the service must be excellent. ""Some of the challenges the industry has had is charging for not very good bandwidth and this has really caused the entire industry to reflect and say how are we going to manage this?"" Neger says. ""We've had to make investments in areas that we've never invested in before -- meeting space, in the lobby. We are spending at minimum $250,000 per year in all of our properties to bring them up to current specifications."" She adds: ""The hotels who have yet not adopted any type of operating cost to set off this investment will find themselves in a difficult position."" Paying the bills may be difficult but so is keeping customers happy. It's not just how much they have to pay that's frustrating for guests -- it's also the difficulty of just logging on. Jean-Jacques Cesbron, from New York, is co-founder and president of Cami Music, and is on the road every other week. ""Every hotel has a different system,"" he says. ""Some require a code from front desk, some require you put in a credit card number, some just ask for your room number and then charge to your room. ""The fact is that it is a crapshoot to get a quality connection and the inconvenience of figuring out the process to get it is terrible."" With the growth of social media and websites like HotelChatter, it's becoming clear that guests' changing demands can't be ignored. Since 2004, HotelChatter has published an annual Hotel Wi-Fi report, praising the brands and boutiques that offer high-quality networks and naming and shaming those that don't. ""Getting charged each night for 24 hours Wi-Fi seems like pure profiteering on their part, but I think hotels are starting to realize that they will lose valuable customers and valuable business by charging crazy amounts for Wi-Fi,"" says Juliana Shallcross, managing editor at HotelChatter. ""What we are probably going to see more of is a tiered pay structure, where basic internet is free for emailing and updating your Facebook status. Anything more involved, like downloading movies, large PDF files, then you'll start to pay,"" she adds. Hotels not only need to adapt to guest activity, they also need to be aware that for many guests Wi-Fi is not an extra luxury, like the mini bar or dry cleaning, it's part and parcel of the guest experience -- like hot water and clean towels. Do you think it's OK for hotels to charge for Wi-Fi or do you think it should be free? Do you think tiered payments are the answer? Let us know by leaving a comment below.","Many hotels still charge guests for Wi-Fi access and prices are often inconsistent .

"A 6-day-old Wisconsin baby who vanished from a home early Thursday has been found safe at an Iowa gas station, authorities said Friday. The U.S. attorney in Madison, Wisconsin, has filed charges of kidnapping against Kristen R. Smith, in the case of 6-day-old Kayden Powell, who was found at an Iowa gas station Friday after going missing from the child's Wisconsin home early Thursday. Smith took Kayden Powellt from a home in Wisconsin and transported the the infant across state lines to Iowa, the federal complaint against her claims. An officer found Kayden Powell Friday morning. The child was swaddled in blankets inside a tote bag at a West Branch, Iowa, gas station, according to Town of Beloit, Wisconsin, police Chief Steven Kopp. ""Despite frigid temperatures, Kayden was found alive, and appears to be doing very well,"" Kopp said. ""In the words of EMS officials, he is in excellent health."" The baby was found outside the building, according to G.B. Jones, acting special agent in charge of the Milwaukee office of the FBI. ""We're all very, very fortunate that this baby is alive,"" Jones said. Smith was jailed Thursday in Iowa on an unrelated fraud warrant out of Texas after police investigating Kayden's disappearance contacted her on her cell phone and asked her to report to a nearby police station, authorities said. When police searched her car, they found baby clothes, but no sign of the infant, Kopp said Thursday. Kayden's mother is 18-year-old Brianna Marshall. Smith reportedly said at the home that she was Marshall's half-sister and that she, Marshall and the baby's father would be moving to Colorado, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. Authorities searched feverishly along the travel route back to Colorado after discovering the baby was missing, Jones said. ""We did have troopers, deputy sheriffs and police officers out all night checking every conceivable place along that route,"" Jones said.","A woman has been charged with kidnapping in case .

"Boston Fire Chief Steve Abraira, whose deputy chiefs criticized him over his handling of the Boston Marathon bombings, has submitted his resignation, the Boston Fire Department said Monday on its official Twitter account. Abraira's resignation is effective Friday. In an April 26 letter to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, 13 deputy fire chiefs said they had no confidence in Abraira, asserting that he failed to assume command responsibility or show any leadership at the scene. ""At a time when the city of Boston needed every first responder to take decisive action, Chief Abraira failed to get involved in operational decision-making or show any leadership,"" the letter read. CNN obtained the letter from a deputy chief who signed it but requested anonymity. In the letter, the deputies describe an e-mail that Abraira sent to all department members, saying that when he arrived at the scene, ""it was clear that our Command Officer had the incident well in hand and that our department was fully active in a support role with our law enforcement partners."" The deputies call Abraira's argument ""illogical"" and ""mere rationalization to justify his behavior,"" saying that when Abraira arrived, the Boston Fire Department was ""still heavily involved in the incident"" because of the possibility of ""second explosions,"" ""additional suspicious packages"" and ""structural stability concern of buildings,"" among other issues. Boston fire chief gets vote of 'no confidence' in handling of bombings . But Abraira defended his actions to CNN. ""In their estimation, they believe that if you don't assume command, you don't have responsibility there for what goes on,"" he said. ""I tried to explain to them, if I'm on the scene, I'm still responsible. That's it. But they don't believe it."" The chief told The Boston Globe that he was comfortable with the way his commanders were handling the incident. ""The nationally accepted practice is that you only take command (as chief) if there's something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it's overwhelming for the incident commander, and none of those things were in fact happening,"" he told the paper. Two bombs exploded at the finish line of the marathon on April 15, killing 3 and injuring more than 260 others. One of two bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a gunfight with authorities four days later. After much secrecy and protest, he was buried in a rural Virginia cemetery. Police took his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, into custody on April 19 after finding him hiding in a boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property causing death and is in federal custody.","Boston Fire Chief Steve Abraira resigns after deputies sigh letter of no confidence .

"Travel operators in China have a huge new set of rules to follow now that the country's first tourism law is in place. Approved in April, the 112-article law came into effect October 1 and aims to promote sustained industry growth. It includes measures to address issues -- mostly in the domestic industry -- such as tourist safety, unfair competition and forced shopping trips, in which agencies offer cheap tours but recoup their costs from commissions in partner shops. A report by state-run media Xinhua claims tour operators in China have hiked their prices as a result. Hong Kong's Travel Industry Council executive director Joseph Tung Yao-chung told Mingpao, a Chinese-language Hong Kong newspaper, that a total of 250 Chinese tourist groups registered to come to Hong Kong on October 1, Hong Kong's National Day, 30% fewer than last year. However, the hope is that the new law will help the industry regulate itself in the long run. ""Price wars were vicious in the past, while the recent rises are a sort of reasonable return to fair competition,"" said Wang Yanqi, director of the Research Center of Leisure Economy of China, in a Xinhua report. The tourism law also includes rules on state development planning. Tour guides and agencies that break the new laws face steep fines of up to RMB 300,000 ($49,000). Though the new law deals mainly with domestic tourism, there are sections that cover the rights of outbound travelers in their dealings with Chinese tour companies. Tackling global criticism . By 2015, 100 million Chinese will travel abroad, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. In 2012, Chinese overtook Americans and Germans as the world's top tourism spenders, with 83 million people spending a record $102 billion on international tourism. Coinciding with all that growth has been a surge in criticism of the way Chinese travelers behave while on the road, and it hasn't gone unnoticed in Beijing. Earlier this year, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang called on his nation's tourists to improve their manners, stressing the importance of projecting a ""good image of Chinese tourists."" Tourist behavior is even singled out in a couple articles of the new law. Article 14 states: ""Tourists shall observe public order and respect social morality in tourism activities, respect local customs, cultural traditions and religious beliefs, care for tourism resources, protect the ecological environment, and abide by the norms of civilized tourist behaviors."" More: Chinese tourism: The good, the bad and the backlash . In September, China's National Tourism Administration issued an illustrated 64-page ""Guidebook for Civilized Tourism"" to instruct citizens on social norms overseas. The booklet covers everything from reminders to say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and  ""excuse me"" to specific cultural items such as one that says ""In Iran, do not talk about babies' eyes."" ""When we are visiting a foreign place, we're the guests and have to treat the host with respect,"" says the guide. Coming on the tails of globally publicized incident earlier this year when a Chinese tourist was caught defacing a stone sculpture in an ancient Egyptian temple with graffiti, point eight in the first section of the guide reminds visitors to respect historical relics, and ""do not scribble on, climb on or touch them."" Other items remind tourists not to spit in inappropriate places, not to litter and only urinate or defecate in designated places. Other notable inclusions: . Photography: ""When taking photos in tourist spots, do not fight and be patient. Do not force the others to take a picture with you, nor obstruct the others when they are photographing. If you would like the others' to take a picture for you, say thank you."" Toilet use: ""Do not occupy the public toilet for a very long time. Do not leave footprints on the toilet seats and flush after use."" Queue jumping: ""Respect order in public. Jumping the line is not acceptable anywhere."" On tipping: ""Service industries in a lot of countries honor tipping. If you think the service is good, please tip accordingly."" At the buffet table: ""When you're at a buffet dinner, only take what you can consume. Do not waste food."" Taking in a show: ""Respect the performers. Clap after the show to show your gratitude to the performers. During curtain call, join the crowd for a standing ovation. If a performer slips up on stage, be understanding but do not cheer, whistle and jeer."" Cultural considerations . Another section of the guide covers items such as proper airplane etiquette and how to check into a hotel, while part three deals with specific cultural situations. In the UK: ""Do not greet the others by asking them questions like 'Where are you going?' or 'Have you eaten yet?' as you would in China."" In Korea: ""Don't pick up your chopsticks before your senior. And face sideways when drinking alcoholic beverages."" In Italy: ""Do not give someone a handkerchief in Italy. It is considered an omen for wiping tears when you lose someone."" In Spain: ""Ladies should wear earrings when going out. Otherwise, it is the same as going out naked.""

"China's unique white dolphins -- famous for the actual pink hue of their skin -- face going from endangered to extinct -- with conservationists doubtful they can be saved. ""We've seen alarming decline in the last decade -- 158 dolphins in 2003, just 61 dolphins in 2012,"" says Samuel Hung, Chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society. ""We are at a critical juncture on whether we can help the dolphins,"" adds Hung. ""I have no idea whether they will keep going down and down -- but what I do know is we need to work urgently to come up with solutions to clean up the dolphin's habitat."" Land reclamation for massive engineering projects, resulting water pollution and boat strikes have exacted a heavy toll on the white dolphin population, which is mainly found in the waters of Hong Kong's Pearl River Delta in southern China. In 2016, the first automobiles are expected to roll across the 42-kilometer Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, respectively connecting the Asian financial hub with the Chinese mainland's ""special economic zone"" and the world's gambling capital. Now under construction, the world's longest cross-sea bridge and tunnel link will go ""right through the heart of the dolphin population,"" says Hung. ""There will be lots of piling activities to construct the bridge."" By 2023, Hong Kong aims to complete a third runway for Chep Lap Kok international airport, already one of the world's busiest. In the absence of soil on which to build, 650 hectares of land -- an area more than 5,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools -- will be reclaimed from the sea.  The area is also prime habitat for the Chinese white dolphin. The Hong Kong government has also proposed four additional land reclamation projects in dolphin-populated areas that aim to increase the amount of land on which to build in order to bring down the high cost of housing, adds Hung. Yet, despite Hong Kong's plans for numerous engineering projects that will impact the white dolphins' habitats, the founder of the 10-year old Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society says he ""actually applauds"" the government's conservation efforts. ""I don't doubt their desire to conserve,"" explains Hung, who adds that the Hong Kong government has provided more than $1 million Hong Kong dollars (US$125,000) each year for environmental research funds, set up a marine protection park for the white dolphins and helped monitor dolphin population numbers. ""But it's the other bureaus who want to push economic projects"" including Hong Kong's Airport Authority and the Civil Engineering and Development Department, says Hung. ""The economic departments are more influential so our voice for conservation work is drowned out by the voice for construction.""","China's white dolphin population has fallen more than 60% from 2003 to 2012 .

"Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his government Tuesday, amid a political crisis fired by violent protests on the country's streets. Azarov and his Cabinet will continue in their roles until a new government is formed, a notice on the presidential website said. Yanukovych's announcement comes only hours after Azarov submitted his resignation and as the national parliament met in an emergency session aimed at ending the crisis. In a first step, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to repeal sweeping anti-protest laws whose passage this month angered anti-government demonstrators. The special parliamentary session also looked at legislation that might provide amnesty for more than 200 people arrested since the demonstrations began in late November. It's been adjourned until Wednesday, when lawmakers will continue the debate, state news agency Ukrinform said. But activists on the street have said that while the concessions are a step in the right direction, their fundamental grievances have yet to be addressed. 'We all want to live in a lawful state,' says Ukrainian protester . They want to see wide-ranging constitutional reform and a shake-up of the Ukrainian political system. The controversial anti-protest laws were rammed through parliament on January 16 by a show of hands by members of Yanukovych's Party of Regions. Anger about the legislation escalated the long-running anti-government protests into violent confrontations, with police and protesters fighting pitched battles in the icy streets of Ukraine's capital, Kiev. Division of powers . As the crisis has deepened, Yanukovych's government has come under increasing pressure both internally and from Western governments concerned about an apparent bid to limit people's democratic rights. Vitali Klitschko, leader of the opposition Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party, or UDAR, told reporters at parliament that the repeal of the anti-protest laws was a small but very important step. Much remains to be done, he said, according to his party's website. ""Today, we still have to consider a very important issue on the amnesty and release of all detained demonstrators,"" he said. ""It is also crucial to address the question of the constitutional reform, which will divide powers between a President, a Prime Minister and the Parliament."" In a statement posted on the government's website, Azarov said that by quitting he intended to ""create more opportunities for social and political compromise for a peaceful settlement of the conflict."" That conflict ""is a threat to the entire Ukrainian society and every citizen,"" he said, adding that the government was doing all it could to prevent bloodshed. It will likely take more than Azarov's departure to satisfy the demands of hardy protesters who, despite the bitter cold and threat of violence, have massed in and around central Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, to demand Yanukovych's ouster and new elections. In recent days, protests have also spread to other cities around the country. Yatsenyuk: 'Shameful practice' Azarov's resignation may have been a case of jumping before he was pushed. He was widely expected to face a vote of no confidence in his government at the special parliamentary session, and his post had already been offered to an opposition leader. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who heads the Fatherland Party, refused Yanukovych's offer to be prime minister, but Azarov's position was made almost untenable. Speaking in parliament Tuesday, Yatsenyuk urged the President to sign the law repealing the anti-protest legislation as soon as possible, according to the official Ukrinform news agency. ""I'm asking Viktor Yanukovych to immediately sign a law for which the parliament has just voted,"" he said. ""We have finally closed the shameful practice of voting by a show of hands and abolished those laws against which the whole of Ukraine rebelled."" Fatherland is also the party of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who has been imprisoned since 2010 on charges the United States and Europe have called politically motivated. In a statement Monday evening, she called on the opposition to remain firm. Another round of talks was held Monday between the government and the opposition as they sought a resolution to the crisis.

Force 'not the answer' Ukraine was high on the agenda for a long-planned ""Russia summit"" in Brussels, Belgium, attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman van Rompuy. Speaking at a news conference after the summit, Van Rompuy urged restraint and said those responsible for violence in Ukraine must be held accountable. ""The present stalemate must be rapidly overcome,"" he said, as he called for genuine dialogue between the government and opposition. The European Union is ready to move ahead with the planned trade deal, or association agreement, with Ukraine whose dismissal by Yanukovych first triggered the popular protests, Van Rompuy added. Barroso said the repeal of the anti-protest laws and a potential amnesty for arrested protesters, if confirmed, would be ""important steps"" toward resolving the crisis. ""Use of force is not the answer"" to the present political situation, he said. There have been tensions between Russia and the European Union over developments in Ukraine, with each side accusing the other of interference. But Putin has denied that Moscow is exerting undue influence in Ukraine. ""Russia has always respected, is respecting and will respect the sovereign rights of all the international entities including new states that emerged after breakdown of the Soviet Union,"" he said at the summit. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, who was also at the summit, will travel to Kiev later Tuesday for talks. Stefan Fule, the European Commissioner for EU enlargement, also returned to Kiev on Tuesday. Their main objective is to help bring a halt to violence and provide political stability in Ukraine, while respecting the will of the people, said Van Rompuy.

The clashes over the past 10 days are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn the planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The families of two boys allegedly shot to death by a U.S. consular employee as they tried to rob him have filed a complaint with Lahore police against the American, accusing him of two murders, a police spokesman said. Nayab Haider said the complaint, called a ""first information report,"" triggers an official investigation by police, who will submit their findings to a court. The court then will decide on what, if any, charges will be filed. The American was driving in a busy area known as Kartaba Chawk when two boys on a motorcycle tried to rob him, said another police official, Faisal Rana. The American shot both boys, he said. Rana identified the American as Raymond Davis. Alberto Rodriguez, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, confirmed that the man involved in the shooting is an employee of the U.S. consulate but did not confirm his identity. Rodriguez also said he could not confirm details of the police account. Rana said the man surrendered to police and was in custody. Rodriguez, however, could not say whether the man was in police custody or whether he had been turned over to the consulate. In addition, Rana said, a car from the U.S. consulate was involved in an accident that killed a motorcyclist while it was en route to the police station in response to the shooting incident.

"(CNN) -- Houston prosecutors are asking a court to formally exonerate a Texas man after DNA tests ruled out his guilt in a rape for which he served 17 years in prison. George Rodriguez was freed in 2004 after an appeals court found that faulty scientific evidence had been used against him in his 1987 trial. Prosecutors didn't retry him, citing concerns about having the victim -- who had identified Rodriguez as one of her two attackers in a police lineup -- testify again. State officials had denied his request for a pardon, but Harris County District Attorney Patricia Lykos agreed to review his case after she took office in 2009. New DNA tests on the forensic evidence in the case came back February 22 and conclusively ruled out Rodriguez, now 50, Lykos said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""When this scientific inquiry began, there was no legal requirement or mandate for any further work to be done by our office, because the case had been dismissed,"" Lykos said. ""Instead, we acted on the most important obligation of all -- to see that the truth emerges, and that justice is done. Today, we can state that an innocent man has been vindicated."" The Harris County District Attorney's office will ask a judge to formally declare Rodriguez innocent at a Thursday hearing, she said. Lykos, a Republican, campaigned on promises to reform the prosecutor's office in Texas' largest city, and she has drawn praise from defense lawyers for creating a post-conviction review process to examine new evidence. The Innocence Project, which won Rodriguez's release in 2004, gave her an award in 2010 for that program. Another man, Manuel Beltran, is now serving a 60-year prison term in connection for rape. The DNA testing also confirmed that another man, now dead but long considered an alternative suspect, also assaulted the victim, who was 14 at the time.","George Rodriguez was released in 2004 but never formally cleared .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Abdul Hakeem Belhaj, one of the most effective commanders among anti-Gadhafi forces in Libya, has seen plenty of combat in his 45 years. A well-built, bearded man with dark, serious eyes, he fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan -- and alongside al Qaeda in the dying days of the Taliban regime. Now he is commander of the anti-Gadhafi forces in Tripoli, and swears loyalty to the National Transitional Council, describing himself as an ""ordinary Libyan"" fighting for a common cause. But there's not much ordinary about Belhaj. As a young man in the late 1980s, he was one of scores of jihadists in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group that went to fight in Afghanistan. His military prowess soon made him a commander among his fellow fighters. After the fall of the Taliban, Belhaj left Afghanistan and was arrested in Malaysia in 2004. After some questioning by the CIA, he was sent back to Libya and jailed. Belhaj was released from Moammar Gadhafi's notorious Abu Salim jail last year. He and dozens of others of LIFG fighters negotiated with the Gadhafi regime for their freedom -- in return for denouncing al Qaeda and its philosophy of jihad. The negotiations were led by a former LIFG member in exile, Noman Benotman, and Saif al Islam Gadhafi, one of the sons of the Libyan leader and a man that Belhaj is now hunting. The Gadhafi regime had jailed hundreds of Islamists, among them fighters of the LIFG who had launched a short-lived insurgency in the 1990s. Many were massacred during a prison revolt in 1996. Western counterterrorism experts are now at best concerned -- and at worst alarmed -- by the prominent role Belhaj and the LIFG cadres have played in Libya's revolt. But sitting in an air-conditioned room in one of Tripoli's most exclusive hotels, Belhaj was keen to dispel the notion that he is part of an Islamist fifth column preparing to make a power grab in the new Libya. ""I am an ordinary citizen of Libya. I am a part of the fabric of this nation, a normal Muslim,"" he said in long-winded and carefully worded classical Arabic. The LIFG ""was not a terrorist organization,"" he said. "" All our activities were inside our country with the aim of liberating our people from Gadhafi. That's why we met and that's why we worked. We did not give any blessing to any act that would hurt civilians or destroy public sector establishments, and anyone who has kept up with our activities knows that."" Belhaj has played a crucial role in liberating Tripoli. Units under his control seized Gadhafi's sprawling Bab al Aziziya compound days after the rebels entered Tripoli. He insists his goals are at one with those of the NTC. ""We are part of the Libyan people. We did not carry out any military acts with a particular ideology or under any flag,"" he said. Flanked by his press assistant, a former LIFG member who became an accountant in London, Belhaj continued: ""We treated everybody equally with one purpose, and that is to achieve the goals of the February 17 revolution."" ""I have not seen anything that would potentially damage the relationship between everybody who worked on the liberation of the cities that they were in,"" he added. But there have been signs of tensions between former LIFG members and rank-and-file fighters who joined the revolt and are perturbed to see such a prominent Islamist figure gain so much power. For his part, Belhaj is now focused on finding Gadhafi. ""A lot of the information that we receive points to more than one area because we are focusing on more than one area,"" Belhaj said. ""He might be between Bani Walid (a pro-Gadhafi town in the desert) and Sirte, trying to find a route to the south of the country as the pressure increases on him."" Gadhafi ""is trying to secure a location for himself and is releasing ridiculous statements to incite some na√Øve people, to motivate some people he describes as his loyalists to alter the current security situation."" Belhaj expressed hope that the violence in Libya would soon be over. ""We hope that will happen without any more bloodshed or destruction of public property,"" he said. ""We call for the surrender of those who continue to support the regime."" That was why, he said, the NTC had extended the deadline for Gadhafi forces in Sirte to lay down their weapons. Belhaj also said he had spoken to one of Gadhafi's sons, Saadi, who has called for an end to the fighting. ""I told him that we would assure his safety and that no one would harm him,"" Belhaj said, but added: ""The legal matters we do not control. We are striving to establish a nation of laws. We want justice to prevail -- that we have lacked for 40 years."" Belhaj also reflected on his time in Afghanistan, stressing that he and others in the LIFG were not affiliated with al Qaeda. ""Our presence in Afghanistan with or without al Qaeda does not mean that we agree with them. Our presence in Afghanistan was to support the just cause of the Afghan fight against the Soviets,"" he said. ""We went to support the people, and we extended a hand to them in education and aid. ... We also helped to defend and fight, as did many other nations that joined, including the United States,"" Belhaj said in what seemed like an effort to reassure Washington. ""As for our presence in Afghanistan, (just because it) coincided with the presence of al Qaeda does not mean that we agree or believe in the same ideology."" Whether Belhaj and others who belonged to the LIFG will continue to sing in tune with the National Transitional Council is the great unknown. I have followed the group's evolution for years, and it seems they truly came to perceive Osama bin Laden's nihilistic campaign against the west as counter-productive, and al Qaeda's indiscriminate attacks on ""non-believers"" as unjustifiable. While in jail at Abu Salim, a prison less than a mile from the Gadhafi compound that Belhaj helped seize, the LIFG fighters wrote a long theological treatise that attacked al Qaeda's core principles. At the end of our interview, Belhaj again took pains to reassure the wider world of Islamists' role in the Libyan uprising. ""I want to take this opportunity to assure to all that the revolutionaries in Libya are united, and there is nothing frightening,"" he said. ""They all joined hands against this tyrant and now the revolution is achieving its goals. ... There is nothing more important than securing our nation."" There are plenty of political models for Libya's Islamists to adopt and adapt -- in Egypt and Tunisia for example, where newly resurgent Islamist parties and groups profess to be committed to democracy and constitutional government. The question is: will they?","Abdul Hakeem Belhaj is one of Libya's top anti-Gadhafi rebel commanders .
Some western analysts are concerned with his prominent role, given his past association with Islamist forces .
Belhaj was part of a group of Libyans that fought alongside al Qaeda against the Soviets in Afghanistan .
Belhaj says the fact that he fought alongside al Qaeda doesn't mean he agrees with the aims of the organization ."
"Washington (CNN)The Congress that has done virtually nothing for two years is wrapping up 2014 with a bang. Dozens of policy provisions are tucked into a 1,603-page bill that will keep the government open through next September. The provisions affect everything from campaign finance laws to financial regulations, marijuana possession and even the government's purchase of white potatoes. The bill, which was negotiated between Democrats and Republicans over several weeks, is expected to get a vote in the House on Thursday -- right as Washington faces a deadline to avert another government shutdown. The provisions are notable because House Republican leaders frequently tout a transparent process. But some of the items added at the last minute to this massive funding bill were never discussed in any committee hearing, or voted on as part of any of the nearly dozen spending bills that were rolled into one package to result in the 1,603-page legislation. House Speaker John Boehner defended including all these so-called ""policy riders"" in the spending bill on Wednesday. ""Understand all these provisions in the bill were worked out in a bi-partisan, bi-cameral fashion or they wouldn't be in the bill,"" Boehner said. Here is a quick list of some of the changes: . Blocking new marijuana legalization bill in Washington, D.C.: Voters in D.C. approved a measure to decriminalize recreational marijuana use last month. But Congress has authority over the city's finances, so the bill bars the District from using any of its own money or federal funds to regulate the use of pot. Wealthy donors allowed to give more to political parties: The bill increases the individual limits that donors can give to national parties to help fund conventions, building funds and legal proceedings, such as recounts. The change would effectively allow rich donors to give ten times more than they can today to support political parties.  Republicans who pushed for the change say they are substituting more private money for the taxpayer money that was collected for national political campaign committees, but instead used to fund a pediatric cancer bill that passed earlier this year. More wheat bread for school lunches: Republicans wanted to block new nutritional requirements for school lunches under a program championed by First Lady Michelle Obama.  But instead of wiping out the rule, Republicans and Democrats agreed to give local schools more flexibility on how they decided to include whole grain items on school menus. The sage grouse faces uncertain future: The Fish and Wildlife Service wanted to add the sage grouse - a type of bird found in some western states - to the endangered species list, but Republicans argued that would have a negative economic fallout for energy companies developing resources in those states. No more taxpayer money for expensive portraits: Committee chairs and other high ranking government officials in Washington often commission large, often very pricey portraits of themselves to hang in hearing rooms. Under the bill they would need to use private money to pay for any new portraits. Old fashioned light bulbs still allowed: The bill blocks new energy efficient standards that would have made incandescent light bulbs obsolete. Consumers had complained about the new requirements. White potatoes get top billing: A new provision was added requiring that the Women, Infants and Children program that provides food assistance to low income families include fresh vegetables, and includes an explicit requirement for white potatoes. Truckers won't be required to get more sleep: Safety advocates wanted to require truck drivers to get a full two night's sleep before beginning their new shift on the road, but the bill blocks that requirement. Farmers get a reprieve from some clean water rules: The deal prevents the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing some of its clean water act rules in some agricultural regions. Gitmo prisoners can't come to the United States: The bill bars money for transferring any detainees held at the facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to any prisons in the U.S. Banks allowed to use taxpayer money to engage in potentially risky trades: The bill rolls back a provision that was part of financial reforms for Wall Street banks.  It reverses a rule that was enacted in 2010 that barred banks from using taxpayer backed funds from trading in derivatives.  Democrats argue these often risky trades helped contribute to the financial collapse in 2008. Blocks IRS from targeting certain groups:  The bill prevents any federal money to be used by the Internal Revenue Service to target any advocacy group based on their ideological leanings.  This practice is already not allowed, but Republicans wanted to underline it after internal documents showed that some IRS employees targeted some groups when investigating their tax-exempt status. New sexual harassment training for Hill staffers:  The measure requires the Chief Administrative Officer, the office that oversees the thousands of aides working on Capitol Hill, to develop an online training program focused on sexual harassment.  Earlier this year, Louisiana GOP Rep Vance McAllister was caught kissing a member of his own staff. What the bill doesn't do: . The bill doesn't block the president's executive action on immigration. Conservatives wanted to use the spending bill to strip away money for any agencies tasked with implementing the president's new policy. But the legislation continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security through the end of February. The deal doesn't roll back any major portions of Obamacare - it allows for continued funding at the current levels. Last fall the GOP's effort to defund the health care law as part of the spending bill resulted in a government shutdown, a move leaders pledged they didn't want to repeat this year.","Lawmakers tucked in dozens of items to the spending bill .

"Instagram is easing users into ads with a first look at what the paid posts will look like. The photo-sharing service said the ads will begin appearing in users' feeds in the coming week and showed examples of what ads will look like in a blog post. Instagram first warned users of the impending ads three weeks ago. This is the first time ads have appeared in Instagram feeds. The ads will look almost exactly like regular Instagram posts, but in the top right corner a blue arrow icon and the word ""sponsored"" will replace the old time-stamp. Click on the more button in the bottom right corner and there will be additional options to hide an ad or give feedback on why you didn't like it. The service is taking great pains to make initial ads attractive and in-line with the sepia- and sunset-soaked Instagram brand. It's handpicking the early advertisers, choosing big names that already have Instagram accounts including Levi's, Ben & Jerry's, General Electric and PayPal. Well-funded brands will likely spring for high quality, original photos that blend in better with a regular feed of photos from friends. If your friends are iffy photographers, the ads might stand out for being a bit prettier than you're used to. It's a much more cautious approach than Instagram's parent company Facebook took with its early ads. The notoriously low-budget ads on the social network have been known to shill everything from discount clogs and dating services to big brands like Verizon and Virgin America with dinky stock photography or logos. Instagram and Facebook already know a great deal about what you like and what ads you'll be most interested in seeing. The service is going to use data from your Instagram and Facebook habits -- like your friends, likes and interests -- to help it choose what ads to show. It will also use your feedback on ads over time to flesh out your ad-dossier. All Instagram users will eventually see ads, even if they don't have a Facebook account. If you're on Instagram, there is no way to avoid them for now, though the rollout will be limited to users in the United States at first. Instagram will also only show ads to people 18 and older (anyone over 13 can open an Instagram account).","Instagram showed mock-ups of what its first ads will look like .

"Beijing (CNN)For years China has been the envy of the world, hailed as the great 'economic miracle' thanks to its sustained double-digit growth. Of late, however, the Middle Kingdom has also become the poster boy for environmental degradation, a target of ridicule for Beijing's now notorious ""airpocalyse."" Even U.S. President Barack Obama could not resist dissing Beijing's bad air. ""I would just point to one simple example, and that is you would not want your kids growing up in Beijing right now, because they could not breathe,"" President Obama said while defending his controversial environmental regulation last week. ""And the fact of the matter is that used to be true in Los Angeles -- as recently as 1970. And the reason it changed was because of the Clean Air Act,"" he added. Lessons . Like LA, Beijing sits in a virtual 'bowl.' Surrounded by mountain ranges, air -- clean or dirty -- typically gets trapped when there's no wind blowing. This similar geography hopefully delivers valuable anti-pollution lessons Beijing can heed. Speaking at a recent forum held at the Stanford Center in Peking University, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that pollution isn't the result of bad geography alone but ""human activity in that bad geography."" Like Beijing today, LA in the last century went through a rapid rise in population and an economic boom. ""With this followed demands for more power, more jobs, and the rising middle class that did things like buy cars and drive them,"" Garcetti said. ""We grew and are proud of that growth, as you here in Beijing should be too. But it came at a cost."" ""Our first smog attack came near World War II, and it was so bad that some thought it was a chemical weapon attack by Japanese forces during the war."" As the LA population grew, smog in the 1950s and 1960s got worse. ""Our economy thrived but our air did not. Like Beijing today, 60 years ago LA was fumed up from oil refineries, power plants, our steel and chemical plants,"" Garcettie said. Pollution came at a human cost. ""In the 1970s when I grew up. We breathed the dirtiest air in the world,"" Garcetti explained. ""Kids were kept from playing outside. Emergency rooms were filled with patients."" Three step plan to beating pollution . Garcetti ticked off three effective measures to combat the smog. Step 1: Face the truth, accept it and own it. When LA was in self-denial, ""we used polite words to describe smog, like 'it's just a hazy day' or 'it's overcast',"" Garcetti recalled. Step 2: Build a strong government for enforcement. In 1963, the government passed its first Clean Air Act, which mandated governments at federal and local levels to get involved. In 1970, it passed its first emission standards for cars. Step 3: Get the public sector and ordinary people involved to make sure that the government's held accountable. Private groups and civil society played important roles as whistle-blowers and watchdogs. The city did not have to sacrifice growth either, Garcetti said. ""When you pair a regulation with innovation, you get a pro-growth policy,"" he said. ""Turning to new green energy not only improved LA's pollution problem, it sparked an entirely new clean tech industry that attracted new businesses in our city and employed tens of thousands of people."" ""Today, I'm the mayor of a city that has seen the population double at the same time we reduced ozone level by nearly two thirds. We have beautiful sunny days, with clear skies throughout most of the year."" Consolation . It may be a small consolation for Beijingers to know that when LA was mired in bad air and dirty water, the skies in the Chinese capital were clear. I fondly remember Beijing in the 1970s and 1980s, when rivers where clean and people fished and swam. Except for the few days when sand storms whipped up from the Gobi desert swept over Beijing, the city's sky was typically blue. Of course, Beijing then had a few industries, life was spartan, population movement was severely restricted, and most people got around via bicycles, not cars. The encouraging news is residents and officials in Beijing now agree that China needs to clean its air. Last month, when Beijing hosted the annual APEC summit meeting, Chinese officials pulled out all the stops to ensure the sky was clear -- forcing factories to close, limiting the number of cars on the road and declaring a six-day holiday to encourage citizens to leave Beijing. It largely worked. Most of the days turned out to be smog free, prompting people to coin the phrase ""APEC blue."" Of course, these are short-term fixes and China needs to make sure long-term measures come to fruition. China's foreign ministry said in response to a question on President Obama's swipe it hoped that ""APEC blue"" could last permanently. Let's hope they're successful because at stake is the health and well-being of millions of Chinese, not to mention China's national pride.","China is a ""poster boy"" for environmental degradation .

"House Republicans on Thursday elected Kevin McCarthy as majority leader, succeeding Eric Cantor, who is relinquishing the job after losing his primary election in an upset. The California Republican defeated Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador for the No. 2 position, which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the chamber and deciding which bills come to the floor for a vote. Labrador argued for a fresh conservative voice in the GOP leadership in challenging McCarthy, who was the favorite. With the win, McCarthy moves up a notch in the leadership hierarchy from whip, where he was responsible for counting votes and enforcing party discipline. Republicans then chose Louisiana's Steve Scalise, a red-state conservative, to succeed him. Operationally, few expect McCarthy's rise to significantly change how Republicans run the House. Supporters say Republican proposals will come largely from committees and McCarthy's mainly will focus on using his political skills to help shape the GOP message and strategy to push its agenda, and help coordinate with Senate Republicans, who are in the minority. Following Cantor's loss to a political upstart in Virginia last week, McCarthy began to quietly reach out to members, using his extensive network as whip to build support. Underneath his easy demeanor is an intensely political operative, who helped recruit and fundraise for most of the first- and second-term GOP members, who make up a sizeable part of the conference. He can cite polls from various congressional districts across the country off the top of his head. Because he lives in his Washington office when Congress is in session, McCarthy spends a lot of time hosting take-out dinners and working out in the House gym. Personal relationships helped him quickly accumulate commitments to win the majority leader's post. Typically the majority leader is the speaker in waiting, but McCarthy would almost certainly face a conservative challenger if the current speaker, John Boehner, decides to step down after the midterm elections. Some members on the right see McCarthy as the establishment candidate, and disagree with his position on immigration, a hot-button issue. McCarthy, who represents an agricultural district, has expressed support for some type of legal status for undocumented workers. Immigration reform: Kevin McCarthy's 'House of Cards' Before last week's stunning upset of Cantor many considered McCarthy as potentially the most vulnerable member of the House Republican leadership team. During his tenure as whip, there were several embarrassing episodes, when high profile bills -- such as the farm bill and GOP debt limit plans -- failed to pass. Because Thursday's election's only installs McCarthy as majority leader for the remainder of the current Congress, the next five months will be a test for him. He could face a challenge in the fall when all GOP leaders stand for re-election ‚Äî whether it's for the top spot or for majority leader. Texas Republican Rep Jeb Hensarling, who briefly considered a bid for Cantor's post, may decide to run against him.

"Every morning, Dirk Dallas takes a trip around the world. With his own eyes, he studies artful, real-time images of life in New York, Paris and Hong Kong. But Dallas, a graphic designer, doesn't actually leave his Riverside, California, neighborhood, or even his front door. He just needs his phone and a digital portal called Instagram. ""It's like taking a vacation every day,"" said Dallas. ""Instagram is different than any other social network I've been on."" The freedom to share and connect with users across the globe is big part of what keeps Dallas coming back to Instagram, the wildly popular mobile photo sharing app, again and again. It's that same appeal, Dallas figures, which led to Facebook's stunning purchase of Instagram this week -- the single largest acquisition in that social network's 8-year history. ""Facebook isn't buying an app; they are buying us,"" said Dallas. ""They are buying a community."" Facebook turned the tech world on its head Monday when the social media giant laid down a whopping $1 billion in cash and stock options to gobble up Instagram, a scrappy, San Francisco-based startup with just 13 suddenly very rich employees. Instagram has seen explosive growth, racking up more than 35 million registered downloads in just 18 months. Its community doubled in size the last five months alone -- turbocharged in part by the release of its long-awaited Android version last week -- which propelled a million new users to sign up in the first 24 hours. On Tuesday, propelled by a wave of publicity, the free app hit the #1 spot on Apple's App Store for the first time ever. The billion-dollar question still looms, of course: Why would the world's largest photo-sharing platform fork over so much money for a tiny company that was evaluated at half that price? Business analysts and tech geeks have speculated on the motives, but the heart of answer just might lie in the passion of Instagram's most invested users. At its core, Instagram is a remarkably simple way to share mobile photos. Users snap pictures, enhance them with filters that add an arty or vintage look, and share them with their followers. As on Twitter, users can follow other Instagrammers, whose photos then show up in their streams. Users can ""like"" or comment on photos, as they can on Facebook. Tyson Wheatley: My year through the lens of a really smart phone . But to many of its most loyal users, Instagram is much more -- a creative outlet, a place to be inspired every day and a platform to make new friends. ""Instagram has changed my life,"" said Bex Finch, who has more than 100,000 followers on the network. ""I love being able to share my world with people I don't know but [who] inspire me."" But Finch, a San Francisco-based photographer who says she has landed gigs by connecting with clients via the app, is worried a massive influx of new Facebook users could spell the end of Instagam's charm. ""Maybe Instagram has played its role,"" she said. ""Maybe it's time to move on."" The blogosphere in recent days has been full of similar complaints from Instagram users worried that Facebook will sell their personal data or pollute their photo streams with ads. Photographer Benjamin Heath is more cautiously optimistic. ""Let's wait and see what happens before we pass judgment,"" said Heath, who also lives in San Francisco. ""Of course I would be very angry if Instagram became something I no longer want to use,"" he said. ""But there's no reason to suspect that yet."" Heath believes there could be a silver lining as the service skyrockets in popularity: improved features such as adjustable filters, perhaps, or an easier way to keep track of talented users. With more than 800 million users, Facebook knows a little something about scale. And Instagram's rapid growth has created its own bumps along the way. Early adopters have complained that Instagram's ""popular page"" has become nearly impossible to reach and is often filled with photos that people did not take themselves -- too many semi-clothed teens, for example, or Justin Bieber tributes. Longtime Instagrammers gripe that some users are there merely to gain followers, not necessarily to join what Shah Kashani describes as a ""thriving community of like-minded people thirsty for photography."" ""I'm just as much a viewer as I am a photographer,"" said Kashani, a web developer from Brooklyn, New York. ""And that's the same with everyone, so there's this constant feedback loop. It almost feels like this collaboration in becoming better photographers."" Kashani wants to keep his Facebook and Instagram accounts, and communities, separate. ""The problem with my Facebook is it's all over the place,"" Kashani said. ""I'm connected to colleagues, family, and friends, but I feel like I'm forcing my photography on Facebook."" Serge Najjar, a lawyer in Beirut, doesn't have a Facebook account. Nor does he want anything to do with it. ""It's always a new challenge to put up with change,"" Najjar said. ""What I fear is Instagram losing its simple approach. It's a very pure, social, exchange between people who share the same passion."" Dallas, the Riverside Instagrammer, also is concerned about Facebook's vast reach. ""Instagram is a very small team. They are nimble and fast and can make decisions,"" he said. ""My fear is that now there will be more layers to this creative process."" Ike Edeani, a graphic designer in San Francisco, bought his first iPhone partly so he could download Instagram. He admits he can easily spend four hours a day interacting with the app's visual community. ""I don't really get excited about posting photos to Facebook,"" Edeani said. ""But that's exactly how I feel when posting to Instagram."" Edeani says that by treating his phone like a camera, he is more open to exploration. ""Instagram reawakened my creativity in a lot of ways,"" he said. ""I've learned to react to that spark -- when I see something just walking around -- and not just dismiss it. Here is this little app that's connecting us all [in San Francisco] and inspiring us to go out and explore this city we live in, to wake up at six in the morning to go capture a sunrise."" Edeani said he's not considering quitting Instagram at this point, in part, because ""there's noting else out there compares."" Not everyone agrees. Some Instagram users have already made the jump to other platforms. Robert-Paul Jansen, a web developer living in The Netherlands, said the Facebook deal was the ""final push."" He closed his account Monday, leaving behind more than 2,000 followers, and now shares his mobile landscape photography on EyeEm, a Berlin-based competitor to Instagram. Jansen is not the only respected Instagrammer to flee the app this week. But fears of an exodus, for now, appear greatly exaggerated. Still, even the most optimistic Instagram users are left with wounds. ""What happens the next time a tool is created that taps in to my interests?"" wondered Heath. ""Am I going to feel the same way? Or can we assume that all great things will eventually be owned by Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft?"" Whatever the motives for the deal, few users seem to be holding CEO Kevin Systrom and the rest of the Instagram team in contempt for selling out. In the end it's a billion dollars,"" said Heath. ""I don't blame [Instagram]. There's no black and white. It's just a lot of bread.""","Facebook bought photo sharing app Instagram for $1 billion on Monday .

"When your smartphone makes it so easy to connect to the Internet, why bother firing up a clunky desktop or laptop computer? Two-thirds of cell-phone owning Americans use their phones to surf the Web and check e-mail, according to the latest study from the Pew Internet & American Life Project. That's double the amount from 2009, when only 31% of people said they used their phones to go online. For a growing segment of people, phones aren't just a secondary way to check the news or send off a quick e-mail. According to Pew, 21% of phone owners use their devices as their primary way of accessing the Internet, more than PCs and tablets. Since Pew began tracking Internet and phone usage in 2009, the numbers have steadily risen year-over-year. First there were the youthful early adopters, then it spread to older age groups. This year, biggest jump in online phone-owners was among 50- to 64-year-olds. The groups most likely to own a smartphone are still the same people who are most likely to access the Internet from their phones. The tech-savvy 18- to 29-year-old set is the most likely to go online from a phone, as are people with a college degree or higher, or people making more than $75,000 a year. Mobile Web use also is higher among minorities. Three-quarters of African-American and 68% of Hispanic phone owners are going online from their handsets, while just 59% of white phone owners are doing the same. A whopping 91% of American adults have cell phones and a little more than half of those are smartphones. Smartphones are built for accessing the Internet and apps -- so much so that making a phone call on the devices can seem like an afterthought. Touchscreen Android, iOS, Blackberry and Windows Phone devices are replacing one-trick feature phones, and are changing the way Americans access the Internet in the process. Each year smartphones get faster, the screens sharper and apps better. Internet connections are also speeding up, both though cellular networks and available Wi-Fi networks. Not every phone owner uses a fancy smartphone to surf the Web, however. People are also going online from their feature phones between texting, phone calls and games of ""Snake."" Surfing the Web on these devices is an impressive feat given the limited controls available.","More people are turning to their phones to access the Internet and e-mail .

"As the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 continues, both the Malaysian government and the airline have come under sharp criticism. Some say that all involved parties, including the manufacturer Boeing, are circling their wagons and bracing for a long public relations siege while the families of the missing passengers continue to grieve. Meanwhile, others have stepped in to help the relatives of the passengers. One group of emissaries from the United States has traveled across the globe at their own expense to offer assistance to the grieving families. However, instead of being welcomed, their arrival was reported with thinly veiled revulsion. I'm talking about the lawyers. The lawyers were described in reports as ""descending"" on the scene and ""hovering"" around the families. Apparently, stereotypes about the legal profession exist around the world. But the bias toward lawyers is logically indefensible. Malaysia Airlines and Boeing are not charities . These gigantic corporations are legally obligated to minimize their financial exposure.  This means that every move they make is strategically calculated against their legal adversaries.  And those adversaries are civilians. More specifically, they are bereaved mothers, fathers and other family members of those who were aboard Flight 370.  Talk about David vs. Goliath. How well do you know the Montreal Convention? The Montreal Convention is an international treaty signed by 97 countries that addresses the liability of air carriers in international flights.  It contains strict limitations on the time in which a claim may be brought.  It holds a carrier strictly liable in the approximate amount of $175,000 per passenger in the case of an ""accident."" However, if a plaintiff is seeking an amount in excess of the prescribed (approximately) $175,000, the convention permits the carrier to prove the damage was not due to the negligence of the carrier or was solely due to the negligence of another party.  So, the airlines may be able to legally minimize their loss to only $175,000 per person if they can blame someone or something else. It is widely agreed that American courts will be the best venue for the families, but the convention has strict rules about where the families can file suit.  If these families cannot figure out how to navigate the convention's jurisdictional complexities, they will be stuck litigating against an airline in a courthouse in Kuala Lumpur, when they might have sought justice in a U.S. court. Did you know all that?  If you didn't know it, then do you expect a family from Chongqing, China, should have to research this in the local law library?  Of course not.  They are entitled to legal help, and it's never too soon to get them help. 'Too Soon' doesn't apply to legal representation . If you didn't know even these basics about the convention, how fair is it for a working-class Chinese family to navigate the complexities of the treaty in an American court?  The logic is inescapable: These families should not be required to litigate these complicated issues in court alone. They should have attorneys to help them. And if we agree that they should have lawyers, then they should have them from the outset of the adversarial process.  After all, do you think Boeing and Malaysia Airlines think it's ""too soon"" to consult with their attorneys?  If these corporate juggernauts are entitled to counsel, it stands to reason that a grieving mother of a Chinese Flight 370 passenger with zero legal training is, too. Safeguards of the republic . Lawyers are the ""safeguards of the republic;"" they are the last bastion of defense for the populace against the government and large corporations.  During his extended stay in America, French political historian Alexis de Tocqueville observed that American lawyers would be best positioned to guard against tyranny and protect natural rights in a mass democracy. The families of Flight 370 passengers will receive the services of highly skilled attorneys who will take on the costs of litigating this case against Malaysia Airlines, a risky venture that would consume a good deal of time, resources and effort.  The families will not have to front one dollar, ringgit, or yuan. What other skilled profession provides services, advancing all the costs, and charges no fees unless you have a successful outcome?  Try that with your doctor.  See if he'll operate on your herniated disc with the proviso that you'll only pay if the surgery is a pain-free success.  Even the controversial Affordable Care Act never dreamed of an expansion of patient rights to this degree. Of course, attorneys stand to earn fees from contingent fee cases, but they also acquire all the risk; they lose every penny they invest in a client if the case is unsuccessful.  An attorney who takes on a high-risk contingent fee case invites financial ruin if he or she doesn't prevail. No one expects the families of the missing passengers‚Äîalready undergoing a traumatic experience‚Äîto single-handedly deal with corporations in full damage-control mode.  Even if it's true that the prospective plaintiffs' lawyers in this case stand to profit from this case, Malaysia Airlines and Boeing are trying to save many millions by managing their legal exposures. That the lawyers are described as ""descending"" on the scene shows that we've come a long way from Alexis de Tocqueville's positive view of legal counsel. Certainly, the practice of law has changed significantly since that time.  The robed barristers of centuries past bear little resemblance to lawyers like Jamie Casino, who recently advertised during the Super Bowl.  But whether they are bearing white wigs or flaming sledgehammers, all are officers of the court, and all should try to help the masses who could use legal counsel at times of tragedy.","Danny Cevallos: Families of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 need legal counsel .

"President Barack Obama's aggressive new proposal to dramatically limit carbon pollution is a policy priority that he hopes will help shape his legacy. But a policy step that Obama considers good for the country and his presidency may be bad for certain Democrats in tight election battles this year. Democrats' flight . Some of the toughest fights this campaign season are taking place in red or purple states where jobs and the economy are in a constant tug of war against the environment. They are also the states where Obama's plan to limit carbon emission from power plants will have its greatest impact. Obama's big environmental move: Demanding power plants cut carbon . Obama's proposal aims to reduce carbon pollution by 30% by 2030, but the Chamber of Commerce put out a study last week saying it will cost $50 billion and eliminate nearly 225,000 jobs. Republicans are framing it as a job killer and electricity bill hiker, putting some Democrats in a tough position in an uneven economy. ""As he seeks to secure his legacy, Obama is finally getting his 'war on coal,'"" the Republican National Committee wrote in a statement slamming the proposal. Coal power plants, the greatest polluters, are expected to be the most impacted by the new rules, if they're finalized. Some Democrats from conservative coal-producing states quickly and sharply broke from the President. Kentucky produces the third-most coal in the country but has seen a reduction in coal jobs and production. A high-profile Senate race there has come down to who loves coal more. Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is running to unseat Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, put out a strong statement opposing Obama's move. ""President Obama's new EPA rule is more proof that Washington isn't working for Kentucky,"" Grimes said in a statement. ""When I'm in the U.S. Senate, I will fiercely oppose the President's attack on Kentucky's coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my number one priority."" She is also actively attacking the President, running ads worth ""six figures"" in Kentucky newspapers that say ""President Obama and Washington don't get it."" Her opposition is aggressive but it didn't stop McConnell for connecting Grimes to the President and fellow Democrats. ""Alison Lundergan Grimes was recruited by President Obama, who said he would 'bankrupt' the coal industry, and Harry Reid, who said 'coal makes us sick.' And she is being funded by liberals nationwide who know that a vote for her is a vote to ensure further implementation of their anti-coal agenda in the U.S. Senate,"" McConnell's spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement. In West Virginia, which produces the second most coal, Democratic candidate for Senate Natalie Tennant also opposes the new rules. ""I will stand up to President Obama, (EPA Administrator) Gina McCarthy, and anyone else who tries to undermine our coal jobs,"" Tennant said in a statement. West Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall, who is in a tough race to retain his seat, put out a statement announcing that he is introducing legislation to block Obama's proposal. The new effort could also play out in Louisiana, where Sen. Mary Landrieu, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, is in a tough reelection campaign. Landrieu has been a major defender of fossil fuel-based energy industries as oil, natural gas and some coal are integral to her state's economy. She straddled the issue carefully on Monday by saying that carbon emissions should be reduced but with the input of Congress and not through the Environmental Protection Agency. And giving an olive branch to the powerful energy industry, she also praised it for reducing carbon. She did not praise the President. ""Congress should set the terms, goals and time frame. Greater use of natural gas and stronger efficiency measures adopted by the industry have already helped us reduce carbon emissions to their lowest levels in 20 years,"" Landrieu said. Her Republican opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy slammed Landrieu. His spokesperson, John Cummins, said she has done little to stop regulations that ""tie down Louisiana's energy economy in an effort to promote a radical climate change agenda."" In North Carolina, another red state, Republican Thom Tillis called his opponent, Democratic incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, ""a rubber-stamp for Obama's anti-energy policies."" Hagan said in a statement that she would push for changes in the plan, which will be subject to public comment. ""I'm talking to business leaders and energy experts in North Carolina about what this proposed rule will mean for our state and our economy. I want to make sure that the proposal does enough to recognize the progress we've made reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy,"" she said. In Montana, Democratic Sen. John Walsh's statement underscores the difficulty of this issue in conservative states. He issued no position, instead saying he ""will be listening to Montanans"" to determine if the rule is one they can accept. Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas was also noncommittal. He said he had ""concerns"" but would wait to hear what the people of his state thought. The issue is likely to come up in races in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Alaska as well. All produce coal but also lean conservative and have constituencies that are turned off by greater government regulation. But Bill Burton, a former Obama spokesman, said division among Democrats is expected, especially in campaign season. ""You're going to have instances where Democrats are going to not be perfectly aligned with the President's message, but that doesn't mean the President's policy is not the right one,"" he said. The Republican Party is taking advantage, launching robocalls connecting candidates to Obama's ""radical energy plan"" in Virginia, Louisiana, Colorado and Alaska. Obama's fight . Before his administration announced the planned change, Obama held a conference call with members of the House and Senate in an attempt to shore up support and enthusiasm, indicating that this would be a political landmine for some Democrats in tough races. But addressing the issue of climate change has been at the forefront of his legislative wish list. Up until now, he hasn't done much, hitting a number of roadblocks along the way. Since failing to pass cap and trade legislation to limit carbon emissions through the Democratic-led Senate in 2010, Obama has struggled with Congress. He has been saddled with a struggling economy and several foreign policy crises, effectively putting climate change on the back burner. Inaction of his own initiative has also limited Obama's influence on the issue. He has repeatedly put off a decision to kill or approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which is still unresolved and has upset everyone with a stake or position on the issue. The appointment of John Podesta as the President's counselor earlier this year to revive a struggling White House was also a signal that Obama was going to try again to address environmental pollution. Podesta, who was chief of staff for former President Bill Clinton, has focused on progressive energy and environmental issues, authoring a book in 2008 that is heavy on the issues. These proposed rules on power plants are being billed as the most aggressive effort to combat pollution and climate change in decades, and Burton says this is a legacy issue for Obama. ""Nothing has been done on this scale as it relates to combating climate change and it will absolutely be an important part of the President's legacy,"" he said. (Burton also does work for the environmental group the League of Conservation Voters). Democrats' plight . Democrats who support the proposal will be backed by billionaire Tom Steyer, who has pledged to financially assist nearly a dozen candidates who support climate change proposals. Not among those candidates are Democrats who are opposing Obama's new rule, including Grimes, Landrieu and Pryor. Green billionaire prepares to attack 'anti-science' Republicans . Steyer praised the President's initiative and blamed Congress for not addressing the issue. ""This Congress has failed in its most basic responsibility to protect the health and welfare of the American people from this grave threat,"" he said, indicating his support for candidates who will do more to address the issue in the future. And Burton says Republicans will be the ones to suffer politically for being ""saddled by the notion that climate denial is salable in 2014.""","Obama announces new proposal to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from power plants .

"When Arsalan Kazemi was picked 54th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft, he knew his elevation to the sport's elite competition was about more than progressing his own career. ""I don't do this just for myself and my family,"" the NBA's first Iranian-born player to be drafted declares on his official Twitter page. ""I have the whole country on my back."" And for Kazemi his success is not just about shouldering that weight of expectation. ""I was more excited for my country,"" the 23-year-old told CNN. ""For the kids that play basketball and have a dream to one day make it to the NBA. I want to show them it's possible."" Kazemi fell in love with basketball at age nine while growing up in Esfahan, Iran, playing outside and disturbing his neighbors at all hours of the day. ""He loved it. He played every day,"" says his mother, Roya Kazemi. ""We made him a hoop in our backyard and I bought him his first basketball."" Within three years, he was a rising star on Iran's junior national team ""playing with guys a lot older than me"" and in 2007, when still just 16, his talents caught the eye of a man who would change his life, persuading him to come to the United States where he's now about to start a career in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Kazemi became the first Iranian ever to be drafted by an NBA team in June. ""I worked hard to make it, and now I have to fight even harder,"" said Kazemi, who is a 6-foot-7 power forward with the Philadelphia 76ers. ""It won't be easy. But it's been like that for me since the day I moved here."" His journey began at the 2007 West Asian Games tournament when Kazemi's ferocious rebounding and defensive skills against Syria gained the attention of Texas-based sports broadcaster Anthony Ibrahim. ""His team lost the ball half-court,"" Ibrahim said. ""Arsalan chased the ball opposite floor and out of nowhere you see him come from the left side all the way to the basket to block the shot."" Political tensions . Kazemi grew up watching the NBA commentator every Friday on Alhurra TV, a Washington-based network that broadcast games in Iran. While most scouts saw no reason to take the risk of traveling to the Middle East, Ibrahim often visited the region to bring young, talented athletes back to the States. Ibrahim, a native of Lebanon, wanted to draw attention to countries where college coaches show little interest. ""It was hard to sell,"" he said. ""When I told people about the talent, they would say 'What, a kid from Iran that can play? What are you talking about?'"" Ibrahim used their athletic ability to help secure scholarships at schools across the nation. ""My goal was always to get these kids education through basketball,"" he said. ""But when we saw AK's level of talent...I said wait a minute, he's got a chance to go pro."" Ibrahim took video of Kazemi to a friend, the general manager of the Lebanese national team; they both decided he ""needs to play at a higher level."" He pitched the opportunity to Kazemi's parents, but given the political tensions between the United States and Iran, they worried about how their son would be received. ""To be honest, I didn't want to come,"" Kazemi said. ""I told my family there's no way I'm going there by myself. All my friends were in Iran, I didn't know where I was going or what my life would be like."" His faith in Ibrahim along with the opportunity to study and play basketball persuaded Kazemi to agree. Securing a student visa was the next challenge. The U.S. hasn't had an embassy in Iran since the hostage crisis more than 30 years ago. It took six months before Kazemi landed in the U.S. in February 2008. At the time, he didn't speak English and he was held at the airport for seven hours of questioning by immigration officers. ""They kept asking me 'What are you doing here? Are you a terrorist?' And if I was here to harm the country."" Kazemi enrolled at The Patterson prep school in North Carolina, easing his homesickness by talking to his mother every day. ""It was really hard on me, I knew just enough English to get by in school,"" he said. ""I was so homesick I carried my laptop everywhere to talk with my mom. I was nicknamed the 'laptop guy.' ""It was so bad, he would be on Skype in the car, in the mall, in the gym,"" Ibrahim added. ""At one point we said 'OK that's enough put the laptop down tell Mom nice talkin' to ya. You're going to be OK'."" He was missing home, but Kazemi was taking the basketball court by storm and college coaches were noticing. Upon graduating from Patterson, Kazemi was heavily recruited by college teams and offered scholarships across the nation. He chose the academically prestigious Rice University in Houston, which has a large Iranian community and is where Ibrahim lived. During his three years there, he led his Conference in rebounding and ranked among the top three rebounders nationwide. He says he also came face to face with the type of situation that had concerned him before he left Iran. After his junior year, he asked for and received a National Collegiate Athletic Association hardship waiver to transfer to Oregon where he competed in his senior year. According to Sports Illustrated, the hardship had to do with derogatory comments allegedly made by the Rice athletic director based on ethnicity and religion. Kazemi is Muslim. ""He made some comments that made me uncomfortable,"" said Kazemi, who declined to specify what the comments were. ""I was approaching an important year and I wanted to focus on basketball without worrying about what he was saying."" The athletic director, Rick Greenspan, who has since left Rice himself, denied any allegations of discriminatory treatment during Kazemi's time at Rice. With the Ducks, Kazemi got lots of playtime and instantly became a fan favorite. ""If you're an athlete in Oregon they treat you like a celebrity,"" Kazemi said. ""I got to experience having a home crowd. It's an amazing feeling when you hear 12,000 people chanting your name."" Fans were intrigued by his superstar ability on the court, but also his facial hair. At games, students would wear fake handlebar mustaches to support their favorite player. Kazemi led the Ducks, who were seeded No. 12, to their first NCAA tournament since 2008.  He averaged 9.4 points, 10 rebounds, 2.0 steals and 1.4 assists and he was named an all-Pac-12 honorable mention. The Ducks had a deep run in the tournament, but lost the Sweet Sixteen game to the No. 1 overall seed and eventual champion Louisville . In that game, Kazemi dropped a double-double, scoring 11 points and grabbing a dozen rebounds -- a performance that put him on the radar of NBA scouts. Two weeks later Kazemi skipped graduation ceremonies to work out with the Atlanta Hawks, one of a dozen NBA teams that invited the power forward to their pre-draft workouts. His mother and sister were granted temporary visas to surprise him on draft night. Kazemi says he was shocked when he became the second round pick of the Washington Wizards, who traded him to Philadelphia in a matter of hours. ""He looked at me and said 'we really did it,'"" Ibrahim said. ""I said no you did it, AK. He got on the court and worked hard for six years. Youngsters in that region are looking up to that boy, he's a great role model.""","Iranian-born Arsalan Kazemi was picked 54th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft .

"(CNN) -- The fate of famed aviator Amelia Earhart remains a mystery after DNA tests on one of three bone fragments discovered on a Pacific island proved inconclusive. Cecil M. Lewis Jr. of the University of Oklahoma's Molecular Anthropology Laboratories reported ""the question of whether the bone is human must remain unanswered"" until new technologies may make a determination possible. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) asked Lewis to test the bones found in 2010 on Nikumaroro, formerly Gardner Island. The bone tested by Lewis may be from Earhart's finger, the group says. Earhart disappeared near the island in 1937 while flying around the world with navigator Fred Noonan. She was later declared dead. ""You learn patience,"" TIGHAR executive director Ric Gillespie said Wednesday night about the findings. ""The door is still open for it to be a human finger bone."" According to Gillespie, a British officer found 13 bones, including a skull, of a likely castaway on the island in 1940 and sent them to Fiji. The officer also reported finding the remains of a woman's shoe and a man's shoe. A doctor in Fiji determined the bones were of a human male, but the remains disappeared. TIGHAR, using notes from the doctor, asked two forensic anthropologists to examine the report on the bones. They concluded they were of a female with northern European origin, Gillespie said. Researchers and the public have long speculated on Earhart's fate. One theory has she and Noonan crash-landing on the island, only to die while awaiting rescue. The three bone fragments were found in the same area as the 13 bones, Gillespie said. The question is whether the bones were from a human or a turtle. But teams have found no evidence of turtle limbs, he said. Lewis, who will discuss his findings Thursday, said in his report posted on TIGHAR's website that two procedures detected possible human mitochondrial DNA, but he was unable to repeat the result. ""We're waiting for new technology to continue sampling without destroying much more bone,"" Gillespie said. Any results would have to be independently verified.

"""Go back to sleep."" Groggy from a night of drinking, that's precisely what James Landrith did. The next morning, Landrith -- who was 19 at the time -- woke up in a bed that he quickly realized was not his own. As his haze lifted, he recognized the woman who ordered him to sleep the night before as a friend of a friend. He remembered she asked for a ride home after their mutual friend left the nightclub where they'd been partying. He remembered the woman was pregnant and bought him drinks as a thank you. He remembered feeling disoriented, and her suggesting a motel room to sleep it off. He even remembered lying down with his pants on, uncomfortable taking them off in front of a stranger, only to awaken later and find the woman straddling him. What he didn't remember was saying ""yes."" The morning after, that familiar voice told him that he could hurt the baby if he put up a fight. Then, he says, she forced herself on him again. A few minutes later it was over. One night in a motel twin bed turned into years of self-examination. It took some time, and the help of a therapist, to get there: ""I was finally able to call it what it was,"" he says. Landrith had been raped. That was 1990. Since then, Landrith -- a former Marine based at Camp Lejeune -- has spoken out on behalf of sexual assault victims, in particular men who were victimized by women. He didn't seek prosecution of his alleged rapist, but he wants other victims to feel free to talk about sexual assault and pursue justice without shame. ""I want people to understand that it's not about how physically strong you are,"" he says. ""We [men] are conditioned to believe that we cannot be victimized in such a way."" According to a 2010 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men in the United States have been raped. The actual number is likely higher, experts say, as incidents of sexual violence are severely underreported in the United States -- particularly among male victims. Experts say any sexual assault victim requires extensive emotional and psychological healing after the incident, but male survivors have a harder time putting words to what happened. In 2012, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report made a significant stride by redefining rape as: ""The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."" The prior definition -- ""the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will"" -- hadn't been changed since 1927, and sexual assault awareness groups say it alienated victims that didn't fit the mold. Veteran confronts rape, suicide: 'I am angry that others are going through this' ""Often, male survivors may be less likely to identify what happened to them as abuse or assault because of the general notion that men always want sex,"" says Jennifer Marsh, the vice president for Victim Services at RAINN, an anti-sexual violence organization. ""Males have the added burden of facing a society that doesn't believe rape can happen to them ... at all,"" says psychotherapist Elizabeth Donovan. She says gender roles dictate that males are expected to be strong and self-reliant -- men are viewed as those who seek sexual conquests instead of those who ""fend them off."" The concept of female-on-male sexual assault has recently gained traction on the Web via the ever-provocative entertainer Chris Brown. Brown recently revealed shocking details to Decca Aitkenhead in the Guardian about his first sexual encounter. ""He lost his virginity when he was 8 years old, to a local girl who was 14 or 15. Seriously? 'Yeah, really. Uh-huh.' He grins and chuckles. 'It's different in the country.' "" Tom Hawking of FlavorWire is one of many writers who took umbrage with this particular anecdote, asking in an article, ""Why Is No One Talking About the Fact That Chris Brown Was Raped?"" Trauma recovery counselor Stephanie Baird says men who experience sexual attention as children, as Brown did, often explain it to themselves as ""I'm a stud, I got laid by ..."" ""They do this in order to feel as if they had some power and say,"" she says. In addition to this macho posturing, there's also the hot-for-teacher or -babysitter complex that is a popular motif in modern American culture. U.N. study in Asia delves into why men rape . ""Because of the culture of 'Mrs. Robinson' it can be much more difficult for a male to even recognize that the action is abusive or without consent,"" Baird says. Consent, she says, means ""being of age, mind, sound body to make an informed decision about whether one would like to become sexually intimate with the other person."" Children cannot consent. The chatter over Brown comes in tandem with recent research published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics that says nearly 1 in 10 youths between 14 and 21 years old have reported perpetrating some type of sexual violence in their lifetime. The study also found that males and females carried out sexual violence at strikingly similar rates after the age of 18 -- 52% of males and 48% of females. The study classified sexual violence into a few categories: foresexual or presexual contact (kissing, touching, etc. against their will), coercive sex, attempted rape, and completed rape. Women were more likely to  instigate unwanted foresexual contact. For male sexual assault victims of any age, convincing others that they've been preyed upon is difficult as well. Experts say the general disparity in physical strength comes into play -- can't a man fight off a woman? ""It's a tough call; people think men can't be raped and they don't understand that in the confusion no still means no,"" says Curtis St. John, a representative for MaleSurvivor, a national support group for male sexual victimization. Further muddying the water is the fact that some men can perform sexually, even including orgasm, and still be raped. In an article in the Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine, Roy J. Levin and Willy Van Berlo found that even in men who have not consented to sex, slight stimulation of the genitals or an increase in stress can create erections ""even though no speciÔ¨Åc sexual stimulation is present."" "" 'Were you aroused?' "" is a question posed to male victims, St. John says. ""You don't hear it with female rape victims. It's an interesting question that men get asked."" Long-term effects of being sexually assaulted can include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse, avoidance of intimacy or the stark opposite -- hyper-sexuality, says St. John. ""Some men feel a need to prove their masculinity by becoming hyper-masculine,"" Donovan says. As for coping, Marsh at RAINN says it's never too late to reach out for help. But with the stigma attached, survivors may not feel comfortable talking to their friends and family because the victims themselves haven't defined their experience as assault. For Landrith, it starts with confronting rape for what it is and sharing experiences. ""Whenever you talk about male survivors, women have it statistically worse, but it's not a competition -- and we each need our time to talk about it,"" he says.","Female-on-male sexual assault is underreported, according to the CDC .
Male victims have a harder time defining what happened to them as assault, experts say .
New study shows nearly 1 in 10 youths (aged 14-21) have perpetrated sexual violence ."
"If Greek island hopping is the dream, then Greek ferry timetables are usually the reality. How many travelers have embarked on an adventure from Athens' Piraeus port planning to explore the Cyclades, Ionian and Dodecanese archipelagos, only to realize they've just got time to grab a Greek salad in Santorini before catching the boat home? And that's if seasonal winds aren't blowing the ferries off schedule. All this could change over the next two years if a Greek aviation company's vision of creating a new, affordable seaplane network comes to pass. Hellenic Seaplanes says it wants to connect more than 100 locations throughout Greece by 2016, with the first routes due to be operational in May 2015. Headquartered in Athens, the company was established in May 2013. The company says tickets for its seaplanes are likely to be affordable, making them a viable and much faster alternative to the ferry. Because its fleet -- currently comprised of 12-seater Dornier Seastar and 19-seat Twin Otter amphibious aircraft -- can land on water, the service will be able to serve smaller islands currently unconnected by air, without the need for costly infrastructure. This prospect is, of course, still in the planning stages and initial launch dates have already been pushed back from this year. Given Greece's economic turbulence of recent years, rapid business expansion isn't plain sailing -- or flying. That shouldn't stop anyone from planning their ultimate island-hopping adventure from Hellenic's list of planned destinations, connecting far-flung destinations from the northern Aegean to the Libyan Sea on a trip that would need a month to explore by boat. Here's some affordable, jet-setting suggestions. Crete . No introductions needed for the biggest, much-loved Greek island. Œôf Crete was a resort, its northern forefront would be the buzzing reception while the south would be the VIP lounge, open only to those willing to experience its authentic heart. The Hellenic Seaplanes network is expected to make the harder-to-reach south more accessible, connecting places such as Sitia, Ierapetra and Sfakia with the hotspots of Chania, Heraklion and Agios Nikolaos. Southern discoveries include hidden villages facing the Libyan Sea, such as Lentas and Loutro. Then there's historic Sfakia and Frangokastello castle, lesser-known archeological sites like the Minoan Palace of Zakros, the stunning gorges of Orino and Kato Zakros, secluded islands just off the coast like Chrisi and remarkable monasteries like Preveli and Chryssoskalitissa. Affordable luxury: The five-star St. Nicolas Bay Resort Hotel & Villas is located on a private beachfront just 1.5 kilometers from Agios Nikolaos, overlooking the enchanting Mirabello Bay. Thessi Nissi Aghios Nikolaos, Crete; +30 28410 90200 . Pelion . For those torn between mountain or sea vacations there's Pelion. Forming a peninsula in central Greece between the Pagasetic Gulf and the Aegean Sea, Pelion mountain is already a favorite among the locals year-round and in ancient times was the summer home of the Twelve Gods of Olympus and stomping ground of mythical Centaurs. Mountain and coastal villages feature traditional architecture and charming squares bustling with flowers -- hortensia seems to be the queen here. There are well marked trails in the forest for hikes that can also turn into mushroom, herb or wild strawberry hunts that end with a dive into the sea. Sandy and pebbly beaches lead into clear waters overlooked by discreet beach bars or traditional seaside taverns serving delicious local food. Affordable luxury: Volos, the coastal port city serving as the main gateway to Pelion is home to the team of the Greek startup Incrediblue. Characterized as an ""Airbnb for boats,"" it offers sailboats, catamaran or private yacht charter for sailing experiences. Oktovriou 219, Volos; +30 2421 076182 . Skyros . Skyros is expected to be one of the first of the Sporades chain of islands to welcome seaplanes, with a waterway on its way to being constructed at Linaria Port. It's an island with a split personality. Northern Skyros features the greenery typical of the Sporades to its north. On the other side of the island is the typical wilderness of the Cyclades islands to the south. Here, it's all about tranquility, tradition and scenery -- many who visit come back. Chora, the island's capital, features traditional white houses on a slope that leads to a Byzantine castle. To the north there's almost-private beaches such as Atsitsa, Pefkos and Agios Fokas, while boat trips around the hard-to-access south take in stalactite-filled sea caves and the little island of Sarakiniko, set in transparent, azure sea waters. One of its most recognizable residents is the Skyrian horse, the small-bodied Greek species and one of the most rare horse breeds worldwide, which is nowadays protected. Affordable luxury: The accommodation list is modest on Skyros, however posh villas can be picked up for relatively good prices on sites such as Greek Luxury Villas and Five Star Greece. Otherwise, Ammos Hotel is a great alternative, offering stylish accommodation with wonderful sea views, located a stone's throw from the sandy beach of Magazia. Magazia, Skyros; +30 22220 91 234 . Kavala . Built like an amphitheater on the slopes of Mount Symvolo, Kavala is one of northern Greece's most vibrant, coastal cities. The city serves as a perfect base for vacations all year round but is at it's best in summer. Mornings can be spent diving into aquamarine waters from beaches such as Ammolofoi (meaning sand dunes), Batis and Toska. Evenings are for walking around quaint alleyways and the castle of the Old Town, restored tobacco warehouses and the neoclassical mansions of the modern town or among the port's fish taverns and lively coffee bars. It's a spot for mingling with locals and combining leisure time by the sea with the discovery of traditional villages, hiking trails and wineries of nearby Paggaio mountain. Nearby, the pristine island of Thasos, a rough diamond of the northern Aegean, is worth a visit, although you'll have forsake planes for a 90-minute boat ride. Affordable luxury: Imaret, an impeccably restored historical monument in Kavala, offers unique and indulgent accommodation. Its restaurant is impressive, serving regional and Mediterranean cuisine mixed with a panoramic view of the city. Th. Poulidou 30-32, Kavala; +30 2510 620151 . Lefkas . This Ionian sea island, connected to mainland Greece via a floating pontoon, has a versatile character, combining elements of the mountainous mainland with some of the most spectacular turquoise waters in the entire country . The main town of Lefkas features modern marinas and colorful two-floor houses while the gently sloping east coast is already developed for tourism. Things get more exciting further out. Vasiliki port to the south is great for wind-surfing, while the wilder west coast is fringed by emerald waters and out-of-this-world beaches such as Egkremnoi, Kathisma or Porto Katsiki. It's not easy to leave these places but those that make the effort will find, among the scattered olive, pine and cypress trees, soulful inland mountain villages such as Exanthia, Karya and Englouvi. The island also hosts the International Folklore Festival, a celebration of art, dance and music held here each August. The online Lefkada Slow Guide is a great resource for planning a visit. Affordable luxury: Pavezzo Country Retreat is a group of renovated houses that share a pool, stunning gardens and verandas in Katouna village. Two independent villas, Myrtia or Honeymoon, have private pools and secluded atmosphere. Katouna, Lefkas; +30 26450 71782 .","Hellenic Seaplanes plans to connect 100 Greek destinations by 2016 .

"Your forecast for the next century: Hotter, drier and hungrier, and the chance to turn down the thermostat is slipping away. That's the latest conclusion from the United Nations, which urged governments to address the ""increasingly clear"" threats posed by a warming climate before some options are closed off for good. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that taking steps to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions blamed for rising temperatures could buy more time to adjust to a warmer world. Cutting emissions now ""increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change,"" the report states. But it adds, ""Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future."" ""In many cases, we are not prepared for the climate-related risks that we already face,"" Vicente Barros, the co-chaiman of the IPCC working group behind the document, said in a statement accompanying the report. ""Investments in better preparation can pay dividends both for the present and for the future."" The summary for policymakers was released Monday morning in Yokohama, Japan. It's the second part of the IPCC's benchmark assessment of climate change, a document released every six years with the input of nearly 1,000 scientists. Without checks on emissions, the impacts of climate change will be more severe, more likely, and possibly irreversible, it concludes. Monday's report underscores ""that we have committed to a certain amount of warming,"" said Kelly Levin, an energy and climate expert at the U.S.-based World Resources Institute. ""Over the next few decades, we are going to lock ourselves into a climate change commitment that is going to paint a very different world, depending on what we choose today,"" Levin said. ""The choices we make today are going to affect the risks we face through the rest of the century."" As a result, ""Adaptation is emerging as central area in climate change research,"" Levin said. But adaptation -- steps such as building sea walls, conserving water and designing cities for warmer climates -- has its limits, she said. ""The report suggests some options are going to be too resource-intensive or too expensive,"" she said. An increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other emissions have driven average temperatures up by about 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) since 1950, the IPCC says. The first part of its report, released in September, concluded that even a best-case scenario would result in an increase in global average temperatures of 1.6 C; the worst-case scenario estimates a rise of 3.7 degrees Celsius (6.6 Fahrenheit). The idea that carbon emissions are changing the Earth's climate is politically controversial, but generally accepted as fact by the overwhelming majority of scientists. And as emissions continue to rise, driving up CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, the impacts will be more severe, more likely and possibly irreversible, Monday's report states. The summary of the full document -- which is more than 1,000 pages -- will be the premiere guide for lawmakers. It breaks down the expected impacts by continent and by categories such as marine life, agriculture and flood risks. And by diving into the specifics of the report, policymakers will be able to see what risks their specific locations face, as well as what adaptation and mitigation techniques could prove fruitful. ""The real highlight is how many impacts there are, how widespread they are and how pervasive they are around the world,"" said Heather McGray, who studies adaptation at WRI. In most cases, climate change will exacerbate existing problems, such as the availability of fresh water in sub-Saharan Africa. The authors conclude that glaciers will continue to shrink ""almost worldwide,"" affecting water supplies downstream. Animals have begun shifting their habitats in response to a warming world, and key crops have been affected already, they wrote. Colder climates may see increases in crop yields from longer growing seasons and milder temperatures, but the negative effects are expected to outweigh the positive, the report states. ""In this report, the finding is the impacts of climate change are already widespread and consequential,"" McGray said. The impacts won't be the same for everyone, and as usual, the world's poor are more likely to be hurt. ""Climate-related hazards affect poor people's lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields or destruction of homes and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices and food insecurity,"" the report states. Positive effects on the impoverished ""are limited and often indirect."" For those people, the effects ""will be catastrophic"" unless emissions can be reduced, McGray said. Carbon dioxide benchmark hits new heights, worries scientists . Opinion: Is it time for international agreements to recognize national laws?","Time's running out to rein in climate change, U.N. panel concludes .
""A certain amount of warming"" is locked in, expert says .
Without checks on emissions, the impacts may be irreversible, report states .
Losses outweigh gains for farmers and the poor, it concludes ."
"The Republican-led House approved a resolution on Wednesday authorizing Speaker John Boehner to sue President Barack Obama over claims he abused his powers at the expense of Congress and the Constitution. The vote was 225-201. Republicans argue Obama's executive orders in a number of areas were unlawful because it's the job of Congress to make or change laws. But they believe his handling of the Affordable Care act gives them the best chance at proving their case, and are basing the suit on that issue. House authorization now allows GOP-leaders to have the unusual challenge filed in federal court. The time frame for that is not clear and many legal experts question whether any judge would take it on. Not a single House Democrat voted for the resolution and five Republicans opposed it. They were: GOP members Paul Broun of Georgia, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Steve Stockman of Texas, and Walter Jones of North Carolina. The vote takes partisan rancor in Washington to a new level less than four months before congressional midterms with control of the Senate at stake. The focus on Obamacare also magnifies politics around the sweeping health law Republicans didn't support and have tried to derail since its approval in 2010. It also illustrates Obama's attempts to act on his own with he and Congress getting nowhere on  top-shelf legislative initiatives. Dems claim impeachment coming . Democrats quickly seized to turn the debate on the lawsuit, saying prior to the vote that the real desire of the GOP is to ultimately impeach Obama. Boehner, who has repeatedly said he disagrees with those pushing impeachment, attempted to shut down that discussion this week. Insisting that Republicans have ""no plans"" and ""no future plans"" to impeach Obama, Boehner denounced the talk of it as ""a scam started by Democrats at the White House."" But Democrats seized on polls showing a majority of Americans oppose any effort to remove the President from office, and aren't letting go of the issue. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the lawsuit was ""on a path to nowhere or maybe among some in your ranks, a path to impeachment."" Apparently not satisfied with Boehner's assurance, Pelosi directed this at him: ""If you don't want to hear people use the word impeachment, as your people have done, then tell them impeachment is off the table."" CNN poll on suit, impeachment . Obama tweaks GOP on impeachment . Obama, himself, tweaked Republicans on Wednesday. In Kansas City, Missouri, he noted the House was about to leave Washington for the month of August, but ""the main vote that they have scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job."" During debate, Democrats lined up on their side of the chamber and one after the other requested that GOP leaders allow votes on measures to raise the minimum wage, extend jobless benefits, and ensure pay equity. They knew Republicans wouldn't hold off on the lawsuit to take any of those issues up, but the the theater was designed to underscore their argument that the majority party was focused on the lawsuit rather than legislating. The campaign arm for House Democrats arm has raised $7.6 million from appeals to supporters citing the suit and tied it to the threat of impeachment. Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,  defended the aggressive public push and pledged Democrats would continue it through the midterm election in November. ""You bet we're going to run on a Congress that is just obsessed with lawsuits, suing the President, talking about impeaching him, instead of solutions for the middle class,"" Israel told CNN. Americans don't like suit, impeachment . A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed those Americans surveyed, by a 57%-41% margin, opposed the lawsuit. Nearly two-thirds said Obama should not be impeached. Texas Republican Pete Sessions responded to Democratic refrains that the resolution was the first step toward impeachment. He said the House voted in 1998 to impeach Bill Clinton because ""he lied to an FBI agent, he lied to a federal grand jury, and he violated the federal law which was a felony."" But in Obama's case, Republicans believe he isn't ""faithfully executing the laws,"" which he has sworn to do, and ""that is an entirely different process."" Oregon Republican Greg Walden, chairman of the House Republican's political operation, said ""impeachment is not on table."" And he issued a warning to fellow Republicans at a meeting, saying that any time the GOP raised the issue it only helped Democrats. The Obamacare focus . When Boehner announced last month that he would sue Obama, he followed a course many tea party members and conservatives had urged for months. They were especially angered by actions Obama took without consulting Congress to change or delay key Obamacare provisions, to allow children of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, and to release Taliban prisoners from U.S. custody in exchange for Afghan war prisoner Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Initially, Boehner indicated the House would sue over Obama's decision last summer to delay for a year a central health law requirement for businesses provide health coverage to their employees. The House voted to do the same thing last July, but Republicans argued they did so to protect the integrity of Congress in the face of what they believed was executive overreach. After consulting legal experts, the House resolution was tweaked to give Boehner more flexibility. It specified that the suit can cite the administration's implementation of any provision of Obamacare. The House's Office of General Counsel will represent the House in court and the resolution gives it the authority to hire outside lawyers to finalize the legal strategy and file a formal complaint. Many constitutional experts have raised doubts that the courts will take up the case. The legal burden will be on the House to present how it was damaged as an institution by the President's actions.

"(CNN) -- Thirty-one nations fully ban corporal punishment. Sweden, in 1979, was the first to make it illegal to strike a child as a form of discipline. Since then, many other countries in Europe have also instituted bans, as have New Zealand and some countries in Africa and the Americas. More than 70 additional nations have specific laws in place that prohibit corporal punishment in schools. You can sort through the table above to see where different countries stand on the issue. In some cases, such as the United States, there are partial bans in place depending on either location or the age of the children. For the U.S., corporal punishment is prohibited in public schools for 31 states and the District of Columbia. Two states, Iowa and New Jersey, extend their bans to private schools as well.

"On Monday night at the CNN/Tea Party Republican Debate in Tampa, Florida, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas suggested that he couldn't be bought for a campaign contribution of $5,000. That raises the question: Is there a price at which Perry's loyalty is for sale? During the debate, House Tea Party Caucus founder and fellow presidential hopeful Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, alleged that campaign cash and connections to a major drug company played a pivotal role in Perry's executive order in February 2007 that mandated teenaged girls in Texas be inoculated against HPV, a virus that can cause cervical cancer. (The order was overturned by the legislature two months later and did not go into effect.) ""The company was Merck, and it was a $5,000 contribution that I had received from them,"" Perry responded. ""I raise about $30 million. And if you're saying that I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended."" But Merck's ties to Perry run much deeper than one $5,000 check. Merck has given $28,500 to Perry's gubernatorial campaigns since January 2001, according to a new report by Texans for Public Justice, a political watchdog group, which uses data from the Center for Responsive Politics. And since January 2006, Merck has given an additional $377,500 to the Republican Governors Association, which, in turn, was one of the largest backers of Perry's own campaigns. Notably, Perry also served as the chairman of the governors association in 2008 and again this year, until last month, when Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell succeeded him, so that Perry could pursue his presidential run. Did Bachmann's drug lobbyist claims ring true? Perhaps more importantly, Perry's friend,  former chief of staff Mike Toomey, spun through the revolving door to become a lobbyist for Merck in Texas, a position he held at the time of the HPV-related executive order. Merck was the first company to offer an FDA-approved HPV vaccine, which it offers under the brand name Gardasil. In 2009, the FDA also approved the drug Cervarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline, which, for its part, has given about the same amount of money as Merck to Perry's gubernatorial campaigns since 2001 and nearly four times as much as Merck to the Republican Governors Association since 2006. In fact, three other pharmaceutical companies have given more money to Perry than Merck and substantially more money to the Republican Governors Association than Merck. The absence of attention-grabbing headlines does not signify that these companies expect nothing in exchange for their investments. To the contrary, it is their fiduciary obligation to return a profit to their shareholders. Bankrolling politicians -- Republican and Democrat -- is just another tool to help them meet their goals and, in so doing, bolster their profits. If anything, money spent on political donations and lobbying holds more sway when it is unexamined. Perry's ties to Merck have made it into the sunlight, and people are now considering his actions in light of their past ties. Is this an example of ""crony capitalism?"" That's not for the Center for Responsive Politics to decide. It's the public's job to decide if the money outweighed the merits in this policy decision, but it needs to have all of the facts in hand to do so. Furthermore, Perry's actions benefiting donors from the pharmaceutical industry don't appear to stop with Merck. For instance, drug-maker Novartis Pharmaceuticals has also contributed handsomely to the Republican Governors Association and it has also benefited from Perry's support. Novartis has donated $700,000 to the RGA since January 2006, although it has only directly donated $5,000 to Perry's own campaign. In 2009, Perry signed a bill into law mandating meningitis vaccines for all college students, a requirement he expanded again earlier this year. Novartis was not the only pharmaceutical company to benefit from the new requirement, but its Manveo vaccine, introduced less than a year later, fit the bill. As for Toomey, his involvement with Perry doesn't end with the HPV vaccine. Earlier this summer, lobbyist Toomey co-founded a super PAC known as Make Us Great Again to aid Perry's presidential run. According to NBC News, Toomey's super PAC plans to spend a staggering $55 million to help his man win the GOP nomination. If Make Us Great Again does spend more tens of millions to help Perry secure the Republican presidential nomination, what might Toomey and his clients be owed in return? What might the donors to Make Us Great Again be expecting a President Perry to deliver?","Sheila Krumholz, Michael Beckel say Rick Perry took heat over HPV vaccine position .

"Bossangoa, Central African Republic (CNN) -- Months after a coup escalated chaos and violence in the Central African Republic, a French military operation has begun in the capital, Bangui, France's defense minister said Friday. The French deployment, along with that of African forces, was unanimously approved Thursday by the U.N. Security Council. The council also voted to impose an arms embargo on the Central African Republic, which is east of Cameroon and north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Security Council resolution, put forward by France, authorizes an African Union-led peacekeeping force to intervene with the support of French forces to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. The start of the French soldiers' new operation in Bangui was announced Friday morning by Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on the French radio station RFI. The French troops currently in the country were deployed to protect French nationals and help secure the airport that serves the capital. But now they are carrying out patrols in Bangui, Le Drian said. ""The operation has begun,"" he said. France has pledged to send in hundreds more soldiers. An African Union force is already in the nation, but rights group say it's not enough to halt the escalating violence. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said Friday that the British military will help fly French military equipment to the Central African Republic. The first of three flights planned this month is due to arrive ""shortly,"" he said in a statement. Deepening violence . Hours before the U.N. meeting Thursday, heavy gunfire erupted near the presidential palace in Bangui, witnesses said. After two days of clashes in the capital, the number of corpses delivered to a hospital morgue in the city rose Friday afternoon to 92, according to Doctors without Borders. The agency, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, told CNN that 170 people had been treated for injuries. Scores were badly hurt -- most with gunshot, machete or knife wounds. A few shots were fired around dawn, but the situation in the capital is now relatively calm, spokesman Samuel Henryon said. Bangui airport was closed for a second day Friday amid the continuing tensions. Violence has raged in the country since a coalition of rebels deposed President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. Bozize fled the country after his ouster. Christian vigilante groups have formed to battle Seleka, the predominantly Muslim coalition behind the president's removal. Multiple sources told CNN that the military commander of Seleka, Gen. Issa Yahya, was killed Thursday in Bangui. His second-in-command, Col. Saleh Zabari, is now thought to be in charge. Christians, Muslims take refuge . Left uncontrolled, militia groups are uniting along religious lines, leading to fears of sectarian violence. The situation in Bossangoa, a town about 185 miles north of Bangui that is at the epicenter of displacement resulting from the violence, remained very tense Friday. About 35,000 Christians have taken refuge in a Catholic church compound there. Members of Seleka have launched grenades at the compound to try to flush out elements of a rival Christian militia, the anti-Balaka. Meanwhile, the anti-Balaka are threatening the town's Muslim neighborhood. The anti-Balaka began targeting Muslims after tens of thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes as Seleka militias marauded through the countryside, in a spiraling cycle of reprisal attacks. The headquarters of the small regional peacekeeping mission told CNN on Thursday that the second-in-command of Seleka had given the militia permission to attack the compound. The mission sent reinforcements in defensive positions around the church to protect civilians. Speaking to CNN before reports of the death of Seleka's commander emerged, Zabari said that it was believed there were armed elements in the compound but that unless those inside moved against them, they wouldn't attack it. A CNN team in the vicinity was forced to flee a U.N. compound in Bossangoa for one protected by the African-led force after the U.N. site came under fire. More than 100,000 more people are believed to be hiding in the bush around Bossangoa, fearing for their safety. Central African Republic: What's going on, what's at stake, what's next . Hundreds of thousands displaced . Speaking after the U.N. vote, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said the U.S. government was ""deeply disturbed"" by ongoing reports of brutality in the nation. ""It is clear that urgent action is needed to save lives,"" she said, adding that the crisis has affected nearly half the country's population. Power said the sectarian tension that has made the tens of thousands of Christians seek refuge in the church compound in Bossangoa, while their Muslim neighbors shelter in a mosque nearby, was a tragic result of the coup. ""Extremists on both sides, in an environment of lawlessness and an environment of state failure, have taken advantage of that vacuum and stoked animosities,"" she said. A representative of the Central African Republic told the Security Council the vote would ""give reasons to hope for a new dawn"" for the country's embattled population. An unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas too risky to access. United Nations officials have warned that the violence between the Christian majority and Muslim minority now in power could lead to genocide. More than 400,000 people -- nearly 10% of the population -- have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. ""They are hiding in the bush without shelter, food, or drinking water, exposed to the weather and mosquitoes that carry malaria, the leading cause of death in the country,"" Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. The group has operated in the country for years and is helping dispatch mobile units to take care of the wounded. Opinion: Why Central African Republic is slipping close to catastrophe .

"Armed with her mobile phone, Temiloluwa Akinremi embarks on her daily online routine, scouring the internet to keep up-to-date with what's happening in her city of Lagos, Nigeria. But these days, along with her daily dose of news and e-mail, Akinremi's web expedition also involves one of her favorite pastimes: shopping. ""I go online every day,"" says Akinremi, a 26-year-old store manager, ""to check for something, to just see if I can get whatever I want to buy. Online shopping saves you time and money because it is cheaper and fast,"" she adds. Akinremi is among a growing generation of young, internet-savvy Africans who have embraced new technology, driving efforts in the continent to bridge the gap between the virtual and real worlds. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), internet-user penetration in sub-Saharan Africa has grown from 0.5% in 2000 to 10.6% last year. Although the figure is still far behind the world average of about 30%, an increasing number of Africans are becoming more familiar with online shopping. Both the proliferation of mobile phones and the rollout of faster internet networks -- like the fiber-optic cables launched in areas such as east Africa -- have helped the expansion of e-commerce activities in countries such as Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. In South Africa, 51% of those with access to the internet are shopping online, according to a 2011 MasterCard Worldwide survey. In Kenya, a recent survey by TNS Research International and the Kenya ICT Board found that 18% and 24% of the 1,700 respondents go online to purchase music and movies, and electronic books. In Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, internet penetration is at about 28%,according to ITU figures, boosted by the rapid growth in the country's telecoms sector. In recent years, the number of mobile cellular subscriptions has skyrocketed from 30,000 in 2000 to over 87 million in 2010. Nigeria's untapped mobile market . Yet, the country's online buying culture is still in its infancy. ""While internet usage has hugely increased in Nigeria over the past few years, the online shopping market is still quite small by world standards,"" says Loy Okezie, founder of Techloy.com, a Lagos-based technology news and research startup. ""One would expect the Nigerian online shopping market to be huge and highly lucrative -- instead, the market is still at an infant stage, although with huge potential to explode in the next five years,"" he adds. It is this big potential that has prompted the emergence of a new crop of internet developers in the country, eager to tap the money-making opportunities available online. One of them is Sim Shagaya, a Nigerian technology entrepreneur who has founded DealDey, a Groupon style group-buying site that offers its members in Lagos discounted deals on a range of products and services. Every day DealDey sends an email to customers like Akinremi with all the latest discounts such as restaurant and spa offers. If the required amount of customers is reached, members receive a coupon along with details about their purchase's collection. Shagaya, who has also worked for Google and RealNetworks, says the model has struck a chord with customers looking to make the most out of the benefits of online shopping -- DealDey plans to expand to  Abuja, Nigeria's capital, and claims to have over 50,000 members since its launch in March, adding about 1,000 people per day, Shagaya says. Yet, promoting e-commerce in a country with high internet costs, slow connectivity and a bad reputation for online scams does not come without its challenges. Shagaya says that building a strong logistics infrastructure is necessary for the growth of e-commerce in developing countries. For that reason DealDey has invested in in-house systems as well as pick-up points where customers can collect their items. ""If you start an internet business in Nigeria, it's not about a web browser or a mobile phone browser,"" he says. ""Many times the internet is an enabler of a business but you still need an offline component, strong logistics, you still need to be able to have a physical presence in front of the developing country customer to keep that customer thinking that you are real and are here for the long-run."" Analysts say that a major problem confronting users in the country is the lack of a convenient and reliable electronic payment service that enables consumers to make payment for goods bought online -- the penetration of debit and credit cards is still low and in many cases online shoppers are still required to physically go to the bank and make a deposit to confirm their purchase. Okezie notes that Nigerian consumers with reliable internet access are still skeptical about shopping online, since there's a feeling that such transactions are risky and prone to fraud. ""Consumers hardly want to make payments for goods via an online platform, especially since they wouldn't like to give out their personal details on the internet for fear of identity theft and other related issues,"" he says. ""Most people still prefer to visit their favorite retail shops and make their purchases, where payments are usually made with cash,"" adds Okezie. Samuel Abdulazeez, head of Nigerian operations for Kalahari, a South Africa-based online retailer that expanded last year in Nigeria and Kenya, says that shifting consumer behavior toward e-commerce and building trust is a gradual process. ""The experience has been that when people come in, they try to test with a little amount of order and then when we deliver to them they consider to buy and increase their amount,"" says Abdulazeez. ""That shows us that a lot of people have that fear."" Yet, despite all the challenges, analysts believe Nigeria's e-commerce sector has the potential to take off within the next few years as the market continues to develop at a fast pace. ""I think that Nigerians would eventually embrace online shopping as long as it offers them an easy, safe and convenient way to shop online,"" says Okezie. And for some young shoppers like Akinremi, e-commerce is here to stay. ""Online shopping has already become a success story in Nigeria, especially amongst the youth of today,"" she says.","A new crop of entrepreneurs are keen to tap the potential of Africa's online market .
Logistics, high internet costs and consumer fears over scams are some of the challenges .
Nigeria has one of the highest percentages of internet users in Africa ."
"(CNN) -- Luxury enthusiasts, rejoice: Louis Vuitton is bringing its upscale sensibilities to the art world. Fondation Louis Vuitton, the philanthropic wing of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, is opening a 41,441-square-foot art museum in Paris to share its cultural values with the general public. Designed by starchitect Frank Gehry for more than $130 million, the building will act as a home for the company's public and private art collections, as well as a showcase for temporary exhibitions and performances by contemporary artists. In the months following its official public opening on October 27, the museum's programming will include commissions inspired by the building's architecture and retrospective concerts by German electronic band Kraftwerk. Giving back, Louis Vuitton style . According to LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault -- whose $30 billion fortune makes him France's richest man -- the Fondation Louis Vuitton is a way for the company to give back to the city. ""(It's) showing that we are very good (citizens) and that we are working not only for profit, but also for something that is transcendent,"" he told CNN at the building's inauguration. To sweeten the deal, LVMH will give the museum and its contents to the city of Paris in 55 years. Louis Vuitton is part of a growing legion of fashion houses lending their names and funds to artistic causes. In 2008, Italian luxury brand Furla started a foundation to support young Italian artists, and Fondazione Prada has co-produced art works and organized contemporary exhibitions since the nineties. A number of brands, including LVMH-owned Fendi, have also volunteered to finance the restoration of various Roman monuments like modern-day Medici. Working with a starchitect . The building itself is as much of a cultural contribution as the art it contains. Gehry, one of the world's most well-known architects, is famous for designing unconventional cultural centers that draw as much interest as the happenings inside, like his Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain and Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Already referred to as the ""glass bird"" and ""the iceberg"" by the public, Gehry's Fondation Louis Vuitton was inspired by classic Parisian glass architecture like the Grand Palais. It is meant to evoke ships and a sense of movement, like wind pushing through sails. Because of its glass covering, the building changes character throughout the day as the light comes and goes. The hard sell . But like other non-traditional buildings in Paris -- from the Eiffel Tower in 1889 to I.M. Pei's glass Louvre Pyramid 100 years later -- Gehry's building has received a certain amount of back-lash. ""France is a country where, as you know, we have a lot of manifestations, of protests. Each time you do something, people are against,"" Arnault said. ""Even for this fantastic building we had to go through a lot of protests before being able to finish it."" However, the Fondation is hopeful that their museum will ascend to landmark status like the controversial buildings that preceded it. At this point, it seems more than possible.

"It used to be that an event had to be truly momentous to warrant a new holiday -- be it the birth of a prophet or a hard-won battle for statehood. But these days all that's needed to craft a commemorative day is good dose of ingenuity and a marketing plan. In case you missed it, last week we had Take Your Houseplant for a Walk Day and next week (August 7) we can all look forward to National Underwear Day and Particularly Preposterous Packaging Day. Indeed, one man alone is probably responsible for most of the world's more ridiculous holidays. American Thomas Roy has invented -- and copyrighted -- over 90 holidays in the last 26 years, including No Socks Day (May 8) and Married to a Scorpio Support Day (November 18). But when he first started brainstorming silly things to celebrate, he had no idea that some of his inventions would one day make it onto calendars and diaries. He certainly didn't imagine that anyone would observe them. ""I just started doing it on a lark,"" admits Roy, who used to flip through Chase's Calendar of Events -- an annual reference guide to holidays around the world -- to get ideas for the morning radio show he hosted out of Lebanon, Pennsylvania. One year, he noticed a form in the back of the book inviting readers to submit their own holidays. ""I was like, 'oh no, don't tell me this is possible,'"" he recalls. For fun, he crafted Northern Hemisphere Hoodie-Hoo Day -- Roy's answer to curing cabin fever. On February 20, observers are meant to hit the streets at noon and shout, ""hoodie hoo"". To his surprise, the holiday was printed in the next edition. It wasn't long before various media got a hold of it and started promoting the day as a fun, off-the-wall thing to do. Shortly afterward, the letters started coming in. Roy received invitations to Hoodie-Hoo Day celebrations. Occasionally, corporations pay him to use some of his creations. A few years ago, Entenmann's Bakery used his Eat What You Want Day in one of their ad campaigns. ""It was kind of scary,"" he says. ""This is how politicians get into office with these nonsensical ideas, and people buy into it."" In 1985, Australian Elaine Fremont wanted an excuse to have a monthly party. She invented Bonza Bottler Day, which she celebrated on any day that matched the month (i.e, January 1, February 2 ... ). Though Fremont passed away in 1995, her sister, Gail, carried on the tradition, and the holiday has achieved a cult status in Australia. Official holidays don't always follow logic, either. Japan has a law that states that when two holidays fall with a day between them, the middle day becomes a de facto holiday. According to Kylie Clark, a spokesperson for the Japan National Tourism Organization, it's recognized that some holidays are mainly an excuse for the populace to take time off. ""Japanese people tend to be hesitant to use their annual leave,"" she admits. Read more: The world's messiest festivals . In recent years, bolstering awareness has been another popular reason to craft a celebration. Though special interest groups often spearhead these initiatives, sometimes a day is granted importance just because a particularly enthusiastic individual thinks it should be. Keith Milsom could be one of the most dedicated lefties in the world. He runs an online shop -- founded as a brick-and-mortar storefront in Central London by his left-handed father in 1967 -- called Anything Left-Handed. Though hard to prove, he strongly suspects Simpsons creator Matt Groening -- himself a leftie -- used the store as his basis for Ned Flanders' shop, The Leftorium. Several years ago, Milsom founded The Left-Handers Club, and shortly started receiving queries about starting a holiday to support left-handed people. He launched International Left-Handers' Day on August 13, 1992. The date was picked to coincide with a slow news cycle so that it would have a better shot at garnering some media attention. ""250,000 people visited our site on the day last year. Unfortunately, that doesn't always convert into orders,"" says Milsom. ""While there's a lot of interest in left-handed products, there's also a lot of apathy."" Read more: Why solstice stirs libidos . Still, he's been contacted by dozens of people who have concocted their own Left-Handers' Day celebrations. ""It tends to be people converting their spaces in to 'lefty-only' zones. We've heard of people who own pubs and make a rule where everyone has to drink with their left hand that day. It's fairly low-key,"" he admits. Ultimately, though, the true test of a holiday's validity is if it gets its own greeting card. While Hallmark denies creating holidays, the company says it employs a team of 600 to research events worth celebrating. While Hallmark isn't making Hoodie-Hoo Day cards yet, this year it started making Star Wars Day e-cards. ""We've seen the demand for that rise out of social media,"" says Hallmark spokesperson Kristi Ernsting, who adds that customers were creating their own ""May the Fourth Be With You"" e-cards through the Hallmark site. The company decided to follow suit. ""People seem to really like that phrase,"" she says.","Thomas Roy has created over 90 holidays, all of which he's trademarked.
Roy's most popular celebration is Northern Hemisphere Hoodie-Hoo Day.
Anyone can create a holiday by sending a form to Chase's Calendar of Events.

"Any publicity is good publicity for Dublin-based budget airline Ryanair. The no-frills airline recently announced plans to cut down to just one toilet per aircraft (see below), and that had us wondering: are announcements like their toilet fee and ""fat tax"" tasteless marketing ploys, or is Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary just really cheap? Despite wanting to strip their passengers of basic comforts like toilets and seat pockets, Ryanair is doing good business. Comparing September 2011 with September 2010, Ryanair reported a 6 percent hike in passenger numbers, from 6.84 million to 7.25 million. Through September 2011, the airline carried 76.8 million passengers, reported the airline. The airline's website also claims that in 2010, profits rose 26 percent to more than ‚Ç¨401m (US$551m) despite higher fuel prices, the global recession, and volcanic ash disruptions in the spring. Ryanair's high booking fees and ancillary charges include: ¬£30 (US$41) to check in a bag, ¬£10 (US$14) to pay for flights with a debit or credit card (excluding Visa Electron) and ¬£60 (US$83) to check in sports or music equipment, according to the Telegraph. CNNGo: World's 50 best beaches . So, to honor the success of the self-proclaimed ""world's favorite airline"" let's take a look at some of its most ingenious money-saving tactics. 1. One toilet per aircraft . In October 2011, Ryanair expressed its intolerance for people with bladders. The budget airline announced that it would remove two or three toilets from its aircraft to make room for six extra seats. Up to 200 passengers and six crew would share a bathroom during the flight, reported the Daily Mail. O'Leary said, ""We very rarely use all three toilets on board our aircraft anyway."" But apparently he is doing us all a favor. The move ""would fundamentally lower air fares by about 5 percent for all passengers, cutting ¬£2 (US$3) from a typical ¬£40 (US$63) ticket."" What a steal. Currently, there is no legal stipulation for an airline to provide toilets on its aircraft, but Ryanair has not announced a date to implement the plan. CNNGo: 10 of the world's best hotels for pets . 2. Charging ¬£1 for toilets . The toilet removal wasn't a surprise to passengers and critics because O'Leary announced in 2010 that Ryanair would charge ¬£1 or ‚Ç¨1 for passengers to use the toilet. Stephen McNamara, spokesperson for the airline, told TravelMail: ""By charging for the toilets we are hoping to change passenger behavior so that they use the bathroom before or after the flight,"" according to the Daily Mail. But as of 2011, O'Leary said the plans to ""charge a pound to spend a penny"" have now been dropped. 3. Standing room only . Looking more and more like cheap suburban public transport, Ryanair announced in July 2010 it was preparing for standing-room-only seats at the back of its 250-strong fleet. A spokesman for Ryanair said that Boeing had been consulted over refitting the fleet with ""vertical seats."" Passengers would be strapped in while standing up, and tickets for these seats would cost between ¬£4 (US$6) and ¬£8 (US$13). Here's a video of their design. However, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said the plans would struggle to meet safety requirements. The unnamed spokesman said: ""It's aviation law that people have to have a seat belt on for take-off and landing so they would have to be in a seat. I don't know how Mr. O'Leary would get around that one. During turbulence passengers also have to have a seat belt on."" In response to criticism for the idea, technological determinist O'Leary suggested haters were a bunch of Luddites who couldn't groove with the changes. ""People are always slow to accept the changes that face the aviation industry, even though it is already almost unrecognizable from 20 to 30 years ago,"" said a Ryanair spokesman, as reported by the Guardian. CNNGo: 10 adventures for chocoholics . 4. Charging for overweight passengers . Backpackers around the world put down their Italian gelato when they heard about Ryanair's ""fat tax."" The airline asked passengers on its website whether or not they should charge for ""very large passengers."" ""Over 100,000 passengers logged on to ryanair.com to take part in our competition and almost one in three (over 30,000) think that very large passengers should be asked to pay a fat tax. The revenues from any such 'fat tax' will be used to lower the airfares for all Ryanair passengers yet further,"" Ryanair's McNamara said. This time the plan did not go ahead, not out of ethical considerations but because it would be hard to collect the money and would make boarding much slower. 5. Charging extra ¬£40 to print boarding passes . Ryanair currently charges passengers ¬£40 (US$63) to print their boarding pass at the airport. The charge was intended to speed up the check-in process. In January 2011, a passenger took the budget airline to court over the charge in Spain. In October 11 2011, the Barcelona Appeal Court ruled that Ryanair's boarding card was perfectly legal in accordance with Spanish and EU law. The airline's smug response to the verdict on their website was that ""less than 1 percent of passengers pay this boarding card reissue penalty which applies only in those rare cases where passengers fail to comply with their agreement, given at the time of booking."" Passengers can avoid the reissue penalty by checking in online before leaving for the airport.","Ireland's budget airline has made a profitable habit out of incensing passengers .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A US Airways plane with 155 people on board ditched into a chilly Hudson River on Thursday, apparently after striking at least one bird upon takeoff from New York's LaGuardia Airport, according to officials and passengers. iReporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the scene in the river. Everyone on board was accounted for and alive, officials said. About 15 people were being treated at hospitals and others were being evaluated at triage centers. Flight 1549, headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, was airborne less than three minutes, according to FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown. The pilot radioed to air traffic controllers that he had experienced a bird strike and declared an emergency, a New Jersey State Police source said. ""I think a lot of people started praying and just collecting themselves,"" said passenger Fred Berretta. ""It was quite stunning.""  Watch passenger describe landing ¬ª . He said he was expecting the plane to flip over and break apart, but it did not. ""It was a great landing,"" Berretta said. Air traffic controllers at LaGuardia saw the plane clear the George Washington Bridge by less than 900 feet before gliding into the water about 3:31 p.m., an aviation source told CNN. iReport.com: Are you there? Send images . Witness Ben Vonklemperer said he watched the plane from the 25th floor of an office building. ""If someone's going to land a plane in the water, this seemed the best possible way to do it,"" Vonklemperer said. ""The way they hit it was very gradual. A very slow contact with the water."" As the situation began to settle Thursday evening, the flight's pilot, Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, emerged as a hero, with praise being heaped on him by passengers, officials and aviation experts. ""I don't think there's enough praise to go around for someone who does something like this. This is something you really can't prepare for,"" said former Delta pilot Denny Walsh. ""You really don't practice water landings in commercial airplanes. Just the sheer expertise he demonstrated is amazing."" US Airways CEO Doug Parker said it would be premature to speculate about the cause of the accident until the National Transportation Safety Board, which is sending a team to the site, completed an investigation. A source familiar with the situation, however, told CNN the pilot reported a double bird strike, but it was unclear whether that meant birds in both engines or two birds in one engine. The pilot initially said he needed to go back, and air traffic controllers started to give him clearance to do so, but the pilot said he wanted to head to Teterboro, New Jersey, because it was closer. That was the last transmission from the pilot, the source said. Passenger Alberto Panero said that within a few minutes after takeoff, he heard a loud bang and smelled smoke.  Watch passenger say he heard a loud bang ¬ª . ""That's when we knew we were going down and into the water. We just hit, and somehow the plane stayed afloat and we were able to get on the raft. It's just incredible right now that everybody's still alive."" Passenger Jeff Kolodjay of Norwalk, Connecticut, said he was sitting in seat 22A, near one of the engines. ""The captain came on and said, 'Look, we're going down. Brace for impact.' Everyone looked at each other and we said our prayers. I said about five Hail Marys,"" said Kolodjay, who was headed to Charlotte to play golf. ""The plane started filling with water pretty quick,"" he said. ""It was scary. There was a lady with her baby on my left-hand shoulder, and she was crawling over the seats.""  Watch footage of plane in water ¬ª . Police, fire and Coast Guard boats, along with commercial ferries, were quickly on the scene as passengers lined up on slightly submerged safety chutes. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said later Thursday that the plane was tied to a pier at Battery Park City in lower Manhattan. As night fell, Coast Guard and FDNY boats remained at the scene. President Bush commended those involved in the rescue. ""Laura and I are inspired by the skill and heroism of the flight crew as well as the dedication and selflessness of the emergency responders and volunteers who rescued passengers from the icy waters of the Hudson,"" he said. Bloomberg also commended the pilot for not leaving the plane until he had checked to make sure everyone had been been evacuated. ""It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out,"" Bloomberg said. ""I had a long conversation with the pilot,"" Bloomberg said. ""He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off, and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board, and assures us there were not."" ""There is a heroic pilot,"" said Gov. David Paterson. ""We have had a miracle on 34th Street, I believe we now have a miracle on the Hudson."" The temperature in New York was 20 degrees about the time of the crash off Manhattan's west side.  See map of crash site ¬ª . Dr. Gabriel Wilson, associated medical director of the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital, said 55 survivors were checked out and cleared to leave from the scene. Those being treated at hospitals included a husband and wife with hypothermia at Roosevelt Hospital, as well as a flight attendant with a leg fracture, hospital spokeswoman Michelle Stiles said. Since 1975, five large jetliners have had major accidents in which bird strikes played a role, according to the Web site of Bird Strike Committee USA, a volunteer group dedicated to reducing the frequency and severity of the strikes. More than 56,000 bird strikes were reported to the FAA from 1998 to 2004, according to the group's Web site. People who believe they may have had relatives on the flight may call US Airways at 1-800-679-8215 within the United States, the airline said.

"As President Barack Obama channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in Syria, he shouldn't be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed. One common refrain from those who plan to vote against the resolution to authorize military action in Syria is they simply can't support a proposal that their constituents vociferously oppose. ""Both in terms of the percentage opposed -- I would have to say it is by far the single biggest issue we have seen,"" said Rep. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana. Daines represents all of Montana -- he is an ""at large"" member -- and he said that during the August recess he put 3,000 miles on his truck, crisscrossing the state and attending events that put him in close conversations with his constituents. At coffee hours, town halls, and meet and greets all over the state, Daines found that the sentiment was overwhelming: ""I am hearing from the people of Montana. They are telling me we should not be involved."" ""It is called the people's house for a reason,"" Daines concluded. ""We are here to express the voice of the people. This is an example of where Congress, hopefully, will express the will of the American people."" The number of ""no"" votes in Congress continues to grow, while lawmakers planning to vote ""yes"" are becoming an even smaller minority, according to CNN's latest vote count. There are currently 148 House members prepared to vote against Obama's call for military action -- with 30 Democrats joining 118 Republicans in their opposition. That overall number of ""no"" votes has grown from 109 on Friday. In order to win passage of the authorization, Obama will have to persuade 270 members to vote ""yes"" -- a heavy lift, considering there are currently only 25 members who say they plan to vote ""yes"" on military action, 17 Democrats and eight Republicans. The number of ""yes"" votes has only increased by two since Friday. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday shows that even though eight in 10 Americans believe that Bashar al-Assad's regime gassed its own people, a strong majority don't want Congress to pass a resolution authorizing a military strike against it. Since Obama unexpectedly asked Congress in August to authorize military action in Syria, polls have found that Americans are opposed to such action. The Senate has been more receptive than the House to Obama's authorization request. There are currently 25 ""yes"" and 23 ""no"" votes in the Senate, with a significant 52 senators undecided. But the trend favors the ""no"" votes -- with a handful of moderate Democrats in the last three days coming out against the proposal. ""After doing my due diligence, I believe we need an alternative path forward in dealing with the Assad regime,"" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota in a statement. ""We must balance the legitimate concerns that Americans have about the use of military force with our strategic interests."" Other Democratic senators echoed Heitkamp: Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska. Pryor issued a statement Saturday saying Obama and his national security team had not yet made an effective case for taking action against al-Assad's regime and laying out the criteria that had to be met in order for him to support military action in Syria. ""Based on the information presented to me and the evidence I have gathered, I do not believe these criteria have been met,"" Pryor said. Begich told people on a telephone town hall last week that he was a ""probable no"" on Syrian authorization. ""This has probably been the No. 1 issue, especially in the last week, that Alaskans have been contacting my office, as well as when I was back home for the last month,"" Begich said. Because of the possibility of a filibuster, Obama and supporters need 60 votes in the Senate to win passage. Despite the vocal opposition and light support, majorities in both the House and Senate remain undecided on the proposal, and the White House is putting on the hard sell to court those possible ""yes"" votes. The Senate is expected to take up the resolution after returning from its month-long summer recess Monday. White House officials will travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to make their case with lawmakers, hours before Obama addresses the nation in a prime-time speech.","Lawmakes who plan to vote against military action say their constituents oppose it .

"What happens now? Australian officials have said they don't think missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is in the patch of the southern Indian Ocean where underwater pings were picked up last month. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in early April that authorities were ""very confident"" the signals were coming from the plane's flight recorders, raising hopes of closure among some of the families of the 239 people on board the passenger jet. But after spending weeks scouring the bottom of the ocean roughly 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) off Western Australia with a high-tech unmanned submarine, the searchers have drawn another blank, deepening the mystery surrounding the Boeing 777's fate. Officials say they are still trying to figure out the source of the signals that led the search for the past seven weeks. More than 11 weeks after Flight 370 dropped off radar screens over Southeast Asia on a scheduled flight to Beijing, officials in charge of the hunt are drawing a line through the ping-centered search and moving on to the next phase. Where does the search go next? The underwater search area guided by the pings covered more than 850 square kilometers (330 square miles). With that zone now ruled out, Australian authorities, who have been coordinating the search in the southern Indian Ocean, say attention will shift to a new area as large as 60,000 square kilometers. That's roughly the size of West Virginia. ""The search will be a major undertaking,"" the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said this week. ""The complexities and challenges involved are immense, but not impossible."" The underwater search will remain in the same overall region, as officials are basing their focus on an analysis of satellite, radar and other data that concludes the plane ended up somewhere along an arc stretching into the southern Indian Ocean. ""What has not changed at this stage is the belief that, after weeks of research and re-analysis, that the Inmarsat data is correct and that they are looking broadly in the right area,"" said Geoffrey Thomas, the editor in chief of Airlineratings.com, referring to the satellite data provided by the British company Inmarsat. ""Now clearly, we were hoping that the pings would narrow that broad area down to a narrow one, but that has not been the case, and now we have to unfortunately go the long road,"" Thomas told CNN. Will they start searching the new area immediately? No. In fact, it hasn't yet been fully mapped out. The ATSB said this week that it's reviewing existing information from experts in order to refine the new zone. Meanwhile, a specialized Chinese ship, the Zhu Kezhen, has begun mapping the ocean floor in some areas already picked out by the ATSB. A contracted commercial survey vessel will join those efforts next month. It's unclear how deep the water is in these areas because ""it's never been mapped,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said earlier this month. Officials say depths are likely to exceed 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). The survey will take about three months and ""give us crucial knowledge of the seafloor terrain needed to begin the underwater search,"" the ATSB said. Who will do the actual searching? That's still being figured out. The Bluefin-21, the robotic submersible supplied by the U.S. Navy that has been searching the area where the pings were detected, has reached the end of its mission. Search officials are regrouping and preparing to identify and deploy other high-tech equipment. But that's going to take some time -- up to two months, if not longer, according to Australian authorities. Officials say they want the next phase of the underwater search, which could take up to a year, to be led by a single private contractor who will bring together and manage several underwater assets in the search zone. Search coordinators say they are looking for sonar equipment that can be towed by a ship, an autonomous underwater vehicle with a mounted sonar device and optical imaging equipment. Some towed sonar devices, such as the U.S. Navy's Orion, can transmit data to the surface in real-time. They also have the capability of scanning a larger area than the Bluefin, which was limited to about 40 square kilometers during each mission. Only a handful of companies have such devices. Australian authorities say they plan to post their request for tenders for the next phase of the search in the coming days. Who's going to pay for it? That's another issue that isn't clear yet. Australia has estimated the next phase of the search will cost $60 million, with the breakdown of exactly who's going to pay for what yet to be announced. While 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysia, China and Australia have held high-level talks about the future of the search. Malaysia is where the plane is from, most of the people on the flight were Chinese, and Australia had six passengers on board and is closest to the remote part of the Indian Ocean where searchers have focused their hunt. The United States has contributed a range of assets to the search so far, including the Bluefin-21, which costs an estimated $40,000 a day to operate. Are the searchers still looking in the right place? Australian officials say they remain confident in the conclusion -- reached by a team of experts from Boeing and aviation authorities around the world, including the United States and Europe -- that Flight 370 ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean. Despite questions from independent experts, Inmarsat says it stands by its analysis of a series of communications between the plane and the company's satellite system that provided a key part of the conclusion about the jetliner's path. Earlier this week, Malaysian authorities released the satellite data from Inmarsat, meeting a long-standing request of some passengers' families who were unsatisfied by authorities' explanation of the plane's fate. Independent experts are now studying the data to see whether they agree with the official view.","The new search area is roughly the size of West Virginia .

"In a major defeat for supporters of tougher gun laws, the U.S. Senate on Wednesday defeated a compromise plan to expand background checks on firearms sales as well as a proposal to ban some semi-automatic weapons modeled after military assault weapons. The votes were on a series of amendments to a broad package of gun laws pushed by President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December. However, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association led a backlash by conservative Republicans and a few Democrats from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package, even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents. After the votes, Obama angrily criticized the NRA and senators who voted against the expanded background checks for rejecting a compromise he said was supported by a strong majority of Americans. Public opinion gets trumped in gun control defeat . ""Instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,"" Obama told White House reporters. Noting polls that showed 90% support for such a measure, Obama called it a ""pretty shameful day for Washington"" and wondered of Congress: ""Who are we here to represent?"" He was flanked by relatives of gun violence victims as well as former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a gun owner who was disabled in a shooting attack and supported Obama's proposals. A statement by Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, said the Senate had ""ignored the will of the American people,"" adding that those senators who voted against the expanded background checks chose to ""obey the leaders of the powerful corporate gun lobby, instead of their constituents."" To Erica Lafferty, the daughter of the principal of the Newtown, Connecticut, school who was killed along with 20 first-graders and five other educators in the December attack, the vote amounted to inaction in the face of a national tragedy. ""The next time there's a mass shooting and they're asked what they did to prevent it, they're going to have to say nothing,"" she said. On the other side, the NRA's Chris Cox called the expanded background check proposal ""misguided,"" saying it would not reduce violent crime ""or keep our kids safe in their schools."" The broader gun package still under consideration by the Senate includes tougher laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases, and steps to devise ways to improve safety in schools. Obama: 'This was a pretty shameful day in Washington' As originally proposed, with a provision to expand background checks, it would have been the most significant gun legislation before Congress in almost two decades. Due to early opposition to the background check provision, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania worked out a compromise that was less comprehensive than what Obama wanted but still gained the president's support. The Manchin-Toomey plan would have expanded background checks to include private sales at gun shows and all Internet sales, while continuing to exempt most sales between family members and friends. Due to procedural steps agreed to by both sides, all the amendments considered Wednesday required 60 votes to pass in the 100-member chamber, meaning Democrats and their independent allies who hold 55 seats needed support from some GOP senators to push through the Manchin-Toomey proposal. The final vote was 54 in favor to 46 opposed with four Republicans joining most Democrats in supporting the compromise. With the outcome obvious, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, cast a ""no"" vote to secure the ability to bring the measure up again. Meanwhile, four Democrats from pro-gun states voted with most Republicans in opposition. Giffords on senators: 'Shame on them' When the result was announced by Vice President Joe Biden, who presided over the chamber for the vote, two women in the gallery of spectators shouted ""shame on you"" at the senators. ""They are an embarrassment to this country that they don't have any compassion or care for people who have been taken brutally from their families,"" said one of them, Patricia Maisch, who grabbed the gun magazine from the attacker who shot Giffords and several other people in Tucson in January 2011. On the proposal by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California to update a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons that expired in 2004, the vote was 40-60, showing opposition by several Democrats as well as the chamber's Republican minority. Obama had pushed for Congress to include both the expanded background checks provision and the weapons ban in any gun package. In recent weeks, he and the White House focused their efforts on winning support for the Manchin-Toomey compromise. However, the NRA promised political retribution against supporters of  tougher gun laws, and it called the expanded background checks a first step toward a national gun registry and government confiscation of firearms. Obama called that claim misinformation, noting the Manchin-Toomey proposal prohibited such a registry. He said the tactics of the NRA galvanized a vocal minority of gun owners against the legislation, which caused some senators to flinch. Rand Paul: OBama used Newtown families as 'props' ""They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment,"" Obama said. ""And obviously a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure.  And they started looking for an excuse, any excuse to vote 'no.'"" Reid earlier warned Republicans that the strong majority of Americans who support expanded background checks won't forget votes against the Manchin-Toomey compromise. ""The American people ... have a long, long memory,"" he said. Meanwhile, an alternative package of gun proposal that reflected the NRA position also was defeated. Offerd by conservative Republicans, the alternative plan introduced Wednesday after weeks of  hearings and debate on Democratic proposals lacked any expansion of background checks but called for more funding to better enforce the existing system. Emotions high as political world reacts . A sponsor of the Republican alternative, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said it would target the gun violence problem in a way that the Democratic proposal before the Senate would not. In response, Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, called the GOP's last-minute proposal a ""weak and counterproductive alternative."" Other proposed amendments defeated Wednesday included a plan by Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable throughout the country., as well as a proposal by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey to limit the number of rounds in ammunition magazines. Any legislation passed by the Senate would then go to the Republican-led House. So far, House Speaker John Boehner has stopped short of promising a vote on whatever the Senate sends over. Polls show that a strong majority of Americans support some type of initiative to stem gun violence. In a CNN/ORC International poll released last week, 86% of Americans say they support expanded background checks.","President Obama says gun law foes ""willfully lied""

"When leaving Myanmar one year ago, Tay  thought he would find a better life in Thailand. Instead he found himself a victim of modern slavery. The soft-spoken 21-year old was smuggled across the border by labor brokers with the promise of a safe and stable job at the end of the journey. He was prepared for hard work at a pineapple factory that would enable him to save money and pay back the man who helped take him across the border. Instead he said that he and 12 others who made the journey with him were sold for around $430 each into jobs that made them virtual slaves. To Tay's horror he was taken onto a fishing boat, despite no experience of fishing, and for the next six months was forced to work without pay. According to Tay, some of the girls in his group were sent to work in seafood processing factories, while the prettier ones were sent to brothels. ""I felt very depressed when I first arrived on the boat, like I was in hell,"" he said. ""I was beaten because I didn't know how to do the work properly."" Tay's story is not unique.¬† According to a new report by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), a British-based human rights charity, the Thai fishing and seafood industry, worth $7 billion annually, involves considerable exploitation of trafficked migrant workers, most from neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia. Tay was fortunate to escape after nine months working on the boat. By pretending to be ill he was able to go ashore long enough to flee to Pattaya, a resort town to the south of Bangkok, and take refuge in a temple. He remains there, unsure of his future or if any of the people involved in his ordeal will face prosecution. He asked CNN not to use his real name for fear of reprisals. Brutal conditions . Many others echo his testimony of coercion and harsh conditions on board fishing boats. A group of 14 men from Myanmar rescued from boats last year told the EJF of 20 hour work days with little or no pay and beatings at the hands of Thai crew members. According to reports from the EJF some even witnessed murder, with bodies being thrown overboard as causally as unwanted catch. Speaking from a government shelter in the south of Thailand where they have been for nearly one year, most are now disillusioned and more interested in just going home than finding justice, said Steve Trent, founding director of the EJF. ""If they give up and say 'we just want to go home,' the case that surrounds everyone that exploits them collapses and there won't be further action,"" he said. ""It's not good enough to say the judicial process is slow in Thailand. In effect they are punishing these people again. They are the innocents involved."" The rise in forced labor on board Thai fishing boats is tied to growing global demand for cheap seafood and diminishing fish stocks, say the EJF. Fishing boats have to make longer trips for less catch, making an already tough job harder and less attractive to domestic workers, as well as threatening profit margins for all involved in the industry. Taking action . Last year the Thai government announced a national action plan to prevent human trafficking and support its victims. Together with national fishing associations and civil action groups, the Ministry of Labor assisted the International Labor Organization (ILO) with its 2013 report on trafficked workers in the fishing sector. The report found that one in six working on long-haul fishing boats did not decide to do so willingly, but acknowledged that the vast majority of workers in the sector are Thai and work voluntarily. ""There are real concerns regarding forced labor in the fishing industry, said Max Tunon, senior program officer for the ILO. ""In the past years there has been engagement from the government and national fishing associations to ILO initiatives and we've seen more commitment from the central level but not yet seen concrete results. ""The sector has been this way for a long time and there are no quick or easy fixes. Turning this around is long process, but we're hoping to see the result."" Both the U.S. State Department and EJF have been critical of Thai attempts to clampdown on human trafficking in the country citing widespread corruption among law enforcement officials. According to a 2013 U.S. State Department report, the Thai marine department and navy inspected 608 fishing vessels in 2012 but found no cases of trafficked workers, suggesting corruption and inadequate financial and human resources were allowing the continued exploitation of workers. Thailand's Ministry for Labor and the Ministry for Social Development have not responded to CNN's requests for comment, but the government has said in the past that it is committed to fighting human trafficking. Pressure to change . Tay said he witnessed police taking bribes from boat owners who had undocumented crew members. But Trent believes that links between authority figures, boat owners and human traffickers can be even more brazen. ""We have documented evidence of marked police cars transporting trafficked victims who are then sold onto boats as slaves,"" said Trent. ""It's an absurd situation where you have those paid to protect people conniving in their abuse."" CNN could not reach the Department for Special Investigations for comment on the claims. ""The problem really lies with many of the people that run these local businesses who are brutal and corrupt,"" said Trent. ""It seems that political and market driven pressure combined is the only way the industry is going to change."" Thailand is currently listed as a Tier 2 watch-list country on the U.S. State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP) and will drop to Tier 3 -- the lowest classification this year -- if it does not improve, something the EJF is calling for. The results could be the withdrawal of international financial aid.","Report by NGO finds widespread abuse of migrant workers in Thai fishing industry .

"Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon's performance as an upset wife earned her a trip to jail and a disorderly conduct charge. ""You are going to be on national news,"" Witherspoon allegedly told a Georgia state trooper as he handcuffed her on Atlanta's Peachtree Road early Friday morning. That didn't discourage Trooper First Class J. Pyland from writing a very quotable arrest report suitable for national news -- with dialogue worthy of a Witherspoon movie script. Her lawyer worked out a deal with the prosecutor Monday morning in which Witherspoon will go through a pre-trial intervention program to avoid getting a conviction on her record, an Atlanta Municipal Court spokesman said. The program provides ""alternative methods of resolving criminal matters other than prosecution,"" the court's website said.  ""Participants are charged with minor criminal offenses, do not have prior convictions, do not have any cases pending, and have not already gone through a diversion program.""  The judge set May 22 as the date for a hearing to check if she is complying with the program. While the court's program may be relatively painless, Witherspoon is suffering from another punishment:  public humiliation. The actress canceled plans to do interviews in New York to promote her new film ""Mud"" on Monday, her publicist said.  She did walk the red carpet at the movie's New York premiere Sunday night, but she declined to talk to the media. Witherspoon, who was in Atlanta working on a movie titled ""The Good Lie,"" was charged with interfering with Pyland's arrest of her husband, Hollywood agent James Toth, on a drunken driving charge. ""Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer,"" Pyland wrote.  ""I told Mrs. Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet."" Witherspoon, 37, allegedly did not follow his order, getting out of the Ford Fusion instead.  When the trooper warned her again, Witherspoon allegedly told him she was a U.S. citizen and allowed to ""stand on American ground.""  Her American pride got her handcuffed. ""I put my hands on Mrs. Witherspoon's arms to arrest her,"" Pyland wrote. ""Mrs. Witherspoon was resistant but I was able to put handcuffs on her without incident due to Mr. Toth calming her."" ""Do you know my name?"" the trooper recalled Witherspoon asking him.  ""I answered, 'No, I don't need to know your name.'"" ""You're about to find out who I am,"" she replied, the arrest report said. Pyland stopped Toth, 42, after seeing him weave in and out of his lane as he drove through the city's Buckhead community, the arrest report said. Toth's eyes were bloodshot and his clothing disheveled, Pyland wrote.  After several coordination tests, he was given a breathalyzer test that registered 0.139, well above the legal limit of 0.08 for a driving under the influence charge, the report said. Their car was impounded, and Witherspoon and Toth were taken to the Atlanta city jail, the report said.  An unidentified passenger in the back seat caught a cab, it said. The couple were bailed out of jail Saturday morning. A court date is set for Monday morning. Having had time to sober up, Witherspoon apologized profusely for her behavior. ""But I do want to say, I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said,"" the actress said in a statement.  ""It was definitely a scary situation and I was frightened for my husband, but that is no excuse. I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job. I have nothing but respect for the police and I'm very sorry for my behavior."" Witherspoon, whose earlier films include ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" won a shelf full of awards for her performance as June Carter Cash in ""Walk the Line,"" including a best actress Academy Award.","Witherspoon cancels interviews to promote new film Monday .

"And I didn't think Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo! chief who caused quite a stir with her two-week maternity leave and decision to ban employees working from home, could get any more controversial. Enter her decision to strike a pose in the September issue of Vogue magazine, lounging on a hammock wearing Michael Kors and stiletto heels, and let the debate, mostly among women, rage on. ""Smart women can be beautiful,"" said Jen Bosse of the blog, Defining My Happy. ""Beautiful women can be leaders of industry. Women should not have to succumb to societal pressure dictating what they are 'allowed' to be and do."" I happen to agree with Jen's sentiment, but other women saw Mayer's pose as a step backward. ""We fight so hard to be where we are and prove that it wasn't our cute bodies, perky boobs or cute face that got us there,"" said self-described ""pretty geek,"" Anna Nicole Moose, in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page. ""Shame on you Marissa Mayer for playing into stereotypes."" But can't a woman be powerful, strong and beautiful, all at once? That question drew a range of responses from women on various rungs of the corporate ladder, some supportive of Mayer embracing her femininity and others lamenting the undue pressure on female leaders to soften their image. Yahoo's Marissa Mayer turns heads with Vogue photo shoot . For many women, the fact that there's even a debate about Mayer's decision to do the Vogue photo shoot in the first place shows that a double standard is alive and well. ""Why are women always being held to a different level of scrutiny in the business and tech space?"" said Carolyn Gerin, senior editor of Destination I Do Magazine. ""So what if Marissa Meyer loves fashion? Would we think less of Larry Ellison being photographed with his monster boat ... or Richard Branson with his hot air balloons?"" Cali Williams Yost, author of the book ""Tweak It: Make What Matters to You Happen Every Day,"" said, ""My hope is that someday we're not batting an eye at CEO women being in Vogue, as we don't bat an eye on CEO men being in Outside magazine talking about how they climbed Mount Kilimanjaro."" Marissa Mayer: From Google 'geek' to Yahoo CEO . Patrice Grell Yursik, creator of a beauty, fashion and lifestyle site for women of color called Afrobella.com, believes Mayer has the right to present herself any way she sees fit, but says sadly, mainstream media showcases women and men differently. ""I can't think of the last time a men's magazine chose to profile a CEO by asking him to sprawl out on a couch,"" she said. ""When, let's say, GQ or Esquire is profiling someone on this level, they're not asking them to unbutton their shirt and pose suggestively with any kinds of props."" The response from Mayer's fellow female CEOs and female executives was also telling. Barbara O., who only wanted to use her first name and initial of her last name, is a chief marketing officer who worked in the tech industry at companies ranging from Apple to Netscape to Yahoo!. Her position isn't one based on sexism, she says, but on her views about the best way for a CEO to benefit his or her company. How Marissa Mayer writes her own rules . ""The pose that Marissa took for ... Vogue is not one that a man would take or that seems to be beneficial for Yahoo!,"" she said in response to a post on CNN's Facebook page. ""I am fine with her using her good looks or her smarts or her role as a CEO and mother to help folks take a new look at Yahoo!. However, this Vogue (photo) looks to be much more about Marissa being sexy as a woman rather than Marissa looking great as CEO of a company desperately trying to remain relevant."" Grace Chan, vice president for product management for Wanderful Media, said she wouldn't have posed for Vogue as an executive. ""This is something I wouldn't personally do because I believe if you want to be treated equal, you shouldn't take advantage of your physical assets,"" said Chan. ""I don't want to get brownie points because I am attractive. I like to separate the fact that I am a woman and I am a professional."" Other women in leadership positions said they saw no problem with Mayer showing a different side of her personality. ""So what if Marissa Mayer is in a fashion spread in Vogue?"" said Mary Cook, CEO of CallSocket.com. ""When she 'took office' did she also park her sense of fashion, personal interests, and humor at the front door? I hope she had fun on the photo shoot and she looks great to boot!"" For some women, the issue is not what Mayer did but what she said. In the Vogue article, the Yahoo! CEO said she didn't set out to lead technology companies. ""I'm just geeky and shy and I like to code. ... It's not like I had a grand plan where I weighed all the pros and cons of what I wanted to do -- it just sort of happened,"" she told the magazine. ""You don't become a female CEO of a tech company for just stumbling onto a career, and you certainly don't end up in Vogue for those reasons either,"" said Hayley Krischer, a writer of the feminist blog, Femamom, and mom of two. ""Mayer has embraced all of her horrible work ethics ... putting a kabosh on the work-from-home environment so why not embrace her aggressive side and tell the truth about who she is?"" If Marissa Mayer can 'have it all,' can you? In the midst of all the back and forth were questions from some women about why we women are often ripping each other apart. After all, women have been some of the loudest critics of Mayer. ""She's not doing a spread in Playboy,"" said Micky Marie Morrison, author of ""Baby Weight."" ""It's not at all inappropriate. What's inappropriate is judging her."" Nicole Williams, LinkedIn's career expert, said, ""The thought that women can be glamorous, beautiful and successful is really difficult for women to embrace because I think in large part it's hard. It's really hard to be all those things at once and it feels kind of threatening.""

"Condoleezza Rice for vice president? Before we go A-to-Z with pros and cons, let's start with why Romney's team might have floated the Condi trial balloon now. If you were anywhere near a television this week you saw Mitt Romney getting booed at the NAACP convention for saying he would repeal Obamacare. It was running on a virtual loop all over cable news. Romney draws boos from NAACP, support from conservatives . Then, suddenly, an exclusive report about a black woman being considered as Romney's running mate pops up on the Drudge Report. Report sparks speculation of Romney-Rice ticket . GOP sources say Matt Drudge is the go-to guy for a top Romney aide when he wants to change a narrative about his candidate. Now that we've gotten the ""why now"" out of the way, why not explore Rice the running mate. By most Republicans' accounts, at the end of this report, you will see why Rice will likely not be Romney's pick . The pros . There are many, beginning with the obvious: She is a black Republican woman, a political two-fer. And having a female on the ticket would make the influential Ann Romney happy. Mrs. Romney told CBS News earlier this month that they have been ""looking at that and I love that option."" Rice has never run for office but she is no stranger to presidential politics. She was by George W. Bush's side during both of his campaigns. She's an intellectual known for her powerhouse smarts and she has a good personal story. Rice was the only child of a black family growing up in the segregated South, whose fortitude landed her in unlikely GOP foreign policy circles. Rice is also a bit of a Renaissance woman. She is a concert pianist with a love of football. Her real dream job is to be NFL commissioner. The former secretary of state and national security adviser would bring some needed foreign policy chops to Romney's ticket. The cons . She was a central Bush administration player making the public case for the Iraq war, warning about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist. ""There will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,"" Rice told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in September 2002. Some GOP sources tell CNN say they can't imagine Romney would want to reopen wounds from the Bush years -- especially about what even Republicans call a mismanaged war. Rice is also at odds with the GOP base on immigration, telling CNN's Candy Crowley not passing her boss's legislation allowing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants was one of her biggest regrets. Last but hardly least is Rice's stance on abortion. She calls herself ""mildly pro-choice."" This is the reason you can sum up social conservative reaction to the Rice trial balloon with one word: nonstarter. Veteran conservative voice Richard Viguerie, one of the founders of the Moral Majority, said the notion of Romney picking Rice as his running mate would be a ""slap in the face"" to conservatives. While Viguerie took issue with Rice's position on abortion, he said she was part of those to blame for Republican losses in 2006 and 2008 which gave rise to the ""tea party rebellion of 2010."" ""Putting Condoleeza Rice at the top of the VP short list is an insult to the conservatives, tea partiers and independents that are looking for a break with the old establishment Republican Washington that Rice represents,"" he said. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention, a longtime friend of Romney's, bluntly told CNN that Rice's stance on abortion disqualifies her. ""I love Condi Rice, I'd love to see her in any role in Romney administration except vice president,"" Land told CNN in a telephone interview. The issue, he said, isn't so much Rice -- it's Romney. Conservatives already mistrust Romney on abortion, since he was in favor of abortion rights when he was governor of Massachusetts, a relatively liberal state on the issue.

""What it would do is turn some activists and contributors into mere voters and turn some voters into fishermen,"" he said. Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council agreed. ""I think the governor needs someone that undergirds his stated pro-life position because of policy positions that he's taken when he was governor. He has since changed those positions to be clearly pro-life but to underscore that and to reemphasize that especially with social conservative voters, he has to have a running mate that has impeccable, impeccable pro-life credentials,"" Perkins said. The Susan B. Anthony List, a leading anti-abortion group, already e-mailed around a clip of Romney during the GOP primary race last year saying that the running mate he would consider would be anti-abortion. ""I would expect that they would all be pro-life and pro-traditional marriage,"" Romney said in September 2011. Romney was more explicit on the campaign trail in February. ""My vice presidential nominee will be pro-life,"" Romney said at a rally in Shelby, Michigan. Despite widespread suspicion about the late-night Rice-for-VP leak, GOP sources tell CNN some of Romney advisers are pushing for her -- so much so that a prominent evangelical leader told CNN he called the campaign last week to ask about it -- and warned that picking Rice would be a big mistake.

""Not because politics are so tough, but it's just not me."" ""There is no way that I will do this because it's really not me. I know my strengths and Governor Romney needs to find someone who wants to run with him. There are many people who will do it very, very well. I'll support the ticket,"" Rice reiterated on CBS News last month. What is Rice's response to the Drudge ""exclusive?"" This may speak for itself: She didn't respond to an e-mail and her chief of staff told us her past comments stand, and that she is on vacation and not available for further comment.","A Drudge Report exclusive has stoked speculation about Condi Rice as a potential VP pick .

"Anthony Weiner was running almost an hour late for his final campaign appearance of the weekend, two days before he faces all-but-certain political doom in Tuesday's Democratic primary for New York mayor. There was a ""child care mixup"" at home, an aide said. Weiner had to peel off the campaign trail and hustle back to his Park Avenue residence to pick up his 20-month-old son, Jordan. Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, has been absent from his side for weeks. But a small band of Weiner volunteers waited patiently for their candidate near the entrance to Pier 1 in Manhattan's Riverside Park, distributing campaign fliers to a largely disinterested crowd of families soaking in some late summer sun at the Westside County Fair. As they lingered, an otherwise normal-looking middle-aged man approached each of the volunteers and angrily thrust a finger in their faces. One by one, he scolded them with a nonsensical reprimand: ""Sexting for mayor!"" he yelled. ""Sexting for mayor!"" By the time Weiner arrived, the man was gone, and the former congressman avoided yet another public confrontation over the lewd online chats that torpedoed his once-promising mayoral bid. These scenes have become an almost daily routine for Weiner since he admitted in July that his naughty online behavior had continued well after he resigned from Congress in 2011, when he copped to exchanging racy pictures and lurid messages with women he had met on the Internet. Weiner today is more of a public curiosity than a serious candidate, despite being the best pure political talent in a Democratic field bereft of charisma and the kind of outsized personalities to which New York voters have become accustomed. After once leading the mayor's race, he is now in a distant fourth place. If no candidate captures more than 40% of the vote in Tuesday's primary -- and front-runner Bill de Blasio just might -- the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election. Combative Weiner still says he can win . Weiner will not be one of them, despite what he tells reporters. ""I'm convinced that I'm going be the next mayor of this city,"" Weiner said Sunday during an interview on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" an appearance that seemed wildly discordant with his diminished stature in New York, where the press is mostly ignoring him (unless he clashes with a loud-mouthed voter). Weiner challenges man who rebuked him for being 'married to an Arab' Scant media coverage but plenty of attention . At appearance after appearance during his final weekend of campaigning, a frantic schedule that featured 13 public events and trio of ""tele-town halls,"" Weiner attracted scant media attention. There were just two members of the press at a Weiner event Saturday in which he presented his ""closing arguments"" for a fairer tax system to a group of Spanish-speaking voters from Washington Heights, with the assistance of a translator. The next day, outside a YMCA in the Upper West Side where Weiner was pitching his affordable housing plan, a local news producer who had been detailed to the candidate said he was often the sole journalist at his events. After Weiner concluded his news conference, he asked whether any of the three reporters present had any questions about the topics at hand: public housing, rent regulations, mix-used zoning. There were none, so he took a question about de Blasio. But wherever he showed up during his admirably hectic final push -- on street corners, at community fairs, even at a cricket field in the far reaches of Queens -- Weiner would invariably draw a crowd of onlookers, most of them polite and nearly all of them reaching for their smartphones to document the moment. He is the human manifestation of click bait. While Weiner chatted with a voter on the corner of 105th and Amsterdam about expansion plans for NYU and Columbia University, an open-topped New York tour bus pulled up to a nearby stoplight. A heavyset man on the top deck of the bus spotted the candidate on the sidewalk -- from a 40-yard distance, no less -- and started flailing his arms and screaming at the top of his lungs: ""Weiner! Weiner! Weiner!"" Weiner paused and waved back. ""Welcome to New York! Stay as long as you want! Spend lots of money!"" In the closing days of the race, Weiner seems to be living in a sweet spot between shamelessness and fortitude, soldiering on in the face of mockery and barely any hope of winning. If he cracks double digits on Tuesday, it will be a surprise. Voters can't quite seem to figure out why he didn't quit the race weeks ago. Craig Meisner, a Democrat from Riverdale who runs a nonprofit, came upon one of Weiner's ""closing argument"" events Saturday while walking through Isham Park in upper Manhattan. Like hundreds of New Yorkers before and after him, he looked on curiously, snapped a picture and promptly posted it to Twitter. ""It makes no sense to me at all,"" Meisner said of Weiner's campaign. ""I am assuming he's running so that for his next step, his next office, he can say he's cleansed himself. You go through the process, you get vilified to whatever degree, and then you can run again for something else."" What could have been . Where some see desperation, others wonder what could have been. ""Anthony Weiner is the best political performer in this field and is progressive and tough enough in his policies and rhetoric that he'd be at or near the top of this race were it not for his scandals,"" said one veteran of New York City politics who, because of friends working in rival campaigns, did not want to be named saying something nice about the man who called himself Carlos Danger. Weiner's brazenness, energy and full-blown New Yorkitude offer a stark contrast to the cautious and consultant-driven personas of his Democratic opponents. At a Harlem forum hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton on Saturday, Weiner held forth on the topic of civil rights, referring to members of the African-American audience as ""my brothers and sisters."" When Weiner mistakenly referred to Sharpton as ""Rev. Jackson,"" he had the crowd in stitches with his quick recovery: ""Thank you! Good night!"" Even the front-running de Blasio couldn't match Weiner's effortless wit and ability to read a crowd. The next morning, Weiner called into Hot 97, the venerable New York hip-hop radio station. Asked to name his favorite rappers, Weiner quickly won over the DJs. ""I'm a big fan of Luda; I like Nas,"" he answered. ""But I'm little more a of dance hall reggae guy than a hip-hop guy."" Much laughter ensued. None of this is to say that Weiner, freed from the burden of expectations, is feeling loose and breezy as his campaign winds down. Arriving at staged press events where there might only be one reporter waiting for him, Weiner can wear a pained look on his face, his jaw clenched tightly as he prepares to go through the motions of his outlining his policy positions even though they have no hope of making the papers. ""Lucky ducky artichucky,"" he muttered to himself as he prepared to speak to a single NY1 camera at his YMCA event. One reporter described his demeanor lately as ""sheepish,"" which is how Weiner looked when he arrived an hour late to Riverside Park holding the hand of his son, Jordan, who was wearing the world's tiniest fedora. ""See the hat? He's bringing sexy back,"" Weiner said. As with everywhere he goes, observers hung back as Weiner walked along the Hudson River waterfront, looking on curiously and snapping pictures. Mothers and fathers pushing strollers looked annoyed as Weiner's entourage clogged the walkway. ""You've got to be kidding me,"" one woman exclaimed. The appearance was billed as a ""retail"" event, but Weiner shook few hands, instead tending to his child and walking along the Hudson River waterfront for the benefit of the cameras. The fact that Weiner is now being trailed at all times by filmmaker Josh Kriegman, a former producer for the MTV reality series ""MADE,"" only adds to the sense that his campaign, in its final days, is as much performance art as pursuit of office. Weiner is asked how he steels himself for this perplexing ritual every morning before he leaves his apartment. ""This is the only campaign I know how to run,"" he explains, pointing to the dozens of news ideas he has floated during the campaign. ""Every single I day I get up and I think, I am going to run the campaign New Yorkers want. This is where I am comfortable. This is what I like doing, and this has always worked for me. So I am not going to stop.""","Weiner makes his ""closing arguments"" in mayoral campaign that he once led .

"When Hillary Clinton joins candidates across the country, there is a standard formula for those introducing her: Rev up the crowd, tout candidates on the ballot, speak positively about Hillary Clinton. It appears Sen. Elizabeth Warren didn't get the message. When Warren and Clinton both stumped for Martha Coakley, Massachusetts' Democratic candidate, in Boston on Friday, Warren barely mentioned the former secretary of state. ""Happy to welcome Secretary Clinton back to the commonwealth,"" Warren said, firing up the crowd. ""We love it!"" Warren has seen an uptick in speculation that she will run for president lately. While the senator has said she isn't running for president, she has left the door open and has continually dodged question about Clinton. The reason: If Warren were to run, she would likely face Clinton, the former secretary of state is widely seen as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Related: Warren tells CNN Democrats must 'stand up and fight' Clinton, by comparison, was effusive in her praise of Warren, the pride of many liberals because of her commitment to take on Wall Street and big banks. Clinton labeled Warren ""the passionate champion for working people and middle class families.""

Compare what Warren said about Clinton with how other members of the Senate have introduced Clinton recently. ""Hillary is a hero to me and too so many others,"" said Sen. Al Franken at an event with Clinton on Thursday. ""People admire Hillary because she spent her life fighting for economic and social justice."" Franken then made the praise personal: ""And I would add she is funny. By the way, I am not saying that because I want to pay her a nice compliment. I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it. ... Hillary is truly, truly funny."" Sen. Mark Udall, who is running for reelection in Colorado, all but endorsed Clinton for president earlier this week while introducing her. ""We hope she is going to come back over the next few years,"" he said to a roaring crowd, before touting Clinton's record of fighting for workers ""all over the world."" Clinton struck a populist tone during her appearance with Warren and Coakley. She spoke about trickle down economics, telling the audience that the concept ""should be confined to the trashbin of history."" ""Don't let anybody tell you that raising the minimum wage will kill jobs,"" Clinton said. ""Don't let anybody tell you that it's corporations and businesses that create jobs."" Clinton was in Massachusetts for her first event of a busy day in the Northeast.

"Salvation Army bell-ringers are a familiar ornament outside local retailers during the holiday season, but over the past month it hasn't been the rings from their bells that are catching people's ears. ""Wedding rings seem to be the token item this year for donations,"" said Haven Sink, director of public relations for the Salvation Army in Wake County, North Carolina. A wave of wedding ring donations has hit the Salvation Army's Red Kettle campaign this year, with seven separate instances of ring donations reported over the past month, according to the organization. ""It's very curious,"" said Jennifer Byrd, national public relations director for the Salvation Army. ""Maybe some of these rings came from marriages that didn't work out and they just wanted to do something positive with them?"" On Friday, a diamond ring was donated at a Goffstown, New Hampshire, kettle, one of three rings generously deposited by the same donor. ""I was overwhelmed,"" said Salvation Army organizer Debbie Urella, upon finding a third ring in a red bucket. ""I know who donated the rings. We've helped her in the past and she wanted to repay us."" The donor chose to remain anonymous. Urella plans to have the rings appraised after Christmas. The phenomenon has hit other parts of the country as well. Wedding bands have turned up at the bottom of red kettles in two cities in Florida, in Raleigh, North Carolina, in Shawnee, Kansas, and in Spokane, Washington, where a diamond ring worth $5,000 was wrapped in a dollar bill. ""I think people know that when they give something to the Salvation Army they trust the organization will do the most good with it,"" Byrd said.

"A  compounding pharmacy at the center of a fungal meningitis outbreak last year has agreed to a preliminary settlement that would create a $100 million fund for victims. The fund will also be used to pay off creditors of the bankrupt New England Compounding Center, attorneys in the case said. A judge will have to approve the plan before it goes into effect. The nationwide meningitis outbreak was linked to steroid injections distributed by the Massachusetts-based pharmacy. More than 700 illnesses and 64 deaths in 20 states were blamed on the injections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But the CDC noted the deaths are from ""all causes among persons who meet the case definition and . The pharmacy's owners said they deny any liability or wrongdoing, but want to play a major role in establishing a fund for those who died or suffered ""as a result of this tragic outbreak,"" according to a statement announcing the settlement. Paul Moore, a trustee of the bankrupt pharmacy, supported the preliminary settlement agreement. ""We are pleased that a significant amount of funds will become available for distribution to victims and their families as compensation for the deaths, injuries and suffering they endured as a result of this tragic meningitis outbreak,"" Moore said. The settlement amount would be funded by cash from the pharmacy's owners as well as other sources, such as insurance, tax refunds and the sale of a related business. Ripple effect .

Following the outbreak, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said it launched ""a series of aggressive initiatives"" aimed at preventing a recurrence.

"When your city has an unenviable reputation for insulting tourists and fleecing them for every cent, inviting hotel guests to pay what they want could be a risky move. That's the experiment being tested by several hotels in the French capital during the height of the summer season. ""It's something like a trust contract between the client and the hotel,"" says Aldric Duval, who came up with the ""Payez ce que vous voulez"" (Pay what you want) concept as a gimmick to promote Tour d'Auvergne, his three-star hotel in the city's Opera district. Duval has recruited four other city center hotels, variously rated with three and four stars, to the scheme which runs from July 21 to August 10. He tells CNN he struck on the idea after successfully running an honesty bar that left it up to guests to declare their booze consumption at check-out. In the City of Light, it seems hotel guests are not generally light fingered. Allowing them to choose their own room rates -- instead of paying typical charges of about $250 -- will not only bring in the punters, but will also give the hotel valuable feed back, he adds. ""We put guests at the heart of the system and we transform them into a mystery customer. They will look at the hotel with a new eye and if they play true in this game, it can work."" If guests decide their stay is barely worth a dollar -- or euro, this being Paris -- then it could it could also wind up being an embarrassing financial disaster. Duval doesn't think so. Friendlier to tourists . ""If the client wants to pay one euro, there's nothing I can do, but people will know that this approach is not a good deal, we'll explain it's not fair if they pay one euro."" ""We could have run a promotion offering free rooms to the first 15 people to answer a question on our Website, but we've decided to do this instead."" Duval says the scheme has attracted interest from other hotels in Paris and elsewhere in France, with several in Cannes and Nice planning similar deals for the winter low season. The pay-what-you-want scheme follows recent comments by France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, that the country needs to be friendlier and more accommodating to visitors if it want to protect an annual tourism income of $16 billion. Duval said his scheme wasn't a response to this and complained that the government should be doing more to help hoteliers during tough economic times. ""To be friendly to the tourists Laurent Fabius must cut the hotel taxes and charges, then Paris will be better and more attractive and not so expensive."" It's unlikely, however, that Fabius will let them set their own tax rates. What would you pay if you could choose your room rate?

"Along a pastoral lane at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate sits a sizable wooden pen built specifically to house the two turkeys that will be ""pardoned"" at the White House on Wednesday. The well-appointed pen includes a small coop to protect them from weather and foxes, and an area for them to strut their stuff for camera-toting tourists. But there is one thing that is missing: other turkeys. That's because all the turkeys ever pardoned at the White House are dead, including the six already given a pass from the roasting pan by President Barack Obama in previous years. John Boehner, king of the turkey brine? ""The bird is bred for the table, not for longevity,"" said Dean Norton, the director at Mount Vernon in charge of livestock. ""Some of [the pardoned turkeys] have been pretty short lived."" Compared to domesticated animals,  turkeys bred for consumption are usually plump and slaughtered after a period of months, and wouldn't be expected to live much longer on their own. So, a pardon really can extend their lives a lot, relatively speaking. The two turkeys pardoned in 2012 - Cobbler and Gobbler - died within a year of their White House appearance, despite what a spokeswoman at Mount Vernon said was diligent veterinary care. Gobbler died on February 5, 2013, of natural causes. Cobbler lived a bit longer, dying on August 22, 2013, after he fell ill and had to be euthanized. Both are buried at Mount Vernon. In the two years prior, three of the four pardoned turkeys died less than five months after their pardon. The other turkey - Peace, who was pardoned in 2011 - lived 16 months after arriving at Mount Vernon. So why do those birds -- and others bred to be eaten -- die faster than their wild brethren? ""The birds are fed in such a way to increase their weight,"" Norton, who has worked at Mount Vernon since 1969, said. ""[Americans] want a nice big breasted turkey and so they are fed high protein diet and they get quite large. The organs, though, that are in this bird are meant for a smaller bird. They just can't handle the extra weight, so they end up living not as long [as wild turkeys]."" The differences extend beyond life expectancy, too. ""Your native bird can fly beautifully and roost in trees,"" Norton said, while the type that receive pardons ""does not fly, has very short stubbly legs and typically last right up to Thanksgiving."" How to defrost your turkey . Final years? Figuratively . In 2012, when Obama announced the pardons for Cobbler and Gobbler, he hinted the birds were in their final years, telling the audience that they were headed to Mount Vernon ""where they will spend their twilight years in the storied home of George Washington."" The word ""years,"" however, seems to be an exaggeration. The National Turkey Federation, a group that lobbies for the turkey industry and selects those to be honored each year at the White House, disagrees with any notion that the lives of these birds are cut short. They are bred for consumption have a ""life expectancy of about 18 weeks,"" said Keith Williams, spokesman for the turkey federation. ""They are not raised as pets and animals are not pets."" Their short lives, Williams points out, says more about Americans taste for turkey and breeding practices than mistreatment or short lives. Thanksgiving tips and recipes . Bred to be stuffed . Starting in 1960, farmers specifically started breeding plump turkeys that had large amounts of white breast meat -- a response to American demand. The differences between wild and bred turkeys, Williams said, stems mostly from diet. ""A turkey that is bred exclusively for eating, eats corn and soybean that have minerals in them,"" Williams said. According to the federation, a whopping 219 million turkeys were consumed in the United States in 2011. On Thanksgiving that year, the group estimates 46 million were gobbled up. Since 1970, around the time breeding practices changed, turkey consumption has increased 104 percent, according to the federation. The practice of pardoning a turkey at the White House dates to Abraham Lincoln. The story goes that around Thanksgiving, turkeys were brought to the White House and Lincoln's son, Tad, grew attached to one particular bird and begged his chief executive father to spare the fowl from the table. Lincoln agreed and the turkey lived. It is unclear if the practice continued for the next 100 years. But in 1963, President John F. Kennedy decided to send his turkey back to the farm it came from, telling the National Turkey Federation they should ""just let this one grow"" instead. Bush ""41"" sent them to Frying Pan Park . The tradition became official in 1989, under President George H.W. Bush. On November 14, weeks before Thanksgiving, Bush pardoned a turkey and the White House shipped him off to live his twilight year at -- Frying Pan Park -- in Herndon, Virginia. Since then, a President has pardoned a turkey each year. All of Obama's turkeys were sent to Mount Vernon. The birds spent the holidays in the public pen and then were moved to a livestock area out of view because they were not ""historically accurate"" to Washington's time period. According to Norton, the turkey federation wanted the birds to be more prominently displayed. So this year, they will head to Morven Park, a historic estate in Leesburg, Virginia, on January 7. The estate was home to Former Virginia Gov. Westmoreland Davis, who ran it  from 1918 to 1922. Davis was a prodigious turkey farmer, according to Teresa Davenport, a spokeswoman for Morven Park. As for the near certainty that the turkeys will soon die, Davenport said they ""are going to do everything [they] can to make that not happen."" ""These turkeys were raised in Minnesota, so they are used to cold winters,"" Davenport said. ""A lot of the employees here are already on turkey duty.""","Each year, an American president ""pardons"" a turkey or two just before Thanksgiving .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations' Human Rights Council concluded Wednesday that Israeli forces committed serious violations of international law when they conducted a mid-sea interception of a humanitarian aid flotilla in an incident that left nine people dead. ""The fact-finding mission concluded that a series of violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, were committed by the Israeli forces,"" said the 56-page report. The report described the circumstances of the deaths of ""at least six of the passengers"" as being ""consistent with ... an arbitrary and summary execution."" Israel has maintained its troops used force on the activists in May after they were attacked by those on board one boat. Soldiers were attacked with knives, metal poles and other objects, Israeli officials have said. But passengers on board the boat insist Israeli troops fired on them without provocation. ""The report published today is as biased and as one-sided as the body that has produced it,"" the Israeli government said. ""Israel, therefore, is of the opinion that the flotilla incident is amply and sufficiently investigated as it is. All additional dealing with this issue is superfluous and unproductive."" But Israel on Wednesday said it was conducting its own investigation and will participate in a panel of inquiry called by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The Human Rights Council, which indicated it spoke with more than 100 witnesses, said Israeli troops ""demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence"" against flotilla passengers during the May 31 interception. It said there was also evidence of wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment and injury that would warrant prosecution within the Fourth Geneva Convention. ""The Mission is satisfied not only that the flotilla presented no imminent threat but that the interception was motivated by concerns about the possible propaganda victory that might be claimed by the organizers of the flotilla,"" the council's fact-finding mission declared. After Israeli forces landed on one vessel, a struggle for control of the ship began. Israeli forces fired at wounded people and killed several people who posed no threat, the report said. ""The circumstances of the killing of at least six of the passengers were in a manner consistent with an extra-legal, arbitrary and summary execution,"" it added. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has said that Israel went to great diplomatic lengths to stop the flotilla heading to the Palestinian territory of Gaza, and when that didn't work, it considered the implications of the use of force and weighed the possibility of simply letting the flotilla through. In the end, Israel made the right decision, Barak said recently in testimony before an Israeli commission looking into the incident. The incident left a wide-ranging military and diplomatic alliance between the Jewish state and Turkey, its powerful regional ally, badly shaken. The flotilla departed from Turkey.","Nine people were killed during interception of flotilla bound for Gaza .

"(CNN) -- Columbus Day often brings to mind the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. This Monday, some cities and states would rather you think of the Sioux, the Suquamish and the Chippewa. For the first time this year, Seattle and Minneapolis will recognize the second Monday in October as ""Indigenous People's Day."" The cities join a growing list of jurisdictions choosing to shift the holiday's focus from Christopher Columbus to the people he encountered in the New World and their modern-day descendants. The Seattle City Council voted last week to reinvent the holiday to celebrate ""the thriving cultures and values of Indigenous Peoples in our region."" The Minneapolis City Council approved a similar measure in April ""to reflect upon the ongoing struggles of Indigenous people on this land, and to celebrate the thriving culture and value that Dakota, Ojibwa and other indigenous nations add to our city."" The Seattle School Board followed suit along with Portland Public Schools, where officials say Indigenous People's Day will not replace Columbus Day but supplement it. Schools across the country have been working for years to clarify Columbus' role in history.

The Italian explorer and his namesake holiday have long been controversial. Despite what American schoolchildren may have learned about when ""Columbus sailed the ocean blue,"" supporters of Indigenous People's Day believe Columbus should not be celebrated for ""discovering"" America. Indigenous people had been living in the ""New World"" for centuries by the time he arrived, and his voyages established lasting connections between Europe and Americans that paved the way for its colonization, leading to the subjugation and decimation of the indigenous population. ""Learning about the history of Columbus and transforming this day into a celebration of indigenous people and a celebration of social justice ... allows us to make a connection between this painful history and the ongoing marginalization, discrimination and poverty that indigenous communities face to this day,"" Seattle Councilmember Kshama Sawant said.

"Whatever the six-woman jury mulling the fate of George Zimmerman decides, the former neighborhood watch volunteer charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin cannot emerge as a winner, according to his defense attorney. Asked Wednesday what kind of life Zimmerman would lead if he were acquitted, Mark O'Mara told CNN's Martin Savidge ""not a good one."" ""He has to live mostly in hiding, he has to protect himself from that periphery that still believe that he's some racist murderer or acted in a bad way,"" O'Mara said. ""I think that he's probably concerned about living in central Florida and never having a normal life, and that's unfortunate. His life will never be the same."" Did investigators blow the Zimmerman case? O'Mara said he had received dozens of e-mails from people ""who are vicious in their hatred for George Zimmerman -- and for me. It's absurd, but they're there. So, I don't know which is the one who's going to walk down the street at the same time George does. They know what he looks like; he doesn't know what they look like."" But O'Mara offered no regrets about having taken on the high-profile, racially charged case in April 2012, two months after the black 17-year-old was shot dead in a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood while returning home one February night wearing a hoodie sweatshirt and carrying nothing more threatening than a bag of Skittles  and a canned soft drink. ""It just seemed like it was perfect for me,"" the lawyer said. ""And you overlay that with the social questions about the case, the racism questions, the way this case is being viewed, even the stand-your-ground law itself, it just met on literally all eight cylinders."" Florida's stand-your-ground law, which allows the use of deadly force by someone facing a reasonable belief of an illegal threat, has also come under scrutiny in the case. What about Martin's right to 'stand his ground'? The defense lawyer said he typically does not even ask his clients -- most of whom ""have done something wrong"" -- whether they are innocent of whatever charge or charges they face. ""It's too personal, in a strange way,"" he said. But that was not the case with Zimmerman. ""Once I learned that George was significantly injured that night, and that he voluntarily complied with all law enforcement requests -- from interviews to voice stress analysis tests to walkthroughs -- I knew that there was something here different than most cases."" He said he regretted that the case has divided the country along racial lines, which would not be erased by the verdict. ""Half of the country is going to be upset with the verdict. It's absurd,"" he said. ""And it's absurd that 75% of the people who were asked about whether or not George Zimmerman could get a fair trial a month before the trial started said no. That should never happen in our country. There shouldn't be 1% of our population who believes that anybody cannot get a fair trial."" Top 10 moments in the Zimmerman trial . Zimmerman's father has accused the counsel of not stating forcefully enough that his son was innocent, but the lawyer defended his actions. ""While I could have gone up to the top of the stairs and screamed his innocence at the top of my lungs, I would have only incensed those very people who I really wanted to do some reaching out to,"" he said. He credited that tack with having lowered the intensity of the public anger that boiled over in the initial stages of the case. ""There are not a lot of people screaming at the top of their lungs any more that George is a racist, and they're not even saying that he's a murderer,"" he said. ""I think people get that he's a non-racist."" O'Mara cited his client's work as a mentor to black children and his having taken a black girl to his prom as evidence of his nonracist beliefs. ""You didn't have to scratch very far below the surface to realize that George Zimmerman is an anti-racist,"" he said. Zimmerman trial: It's about race . O'Mara said he has funded some of the defense work out of his own pocket. ""People still need to be paid,"" he said, ""depositions need to be taken."" While he welcomed donations from the public, most of them in $10 to $100 amounts, he said he has rejected ""a dozen or thereabouts"" donations that came with messages expressing racist points of view. This trial would never have happened -- and Zimmerman would never be the subject of death threats, even if he's acquitted -- if it weren't for the efforts of lawyers for Martin's family, led by Benjamin Crump, contends O'Mara. ""They victimized him,"" the defense lawyer said. ""George Zimmerman was victimized by a publicity campaign to smear him, to call him a racist when he wasn't, and to call him a murderer when he wasn't."" When confronted with these comments Friday night, Crump countered by saying that Zimmerman's team ""seemed to forget that Trayvon Martin was dead, (an) unarmed kid on the ground who his client profiled, followed, pursued and shot in the heart."" ""They had ... a confessed killer, and they weren't going to arrest him,"" Crump told CNN's Piers Morgan, adding that he felt compelled to help Martin's parents press the case. ""There's something wrong with that."" On the other side, O'Mara said politics appeared to have affected the way the case was handled by the prosecution. He noted that a special prosecutor was brought in ""when there doesn't seem to be any reason why,"" and that ""most good analysts"" believed the charges filed were ""an abomination."" But he had praise for Judge Debra Nelson, who has overseen the case. ""Even though the rulings did not go our way like I would like them to, she was always well-prepared. She does her case law research, she does her homework,"" he said. ""You mention a case, she knows the case. Those are the signs of a very good judge."" He predicted that justice would ultimately prevail in the form of an acquittal for Zimmerman but acknowledged that the jury deliberation would be a difficult time for him. ""I can't eat, I can't work, I just have to wait, it is the worst thing,"" he said. ""It's sort of like waiting for a child to be born or something. ... I don't think there's anything else you can do."" How long did the juries of other major trials deliberate?","Mark O'Mara says lawyers for Martin's family wrongly ""victimized"" his client .
One of those lawyers it was ""wrong"" Zimmerman wasn't arrested at first .
FIRST ON CNN: Zimmerman's life if acquitted? ""Not a good one,"" defense lawyer says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Another attempted terrorist attack on the United States in coming months is ""certain,"" the heads of major U.S intelligence agencies told a Senate committee Tuesday. Al Qaeda remains the top security threat to the United States, but a growing cyber-security threat also must be addressed by the U.S. intelligence community, the heads of the CIA, the FBI and other agencies told the Senate Intelligence Committee. The hearing covered a range of security issues and became contentious, with Republicans on the committee arguing with Democratic counterparts and the intelligence chiefs on how the Obama administration has handled terrorism suspects such as the failed Christmas Day bomber of a U.S. airliner. Asked by committee chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, of the likelihood of another attempted terror attack on the United States in the next three to six months, the officials agreed with Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair's initial answer of ""certain."" While none of the intelligence chiefs, who included CIA Director Leon Panetta, FBI Director Robert Mueller and others, cited a specific pending threat, their testimony made clear that an evolving al Qaeda remains their top concern. ""My greatest concern, and what keeps me awake at night, is that al Qaeda and its terrorist allies and affiliates could very well attack the United States,"" Panetta said. Al Qaeda is adapting methods to make their plots more difficult to detect, shifting from large attacks with multiple players to using individuals without any background in terrorism, Panetta said. He noted the Christmas Day attempt as an example, saying the suspect had a U.S. visa but little history of involvement with terrorist groups. ""Obviously, they decided to make use of someone like that within a very short period of time"" of the suspect coming into contact with al Qaeda, Panetta said. Blair also said that deciding whether to prosecute terrorist suspects in a criminal court or by a military commission should be decided on a case-by-case basis. The question involved the handling of Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the suspect in the failed Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. airliner. Republicans have criticized security officials for charging the suspect in criminal court instead of treating him as an enemy combatant to be prosecuted by a military commission. Sen. Kit Bond, R-Missouri, said it was a mistake for security officials to have read AbdulMutallab his Miranda rights on the night he was arrested, instead of first conducting further interrogation. Blair, however, said the handling of terror suspects requires flexibility to allow for the appropriate response in each case. FBI Director Robert Mueller agreed, saying that providing a suspect with Miranda rights can bring better information than traditional military or intelligence interrogation. Mueller noted that incentive agreements with suspects have many times resulted in gaining ""actionable intelligence"" that otherwise might never have come forward. Republican Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine and James Risch of Idaho, asked why AbdulMutallab was read his Miranda rights so quickly. Mueller said the decision must be considered in the context of the full investigation. ""You're looking at it through the rear-view mirror,"" Mueller said. ""Do not discount what has happened or what does happen after that in terms of gaining intelligence."" Later Tuesday, a law enforcement official told CNN AbdulMutallab had been talking to investigators since last week and providing useful, current and actionable intelligence -- leads that the FBI and intelligence officials have been actively following up. The official was not authorized to speak for attribution because the case remains under investigation. Mueller said none of the intelligence chiefs at Tuesday's hearing were consulted about the decision to read AbdulMutallab his Miranda rights. That decision was made by the chief security interrogator at the scene in consultation with the Department of Justice, Mueller said. The discussion included a harsh exchange among committee members, with Democratic Sens. Feinstein, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island accusing Republican Sens. Bond and Orrin Hatch of Utah of politicizing the issue. Feinstein noted the policy of charging terrorists in U.S. criminal courts dates back to the Reagan administration, while Whitehouse called Republican framing of the issue ""fallacious."" Hatch also asked Blair if any evidence showed that President Obama's plan to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility for terrorism suspects would reduce the terrorist threat against the United States. Hatch and Bond said they opposed the plan because it would bring terrorism suspects to U.S. soil. Blair responded that Guantanamo has become a major recruiting tool for al Qaeda, setting off an exchange with Hatch that concluded with Blair saying: ""Guantanamo has achieved a sort of mythic quality that helps al Qaeda."" In his written testimony to the committee, Blair said it would take the capture or deaths of al Qaeda's top two leaders -- Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri -- to possibly end the group's intent to attack the United States. On the cyber-security threat, Blair's written testimony described an inability to contend with attacks using computer networks and telecommunications systems. ""Sensitive information is stolen daily from both government and private sector networks, undermining confidence in our information systems, and in the very information these systems were intended to convey,"" Blair wrote. ""We often find persistent, unauthorized, and at times, unattributable presences on exploited networks, the hallmark of an unknown adversary intending to do far more than merely demonstrate skill or mock a vulnerability."" Feinstein agreed with Blair's assessment that the nation was unprepared for the kinds of possible cyber attacks it could face. ""The need to develop an overall cyber-security strategy is very clear,"" Feinstein said.","NEW: Capture of al Qaeda's top leaders needed to possibly end attempts, Dennis Blair says .

"A respiratory virus is sending hundreds of children to hospitals in Missouri and possibly throughout the Midwest and beyond, officials say. The virus causes symptoms like a cold, except worse, and is prompting up to 30 children a day to seek care at one Kansas City hospital, where about 15% of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, officials said. In a sign of a possible regional outbreak, Colorado, Illinois and Ohio are reporting cases with symptoms similar to the same virus and are awaiting testing results, according to officials and CNN affiliates in those states. In Kansas City, about 450 children were recently treated at Children's Mercy Hospital, and at least 60 of them received intensive hospitalization, spokesman Jake Jacobson said. ""It's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care. I would call it unprecedented. I've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics, and I've never seen anything quite like this,"" said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, the hospital's division director for Infectious Diseases. ""We've had to mobilize other providers, doctors, nurses. It's big,"" she said. The Kansas City hospital treats 90% of that area's ill children and noticed an initial spike on August 15, Jackson said. ""It could have taken off right after school started. Our students start back around August 17th, and I think it blew up at that point,"" Jackson said. ""Our peak appears to be between the 21st and the 30th of August. We've seen some leveling of cases at this point."" Full scope unknown . An analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed at least 19 of the Kansas City children tested positive for Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Vaccines for EV-D68 aren't currently available, and there is no specific treatment for infections, the Missouri agency said. ""Many infections will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,"" it said. ""Some people with several respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy."" Some cases of the virus might contribute to death, but none of the Missouri cases resulted in death and no data is available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the United States, the agency said. Symptoms include fever, body and muscles aches, sneezing, coughing and rash, one hospital said. Jackson said physicians in other Midwest states reported cases with similar symptoms. ""The full scope is yet to be known, but it would appear it's in the Midwest.  In our community, meticulous hand-washing is not happening. It's just the nature of kids,"" Jackson said. ""Worst I've seen"" Denver also is seeing a spike in respiratory illnesses resembling the virus, and hospitals have sent specimens for testing to confirm whether it's the same virus, CNN affiliate KUSA said. More than 900 children have gone to Children's Hospital Colorado emergency and urgent care locations since August 18 for treatment of severe respiratory illnesses, including enterovirus and viral infections, hospital spokeswoman Melissa Vizcarra told CNN. Of those, 86 have been sick enough to be admitted to the Aurora facility. And Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children had five children in intensive care and 20 more in the pediatric unit, KUSA said this week. ""This is the worst I've seen in my time here at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children,"" Dr. Raju Meyeppan told the outlet. ""We're going to have a pretty busy winter at this institution and throughout the hospitals of Denver."" Will Cornejo, 13, was among the children in intensive care at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children after he came down with a cold last weekend and then woke up Tuesday night with an asthma attack that couldn't be subsided with his medicine albuterol. His mother, Jennifer, called 911 when her son's breathing became shallow, and her son was airlifted to the Denver hospital, she told KUSA. Her son was put on a breathing tube for 24 hours. ""It was like nothing we've ever seen,"" Jennifer Cornejo told KUSA. ""He was unresponsive. He was laying on the couch. He couldn't speak to me. He was turning white and his lips turned blue. ""We're having a hard time believing that it really happened,"" she added. ""We're much better now because he is breathing on his own. We're on the mend."" Restricting kids' visits with patients . In East Columbus, Ohio, Nationwide Children's Hospital saw a 20% increase in patients with respiratory illnesses last weekend, and Dr. Dennis Cunningham said patient samples are being tested to determine whether EV-D68 is behind the spike, CNN affiliate WTTE said. Elsewhere, Hannibal Regional Hospital in Hannibal, Missouri, reported ""recent outbreaks of enterovirus infections in Missouri and Illinois,"" the facility said this week on its Facebook page. Blessing Hospital in Quincy, Illinois, saw more than 70 children with respiratory issues last weekend, and seven of them were admitted, CNN affiliate WGEM reported. The hospital's Dr. Robert Merrick believes that the same virus that hit Kansas City is causing the rash of illnesses seen at the Quincy and Hannibal hospitals, which both imposed restrictions this week on children visiting patients, the affiliate said. ""Mostly we're concerned about them bringing it in to a vulnerable patient. We don't feel that the hospital is more dangerous to any other person at this time,"" Merrick told WGEM. Blessing Hospital is working with Illinois health officials to identify the virus, the hospital said in a statement. While there are more than 100 types of enteroviruses causing up to 15 million U.S. infections annually, EV-D68 infections occur less commonly, the Missouri health agency said. Like other enteroviruses, the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people, the agency said. ""Unlike the majority of enteroviruses that cause a clinical disease manifesting as a mild upper respiratory illness, febrile rash illness, or neurologic illness (such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis), EV-D68 has been associated almost exclusively with respiratory disease,"" the agency said. Clusters of the virus have struck Asia, Europe and the United States from 2008 to 2010, and the infection caused relatively mild to severe illness, with some intensive care and mechanical ventilation, the health agency said. To reduce the risk of infection, individuals should wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after changing diapers, avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid kissing, hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick; disinfect frequently-touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs; and stay home when feeling sick, the Missouri agency said.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- As Libya entered its fourth week of bloody clashes Tuesday, there was little doubt that the situation had turned into all-out civil war. Rebels have seized several cities from government control and the army has fiercely fought to reclaim some of them. Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000. Thousands more have fled the country, prompting a human rights group to once again urge both sides to allow humanitarian aid in. ""Both the Libyan government and opposition forces need to allow unhindered access for aid organizations to assist civilians,"" Bill Frelick, refugee program director at Human Rights Watch said Tuesday. ""People living in areas of heavy fighting in western Libya are now in dire need of medical aid and other assistance."" Late Monday night, the Gulf Cooperation Council said Libya had rejected its offer of humanitarian aid. The council is comprised of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf, launching aerial strikes Monday to crush the uprising against him. Gadhafi's aerial forces targeted the main road heading into the oil town after launching another air strike earlier, five kilometers (3.1 miles) southeast of the city. The opposition fired anti-aircraft guns in response. The protests against Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought the ouster of the 68-year-old Gadhafi who has ruled for nearly 42 years of rule. It started as the kind of revolution that swept neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, but since then the uprising has turned into warfare. And as reports continue to emerge of the government's use of force against civilians, the international community has been left pondering strategies on how to end the violence. Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France, Britain, and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya, diplomatic sources at the United Nations said. And the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday night they supported such an action. But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China, two permanent members of the council that wield veto power. U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he had a ""very clear message to those who are around Col. Gadhafi."" ""It is their choice to make how they operate moving forward and they will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there,"" he said. NATO said it has begun around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya. ""We've got NATO as we speak consulting in Brussels around a wide range of potential options, including potential military options,"" Obama added. With no clear end to the deadly clashes in sight, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli. The fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya, with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave. About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, the U.N. refugee agency has said. But between 15,000 and 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border. Of those left, the majority are from Bangladesh, the U.N. refugee agency said. The group plans to start running chartered flights to there Tuesday. A man who said he was trapped in Misrata, a city east of Tripoli that has seen heavy clashes, said the rebels were running out of weapons -- but will continue to fight. ""Maybe tomorrow I'll still be alive, i don't know. I have nothing to lose,"" the man said. ""Nobody believes he will be alive tomorrow. Nobody knows. We need support.""

"(CNN) -- Robin Williams will undergo heart surgery, according to his publicist. Actor-comedian Robin Williams was on an 80-city tour for his one-man show. The 57-year-old actor and comedian postponed his one-man show tour and entered a hospital for testing this week after suffering a shortness of breath. Williams will undergo an aortic valve replacement, the publicist said. ""I'm so touched by everyone's support and well wishes,"" Williams said in a statement. ""This tour has been amazing fun and I can't wait to get back out on the road after a little tune-up."" The publicist would not say when or where the surgery will take place. The surgery is similar to the procedure former first lady Barbara Bush underwent Wednesday. Bush's surgeon, Dr. Gerald Lawrie, described it as ""a very routine procedure"" from the doctors' perspective. Williams was in the middle of an 80-city tour of his ""Weapons of Self-Destruction"" show, which is expected to resume in the fall, the publicist said. His Web site says the shows ""highlight Williams' trademark free associations and riffs on social and political absurdities."" Williams rose to fame in the mid-1970s as the childlike alien Mork, who first appeared on an episode of ""Happy Days"" and then was spun off into his own show, ""Mork and Mindy."" His manic standup comedy, combining impersonations, commentary, jokes and nonsense in high-speed profusion, was and remains his trademark.  View a timeline of Williams' life and career ¬ª . Williams began his movie career with 1980's ""Popeye,"" but succeeding films, such as 1982's ""The World According to Garp"" and 1984's ""Moscow on the Hudson,"" countered his wild standup persona with quiet, pensive performances. (The performer had attended New York's famed Juilliard School to study drama in the 1970s, where one of his classmates was Christopher Reeve.) It wasn't until 1987's ""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" which managed to combine Williams' frenzied comedy style with more sober drama, that he broke through as a film star. He was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of ""Vietnam's"" DJ Adrian Cronauer. Other Williams films include ""Awakenings"" (1990), ""The Fisher King"" (1991), ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (1993), ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) and ""Insomnia"" (2002). He won a best supporting actor Oscar for ""Good Will Hunting."" Williams has been active in charitable endeavors, most notably the Comic Relief program, which raises money for various causes. Williams' current heart problems aren't the first time he's coped with health issues. In August 2006, the comedian and actor checked himself into an alcohol rehab center.

"David Kwiatkowski, a hospital worker accused of causing a multi-state outbreak of hepatitis C last year, will plead guilty to all 14 charges in exchange for a prison term of 30 to 40 years. Kwiatkowski agreed to plead guilty to seven counts of tampering with a consumer product and seven counts of obtaining controlled substances by fraud, according to a plea agreement filed Monday. The outbreak sickened 30 people with hepatitis C, a sometimes-fatal virus that attacks the liver. How did this happen? Ten months after he was diagnosed with hepatitis C, Kwiatkowski began working at New Hampshire's Exeter Hospital in April 2011. Investigators said Kwiatkowski stole syringes of the painkiller fentanyl from patients who were scheduled for surgery. ""Kwiatkowski used the stolen syringes to inject himself, causing them to become tainted with his infected blood, before filling them with saline and then replacing them for use in the medical procedure,"" the U.S. attorney's office in Concord, New Hampshire, said in a statement. ""Consequently, instead of receiving the prescribed dose of fentanyl, patients instead received saline tainted by Kwiatkowski's infected blood."" According to the plea agreement, Kwiatkowski told an investigator, ""I'm going to kill a lot of people out of this."" Group: We had no evidence to punish man accused in case . Offenses across the country . Before moving to New Hampshire, Kwiatkowski worked as a traveling medical technician for hospitals in Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania, officials in those states said. ""The defendant admitted that he diverted drugs in a similar way at Houston Medical Center in Georgia and Hays Medical Center in Kansas,"" the plea agreement states. ""He estimated that he swapped syringes at least 20 times in Kansas and approximately 30 times in Georgia. But if a New Hampshire court accepts Kwiatkowski's plea deal, he can avoid federal criminal charges in Kansas, Maryland and Georgia, the plea agreement states. Controversy surrounds health care contract workers . Fired in Arizona . Kwiatkowski was fired from an Arizona hospital in 2010 after a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's room with a syringe floating in the toilet, according to documents obtained by CNN. A spokeswoman for the Arizona Heart Hospital said Kwiatkowski was immediately fired, and he relinquished his license as a radiologic technologist. The agency that placed Kwiatkowski in the Arizona job had reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, according to a spokeswoman for the agency, Springboard, Inc. But a few weeks later, he was working at Temple University Hospital in Pennsylvania, and then went on to work in Kansas and Georgia before moving to New Hampshire.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Humane Society of the United States released a video Wednesday it says shows mistreatment of ""downed"" cows at a California slaughterhouse -- and one lawmaker said it raises questions about the safety of the nation's food supply. The Humane Society says the video was shot last year by an undercover investigator. The video shows Hallmark Meat Packing Co. workers administering repeated electric shocks to downed cows -- animals that are too sick, weak or otherwise unable to stand on their own. Workers are seen kicking cows, jabbing them near their eyes, ramming them with a forklift and shooting high-intensity water up their noses in an effort to force them to their feet for slaughter. The society says the video was shot last year by an undercover investigator who wore a hidden camera under his clothes when he worked at the facility. Hallmark Meat Packing Co., based in Chino, California, sells beef to its sister company, Westland Meat, which distributes it to various federal programs, including the National School Lunch Program.  Watch the video of cows being abused ¬ª . Downed cows are more easily contaminated and may carry diseases harmful to consumers. U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations prohibit allowing disabled or contaminated animals into the food supply. Officials said they would investigate. ""This must serve as a five-alarm call to action for Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,"" said Wayne Pacelle, Humane Society president. ""Our government simply must act quickly both to guarantee the most basic level of humane treatment for farm animals and to protect America's most vulnerable people -- our children, needy families and the elderly -- from the potentially dangerous food."" The Associated Press reported that the Agriculture Department is investigating the possible violation of state and federal laws at the slaughterhouse. Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer said ""appropriate actions will be taken"" if violations are found in the facility, and added there is no evidence the nation's beef supply is at risk. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, sent letters Wednesday to the agriculture secretary and the head of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) asking for an immediate investigation into the safety of ground beef being used in the National School Lunch Program. ""The treatment of animals in this video is appalling, but more than that, it raises significant concerns about the safety of the food being served to our nation's children,"" Durbin said. ""The apparent slaughter of sick and weak animals not only appears to violate USDA regulations, but could be a danger to our nation's food supply."" He called on the USDA to investigate and urged FSIS to act immediately ""to review the safety of the food being used in the school lunch program."" Westland, the second-largest supplier of beef for the National School Lunch Program, was named ""supplier of the year"" in 2004-2005 by the Agriculture Department. It has delivered beef to schools in 36 states. In a written statement, Steve Mendell, president of both Westland and Hallmark, said the company has fired the two employees in the video and suspended their supervisor. ""We are shocked, saddened and sickened by what we have seen today. Operations have been immediately suspended until we can meet with all our employees and be assured these sorts of activities never again happen at our facility,"" he said. The statement did not address whether meat from the sick cows in the video ever entered the food supply. The USDA, in its news release, said it was ""unfortunate"" the Humane Society ""did not present this information to use when these alleged violations occurred in the fall of 2007."" The Humane Society, in its statement, said it had turned the information over to ""California law enforcement officials"" at that time, and ""local authorities asked for extra time before public release of the information.""

"(CNN)Gonzalo is a major hurricane, gaining in strength Tuesday as it pulled away from Puerto Rico and headed toward Bermuda. The hurricane has maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kilometers per hour), and forecasters believe it will grow into a category 4 storm by the time it approaches Bermuda from the southwest. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Gonzalo -- if it stays on its current predicted path -- will remain well east of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands as it moves north over open Atlantic water. There are no hurricane warnings as of Tuesday evening, and the storm is not a threat to the United States, the center said. On Monday, the storm hit the Virgin Islands. Denise Ormaechea, who has lived on St. Martin for 15 years, says she is normally prepared for hurricanes. ""The difference with this one is that it took us by surprise!"" the iReporter said.

"The ill-fated Royal Caribbean cruise ship returned home Wednesday with an ignoble mark. Nearly 700 crew and passengers fell ill aboard the Explorer of the Seas, the highest number of sick people reported on any cruise ship in two decades, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show. At least 630 passengers and 54 cruise workers got sick, but not all at the same time. Some passengers suggested that the outbreak may have been worse than reported. ""They claim there were 600; I think there could have as many as 1,000"" sick people on board, passenger Sal Panto Jr. told CNN. ""Some people I know didn't bother going down to the infirmary. They weren't feeling well, so they went to the state room. They didn't report it."" After the cruise, Kim Waite told CNN that she discovered the scope of the outbreak when she was taken to a makeshift infirmary in a wheelchair and sick passengers were everywhere, vomiting in buckets and bags. She said she waited three hours to be seen. ""I just started crying,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it. I was in shock. Because I thought I was the only one that was sick, and then when you see everyone else sick, it really upsets you even more."" Are cruise ships floating petri dishes? Waite said she was anxious to catch a flight back to London with her husband. The tickets will cost them an additional $2,000 on top of what they paid for the cruise and travel. ""I never wanted to go home so much in my life,"" she said. ""I've had enough. I've never slept so much."" Waite said the ship arrived late on the first day of the cruise, and it appeared that there wasn't sufficient time to clean it. ""The seas were so rough, they shut the doors for 2 days,"" she said. ""We had no air. There was no air, no circulation ... and that's why, I think, we got  ill."" Danielle Banebianco said she was on a honeymoon, but she and her husband spent a couple of days sick. ""We were looking forward to staying warm and being on our honeymoon and enjoying our time together, and we're never gonna get that back,"" she said. Joseph Angelillo told CNN that he became ill, along with his wife,  and they were confined to their cabin for three days, unable to eat. ""That was the last thing we wanted to look it,"" he said of food. ""It was terrible, terrible."" Angelillo said entertainers became sick. Shows were canceled. Some sick passengers refused to admit being ill to avoid being confined to their rooms, he said. ""That happened a lot from what I'm hearing,"" said Angelillo, who sneaked out of his cabin several times for crackers and ginger ale for him and his wife. He added, ""It was atrocious. They tried to do whatever they could do. But once you feel like we were feeling, it wasn't worth it. I doubt if I'll be back."" Angelillo said Royal Caribbean offered sick passengers credit for days they spent confined to their cabins. ""I don't know if I'll ever see the inside of another ship again, while it's in the ocean, put it that way, "" he said. 'I lost five pounds' One passenger was seen being put on a stretcher and taken to ambulance, but the cruise line said in a statement that he was transported to a hospital for a ""reason unrelated to norovirus,"" a common cause of gastroenteritis, which produces vomiting and diarrhea. ""Best cruise of my life,"" one passenger joked as he left the ship. ""I lost five pounds."" Before the ship arrived at port in Bayonne, New Jersey, one frustrated passenger voiced her displeasure with the experience. Passengers disembarked in northern New Jersey shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday, with some set to stay in area hotels until they can catch flights back home -- days before the Super Bowl will be played there. ""Are we bringing this virus off the ship with us?"" asked Shannon Blace, a passenger from Toronto who was traveling with a party of 12 people -- 10 of whom have been sick. ""We're all going to hotels all over the New York area. Will we be spreading the virus to the Super Bowl this weekend?"" Blace told CNN via telephone that she was upset and felt as if she had spent a week on a floating prison. ""It's just been a big nightmare,"" she said. ""It feels like (Royal Caribbean) never had a contingency plan in place to handle an epidemic on the ship."" Blace said it was evident early on that many people were sick. She felt the ship should have been turned around. ""On Wednesday night, I was in the dining room and a woman was vomiting into her napkin,"" she said. ""There were people walking around in their pajamas with vomit and diarrhea on them. People were barfing all over the place."" Not all passengers, however, were dissatisfied. ""We had a wonderful cruise, and they were very nice,"" said Margery Feinstein . On Sunday, five stool samples were sent from the ship to the CDC in Atlanta, where the samples were expected to arrive the next day, CDC sources told CNN. But the arrival of the samples has been delayed because of paperwork issues and the bad weather in the Southeast. In a statement Wednesday, Royal Caribbean said the entire ship will undergo a ""thorough 'barrier' sanitization program ... to make certain that any remaining traces of the illness are eliminated."" ""It will be the third aggressive sanitizing procedure the ship has undertaken since we became aware of the issue, and will additionally provide a window of more than 24 hours where there are no persons aboard the ship, which is a significant help,"" the statement said. The ship had 3,071 passengers and 1,165 crew members, according to the CDC. No official cause for illnesses, but norovirus possible . Explorer of the Seas departed Cape Liberty, New Jersey, on January 21 for what would have been a 10-day cruise. Passengers and crew developed symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. CDC officials boarded the ship in St. Thomas on Sunday to study the outbreak and the response on the voyage back to Cape Liberty. The cause of the illness was not clear, though the symptoms are consistent with norovirus, the cruise line said. Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis, which produces vomiting and diarrhea. ""The number of reported new cases of gastrointestinal illness has dropped sharply after a spike in the first days of the cruise, and most guests who fell ill are up and about,"" the cruise line said Monday. ""The drop in new cases is encouraging. However, it is not unusual in an outbreak to still have smaller, secondary spikes. That is why, after discussions with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our medical team, we decided the most prudent course for the health of our guests and crew was to bring the cruise home on Wednesday, two days earlier than planned."" The company said all passengers would get a 50% refund and a 50% credit for a future cruise. Those passengers who were ordered quarantined to their rooms will get an additional credit of one future cruise day for each day in confinement, it said. ""Guests scheduled for the next cruise on Explorer of the Seas can be confident that all possible measures will have been taken to prevent further problems,"" it added.

"Calling it a ""cost of war,"" Republican and Democratic leaders announced a $17 billion compromise bill Monday that would get veterans to a doctor more quickly, hire more medical staff, add dozens of new facilities and cut bonuses at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As it aims to reshape medical care for veterans, the proposal also would plump up the deficit, adding $12 billion in red ink. The bill was hashed out over months and unveiled by the chairmen of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees after a weekend of negotiations. The deal would pour spending into both short- and long-term programs for the struggling VA. That money comprises: . ‚Ä¢ Roughly $2 billion to lease 27 new medical facilities; . ‚Ä¢ $5 billion for hiring doctors and nurses and some construction; . ‚Ä¢ And $10 billion to go to a new program allowing veterans to seek outside care if they wait longer than 30 days for an appointment or live more than 40 miles away from a VA hospital. More than a funding bill, this deal also gives the veterans secretary unprecedented power to quickly fire executives at the agency. Anyone fired under that provision would have a week to appeal the decision and the case must be decided within 21 days or the person's firing goes into effect. That agreement merged Democrats' insistence on an appeals process with Republicans demand for fast consequences. ""It is compromise legislation,"" said Senate Veterans Affairs Chairman Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, ""(There) was give and take on both sides."" That includes the price tag, which is handled with a combination of emergency spending (as Democrats hoped) and offsets (as Republicans wanted). Bad VA care may have killed more than 1,000 veterans, senator's report says . Specifically, lawmakers would offset some $5 billion of the spending by forcing other changes at the VA, including what will amount to a cap on staff bonuses at the agency. But after those cost cuts at the VA, the deal would add approximately $12 billion to the federal deficit. That's usually something that Republicans would block, but the two leaders behind the bill argue this issue deserves what they call emergency spending. ""Funding our veterans' needs must be considered a cost of war,"" Sanders stressed. The toughest sell may be with spending-skeptic House Republicans. But House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican, insists his fellow conservatives will give the bill the votes it needs. ""I believe it will (pass),"" he told reporters Monday. ""Taking care of veterans is not an inexpensive proposition. And I believe our members understand that."" Republicans may warm up to the increased oversight in the measure, which requires an independent report on VA health care, a commission on access to care and a task force to review the agency's scheduling system. The 130-page bill also contains a host of smaller provisions: it increases incentives for young doctors to work at the VA by doubling the amount of their student loans the agency can repay per year. The deal comes under threat of travel clock, as Congress plans to leave for a five-week break by Friday. Miller and Sanders said they expect both chambers to vote on the legislation this week, though exact scheduling is still under discussion. Veterans waiting longer for cancer care .

"(CNN)""It only takes one virus to get through for a person to be infected,"" explained Dr. John Mascola. This is true of any viral infection, but in this instance, Mascola is referring to HIV and his ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine against the virus. ""It's been so difficult to make an HIV/AIDS vaccine."" Those were the words of many working in HIV vaccine development until the results of a 2009 trial in Thailand surprised everyone. ""The field is energized,"" said Mascola, director of the Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describing the change in atmosphere in the vaccine community. The trial included over 16,000 volunteers and was the largest clinical trial ever conducted for a vaccine against HIV. It was also the first to show any protection at all against infection. Two previously developed vaccines, known as ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX, were used in combination, with the first priming an immune response against HIV and the second used as a booster once the immunity waned. The duo reduced the risk of contracting HIV by 31.2% -- a modest reduction, but it was a start. To date, only four vaccines have made it as far as testing for efficacy to identify their levels of protection against HIV. Only this one showed any protection. ""That trial was pivotal,"" Mascola said. ""Prior to that, it wasn't known whether a vaccine could be possible."" In recent years, there have been parallel findings of an equally pivotal nature in the field of HIV prevention, including the discovery that people regularly taking their antiretroviral treatment reduce their chances of spreading HIV by 96% and that men who are circumcised reduce their risk of becoming infected heterosexually by approximately 60%. Both improved access to antiretrovirals and campaigns to increase male circumcision in high-risk populations have taken place since the discoveries, and although numbers of new infections are falling, they're not falling fast enough. In 2013, there were 35 million people estimated to be living with HIV globally. There were still 2.1 million new infections in 2013, and for every person who began treatment for HIV last year, 1.3 people were newly infected with the lifelong virus, according to UNAIDS. A vaccine remains essential to control the epidemic. A complex beast . Scientists like Mascola have dedicated their careers to finding a vaccine, and their road has been tough due to the inherently complicated nature of the virus, its aptitude for mutating and changing constantly to evade immune attack, and its ability attack the very immune cells that should block it. There are nine subtypes of HIV circulating in different populations around the world, according to the World Health Organization, and once inside the body, the virus can change continuously. ""Within an individual, you have millions of variants,"" explained Dr. Wayne Koff, chief scientific officer for the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. HIV invades the body by attaching to, and killing, CD4 cells in the immune system. These cells are needed to send signals for other cells to generate antibodies against viruses such as HIV, and destroying those enables HIV to cause chronic lifelong infections in those affected. Measles, polio, tetanus, whooping cough -- to name a few -- all have vaccines readily available to protect from their potentially fatal infections. But their biology is seemingly simple in comparison with HIV. ""For the older ones, you identify the virus, either inactivate it or weaken it, and inject it,"" Koff said. ""You trick the body into thinking it is infected with the actual virus, and when you're exposed, you mount a robust immune response."" This is the premise of all vaccines, but the changeability of HIV means the target is constantly changing. A new route is needed, and the true biology of the virus needs to be understood. ""In the case of HIV, the old empirical approach isn't going to work,"" Koff said. Scientists have identified conserved regions of the virus that don't change as readily, making them prime targets for attack by antibodies. When the success of the Thai trial was studied deep down at the molecular level, the protection seemed to come down to attacking some of these conserved regions. Now it's time to step it up. In January, the mild success in Thailand will be applied in South Africa, where over 19% of the adult population is living with HIV. The country is second only to bordering Swaziland for having the highest rates of HIV in the world. ""The Thai vaccine was made for strains (of HIV) circulating in Thailand,"" said Dr. Larry Corey, principal investigator for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, which is leading the next trial in South Africa. The strain, or subtype, in this case was subtype B. ""For South Africa, we've formed a strain with common features to (that) circulating in the population."" This region of the world has subtype C. An additional component, known as an adjuvant, is being added to the mix to stimulate a stronger and hopefully longer-lasting level of immunity. ""We know durability in the Thai trial waned,"" Corey said. If safety trials go well in 2015, larger trials for the protective effect will take place the following year. An ideal vaccine would provide lifelong protection, or at least for a decade, as with the yellow fever vaccine. A broad attack . The excitement now reinvigorating researchers stems not only from a modestly successful trial but from recent successes in the lab and even from HIV patients themselves. Some people with HIV naturally produce antibodies that are effective in attacking the HIV virus in many of its forms. Given the great variability of HIV, any means of attacking these conserved parts of the virus will be treasured and the new found gold comes in the form of these antibodies -- known as ""broadly neutralizing antibodies."" Scientists including Koff set out to identify these antibodies and discover whether they bind to the outer coat of the virus. The outer envelope, or protein coat, of HIV is what the virus uses to attach to, and enter, cells inside the body. These same coat proteins are what vaccine developers would like our antibodies to attack, in order to prevent the virus from entering our cells. ""Broadly neutralizing antibodies"" could hold the key because, as their name suggests, they have a broad remit and can attack many subtypes of HIV. ""We will have found the Achilles heel of HIV,"" Koff said. Out of 1,800 people infected with HIV, Koff and his team found that 10% formed any of these antibodies and just 1% had extremely broad and potent antibodies against HIV.  ""We called them the elite neutralizers,"" he said of the latter group. The problem, however, is that these antibodies form too late, when people are already infected. In fact, they usually only form a while after infection. The goal for vaccine teams is to get the body making these ahead of infection. ""We want the antibodies in advance of exposure to HIV,"" explained Koff. The way to do this goes back to basics: tricking the body into thinking it is infected. ""We can start to make vaccines that are very close mimics of the virus itself,"" Mascola said. Teams at his research center have gained detailed insight into the structure of HIV in recent years, particularly the outer coat, where all the action takes place. Synthesizing just the outer coat of a virus in the lab and injecting this into humans as a vaccine could ""cause enough of an immune response against a range of types of HIV,"" Mascola said. The vaccine would not contain the virus itself, or any of its genetic material, meaning those receiving it have no risk of contracting HIV. But for now, this new area remains just that: new. ""We need results in humans,"" Mascola said. Rounds of development, safety testing and then formal testing in high-risk populations are needed, but if it goes well, ""in 10 years, there could be a first-generation vaccine."" If improved protection is seen in South Africa, a first-generation vaccine could be with us sooner. Making an Impact . When creating vaccines, the desired level of protection is usually 80% to 90%. But the high burden of HIV and potentially beneficial impact of lower levels of protection warrant licensing at a lower percentage. ""Over 50% is worth licensing from a public health perspective,"" Koff said, meaning that despite less shielding from any contact with the HIV virus, even a partially effective vaccine would save many lives over time. The next generations will incorporate further advancements, such as inducing neutralizing antibodies, to try to increase protection up to the 80% or 90% desired. ""That's the history of vaccine research; you develop it over time,"" Corey said. He has worked in the field for over 25 years and has felt the struggle. ""I didn't think it would be this long or this hard ... but it's been interesting,"" he ponders. But there is light at the end of tunnel. Just. ""There has been no virus controlled without a vaccine,"" he concluded when explaining why, despite antiretrovirals, circumcision and increased awareness, the need for a one-off intervention like a vaccine remains strong. ""Most people that transmit it don't even know they have it,"" he said. ""To get that epidemic, to say you've controlled it, requires vaccination.""","In 2009, HIV vaccine trial in Thailand to offered glimmers of hope for a future vaccine .
A modified form of the vaccine is to be tested in South Africa from January .

"The ball is now in Congress' court. Less than one week after President Barack Obama asked Congress for $3.7 billion to address the tens of thousands of immigrant children who have crossed the southern border in recent months, Congress is now tasked with doing something about it. It can pass it, do nothing or craft a new bill. It looks as if the latter approach is the most likely. The path to a solution, however, doesn't appear easy. Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided on both the causes of the problem and the ways to solve it. Republicans appeared on the political talk shows Sunday with a mostly unified message, and their message contrasted starkly with the Democrats' position. Republicans indicated that Obama's request, which includes $1.8 billion to care for the children in U.S. custody, is not going to advance beyond their in-boxes. While they support the allocation of some money, numerous Republicans said Sunday that any money should be ""targeted"" to quickly deport the youths and to beef up border security. Fast deportations . ""We should do targeted appropriations where it's needed to make sure that we are able to detain people and send them back to their countries,"" Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on ABC's ""This Week."" His colleague, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is a member of a group appointed by House Speaker John Boehner to come up with border crisis solutions. He said funding should ""provide more swift removal and return"" to immigrants' Central American countries. Change the law ... A 2008 law that unanimously passed the House and Senate and signed into law by President George W. Bush is prohibiting most of the unaccompanied children from being immediately sent back to their home countries. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Action Act was written to protect young victims of human and sex trafficking. It states that minors must be humanely cared for, united with relatives living in the United States if possible and given a day in court to present their need for asylum. ""We think that law needs to be changed,"" McCaul said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who is considered a moderate voice on immigration and was a leading Republican to help pass comprehensive immigration reform through the Senate last year, said the children must be quickly sent home by the planeload. McCain: Stopping child immigrant nightmare must include returning children, securing border . ""All we need to do is change the act, the Trafficking Victims Prevention Act, to treat these children the same way as we do with Canada and especially Mexico,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" noting that children crossing borders from America's two neighbors can be immediately turned away. ... but don't . But as violence is pandemic in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, the countries from where most of the children are coming, Democrats are reluctant to change the law, as some children are escaping violence and possible death. Many Democrats want to ensure that those who are facing life-threatening situations at home are given the opportunity to stay in the United States. ""I will say this: Follow the law, and the law said that we must put the children's interests first, which is what President Barack Obama is doing,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, agreed. He said the children should be able to make their cases for asylum. ""I think we've got to be care when we consider completely doing away that that law."" But McCaul hinted that he didn't support wiping out the law, just altering it. ""Those (children) with a fear of persecution and violence will have a legal basis to possibly stay,"" he said. Not much time . While McCaul said the border crisis ""demands action"" that should occur ""soon,"" time is slipping away. Congress' monthlong August break is quickly approaching. Boehner last week said he will wait until his self-appointed working group comes up with a proposal before the House moves forward. Coming to agreement in a Congress where the Senate is controlled by Democrats and the House by Republicans is not usually a quick process. While 57,000 immigrant children have entered the U.S. since October, another 30,000 are expected in the next 2¬Ω months. Secure the border . The two sides are also sharply at odds over the issue of border security. Republicans say too little money is in the President's emergency request to protect the border. Of the $3.7 billion request, $433 million would be for Customs and Border Protection, the agency in charge of border security. ""The way to deal with it is to secure the border first,"" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry is leading the Republican charge for additional resources at the border. Perry to Texas reps: Don't approve Obama's border proposal . ""If you have a patient who is bleeding profusely, the first thing you have to do is stop the bleeding, and that's the reason we have been so adamant about securing the border,"" Perry said on ""Face the Nation."" He is calling on Obama to send 1,000 National Guard troops to the border that could ""show the force."" Those troops would be temporary, until an additional 3,000 Border Patrol agents would be permanently placed. ""Gov. Perry's just wrong,"" is Gutierrez's reaction. ""The border is secure; the fact is, the children are handing themselves over to the Border Patrol agents."" McCain said the U.S. needs to spend ""about $6 billion"" to secure the borders. Since 2002, spending on border security has more than doubled. The budget for Customs and Border Protection has ballooned from $5 billion to $12.4 billion in just over a decade, with steady increases each year, according to Homeland Security Department budget documents. The number of Border Patrol agents have also more than doubled. More than 18,611 agents patrolled the southern border in 2013, which comes to about 9.7 agents per mile, according to Customs and Border Protection. But on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Perry insisted that more money needs to be spent. Obama needs to be ""realistic about the problem and how you deal with the problem -- and it is a border security issue.""

"The streets of Ashkelon were half empty when I arrived on a Monday afternoon. The latest war was under way, and Haaretz had just published a critical article I'd written about Israel's air force pilots and the grave consequences of their bombardment of Gaza. I came to this southern Israeli town, not far from Gaza, to chronicle the fear spreading throughout Israeli communities near the border. As a columnist for the country's leading liberal newspaper, I am quite used to people being hostile towards my views, but this was something new. As I arrived in the town center for a live interview with Channel 2, a crowd of people immediately swarmed around me, cursing me with an aggression that I've never seen before. The bullies encircled me, jumping in front of the camera in an attempt to prevent the interview from going on. The show's host cut the broadcast off. The mob hurled insults at me, calling me ""garbage"" and a ""traitor"" and accused me of claiming that Israeli pilots were murderers -- something I never said. As the crowd's anger grew, I rushed to my car and drove out of the town center, the men's screams trailing off as I steered my way out of Ashkelon. But it wasn't just the street mobs. Leading figures in Israel have publically called me a traitor. Yariv Levin, a senior member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party, called on TV for me to be charged with treason during war time. Haaretz has hired a bodyguard to ensure my safety, and my life has been turned upside down by the incident. They haven't succeeded in silencing me. I will continue to write about the brutality of this war, about the atrocities, the mass killing of civilians and the horrifying destruction in Gaza. But I am not the story. The real tale to be told is of the unprecedented cracks in Israeli democracy that have been revealed in just one month of conflict. Years of nationalistic incitement by the Israeli government, of expressions of racism, of anti-democratic legislation, of price-tag actions against Palestinians in the West Bank, without anyone being brought to justice -- all of that intolerance has suddenly exploded in our faces. Anti-war protesters have been assaulted in the streets by right-wing hooligans. People were reportedly fired from their jobs because of critical remarks they made on their private Facebook accounts. And social media was flooded with racist, nationalistic and exceptionally brutal and callous content, which was then spread to tens of thousands of Israelis. Several weeks ago a university professor in Ramat Gan emailed his students to say he hoped that their families, whoever they might be, would be safe during these dark times. This simple act of kindness was enough for the dean of the faculty to try to have the professor apologize to his students, some of whom claimed to have been offended by his words. Failing to make a distinction between the value of Israeli and Palestinian blood is apparently enough to contravene the values of Israeli academia and cause a public scandal in Israel in 2014. B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, was concerned that Israeli media never mentioned the names of the Palestinian victims of Israel's offensive. So they produced a paid advertisement listing the names and ages of some of the children who had been killed in Gaza. But the Israeli broadcasting authority refused to air it, on the grounds that it was ""politically controversial"". The list of examples could go on and on. But the biggest problem is not the marginal extremist who cheers for the killing of Palestinian children in Gaza, or applauds every Israeli bomb that falls on a private residence. The biggest problem is the Israeli mainstream, which spoke with one voice during this war, and which had zero tolerance for any kind of dissent, or even the simplest human compassion with Palestinian sacrifice, suffering and bloodshed. It is all about dehumanization. As long as Israelis don't perceive Palestinians as equal human beings, there will never be a real solution. Unfortunately, dehumanizing the Palestinians has become the best tool to strengthen the occupation, to ignore and deny its crimes and enable the Israelis to live in peace, without any moral dilemmas. If the Palestinians are not human beings, there is no question about human rights. This process climaxed in this war and this is the real basis for the moral blindness which has covered Israel. One of Israel's greatest assets -- as well as the source of its greatest pride -- has been our liberal, democratic and free society. But what we're doing to ourselves now is a greater threat to our existence than Hamas' rockets could ever be. Israel likes to describe itself as ""the only democracy in the Middle East,"" but it's really only a democracy for its Jewish citizens who are quick to fall in line with the mainstream every time Israeli tanks roll across the border. It may not have always been this way, but I fear that this new phenomenon is here to stay. There is no one to stop it. The Israeli media, commercial and free, is collaborating with it; the legal and legislative systems are stepping back, and so is the political system.  We will carry the scars of this summer with us from now on. The people who were too afraid to speak out against Israeli aggression this time around won't be any more likely to stand up next time. Can you think of any worse news out of Israel?","Levy: Unprecedented cracks in Israel's democracy have been revealed after month of Gaza conflict .

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie delivered a special message to fans in a video posted to YouTube: She's got chickenpox. The illness has left her unable to attend the premiere for her newly directed movie ""Unbroken."" It's the second time this week that an image of the actress has made headlines. A photo of her appeared on Wednesday giving a seemingly uncomfortable hug to a movie executive caught up on the Sony Pictures hacking scandal. In the video, Jolie wears a white tank top, and pink spots speckle her face, neck and upper body. ""I just wanted to be clear and honest about why I will be missing the 'Unbroken' events in the next few days, which is that I found out last night that I have chickenpox.

"An exasperated President Barack Obama on Tuesday expressed new surprise and dismay at the lack of congressional action on stemming gun violence, hours after yet another American community was jolted by a deadly school shooting. He said the failure to expand background checks on firearms sales was his ""biggest frustration"" as president, and called on concerned citizens to vent their anger loudly. Obama said it was ""stunning"" Congress couldn't pass laws making it harder to obtain firearms in the aftermath of the 2012 elementary school shooting that devastated Newtown, Connecticut, and stunned the nation. Obama said the violence on that December morning amounted to the ""worst day"" of his presidency. ""Why aren't we doing something about this?"" he asked during an online question-and-answer session on college costs at the White House. ""I will tell you, I have been in Washington for a while now. Most things don't surprise me. The fact that 20 six year olds were gunned down in the most violent fashion possible and this town couldn't do anything about it was stunning to me,"" he said. Obama's remarks came hours after a student opened fire at a high school near Portland, Oregon, killing a classmate before turning the gun on himself. The incident joined a list of dozens of shooting incidents at U.S. schools, campuses and public areas that have taken place since the 2012 Newtown massacre. Just Sunday, two police officers in Nevada were shot and killed while eating lunch. ""The country has to do some soul searching about this,"" he said. ""This is becoming norm."" Ramping up restrictions on gun sales was a top priority of Obama's after Newtown. A bipartisan measure that would have mandated background checks on gun sales failed to pass the Senate the following April, and other proposed measures, like a ban on assault weapons, garnered little support among lawmakers. The failure of it all was seen as a major defeat for the President, who led the nation in mourning for the students and teachers killed in Connecticut. Without congressional support, Obama signed dozens of unilateral executive actions meant to quell gun violence. Though broad action, like banning assault weapons or high capacity magazines, still require congressional approval. On Monday, Obama said the United States was the only developed country on Earth where mass shootings occur with regularity, adding that ""if public opinion does not change, we're not going to change."" And he shot down arguments that mental health was more to blame for mass killings than access to guns. ""The United States does not have a monopoly on crazy people. It's not the only country that has psychosis,"" he said. ""And yet we kill each other in these mass shootings at rates that are exponentially higher than any place else. Well, what's the difference? The difference is that these guys can stack up a bunch of ammunition in their houses and that's sort of par for the course."" Politicians from both parties are ""terrified"" of the National Rifle Association, Obama said, saying the gun rights organization was well-funded and able to influence elections to prevent any significant new gun regulations from becoming law. Late in the day on Capitol Hill, Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer stood before the chamber and could barely get the words out about the violence earlier in the day in his district at Reynolds High School in Troutdale. ""In a scene that is achingly familiar, this morning at Reynolds a shooting occurred, a student killed, the shooter died, a teacher wounded,"" he said. The chamber then observed a moment of silence.

"A series of bomb blasts across Iraq on Monday killed at least 42 people and wounded more than 257 others, police said. The attacks took place in at least six provinces: Baghdad, Anbar, Babel, Kirkuk, Salaheddin Diyala, and Nasriya, police officials across the country told CNN. Two of the bombs exploded at a checkpoint near Baghdad's international airport. Most of the attacks in Baghdad targeted Shiite areas, police told CNN. Al Qaeda in Iraq, made up of Sunni extremists, has claimed responsibility for many attacks in recent months. Attacks elsewhere hit security checkpoints, Shiite areas and political offices.

"The Ebola outbreak ""continues to accelerate"" in West Africa and has killed 1,552 people, the World Health Organization said Thursday. The total number of cases stands at 3,069, with 40% occurring in the past three weeks. ""However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities,"" the WHO said. The outbreak, the deadliest ever, has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with a handful of cases in Nigeria. The overall fatality rate is 52%, the WHO said, ranging from 42% in Sierra Leone to 66% in Guinea. The WHO issued a ""road map"" Thursday that ""responds to the urgent need to dramatically scale up the international response"" in light of the acceleration of new cases, it said. It aims to stop Ebola transmission in affected countries within six to nine months and prevent its spread internationally. The road map prioritizes the setting up of treatment centers, community mobilization and safe burials. It will also try to overcome bottlenecks in vital supplies such as personal protective equipment, disinfectants and body bags. The road map is based on an assumption that ""in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be 2-4 fold higher than that currently reported,"" the document states. It also acknowledges that the total number of cases ""could exceed 20,000 over the course of this emergency."" But such a plan is easier stated than carried out, said the aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres. The road map should not give a false sense of hope, the group's director of operations, Brice de le Vingne, said in a statement. ""A plan needs to be acted upon,"" he said. ""Huge questions remain about who will implement the elements in the plan."" All of the best medical aid organizations have not had the proper setup to respond at the scale needed to seriously make a dent in the Ebola outbreak, he said. ""As an international public health emergency, states with the capacity to help have the responsibility to mobilize resources to the affected countries, rather than watching from the sidelines with a naive hope that the situation will improve,"" he said. Vaccine trials accelerated . An Ebola vaccine being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline will be fast-tracked for human trials, the international consortium behind the effort said Thursday. The experimental vaccine could be given to healthy volunteers in Britain, Gambia and Mali as early as September, according to a statement from the consortium, which provided funding. The vaccine, which does not contain infectious virus material, has showed promise in early tests on primates to protect them from Ebola without significant adverse effects, the statement said. The human trials will begin as soon as ethical and regulatory approvals are granted. Nine things to know about the killer disease . 'Worse than I'd feared' Health workers are paying a heavy price as they care for those struck down by the virus. The WHO said Monday that 120 health care workers have died in the Ebola outbreak, and twice that number have been infected. Public health experts say several factors are to blame, including a shortage of protective gear and improper use of the gear the workers do have. ""It's even worse than I'd feared,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday of the crisis. ""Every day this outbreak goes on, it increases the risk for another export to another country. ""The sooner the world comes together to help Liberia and West Africans, the safer we will all be."" Frieden spoke to CNN's Nima Elbagir in Monrovia, Liberia, where fear and anger over the largest Ebola outbreak on record has grown as health officials put up quarantines around some of the capital city's poorest areas.

"Curtis Reeves Jr., the man charged with second-degree murder for fatally shooting a man inside a Florida movie theater in January, was released from a Florida jail on $150,000 bond Friday. Reeves had been held in the Pasco County jail without bond since he shot and killed 43-year-old Navy veteran Chad Oulson after a confrontation over Oulson's text messaging inside a movie theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel. An appeals court ruled Thursday that ""the record suggests no special circumstances or other factors that would justify a reasoned discretionary decision to deny pretrial release."" On Friday, Judge Pat Siracusa -- who wrote in his ruling that the court was ""hesitant to announce in open court...the specific enumeration of reasons to deny bond,""  -- adopted the appeals court ruling. Siracusa's bond conditions stipulate that the 71-year-old Reeves is allowed to leave his home only to attend church, court dates, medical appointments, and to go to the grocery store.  The former police officer must also ""surrender all firearms in his home to either the Pasco Sheriff's Office or to his lawyer, Richard Escobar,"" according to the order. Escobar said Reeves is ""a wonderful family man"" and ""a church-going man"" who is ""coming home to resume his life and help prepare his defense."" A spokesman for Oulson's wife said the news was a ""difficult pill to swallow."" ""He ripped her family apart and now he can be home, be in his own bed, and see his children and grandchildren,"" said T.J. Grimaldi, Nicole Oulson's attorney. ""It is unbelievably unfair."" Heated argument escalated . The hearing in February that resulted in Reeves initially being denied bond served almost as a mini-trial. Over 12 hours of  testimony was heard over two days from witnesses who had also gone to see ""Lone Survivor"" that day. One patron, Charles Cummings, testified he overheard Reeves and Oulson talking, and at one point, the latter said, ""I'm just texting my 2-year-old daughter."" Soon after that, a ""very agitated"" Reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later. At that point, a fairly calm Oulson asked aloud whether he could check a voice mail from his daughter's babysitter, according to Mark Douglas Turner, a retired Air Force veteran. The situation devolved after more words were exchanged. Alan Hamilton, an off-duty Sumter County Sheriff's corporal, said he heard Oulson say, ""I am trying to text my f**king daughter, if you don't mind."" Popcorn flew in Reeves' direction soon after. ""And almost immediately,"" recalled Turner, who said Oulson threw the bag, ""the gun comes out and there are shots fired."" Escobar said Friday that Reeves ""used the law of self-defense to preserve his life just like every citizen has the right to do,"" and described Oulson's conduct in the theater as violent. But Grimaldi warned Friday that with Reeves back on the street, it could happen again. ""Reeves is an absolute danger to society,"" said Grimaldi.  ""He went from throwing popcorn in someone's face to murdering someone.  This could happen to someone else."" Witness describes shooting .","Curtis Reeves Jr. was released on $150K bond Friday .

"(CNN) -- Others may already be faltering, but Chelsea march on. Jose Mourinho's side continued their impressive early season form with a 6-3 win against Everton in the English Premier League on Saturday. After comfortable wins against Leicester City and Burnley in their opening two league fixtures, the Blues traveled to Goodison Park. Roberto Martinez's side were expected to provide a stern test of Mourinho's newly-modeled side but were ultimately swept aside in a thrilling encounter on Merseyside. The home side's interest in the match threatened to be curtailed inside three minutes as Chelsea raced into a 2-0 lead. Diego Costa struck after just 35 seconds, guiding a low shot underneath Everton keeper Tim Howard with Branislav Ivanovic doubling the lead two minutes later. Everton regrouped and thought they'd pulled one back in the 16th minute when Sylvain Distin turned the ball in after Romelu Lukaku's header had rebounded off the post. But the French defender's effort was ruled offside. The Toffees stuck at it and their perseverance paid off on the stroke of halftime as Seamus Coleman's cross was met by Belgian midfielder Kevin Mirallas who headed past Chelsea keeper and international teammate Thibaut Courtois. Everton started the second half brightly, but Chelsea were soon in control of the match once more when Coleman deflected Eden Hazard's cross into his own net in the 67th minute to make it 3-1. Despondency soon turned to hope again as Everton's Steven Naismith scored two minutes later only for Nemanja Matic to restore Chelsea's two-goal cushion in the 74th minute. Substitute Samuel Eto'o made an immediate impact against his former club with a headed goal to make the score 4-3, before Ramires scored for the visitors again moments later. Diego Costa confirmed the inevitable with his second goal of the match in the 90th minute to cap another good day for his new club. As one Spanish striker beds in at Stamford Bridge another has departed after it was announced that Fernando Torres will join Serie A side AC Milan on a two-year loan deal subject to the 30-year-old passing a medical. Torres has endured a torrid time in London since his √Ç¬£50 million ($83 million) move from Liverpool in 2011 scoring just 20 times in 110 appearances. The unsettled Spaniard leaves an increasingly settled Chelsea side who are now top of the league with nine points from three games. Their main rivals for the title this season have so far endured mixed fortunes with Manchester City the latest to slip up. The Sky Blues slumped to a shock 1-0 defeat to Stoke City earlier on Saturday. Following comfortable wins over Newcastle United and Liverpool, Manuel Pellegrini's side were hot favorites to make light work the Potters who had lost all previous 12 matches at the Etihad Stadium. But it was Stoke who walked away with all three points after Senegal striker Mame Biram Diouf's fine solo effort in the 58th minute settled the game. Stoke's first win of the new campaign lifts them to ninth in the table while City slip to fourth. United still winless . The red side of Manchester will be equally blue this weekend as Louis van Gaal's search for a first Premier League win goes on. Despite fielding new signing Angel Di Maria for the first time, United were unable to break down the defenses of newly promoted Burnley in a game that ended goalless. The result leaves United languishing in 14th place in the table with two points from a possible nine. The lackluster display caps another dismal week for United who suffered a shock exit from the English League Cup in midweek at the hands of MK Dons, a team two divisions below them. There was one bright spot on an otherwise gloomy weekend for United fans with the announcement that Dutch international Daley Blind will join from Ajax, subject to a medical and the defensive midfielder agreeing personal terms, the club said Saturday. In Sunday's matches, Mario Balotelli is expected to make his debut for Liverpool as the Merseysiders take on Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. Arsenal are also in action against Leicester City, while Aston Villa take on Hull City. Bayern held by Schalke . Meanwhile in the Bundesliga, Xabi Alonso made his debut for Bayern Munich but couldn't prevent the German champions from dropping their first points of the season in a 1-1 draw at Schalke. The veteran Spanish midfielder, who joined Pep Guardiola's side from Real Madrid on Friday, played nearly 70 minutes before being substituted, by which time both goals in the game had been scored. Bayern took the lead in the 10th minute courtesy of Robert Lewandowski -- scoring his first goal for his new club since joining from Borussia Dortmund in the summer -- before Schalke picked up their first point of the new season with a 62nd minute equalizer from Benedikt Howedes. The draw leaves Bayern with four points from two games and joint second behind Bayer Leverkusen who continued their perfect start to the season with a 4-2 win over Hertha Berlin. Paderborn, Cologne were also winners on Saturday with the matches between Werder Bremen and Hoffenheim and Wolfsburg and Frankfurt ending in draws. Atletico win in Spain . In La Liga, reigning champions Atletico Madrid picked up their first win of the new season beating new boys Eibar 2-1. Former Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic scored what proved to be his new team's winning goal in the 25th minute following Brazilian center back Miranda's 11th-minute opener. Abraham Minero Fernandez pulled one back for Eibar in the 33rd minute but they couldn't find an equalizer. The result leaves Diego Simeone's side on four points from two games with Barcelona and city rivals Real Madrid both in action on Sunday. The Catalans travel to Villarreal while Real visit Real Sociedad. Serie A kicks off new season . Two matches were played on the opening day of Serie A in Italy on Saturday. Reigning champions Juventus were 1-0 winners at Chievo while last season's runners up were also victorious beating Fiorentina 2-0 at the Stadio Olimpico.","Chelsea maintain 100% start to new English Premier League season .

"(CNN) -- The United States finally claimed a gold medal in figure skating ice dance as Meryl Davis and Charlie White produced a stunning world record display in Sochi on the tenth day of action. Having taken team bronze on day two of the Games, and a silver in Vancouver four years ago, Davis and White saved the best for last as they completed their Olympic medal set. The two-time world champions scored 116.63 points for their free skate, to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's 'Scheherazade', which created an overall total of 195.52 when added to their record display in the short dance on Sunday. ""We're so excited we're kind of in shock a little. I'm not sure what we're feeling. We're kind of in disbelief,"" Davis, 27, told reporters afterwards. ""I've never skated and visualized the performance at the same time and tonight that's kind of how it felt. It felt great."" The U.S. had won 14 figure skating gold medals before, all of which came in either the men's or women's singles. ""17 years of hard work was justified,"" said White, 26, referring to the fact that he first started skating with Davis as a child. ""To come away with a gold medal is amazing."" ""We were well prepared by our coach Marina (Zueva) in coming here and doing our job. I felt like we had done everything we could from the beginning of this competition -- in practice, team event, this event."" Rather unusually, the American duo have the same coach -- Russian-born Zueva -- as the Canadian couple who took silver: 2010 Olympic champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. The quartet even train together in Detroit. ""That was our best performance of the year for that program,"" said Moir. ""We don't know what our plans are for the future from an amateur standpoint. We know we're doing 'Stars on Ice' in the spring!"" To the delight of an enraptured home crowd, Russia's Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katsalapov -- who had already won gold in the team event at Sochi -- won bronze at the Iceberg Skating Palace. MYTH BUSTERS . Yet the host nation was not to be denied in the bobsleigh as Alexander Zubkov and Sochi-born Alexey Voeveda took a historic gold, Russia's first at the Olympics. Having regularly trained in Sochi, the pair set a track record of 56.08 in their third run -- and Zubkov was delighted to have also beaten a different kind of record. For the pilot disproved local belief that whoever carries the flag in the opening ceremony does not win a medal. ""Now you see it's just superstition,"" said the Russian team's flag bearer from ten days ago. Poland took silver in the race, while Steven Holcomb and Steven Langton became the first pair from the U.S. to win a medal in the two-man competition since 1952. ""When we do well in two-man, we typically do well in four-man,"" said Holcomb, who took gold in the four-man four years ago. ""We build momentum."" The medals for the four-man bobsleigh will be decided on Sunday, ahead of the closing ceremony later that night. Meanwhile, Jamaican duo Winston Watts and Marvin Dixon failed to make it into the top 20 of the two-man event and went out after the third run. DOUBLE DELIGHT FOR BELARUS . In many ways, the day belonged to Belarus -- a country of less than 10 million inhabitants that is lying seventh on the medals table, albeit with the same number of golds (five) as second-placed Russia. Three of these have gone to the woman who is now the most successful Olympian in Belarus' history, with Darya Domracheva having also won a bronze in Vancouver 2010. Having triumphed in the 10 km pursuit and the 15 km individual, Domracheva blitzed the field in the women's 12.5 km mass start as well -- spending over half the race skiing alone after opening up a healthy lead by the second lap. She finished 20 seconds ahead of Czech Republic's Gabriela Soukalova, with Tiril Eckhoff of Norway taking bronze. ""It's amazing to be here because I dreamed about it, to be an Olympic champion, from my childhood. But to get three - dreams do come true,"" said the 27-year-old Domracheva. ""Russian family, Belarussian family. All these nations, Russians, Belarussians, we are like brothers and sisters. For me, I feel this country is really native for me."" Soukalova, meanwhile, emulated the feats of her mother, who won a silver medal in cross country at the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo. ""It is one of the best moments of my life,"" the 24-year-old told reporters. ""It's a really big pleasure to win silver here. I hope my mum is happy that I am as successful as her."" There was a double celebration for Belarus as Anton Kushnir ensured that his nation took gold in both the men's and women's freestyle skiing, after compatriot Alla Tsuper's triumph on Friday. Belarus has a proud record in aerials, having won a medal in the men's competition five times in a row while their total tally of three golds is superior to any other nation. Their twin success in Sochi is only the second time that one nation has won both the men's and women's events, with the U.S. previously achieving the feat in 1998. Kushnir's jump in the 'super final' was as supreme in its execution as it was in its ambition and he said he took extra incentive from having his family, including his two-year-old son, watch him in Sochi. ""I am so happy that they came here. It is so great that when I see them I can jump longer and with more power,"" he said. ""Five gold medals is so great for us and all of our country. I am so happy."" David Morris took a shock silver as Australia won its first medal in the men's event, with Zongyang Jia winning bronze for China. TABLE TOPPERS . The fifth and final gold medal of the day went to Germany's ski jumpers in the men's team event. The Germans managed to end an incredible winning streak in the event, with Austria not only having won gold in the last two Olympics but also failing to lose a team large hill event since 2005. They had to settle for silver, while Japan finished third. Germany's success took them to seven golds, two more than their nearest rivals at the top of the medals table. In other action on Monday, the U.S. and Canada beat Sweden and Switzerland respectively to set up their fourth meeting in the final in five Winter Olympics. Originally earmarked for Monday morning, the men's 15 km mass start biathlon final and snowboard cross qualification were postponed to Tuesday because of thick fog.","Davis and White set a world record as they claim a first U.S. gold in ice dance .

"A bloodied but defiant activist -- his face scarred, an ear severely cut, his body ""beaten black and blue"" -- has become the latest symbol of the turmoil in Ukraine, stirring fresh anger in that country and elsewhere as the political standoff drags on. The visibly battered Dmytro Bulatov reappeared Thursday, more than a week after he went missing amid anti-government protests. He told reporters he'd been kidnapped and tortured by his captors -- who, he claimed, ""crucified me"" by piercing his hands -- before being dumped in a forest. Video footage shows blood caked on his head where he said his ear was cut. Bulatov, who organized convoys of motorists as part of the so-called AutoMaidan protest movement, said his abductors -- seemingly unable to grasp that protesters were there on their own free will -- asked him who was funding the effort. Ukrainian protester wants to live in a lawful state . One day later, the uproar over his treatment and that of the opposition built. Much of this anger and pressure was directed at Ukraine's embattled government, even if it hasn't been directly implicated in what happened to Bulatov. Vitali Klitschko -- head of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party and the most high-profile opposition leader -- blasted the activist's treatment as ""an act of intimidation of all active citizens."" ""Many AutoMaidan activists have suffered,"" the former world champion boxer added, noting protesters who've had their cars smashed and been arrested in the unrest. The views from outside Ukraine weren't much kinder. Saying the U.S. government was ""appalled by obvious signs of torture,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said, ""We are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured, as well as by attacks on journalists. Carney added: ""It is especially concerning that some of these reports have suggested the involvement of security forces."" The Interior Ministry is investigating what happened to Bulatov, state news agency Ukrinform reported. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said after meeting Friday with Ukrainian opposition leaders that -- even after all this public, international anger -- she is ""deeply alarmed by the violence and cases of intimidation and torture."" ""I am particularly appalled by the cruel treatment and torture of Dmytro Bulatov and reports that there are attempts to arrest him from his hospital bed,"" she said in a statement. ""This is completely unacceptable and must stop immediately."" Military calls for stability . These comments came as Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych signed into law Friday a bill that would grant amnesty to scores of political prisoners now detained. But it appeared to be a moot move, given that the opposition -- whose allies, theoretically, would be the ones freed -- haven't backed it. They questioned the requirement that protesters vacate seized government buildings and unblock streets before amnesty is granted. In fact, the protesters camped out on the bitter cold streets of the capital, Kiev, didn't budge after the amnesty law went into effect. Their demands, too, haven't changed: for wider constitutional reforms and shifting more power away from the President and onto the Parliament. They have been in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, since November, when the President reversed a decision to sign a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union and turned instead toward Russia. The protests turned violent after Yanukovych's party rammed a controversial anti-protest law through Parliament two weeks ago. At least four protesters and an unknown number of police also have been killed. Thankfully, there have been no repeats of those violent confrontations since last week. On Friday, Ukraine's military forces urged the President to restore stability, saying that a further escalation of the political unrest in the country threatens the Eastern European nation's territorial integrity. Yanukovych must take ""immediate measures to stabilize the situation,""  the country's Defense Ministry said a statement. In an interview with Russian state news agency Itar-Tass on Sunday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Pavel Lebedev said that Ukrainian military forces would not interfere in the country's current political unrest. ""The army will abide strictly by the constitution and laws of Ukraine that set clearly its role, functions and tasks, including use of armed forces,"" Lebedev said. European leaders call for 'immediate dialogue' Yanukovych on Thursday defended his government's handling of the political crisis, saying that it had ""fulfilled all its obligations"" and that opposition leaders were stoking people's anger for their own gain. His office had earlier said he was out on sick leave. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday that the opposition does not have full control of the street protests that have shaken the country. The opposition, he said through a translator, hasn't provided a ""comprehensive pact"" that would satisfy protesters' demands. According to Yushchenko, the opposition is concerned about ""the fight for power,"" but less with ""the strategic course of the country."" Opposition politicians have called for Yanukovych also to stand down, but he has not given any indication he will do so. Speaking at a joint news conference in England on Friday with French President Francois Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron appealed for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. ""We are concerned about the violence in Ukraine. The repeal of restrictions on fundamental freedoms was a step in the right direction, and we urge President Yanukovych to respect his people's wishes and put his country back on a path to a more stable and secure European future,"" Cameron said. ""On Ukraine, we are calling to an immediate dialogue without violence,"" Hollande said.","EU's Ashton calls treatment of tortured activist ""unacceptable""

"Hairatan, Northern Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan visitors pose for photos and pretend to sell each other passenger tickets next to a rusty little locomotive in a shattered corner of the Afghan capital. Built in Germany in 1923, this little engine is all that is left of King Amanullah Khan's effort to modernize Afghanistan by constructing a 7 kilometer-long railroad in downtown Kabul in the 1920s. The locomotive is now a curiosity at the Kabul Museum, standing below the ruins of the former king's battle-scarred palace. For 24-year old Abil Ahmad, it is the first time he has seen a train in Afghanistan. ""It's a very sad symbol,"" says the university student. ""Unfortunately we don't have a train today."" In fact, the first modern railroad in Afghanistan in nearly a century is nearing completion in the north of the country. Construction crews from Uzbekistan are putting the final touches on a brand-new, 75-kilometer long railroad that runs from the Uzbek-Afghan border to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif. An eerie metallic ""whump"" echoes down the rails, as service locomotives and passenger trains carrying work crews and equipment trundle up and down the track. ""Afghanistan is a land-locked country and its economic prospects depend quite a bit on connectivity with its neighbors,"" says Craig Steffensen of Asian Development Bank, which contributed $165 million dollars for construction of the project. ""If we extend the railway across northern Afghanistan it will really be a shot in the arm towards Afghanistan's economic prospects."" Due to poverty, isolation and war, Afghanistan skipped the age of railroads. Afghans went from riding horseback to traveling by car down bone-jarring dirt roads. The country's economy relies on convoys of trucks to ship goods. Steffensen says the new railroad will dramatically increase capacity for freight passing through Hairatan, the main shipping terminal at the Uzbek-Afghan border. Clusters of freshly-painted fuel depot tanks have cropped up in the sands around Hairatan. According to the Asian Development Bank, Hairatan is the biggest transit point in Afghanistan, accepting more than 50 percent of all imports, including more then 80 percent of the country's fuel. The new railroad is part of an ambitious plan to develop a new ""North-South"" trade corridor. Afghanistan has long been economically and politically severed from its northern, former Soviet neighbors. But for the past several years, the U.S. State Department has been promoting the construction of bridges, rail links and pipelines to the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The idea is to eventually link energy-rich Central Asia to energy-hungry South Asia through the war-torn mountains and deserts of Afghanistan. The plan has won support from another major player in the region: China. Last week, the Chinese state mining company China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) signed an agreement with the Afghan government to develop plans to construct a much longer railroad in eastern Afghanistan. MCC estimates the project's initial price tag would be between $6- to $7 billion dollars. The proposed railway would run at least 700 kilometers (434 miles) from the border of Pakistan to Kabul, past the Aynak copper mine south of Kabul. MCC won a tender in 2008 to extract copper from Aynak. The Afghan government is counting on untapped mineral resources to be the main engine for economic growth in coming decades. But officials say new transport infrastructure will be essential for mineral extraction to succeed. ""For the transportation of iron ore or copper you must have a railway line,"" said Wahidullah Shahrani, Afghanistan's minister of mines. Chinese officials say there is another vital element before railroad construction can begin: security. The proposed MCC railroad runs right through heavily-contested Taliban country. ""There really exists a problem of security,"" said MCC president Zou Jianhui, when asked by CNN how he planned to protect the multi-billion dollar railroad. Jianhui said the security environment would be assessed after two years, when the feasibility study for the railroad is expected to be completed. ""If the security situation is getting worse, then of course we will see and discuss with the [Afghan] government how to go ahead with this investment. Definitely the security of the investment, the safety of the investment is very important to the investor,"" he added. Representatives of Uzbekistan's state railway company say they have not encountered a single security incident since the company began construction of the railroad in northern Afghanistan last January. Armies of guards protect the Uzbek work crews. Afghan police have erected guard posts every few kilometers along the railroad. Afghanistan's northern Balkh province, where the railroad is located, is considered to be one of the safer parts of the country. And yet a deadly suicide bombing targeted a NATO military convoy outside the main city of Mazar-e Sharif last week, killing and wounding several Afghan civilian bystanders. Despite the fear of possible sabotage attacks, residents of the rapidly-growing trade hub of Hairatan clearly see hope in the construction of the new railroad. ""This connects Afghanistan to the world,"" says an 18-year-old high school student named Shakrullah. He says he hopes to one day get a job as an engineer for the railroad. ""I want trains for all the provinces of Afghanistan, not just for Balkh province."" Just a few yards away, an Uzbek operator brought a construction locomotive to a squeaking halt, allowing several women dressed in billowing blue burkas to lead their children by hand over the railroad's dusty tracks.","Afghanistan skipped the age of railroads .

"HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- Four Chinese nationals of Uyghur ethnicity who had been held at the U.S. military's Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility have been resettled in Bermuda, officials said Thursday. Attorney General Eric Holder says the U.S. is ""extremely grateful to the government of Bermuda."" ""Above all, this was a humanitarian act,"" Bermudan Premier Ewart Brown told CNN in an interview at his Cabinet office in Hamilton, Bermuda. ""We don't see it as quid pro quo."" The four were twice cleared for release -- once by the Bush administration and again this year, according to a Justice Department statement. They were among 17 Uyghur detainees at the facility set up to hold terror suspects. The four were flown by private plane Wednesday night from Cuba to Bermuda and were accompanied by U.S. and Bermudan representatives as well as their attorneys, according to Susan Baker Manning, part of the men's legal team. President Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility, raising questions of what will happen to the more than 200 remaining detainees. A political backlash against bringing any of the detainees to the United States has increased the focus on sending them to other countries. Brown said he read an article on the issue of the Guantanamo Bay detainees' fates in The Washington Post while he was in Washington for a White House meeting in May. He said he decided to put an offer to the U.S. government ""on the table."" He said Bermuda, a British colony, told London of its intentions, but not until late in the process. Britain must approve the transfer for it to be permanent, Brown said, adding that he believes the issue may raise tension between Bermuda and Britain. The issue is controversial because of China's opposition to the Uyghurs being sent to any country but China. Uyghurs are a Muslim minority from the Xinjiang province of far-west China. The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement. They left Afghanistan after U.S. bombings began in the area in October 2001 and were apprehended in Pakistan, the statement said.  Watch concerns about resettling the Uyghur detainees ¬ª . ""According to available information, these individuals did not travel to Afghanistan with the intent to take any hostile action against the United States,"" the statement said. Manning said the 17 were picked up as a matter of circumstance and never had terrorist training. They left China because they did not agree with the government, she told CNN. However, China alleges the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement -- a group the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization -- that operates in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang. China on Thursday urged the United States to hand over all 17 of the Uyghurs instead of sending them elsewhere. The Chinese statement followed an offer by Palau, a Pacific island nation, to accept the Uyghur detainees. The Xinjiang region of 20 million people is largely populated by ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities who have traditionally opposed Beijing's rule and clamored for greater autonomy. A senior U.S. administration official told CNN the State Department is working on a final agreement with Palau to settle the matter of the 13 remaining Uyghur detainees. Issues to be worked out include how to transfer the Uyghurs to Palau and how much money the United States would give the men for resettlement, the official said. The official said the average in such cases is $100,000 per person. The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities. China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured. Palau said it will take in the ethnic Uyghur detainees for humanitarian reasons and because of the ""special relationship"" between Palau and the United States. Palau, with a population of about 20,000, is about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) southeast of Manila in the Philippines and about 4,600 miles (7,400 kilometers) west of Hawaii. It has received nearly $900 million in U.S. aid since independence in 1994, according to congressional auditors, and depends on Washington for its defense. In 2006, five other Uyghur detainees were transferred to Albania, according to the Justice Department, which said it has no reports they took part in any post-resettlement criminal behavior or terrorist activities. Since 2002, more than 540 detainees have departed Guantanamo for other countries, including Albania, Algeria, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, France, Great Britain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom and Yemen, the Justice Department said. CNN's Brian Vitagliano and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","NEW: Bermudan premier: ""Above all, this was a humanitarian act""

"When I first saw Thug Kitchen in 2013, I, like thousands of other people, was intrigued by a website -- anonymously penned -- that peppered its posts with phrases like ""Hydrate Mother F‚Äîker!"" and ""Antioxidants are all up in the B‚Äîh!"" in an effort to promote healthy eating. So effective, it was hard to look away. Most compelling to me and my contemporaries was the site's name, specifically the word ""thug."" As an African-American activist and author working to excite people to eat more healthfully (and create more access to fresh affordable food in communities most impacted by food injustice), I have long thought about the important role of pop culture and online media in changing people's attitudes, habits and politics around food.  ""Start with the visceral, move to the cerebral and then the political"" has been the mantra guiding most of my efforts. The pairing of vulgar, slang-heavy admonitions with big, bright, nutritious recipes was certainly visceral. But the more I read through the Thug Kitchen posts, the more skeptical I became about the cerebral and political aspects, if they even existed.  I held out hope that Thug Kitchen was a ham-fisted attempt to craft viral memes that might positively influence the eating habits of the ""thugs"" that the wider culture imagines when that word is used: young black men living in low-income urban neighborhoods. In her book ""Talkin and Testifyin,"" linguist Geneva Smitherman describes how ""through song, story, folk sayings, and rich verbal interplay among everyday people, lessons and precepts about life and survival are handed down from generation to generation."" So, maybe this anonymous writer was a working-class young person of color attempting to engage in linguistically and culturally appropriate cyberoutreach to young folks with similar backgrounds? Don't fear the vegan . While on a promotional tour in the spring for my latest book, ""Afro-Vegan,"" I met a 30-something Philadelphia-based healthy eating activist who was focused on transforming the consumption habits of people by ""inspiring and improving the quality of life, one fruit and veggie at a time. Spreading the love, and knowledge, of an all plant-based diet.""  This cat was affectionately known as the ""Gangster Vegan.""  A less cynical side of me imagined someone like him, who seemed genuinely committed to transforming communities, or like YouTube's outrageously fun ""Sista Girl,"" Felicia O' Dell aka Auntie Fee, as the blogger behind Thug Kitchen. If only. A week before the publication of the site's eponymous cookbook ""Thug Kitchen: The Official Cookbook: Eat Like You Give a F**k"" it was revealed that Michelle Davis and Matt Holloway, a young white couple living in Hollywood, created and maintained the site. Needless to say, audiences were surprised. Many critics accused the duo of playing around with a post-Internet form of blackface and ultimately benefiting from it financially. Some apologists denied there was anything specifically racist, or even racial, about the swearing and slang. Others cried foul at the critics, claiming that a little harmless inauthenticity was A-OK if it raised the profile of fresh, healthy foods and diets. Certainly, swearing isn't exclusive to African-Americans. But many of the site's captions, usually dreamed up by Davis to accompany Holloway's striking visuals, rely heavily on phrases from black rap lyrics, stand-up routines and films, which eventually went mainstream. ""Nobody needs mayo in their life;"" ""Calm your bitch ass down like a boss;"" and ""Don't f*&k around with some sorry-ass ten-dollar takeout"" are hardly the language of a ""Sopranos"" mobster or ""Sons of Anarchy"" biker. And that's a problem. If Guido's Kitchen were revealed to be the work not of a blue-collar, East Coast Italian-American, but of an Asian hipster living in the Bay Area, wouldn't his credibility be shattered? The careful avoidance of putting any faces to the Thug Kitchen name for as long as possible (two years) suggests an awareness of the offense. It's no coincidence that Thug Kitchen's admirers often imagined the ""voice"" of the site to be that of shrill, vulgar and often uproariously funny black men like actor Samuel L. Jackson or rapper Ghostface Killah, and not that of actor Robert De Niro or Hells Angels founder Sonny Barger. The contrast drawn between the consciously progressive dishes shown and the imagined vulgar, ignorant thug only works if the thug is the kind of grimy person of color depicted in the news and in popular media as hustling drugs on a dystopian block, under the colorful glow of various burger stands, bulletproof take-out spots or bodega signs. ""Those kind of people,"" the visual gag suggests, ""intimidating you into... preparing arugula or tempeh? How absurd, how shocking, how hilarious!"" Whites masking in African-American street vernacular for their own amusement and profit isn't just the tired trope of cultural exploitation, which has a rich tradition going back beyond the bete noires of the moment, Macklemore and Iggy Azalea, past Vanilla Ice and Quentin Tarantino, and even beyond Madonna, Elvis and the minstrel shows of the late 19th century that first innovated modern American blackface spectacles. And it isn't just breaking some unwritten codes governing race and language, either. (A common misunderstanding about racism, that there are hordes of sensitive, politically correct grievance peddlers waiting to descend upon people for saying the wrong word or idea, usually comes arm-in-arm with claims of reverse racism and a witch-hunt mentality of political correctness run amok that is as hurtful and divisive as the allegedly racist word or idea itself. Take Paula Deen and Donald Sterling, the sentiment holds, and how they are punished for merely saying a mistaken word or opinion in private that later became public knowledge). Paula Deen and Southern food: Critics say credit is past due . The worst offense here is the misrepresentation. As food historian Jessica Harris has noted, ""the traditional [West and Central] African diet and African-American diet are essentially ... a majority vegetarian"" one. Concepts like farm-to-table, eating seasonally and eating locally, while increasingly popular in the mainstream, were not news to a community who was enslaved and brought to America generations ago to help develop the agrarian South. African-American cuisine may suffer from the stigma and stereotype of being based in fatty pork-based dishes and butter-heavy comfort foods, but in truth, that kind of meat-heavy, indulgent decadence was scarce for millions struggling under the oppression of segregation before the industrialization of our food system. When we peel away the negative stereotypes and reductive portrayals of African-American food, we see a diverse and complex culinary tradition with nutrient-rich foods like collards, mustards, turnips, butter beans, black-eyed peas, green beans, sugar snap peas and the like at the cuisine's core. Urban farmer: 'If I do not farm, I'll get sick.' As of 2011, for 57% of African-Americans, the Southern United States is still home, and most of them come from families who have been close to the land for generations as sharecroppers and migrant agricultural workers. My grandparents, and those of many other Southerners, cultivated home gardens that yielded a number of the crops mentioned above. Many still do. First lady Michelle Obama's advocacy of home gardens isn't trendy for her and millions like her who descend from the South: it's traditional. Whether or not the hipsters and health nuts charmed by Thug Kitchen realize this, vegetarian, vegan and plant-strong culture in the black experience predates pernicious thug stereotypes. Said another way, the Thug Kitchen's central comic conceit doesn't jibe with reality.","Bryant Terry, an author and food advocate, was initially intrigued by Thug Kitchen .

"Throughout the Cold War, the United States relied on the theory of deterrence for protection against nuclear attack. American leaders believed that so long as the U.S. maintained nuclear forces able to survive a first-strike and retaliate with devastating power against the Soviet Union, Kremlin leaders would be deterred from mounting a nuclear attack. In retrospect, this arms race was incredibly costly, wasteful and dangerous. If war had started, the two superpowers would have destroyed each other and probably all of humanity. But deterrence did work. And the U.S. never attacked the Soviet Union or any other nation to stop them from becoming nuclear powers. So, why does it seem that the U.S. has a different strategy toward North Korea and Iran? In response to North Korea's recent threats to launch nuclear attacks, the U.S. announced it would bolster missile defenses in Alaska and California and speed the deployment of missile interceptors to Guam. With respect to Iran, President Obama said as recently as March 20: ""We will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining the world's worst weapons.'' America currently has about 5,000 nuclear weapons. Even though it could retaliate against a hypothetical Iranian or North Korean nuclear attack and obliterate both nations while utilizing only 1 or 2% of its arsenal, the Obama administration is acting as if the theory of deterrence no longer applies. Why? Nuclear weapons: Who has what? It appears that the U.S. is treating Iran differently than other countries trying to go nuclear because it perceives Iranian leaders as aggressive religious fanatics willing to sacrifice everything for their goals. After all, Iran supports terrorist organizations, conducts assassinations and bombings, seeks to subvert neighboring countries, and makes fearsome threats against Israel and the U.S. Similarly, the U.S. seems uncertain about North Korea's young and untested new leader. Pyongyang not only has a history of provocative verbal threats, but it has taken reckless military actions as recently as two years ago, when the North sank a South Korean naval vessel and shelled an island occupied by the South. But wait -- didn't the Soviet spout dangerous rhetoric and take deadly actions? Didn't some of their leaders threaten to ""bury"" America and nuke London and Paris? And let's not forget that Leonid Brezhnev launched proxy wars against U.S. friends in Latin America, Africa and Asia. Yet the Obama administration seems to think that while Soviet leaders were deterred from using their massive arsenal, the Iranians and the North Koreans might not be deterred from using a nuclear force of no more than a handful of weapons at best. North Korea's missile capabilities . But if deterrence theory is valid, then this double standard is invalid. Both Iran's and North Korea's supreme leaders will be deterred, just as were successive generations of Soviet leaders. Both would not authorize the use of nuclear weapons, for fear of seeing their nations destroyed, their people wiped out, and their ambitions for themselves and their countries turned to dust. If deterrence theory is no longer valid, the U.S. had better work harder to achieve President Obama's Nobel Prize-winning goal of a world in which no nation possesses nuclear weapons. No one can say with great confidence what North Korea's Kim Jong Un will do. While the U.S. needs to be prepared for North Korea to act on Kim's threats of nuclear war, unless he has lost his mind, it seems doubtful that he would follow through and commit national suicide by inviting devastating nuclear retaliation. Reaching an agreement with Iran seems possible. Such an arrangement would permit Tehran to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but not to build nuclear weapons. This is Iran's right as a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The question is whether Iran and the U.S. can get past decades of conflict, mistrust and suspicions. But President Obama's threats to use military force to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons do not facilitate talks. They only reinforce Tehran's suspicions that America's real goal is to bring down the Iranian regime. Opinion: North Korea endgame -- 3 scenarios . With a deterrent strategy in his hip pocket as ""Plan B,"" a less threatening posture by President Obama might help him bring about a peaceful resolution in future negotiating rounds with Iran.","Barry Blechman: U.S. never attacked another nation to stop it from becoming a nuclear power .

"(CNN) -- Inventor Glenn Martin admits he appears crazy -- ""But it's the crazy people who change the world."" ""Some people work on old cars, some do quilting, some collect stamps, I build jetpacks."" Night after night for 30 years, the New Zealand father-of-two worked on a secret machine in his garage. Wife Vanessa was one of the few people who knew about the space-age contraption quietly taking shape at their home in Christchurch. Luckily for Martin she was not only ""as crazy as him,"" but petite enough to be its first test pilot. Twelve prototypes and $17 million later, and what started as a young university student's hobby could soon be on the market, the first flying machine of its kind ever to be commercially sold. Behold the ""Martin Jetpack."" ""I wanted to fly to school as a five-year-old,"" said the 54-year-old inventor, who previously worked in marketing in the pharmaceutical industry. ""I saw 'Lost in Space,' 'Thunderbirds,' and the Apollo program when I was young. When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, I knew that anything was possible. Somehow we lost that spirit."" Everyone that is, except Martin. Fabulous flying machines . With a wingspan of just over 2 meters, his futuristic flying machine can travel 74 kilometers per hour and soar 900 meters into the sky. Powered by a V4 200-horsepower engine, it zooms through the air on two giant ducted fans, with enough fuel to last 30 minutes. Should the pilot let go of the controls, the jetpack will automatically hover on the spot. An inbuilt parachute can also be launched in an emergency. It might seem like an unlikely design for a man with a degree in biochemistry and physiology. But as Martin says, building things is just part of the ""Kiwi"" way -- referring to the nickname for people from New Zealand. ""Kiwis live outdoor lifestyles and by the time I was 20 I could ski, mountain climb, abseil, ice skate, kayak, surf, hang glide and skydive,"" he explained. ""We have a tradition of making what we need, of inventing things. So Jetpacks are a normal extension for the people who created the jetboat and bungee jump."" Mission impossible? Martin is now on the search for investors to help get his jetpack, ahem, off the ground. The company needs $4 million in funding. Should it succeed, the machine could be available just months later, with a price tag of around $150,000. But just what will this daring design be used for? ""Our first product will be targeted at First Responders -- fire brigades, the police, ambulance services, along with search and rescue, disaster recovery, and border control,"" said the company's chief executive, Peter Coker. ""There will also be an unmanned version capable of lifting 100kg in weight. We've already had interest from many other places, including mining and agricultural companies."" There are also plans to release the jetpack to the tourism industry and ultimately to individuals -- though its use will come down to aviation laws in each country. New pilots would also be required to undertake a week-long training course. Cities of the future . Could we really see people flying jetpacks around our cities in the future? ""The jetpack is well-suited to operate in cities,"" said Coker. ""Without the large rotor blades similar to a helicopter, it can operate in confined spaces."" ""There is less opportunity at present for personal jetpacks to fly around urban environments, due to regulations. But I think this will probably change over time as new approaches of highways in the sky for personal transport are developed."" For Martin, it would be a little boy's dream come true. ""I was three-years-old when Al Shepard went into space, four-years-old when John Glenn completed an orbit, nine-years-old when Apollo 11 went to the moon, and 21-years-old when I decided to make a jetpack,"" he says. At 54, he could be about to fly into the history books himself. Watch: Can this drone get you home?","The 'Martin Jetpack' could soon be the first commercially sold jetpack .

"Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh has some unusual style advice for 501 fans: Step away from the washing machine. The denim honcho shared the words of wisdom this week at Fortune's Brainstorm Green conference in Laguna Niguel, California.

He recommended spot cleaning jeans with a sponge or toothbrush and a bit of detergent, then air drying. He says you should very seldom machine wash. ""If you treat them right, they'll last a long, long time -- probably longer than most people's waistline."" He added that less washing equals greater environmental sustainability. It's not new advice. Designer Tommy Hilfiger has made similar comments. And CNN's Anderson Cooper told style expert Stacy London two years ago that he washes his jeans very rarely.

"Former wrestler and Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura has some harsh words for the armed forces this Veterans Day: If given the option today, he'd opt out of military service. ""I hate to say it, but no, I would be a conscientious objector today,"" the Navy special forces veteran said in a video posted Tuesday. ""I don't believe that the military fights for our freedom."" ""They give them all the ra ra at the stadiums, and they cheer 'em on,"" said Ventura, who served as a Reform Party governor of the North Star state from 1999 to 2003. ""But when the veterans come home, we pretty much forget about them. They're old news. They're yesterday's garbage. And it's time to move on to the next war."" Related: Jesse Ventura wins $1.8 million lawsuit against slain ex-SEAL . He pointed to the fallout from the Vietnam War as an example of these attitudes -- and he predicted that veterans from more modern wars would experience the same thing. ""There gonna come back to parades, but it's gonna end about right there,"" he said. Ventura did say, however, that he isn't anti-veteran. After all, he is one himself, having served in the U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team member during the Vietnam War. ""You can hate the war and not hate the vet. The veteran is a pawn. They have to do it. They are not given a choice,"" he said. ""Our vets are honorable people... I bear no grudge."" Related: Hagel wants to give Vietnam vets a second chance . In particular, Ventura took issue with the large dollar amount pinned to foreign wars, arguing that ""international corporations"" are the ones who ""truly run our country today."" ""That's why wars are fought -- so the profiteers of war can make money,"" Ventura said, pointing to the large portion of the annual budget that goes toward national security and defense. ""If we weren't involved in these wars, we would have more freedom,"" he said. The video appears on the website of Voices of Liberty, a group led by former Republican congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul.

"As three tugboats towed the disabled Carnival cruise ship Triumph back to port in Mobile, Alabama, things went from bad to worse. The fire that caused the ship to lose power and drift aimlessly on rough Gulf of Mexico swells was just the beginning. Raw sewage seeped into corridors and cabin ways. Food had to be rationed. There were fears of looting. Not surprisingly, passengers were furious and emotional. Some were reported to be ""acting like savages."" For Carnival and the rest of the cruise line industry, the implications are potentially devastating. The deadly capsizing in January 2012 of the  Costa Concordia ship off the coast of Italy still lingers in the public's mind. About a month later, the Costa Allegra liner suffered a similar engine fire, lost power, and was set adrift in pirate-infested waters in the Indian Ocean. Carnival owns Costa Cruises, and now a third high-profile crisis for Carnival in just over a year threatens to cement the perception among vacationers that cruising might not be worth the risk. Five things we've learned about cruises . In the age of social and digital media, the problems faced by cruise lines are compounded. Using mobile phones, passengers aboard the Triumph have been providing concerned family members with constant updates. Those enraged family members have immediately passed the horror stories along to the eager media. The public is getting the full play-by-play in virtual real time, leaving Carnival playing catchup from an increasingly defensive posture. But as bad as the potential damage to Carnival's image may be, the company, as well as the rest of the cruise line industry, has an opportunity to blunt the impact, if it acts quickly and wisely. It seems counterintuitive, but while the gruesome stories of the ""cruise from hell"" are still fresh, the crisis offers an opportunity for the cruise line to make a compelling statement about the industry's commitment to its passengers. (Statements from Carnival.) Crisis management experts know that customers and the general public are more likely to judge an organization by how it handles a problem than how it got into the problem in the first place. That means Carnival has to go much further than mere reimbursements and vouchers for onward travel. The challenge to Carnival's reputation is three-fold. First the company must articulate real concern for passengers and clearly communicate what it is doing to make things right for customers. This will require financial sacrifices, of course. But Carnival has little choice but to pay now and win some badly needed goodwill  -- or pay later in the courtroom, in the court of public opinion, and, of course, at the cash register when bookings decline. Second, the company must clearly communicate what it is doing to fix the problem and prevent anything like it from ever happening again. How did an engine fire, serious as that might be, so quickly develop into a disaster of this magnitude? My celebration trip on the Carnival Triumph: From joy to misery . How could it have been allowed to happen? Why was the widely reported chaos and disorder allowed to develop? Why did Carnival not have emergency response plans in place? What is the industry doing to prepare for what would seem to be a manageable situation? The public will demand answers to these basic questions before it will begin to trust again. Uncertainty breathes life into a crisis. Accurate and timely information smothers it. Third, Carnival must aggressively and clearly deliver these messages now, and for as long as it takes to restore the public's trust. So far, the story has been about the unthinkable conditions the passengers have been forced to endure. Carnival must move aggressively to reshape that narrative to reflect all that it is doing to rectify the situation. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? Carnival has to resist the temptation to explain, minimize, or justify what happened and position itself instead as part of the solution to the problems that caused the disaster. That is what the public will focus on and remember, but only if Carnival is able to communicate it fast and effectively.","David Bartlett: For Carnival, impact of 'cruise from hell' potentially devastating.

"President Barack Obama unveiled an aggressive new climate change strategy on Tuesday that would limit pollution from existing coal-fired power plants, and he made clear that approval of the Keystone XL pipeline depended on the project not increasing overall greenhouse gas emissions. Obama raised the two politically charged issues during a sweeping address on second-term environmental priorities that included his plan of executive actions that don't require congressional approval in an era of partisan gridlock in Washington. He also pledged global leadership on climate change and to redouble U.S. efforts to fight it. The Georgetown University speech came as environmental constituents and climate change advocates press him to take more aggressive action and to push harder for clean energy alternatives. Obama said he was taking action for the ""sake of our children and the health and safety of all Americans,"" saying new initiatives on his environmental agenda built around clean-energy industry and policy will spur the economy and leave a cleaner planet for future generations. ""We can do all of that as long as we don't fear the future and instead we seize it,"" Obama said, adding that his plan was a signal to the world that America would take bold action to reduce carbon pollution. Obama pledged in 2009 the United States would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17% of 2005 levels by 2020. Environmentalists have said decisive action was necessary to make that goal possible with a major legislative effort in Congress failing in Obama's first term. The president again said that U.S. energy strategy must be more than producing more petroleum, reviving his call for eliminating tax breaks for ""big oil."" ""We can't drill our way out of the energy and climate challenges that we face,"" he said, a familiar Democratic sentiment on energy policy. Obama cautioned that the impact of his plan would be felt over time, but now is the moment to further prepare the nation to reduce carbon pollution and protect Americans from climate change. ""The world still looks for the United States to lead,"" he said, noting that the United States is the world's largest economy and the second-largest carbon emitter. ""We have a vital role to play,"" he said. Obama said the United States must use less ""dirty energy,"" waste less, and transition to cleaner sources, and redouble efforts to reach a new global agreement to reduce carbon emissions with ""concrete action"" that is ambitious, inclusive and flexible. He said the United States must ""strengthen our position"" as a natural gas producer, which he said is producing jobs, lowering power bills, and over time would help the country transition to cleaner energy overall, including wind and solar power applications. And Obama said he doesn't have much patience for those who say there's no proof of man-made climate change. ""We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society,"" he said. Americans having their say on divisive Keystone pipeline plan . Keystone pipeline . On the sensitive prospect of the Canada-to-Texas Keystone pipeline, Obama said it would only come about if its development would be in the nation's best interest. And that, he said, would be served if the project does not significantly worsen carbon pollution. ""The net effect on our climate will be absolutely critical in determining whether this project will be allowed to go forward,"" he said. The State Department is in the final stages of reviewing the proposal that has contributed to the political stalemate in Washington. Proponents of the pipeline, many of them Republicans that Obama is looking to compromise with on key issues, say Keystone will enable U.S. energy independence, create jobs and develop important industrial infrastructure. Opinion: The real, and dirty, Obama scandal . Among detractors are some of Obama's traditional allies, who were instrumental in getting him elected twice. They say the massive pipeline effort is dangerous, inherently filthy and must be stopped. In a lengthy study, the State Department has weighed in on the side of proponents. But the Environmental Protection Agency has blasted environmental impact assessments. The Canadian crude that would flow through the Keystone pipeline is mixed with sand in its raw form. Environmental experts say extracting oil and transporting it requires more energy than pumping crude out of a well. Pushing it through pipes increases the energy consumption as well. That higher energy use leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions, an increase of ""18.7 million metric tons (20 million tons) C02 ... per year when compared to an equal amount of U.S. average crudes,"" the EPA said. Coal plants . The Obama administration created regulations for newly built coal plants during the president's first term. On Tuesday, he issued directives requiring the EPA to establish carbon pollution standards for plants that are already active. The administration is not laying out new standards on its own. Instead, it plans to work with industry, states, labor and other interest groups to develop them. Obama directed the EPA to come up with a detailed draft proposal by June 2014 and a finalized version one year later. Environmental groups have been calling on Obama to issue such regulations on coal plants, the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States. Obama argued that the benefits of reduced carbon emissions will far outweigh the costs of implementing new rules. Critics have said new regulations could damage the economy. Construction of new coal plants has slowed in part due to EPA regulations. ""The impact could be economic havoc,"" Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents the coal industry, told CNNMoney earlier this year. Coal is used to produce about 40% of the nation's electricity. Hal Quinn, president and chief executive of the National Mining Association, told Congress last week that U.S. exports of coal are becoming an increasingly large share of the economy. Last year, he said, exports added $16.6 billion to the economy and supported 168,430 jobs. While the administration has not given a cost-benefit analysis of its new plan, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a large environmental action group, estimates it would cost $4 billion to comply with new regulations on coal power plants, but the economy would see anywhere from $25 to $60 billion in benefits. A large part of the benefit comes from reduced health care costs. Carbon pollution is known for contributing to higher rates of asthma, as well as other possible illnesses. Republican reaction was swift with the GOP's political arm in Virginia rolling out its claim of Obama's ""war on coal."" As part of the gubernatorial campaign, it quickly released a ""robo call"" initiative in the southwestern part of the state describing Democratic support for ""job-killing policies."" Obama's second term could look like his first . Frustration with Obama . Many environmentalists will likely embrace the president's proposals on climate change even though he pushed through sharp cuts in car and truck emissions during his first term. Activists have expressed frustration with the administration in the past, saying Obama hasn't worked with a strong sense of urgency on the issue since taking office even though he pushed forward a sweeping plan to reduce car emissions and fuel use. While the idea of long-term climate change is a controversial notion politically, it's accepted as fact by most researchers and Obama. A March poll from Gallup indicated nearly half -- 47% -- of Americans think the U.S. government is doing too little to protect the environment, while 35% said the government was doing the right amount and 16% said it was doing too much. The president offered renewed hope to the environmental community -- but fears among the coal mining industry and concerns among climate change skeptics -- in his inauguration speech and State of the Union address this year. He robustly signaled he would do more to combat climate change during his second term. And again last week, during a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Obama urged countries to work together to fight the ""global threat of our time."" Opinion: Climate change is real .

"A Cameroonian soldier was killed and 10 Chinese nationals went missing after a Boko Haram attack in northern Cameroon, officials from China, the United States and France said Saturday. No further details were immediately available on the circumstances of their disappearance, said Lu Quinjiang, first counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital. One Chinese national was injured in Friday night's attack and was being treated by a Chinese medical team in the Chadian capital of N'Djamena, Lu said. French President Fran√ßois Hollande mentioned the incident Saturday while hosting a security summit in Paris about the growing threat from Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based terror group. Later, U.S. Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman specified Boko Haram as being behind Friday's attack in a region of Cameroon known to be a stronghold for the group. ""Cameroon just suffered its own Boko Haram attack at a Chinese company last night,"" Sherman said, noting also that Boko Haram is to blame for the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria. Several African and Western nations stepped up their search for the girls under a new plan announced at the security summit. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language that's the lingua franca in West and Central Africa. The militant group says its aim is to impose stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram's attacks have intensified in recent years. Cameroon attack . Friday's attack targeted employees of a Chinese company in the northern Cameroonian town of Waza, a few miles away from the Nigerian border. U.S. questions Nigeria's rescue ability; France hosts summit . The Chinese embassy is working with Cameroon's government to locate the missing workers, Lu said, and has asked for tighter security to protect Chinese nationals in the northern part of the country. The Chinese company, Sinohydro, is an engineering firm that builds large scale hydropower projects. It has been involved in the construction of the Memve'ele dam in southern Cameroon as part of the country's effort to boost electricity production, according to the company's website. Last year, a group of Boko Haram fighters crossed into northern Cameroon and abducted a French family of four children, their parents and an uncle from Waza National Park. The family was eventually released, reportedly in exchange for a $3 million ransom and the release of 16 Boko Haram prisoners held in Cameroon.","Boko Haram is behind the attack in Cameroon, a U.S. official says .

"(CNN) -- Videos posted online show tanks in Syrian streets, scrambling crowds and the menacing sounds of sniper fire. On the other side of the world, Syrian-Americans say they are watching in anguish, haunted by what they see and hear. ""You hear people screaming for help, and you can identify the accent,"" said Yaser Tabbara, a 35-year-old attorney in Chicago who was raised in Syria's capital, Damascus. ""It's been very traumatizing for me and my family to see all these things,"" he said. ""To see all of that, and to know that you can do very little about it from outside Syria, is a very demoralizing and frustrating position to be in."" Word of a brutal crackdown by government security forces began to trickle out soon after anti-government protests began in mid-March. Since then, human rights groups say more than 775 people have been killed. CNN has not been granted access into Syria and is unable to independently verify those claims, videos posted online or witness accounts. Syrian-Americans say they also struggle to find out what's happening, frantically searching for news online and calling family and friends in Syria. ""They're too scared. ...They don't say anything on the phone. You really can't. Phones are monitored. Everything's monitored,"" said Mohammed, an American of Syrian descent who lives in the Chicago area. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing his extended family in Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, could face repercussions. ""There's a sense of helplessness. We try to bring the attention of the international community to what's going on. That's the only thing Syrian-Americans can do to deal with the problem,"" said Mohamed T. Khairullah. The 35-year-old mayor of Prospect Park, New Jersey, wrote an op-ed in his local newspaper, criticizing the ""violent repression"" of Syrian President Bashar al-Ashad's regime. In Syria, he wrote, people can't speak out at government meetings or write letters to the editor. ""The only thing they can do now is protest peacefully. That protest is being documented via social media for the world to see the atrocities of the Syrian forces,"" he wrote. Khairullah said the news has sharply divided the large Arab community in the area where he lives, and many people are still struggling to understand the situation. ""People don't know whether to go with or against (the government), and they don't know what the future might hold,"" he said. The members of the Syrian American Club in Washington are also split, according to Munif Atassi, the social club's president. ""I've seen people on either side, and I've seen people in the middle. The majority of people are right in the middle, praying for the conflict to end,"" said Atassi, 57. Friends and family he's spoken with in Syria also have divergent opinions, he said. ""Frankly, they don't know what to believe anymore. ... The people I talk to, they believe that there is propaganda and lying coming from both sides,"" he said. For weeks, it seemed the world's attention was focused elsewhere, said Hosam Hamadah, 47, of Houston. When he couldn't find enough information about the situation in news reports, the small-business owner said he turned to online social networks. Now Hamadah is glued to Facebook, searching for updates and posting videos of the violence that he receives from acquaintances in Syria. Even from thousands of miles away, deciding to speak out about the situation was difficult, he said. ""It took me a while before I made up my mind. Then I realized, if I don't do this and the next guy won't do this, nobody's going to say anything,"" he said. ""Somebody has to say something. Me and my family, we're not better than the people that are getting killed in the streets.""","""It's a very demoralizing and frustrating position to be in,"" one Syrian-American says .

"Atlanta (CNN)Bobbi Kristina Brown was moved to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital on Tuesday, sources close to the family said, but the daughter of singers Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston remained in a fight for her life after being found facedown in a bathtub over the weekend. Her family has been tight-lipped on the 21-year-old's condition but on Tuesday night her father's lawyer issued a statement. ""We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina,"" said Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, lawyers for the performer. Bobby Brown said in a statement, ""We continue to request privacy in this matter. Please allow for our family to deal with this matter and give Bobbi Kristina the love and support she needs at this time."" After she was discovered unresponsive in her home in Roswell, an Atlanta suburb, she was rushed to the hospital where doctors placed her in a medically induced coma. As of late Monday, she remained on a ventilator in the intensive care unit, a source close to the family said. The status of her brain function won't be known until the sedatives are reduced, the source told CNN. ""Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family. As her father already stated, we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time,"" the Houston family said, thanking her supporters. The source close to the family told CNN that Brown's eyes opened and closed a few times Monday, but that doctors told family members not to read too much into that movement. Doctors were trying to reduce the sedatives to check Brown's brain function, but decided to keep her in the coma for now, the source said. The source added that Brown had some seizures on Monday. It was not immediately clear what medical significance these reported events have in Brown's case. Bobbi Kristina, in her own words . She ""was not breathing"" when a man identified as her husband found her Saturday morning inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb. He called 911 and performed CPR until emergency crews arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. The spokeswoman said when Brown was found, she was ""unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat."" In scanner traffic, emergency services could be heard describing an ""ECHO-level response"" -- urgent and life threatening -- with ""possible cardiac arrest."" ""Twenty-one-year-old female in the bathtub, facedown. PD's (police department's) en route."" Brown was taken to a local hospital, where ""she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition,"" Holland said over the weekend. A source close to the family told CNN on Monday that Brown was in ""really bad shape."" Everyone is ""hoping for the best, preparing for the worst"" and ""praying for a miracle,"" the source said. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. The incident report referenced a drowning. Police had been to Brown's residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland said. Almost three years ago, Whitney Houston was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel near Los Angeles, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. A coroner ruled her February 11, 2012, death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown is her only child. ""She encourages me and inspires me,"" Houston once said of her daughter. ""When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'OK. I can do this. I can do this.' "" Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Mother and daughter performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang ""My Love Is Your Love"" in Central Park on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Given the pair's close relationship, it's no surprise that Houston's death was a major blow. Days after her mother's body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was ""overwhelmed,"" family friend Kim Burrell said. ""She loves hard,"" Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. ""She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it."" After Houston's death, Bobbi Kristina talked of pursuing a career in acting and music, just like her mother. In 2012, she reportedly lobbied for a role in a planned biopic of her mother's life. Lifetime's ""Whitney,"" which was directed by actress Angela Bassett, debuted in January 2015, but the Houston family was not involved. Brown did make her acting debut in 2012 on Tyler Perry's show ""For Better or Worse."" Her performance in the small role won praise from Perry. ""She did a fantastic job,"" he said at the time. ""And that kid has a such a future. She's such an actor. "" Even before her mother's death, videos of Brown singing surfaced on YouTube and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to Houston's. Concerns that she may have substance abuse issues, as her mother did, intensified in July 2014 after a picture was posted on her Instagram account showing a young woman who looked like Brown appearing to be smoking from a bong. The image had previously made the media rounds two years prior. The caption read: ""This picture may be inappropriate but I want to make a connection with you all. Don't worry this picture isn't recent just hear me out. Do you know what I feel? I feel strange I can't feel any pain anymore. I don't take any drugs as of recently. Things just happened. But then there is some situation that force me to do things and the impact I'll feel pain. I did and I do. I was hurt."" Brown later denied that she posted the photo and tweeted that it was done by someone attempting to tarnish her image. Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime's brief reality show ""The Houstons: On Our Own,"" which followed her life after Houston's death. One of the show's storylines revolved around Brown's relationship with Nick Gordon, who had lived with Houston and her daughter since he was 12 years old. Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon, and in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarried√¢‚Ç¨¬¢ SO#Inlove.""","Bobby Brown's lawyer says he's investigating ""events that led to the hospitalization""

"(CNN)Each year tech junkies from around the world gather in Las Vegas for International CES, the Consumer Electronics Show where innovators come to show off their latest prototypes, preview products and announce new releases. Although the show is over 40 years old, this year's event, held from January 6 - 9, saw some of the most futuristic products ever, from driverless vehicles to a revolutionary battery which, according to its makers, could let you fully charge a cell phone in minutes. Here is some of the coolest tech from the show. 1. Mercedes-Benz unveiled its driverless vehicle. Although the F 015 Luxury in Motion is just a concept car at the moment, the vehicle shows just how different Mercedes thinks our driving experience will be in the future with an automated driving option and luxury ""mobile living space"" interior. ""Quality time in private space will be the true luxury goods in the future,"" said Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz cars in his CES keynote speech. 2. People controlled objects with a wave of the hand. The latest version of Ring, by Logbar, was unveiled at CES 2015. The cloud control device allows you to do things such as play music from your phone or close curtains using gestures programmed into a smart phone app. The $269.99 device was named as a 2015 CES Innovation Awards Honoree in November 2014. 3. A robotic arm played beer pong. Empire Robotic's Versaball is filled with a ""sand like material."" When air is pumped into the ball it softens, molding around an object, and then when air is removed, the green ball  hardens and grips objects from bricks to ping pong balls. 4. People scooted around on intelligent skateboards. The IO Hawk is a ""Intelligent mobility device"" which can travel at 6.2 mph. It is powered by batteries and moves in response to pressure from your feet. The $1,799.99 device is 4.3 inches high and created a real buzz among the CES crowd. 5. Toshiba's unveiled its concept robot, ChihiraAico. ChihiraAico is probably the most realistic robot you've ever seen, and according to Toshiba will be used in the healthcare industry. The aim was to make a service robot which looked and behaved like a human, but some CES attendees did not find it comforting at all. 6. A smart belt adjusted itself based on how much people ate. The Emiota Smart Belt keeps track of your overall health using your waist size and will also auto adjust after a big meal to keep you comfortable. The belt, which has not yet hit the market, can also nudge you when you've been stationary for too long. 7. Phones were charged in minutes. StoreDot, an Israeli start-up, showed off its super-fast charger, which it claims works up to 100 times faster than others and can be used for phones, tablets, laptops and wearable tech. The technology hasn't been proven and is not yet available to consumers, but according to the BBC the product already has backing from Samsung and Russian businessman Roman Abramovich and StoredDot says it has begun working on a product to charge electric vehicles.
