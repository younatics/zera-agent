Sisters, who recently lost their beloved mother to cancer, were ejected from a Philadelphia shopping mall on Sunday after refusing to remove profanity-laden hats expressing their hatred of breast cancer. Jackie Underwood passed away on May 14, she had first battled cancer in 2004 before it returned in 2011. In the time leading up to her death, her daughters Makia Underwood, 32, Zakia Clark, 29, and Tasha Clark, 27 had worn hats and shirts featuring the expression ‘F**k cancer’ as a show of support. Makia Underwood, left, and sister Zakia Clark, along with their uncle Curran Underwood, right, wear their anti-cancer gear in Philadelphia, on May 21 . The women, who nursed their mom through her final days, actually designed and produced the clothing to raise money for cancer awareness. On Sunday, the three sisters visited the King of Prussia Mall in the Upper Merion Township, with a group of friends and relatives to pick out a dress for Zakia's 9-year-old daughter to wear to her grandmother's funeral on 22 May. Zakia and Tasha decided to wear their ‘F**k cancer’ hats which include a pink ribbon substituting for the third letter of the first word. Zakia said it is the only word strong enough to defeat the word 'cancer.' After several hours of shopping, several members of the group including Zakia and Tasha decided to get some food. Mall manager Robert Hart at the King of Prussia Mall, near Philadelphia, has since apologized for his staff's heavy-handed behavior . As they were eating, the ladies were approached by a security guard who told them to remove their hats because they were offensive. Zakia instinctively took hers off, but Tasha, who had once worked at the mall, told the guard she wanted to see something in writing. Her brave stance prompted her sister to put her own hat back on. ‘He said, “Since you don't want to take your hat off, you can leave my mall,'"" Zakia told Philly.com. ‘He stood there while we ate and threatened to call the cops.’ The ladies say seven more guards appeared and surrounded them, scaring Zakia’s daughter who started to cry. The group was then escorted to the mall office, where they were met by a local police officer who had been called by security guards. ‘The officer said, “I find it offensive that you even have that hat that says 'F**k cancer'"" Zakia said. ""He said, 'It's their mall, they want you out, you have to get out.'"" The ladies objected, pointing out that stores at . the mall, such as Urban Outfitters, sell t-shirts featuring similar . language, but they were then escorted from the premises. Mall manager Robert Hart has since apologized for his staff's heavy-handed behavior. He sent his condolences to the sisters, but noted that since the mall is a family place their code of conduct doesn't tolerate profanity. He also promised to make a donation to a cancer charity of their choice. Video: Profane cancer hats get sisters kicked out of mall .

A baby boy, who doctors said would probably never leave hospital alive, has had his life-threatening condition cured by a medical first achieved using plastic particles and a 3D laser printer. Kaiba Gionfriddo, who used to stop breathing nearly every day, can now breathe normally after having a windpipe transplant and an artificial airway splint inserted. It's the latest advance from the booming field of regenerative medicine, making body parts in the lab. Healthy future: Kaiba Gionfriddo plays with the family's dog, Bandit, outside his Youngstown, Ohio home on Tuesday . In the case of Kaiba, doctors didn't have a moment to spare. Because of a birth defect, the little Ohio boy's airway kept collapsing, causing his breathing to stop and often his heart, too. Doctors in Michigan had been researching artificial airway splints but had never implanted one in a patient. In a single day, they ‘printed out’ 100 tiny tubes, using computer-guided lasers to stack and fuse thin layers of plastic instead of paper and ink to form various shapes and sizes. The next day, with special permission from the Food and Drug Administration, they implanted one of these tubes in Kaiba, the first time it had been done. Suddenly, a baby that doctors had said would probably not leave the hospital alive could breathe normally for the first time. He was three months old when the operation was done last year and is nearly 19 months old now. Kaiba, playing with his mom April, can finally breathe normally thanks to a first-of-a-kind biodegradable airway made by Michigan doctors using plastic particles and a 3-D laser printer . He is about to have his tracheotomy tube removed; it was placed when he was a couple months old and needed a breathing machine. He has not had a single breathing crisis since going home a year ago. ‘He's a pretty healthy kid right now,’ said Dr. Glenn Green, a pediatric ear, nose and throat specialist at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where the operation was done. It's described in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. Independent experts praised the work and the potential for 3-D printing to create more body parts to solve unmet medical needs. ‘It's the wave of the future,’ said Dr. Robert Weatherly, a pediatric specialist at the University of Missouri in Kansas City. ‘I'm impressed by what they were able to accomplish.’ So far, only a few adults have had trachea, or windpipe transplants, usually to replace ones destroyed by cancer. The windpipes came from dead donors or were lab-made, sometimes using stem cells. In a medical first, doctors at the University of Michigan Health System used plastic particles and a 3-D laser printer to create an airway splint to save Kaiba's life . Last month, a 2-year-old girl born without a windpipe received one grown from her own stem cells onto a plastic scaffold at a hospital in Peoria, Ill. Kaiba had a different problem - an incompletely formed bronchus, one of the two airways that branch off the windpipe like pant legs to the lungs. About 2,000 babies are born with such defects each year in the United States and most outgrow them by age 2 or 3, as more tissue develops. In severe cases, parents learn of the defect when the child suddenly stops breathing and dies. That almost happened when Kaiba was six weeks old at a restaurant with his parents, April and Bryan Gionfriddo, who live in Youngstown, in northeast Ohio. ‘He turned blue and stopped breathing on us,’ and his father did CPR to revive him, April Gionfriddo said. The splint has a slit along its length so it can expand and grow as the child does - something a permanent, artificial implant could not do . More episodes followed, and Kaiba had . to go on a breathing machine when he was two months old. Doctors told . the couple his condition was grave. ‘Quite . a few of them said he had a good chance of not leaving the hospital . alive. It was pretty scary,’ his mother said. ‘We pretty much prayed . every night, hoping that he would pull through.’ Then a doctor at Akron Children's Hospital, Marc Nelson, suggested the experimental work in Michigan. Researchers there were testing airway splints made from biodegradable polyester that is sometimes used to repair bone and cartilage. Kaiba had the operation on Feb. 9, 2012. The splint was placed around his defective bronchus, which was stitched to the splint to keep it from collapsing. The splint has a slit along its length so it can expand and grow as the child does - something a permanent, artificial implant could not do. Normal kid: Kaiba hasn't had a single breathing crisis since leaving hospital a year ago and is about to have his tracheotomy tube removed . The plastic is designed to degrade and gradually be absorbed by the body over three years, as healthy tissue forms to replace it, said the biomedical engineer who led the work, Scott Hollister. Green and Scott Hollister have a patent pending on the device and Hollister has a financial interest in a company that makes scaffolds for implants. Dr. John Bent, a pediatric specialist at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said only time will tell if this proves to be a permanent solution, but he praised the researchers for persevering to develop it. ‘I can think of a handful of children I have seen in the last two decades who suffered greatly... that likely would have benefited from this technology,’ Bent said.","Kaiba Gionfriddo was born with a defect that caused his airway to keep collapsing .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 14:06 EST, 14 December 2011 . Alexander Graham Bell foresaw many things, including that people could someday talk over a telephone. But the inventor certainly never could have anticipated that his audio-recording experiments in a Washington, D.C., lab could be recovered 130 years later and played for a gathering of scientists, curators and journalists. 'To be or not to be...' a man's voice can be heard saying in one recording as it was played on a computer at the Library of Congress yesterday. The speaker from the 1880s recites a portion of Hamlet's Soliloquy as a green wax disc crackles to life from computer speakers. Matter of public record: Scientist Carl Haber shows the frequencies of the sound recorded in 1885 by Alexander Graham Bell at Volta Laboratory during a news conference at Library of Congress in Washington . Paving the way: Alexander Graham Bell's 1881 gramaphone, on which he recorded Hamlet's Soliloquy, a trill of the tongue and someone reciting numbers starting with 1-2-3 . The early audio recordings - which revealed recitations of Shakespeare, numbers and other familiar lines - had been packed away and deemed obsolete at the Smithsonian Institution for more than a century. But new technology has allowed them to be recovered and played. Brilliant mind: Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, laid down his recordings in the 1880s when he was in fierce competition with the likes of Thomas Edison . The technology reads the sound from tiny grooves with light and a 3D camera. The recordings offer a glimpse into the dawn of the information age, when inventors were scrambling to make new discoveries and secure patents for the first telephones and phonographs, even early fiber optics. A second recording, on a copper negative disc, played back reveals a trill of the tongue and someone reciting the numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6. A third recording catches perhaps the first sound of disappointment as Bell's recording device seemed to hit a technical glitch. 'Mary had a little lamb and its fleece was white as snow,' a voice says. 'Everywhere that Mary went - Oh no!' On Novenmber 17, 1884, Bell's lab . recorded the word 'barometer' several times on a glass disc with a beam . of light. It and about 200 other experimental records were packed up and . given to the Smithsonian, seemingly never to be played again. The recordings date back to the . 1880s. Bell had moved from Boston, Massachusetts, to Washington after . obtaining a patent on March 10, 1876, for his invention of the . telephone, which occurred when his employee Thomas Watson heard him . shouting over a wire in the next room. He joined a growing group of . scientists who made the nation's capital a hotbed for innovations. Pride of place: Carlene Stephens shows some recordings by Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and Emile Berliner at Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington . Brought to life: The recordings could not have been played up to ten years ago because the digital mapping technology wasn't available, scientists revealed . Bell partnered with his cousin Chichester Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter to create Volta Laboratory Associates in Washington in the early 1880s. During this time, Bell sent the first wireless telephone message on a beam of light from the roof of a downtown Washington building, a forerunner to modern fiber optics. He and other inventors also were scrambling to record sound on anything they could find, including glass, rubber and metal. One early sound record looks like a smashed soup can. Inventors at the time were in intense . competition. Bell, Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison, who invented the . phonograph to record sound on tin foil in 1877, each left objects and . documentation with the Smithsonian to help prove their innovations were . first. Bell went so far as to seal some . devices in tin boxes for safekeeping at the Smithsonian. Edison's . earliest recordings are thought to have been lost. 'This stuff makes the hair stand up . on the back of my neck,' said curator Carlene Stephens, of the National . Museum of American History, before Bell's recordings were played. 'It's . the past speaking directly to us in a way we haven't heard before.' The museum's collection of about 400 . of the earliest audio recordings, including 200 from Bell's lab, . probably will become an important resource for new research on . communications and early technology now that they can be played back, . Stephens said. 'These materials have been in a cupboard and virtually unknown for decades,' she said. 'The collection has been silent.' Safe keeping: Many of the scientists, who were in keen competition to invent new instruments, gave their findings to the Smithsonian so that one day they could be proved correc . Bright beginnings: A Thomas Edison tinfoil phonograph recording, from about 1878. Carl Haber says these artefacts form the start of the information age . The Library of Congress partnered with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, to offer the first listen of these early recordings. Scientists have spent the past 10 years and about $1million to develop the technology to create high-resolution digital scans of the sound discs. This year, scholars from the Library of Congress, the Berkeley Lab and the Smithsonian gathered in a new preservation lab at the Library of Congress and recovered sound from those early Bell recordings. A $600,000 three-year grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Sciences funded the pilot project, and the Smithsonian hopes to continue the work if future grants can be secured. Advances in computer technology made it possible to play back the recordings, Haber said, noting that 10 years ago specialists would have struggled with computer speeds and storage problems. The digital images that now can be processed into sound within minutes would have taken days to process a decade ago. Many of the recordings are fragile, and until recently it had not been possible to listen to them without damaging the discs or cylinders. So far, the sounds of six discs have been successfully recovered through the process, which creates a high-resolution digital map of the disc or cylinder. The map is processed to remove scratches and skips, and software reproduces the audio content to create a standard digital sound file. Carl Haber, senior scientist at the Berkeley Lab, said Bell's recordings and others in the fierce competition of the 1880s marked the start of the information age as we know it. 'The whole idea that you could capture the world as it exists' in a recording, he said, 'they got that in this period.'","Hamlet's soliloquoy crackles from computer speakers .

A jury in Allentown, Pennsylvania found Na Cola Franklin guilty of first-degree murder on Thursday, according to reports. Prosecutors said Franklin and her fiancé, 36-year-old Billy Brewster, got into an argument early in the morning on August 11, the day they were supposed to be married. Police said they found Brewster bleeding from his chest shortly after 2am in the home they shared with three children. Murder: Na Cola Franklin, left was convicted of killing her husband-to-be Billy Brewster, right, after stabbing him twice in the heart during an argument at their home . Defense attorney John Waldron says Brewster went home to their Whitehall Township apartment drunk after an impromptu bachelor party. He claimed that Brewster attacked Franklin and then tried to leave with the couple's 9-month-old son. Waldron argued Franklin, 32, grabbed a knife to protect her child. But prosecutors say that the child was not in danger, and claimed that Franklin showed no signs of being assaulted by Brewster. Brewster's cousin Nakia Kali and his wife Monique - who were staying at the home with his wife for the wedding - testified that Franklin was the one being violent, and they never saw Brewster hit her, The Morning Call reported. The couple said that after returning to the apartment shortly after . midnight, they overheard an argument between Brewster and Franklin. Landing: After being stabbed twice in the chest, Brewster crawled to the second floor landing outside of the apartment he shared with Franklin and three children . When .

This is the dramatic moment a yachtsman who went overboard off the French coast was winched to safety after a fellow sailor called a builders' merchant in land-locked mid-Devon for help. The Ilfracombe man was swept into the sea off Ushant, north west France, on Thursday afternoon. Images released by the coastguard today show him being lowered to safety and carried in a stretcher. His colleague on the 32ft yacht Caprice could not understand the French coastguard, so called his Crediton builders merchant - who raised the alarm with Brixham Coastguard. The yachtsman is now being treated for hypothermia in hospital. Winched to safety: The yachtsman is now being treated for hypothermia in hospital . Unlikely saviour: A worker at a builders merchant in Devon was shocked when a customer rang him to ask for his help reporting a man overboard from a yacht near the French coast The customer struggled to understand the French coast guard . Footage from the rescue helicopter showed the Ilfracombe man being taken on a stretcher. He was swept into the sea off Ushant, north west France . Chris Tucker, who works for Jewson in Crediton, said he was 'a bit surprised' when his customer phoned him at about 3pm. 'I'm not quite sure why he called me, but maybe he knew I'd be there and would have access to a computer and phone,' Mr Tucker said. 'It was quite difficult to hear him because it was so windy, but he just kept repeating coordinates and times. 'He said he couldn't understand the French coastguards and they didn't understand him.' Mr Tucker said he had seen his customer on Tuesday so knew he was planning a sailing trip. 'He'd told me he was going on his friend's yacht and they were going to take it down to the south of France to leave it there for the summer, then get the ferry back,' he said.

French President Francois Hollande will get a new camel, Malian authorities say, after his was eaten . Malian authorities will give French President Francois Hollande another camel after the one they gave him as a present was eaten. The animal had been given in thanks for helping repel Islamist rebels was killed and eaten by the family he left it with in Timbuktu, an official in Mali said. A local government official in northern Mali said today that a replacement would be sent to France. ""As soon as we heard of this, we quickly replaced it with a bigger and better-looking camel,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""The new camel will be sent to Paris. We are ashamed of what happened to the camel. It was a present that did not deserve this fate."" Hollande was presented with the camel when he visited Mali in February several weeks after dispatching French troops to the former colony to help combat al Qaeda-linked fighters moving south from a base in the north of the country. The president joked at the time about using the camel to get around traffic-jammed Paris. But he chose in the end to leave it with a family in the town on the edge of the Sahara desert. Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was tasked with giving Hollande regular updates on the camel's status and had to inform him of its death last week, French media said. ""The news came in from soldiers on the ground,"" said a French government official. The present has been an ongoing farce for the French leader. Farce: The camel, which was left in Timbuktu, was eaten by a family, after one man had earlier claimed it had been stolen . It was claimed that the camel, who had not been named, had actually belonged to a farmer, whose house was destroyed by French shelling during their attack on Timbuktu. The 'true owner' of the camel, who lives in the Ambra refugee camp on the border with Mauritania, said that his animal had been stolen. This meant that the animal could have stolen property, and Mr Hollande and his entourage had no legal right to take it out of the country. A furious Malian calling himself Said Toureg has now threatened to file a lawsuit, saying on Twitter: 'Paris will witness unprecedented judicial activities regarding the stolen camel... there are reports stating that the owner of the camel has filed a lawsuit in the Ambra camp.' A diplomatic Mr Hollande said he was prepared to respect the request from Mali, with France's BFM TV news channel reporting: 'It was decided to resend the camel back to his native country Mali because of the difficulty of surviving in France's cold weather.' French leaders have received many gifts of exotic or wild animals from Africa and further afield over the years. Last week, a robber chainsawed a tusk off the skeleton of an elephant offered to Louis XIV by a Portuguese king in 1668. Police caught the robber as he fled, tusk under his arm.","Camel given as a gift to French president for helping repel Islamist rebels .

There were dramatic scenes in court last night as the judge declared a mistrial over the sentencing of Jodi Arias after the jury failed to reach a unanimous . verdict over whether or not she should be executed for . murdering her ex-boyfriend. The jury was dismissed from the courtroom after spending five months on the case, and while they did decide that she was guilty of the premeditated murder of Travis Alexander, they could not decide whether she should spend life in prison or be put to death. The next step in the lengthy trial will now come on July 18, when an entirely new jury panel is determined and tasked with delivering the final verdict in the case. In tears: Jodi Arias looked frightened before the jury's non-decision was handed down, but her composure did not change dramatically after she realized that she was not being sentenced to death . Heartbroken: Travis Alexander's relatives, including his sister Tanisha (right) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months . The scene in the Phoenix, Arizona courtroom on Thursday afternoon- when the jury came back to the judge with their inability to agree- was not one of relief. Arias herself looked upset and began crying, though not necessarily tears of joy. Alexander's siblings, who have been a constant presence throughout and have all uprooted their lives in California to focus on the trial, were all crying as well. One female juror was at least sympathetic to them, and she was seen mouthing the word 'sorry' toward the Alexanders. Judge Sherry Stephens, who showed some tough love to the jury yesterday, was very complimentary to them today. 'This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform some very difficult duties,' she said. Mistrial: Jody Arias reacts as the jury indicates it has not been able to reach a decision on the death penalty . The jury began deliberating Tuesday, and on Wednesday afternoon they told the Judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. She ordered the jurors . to go back and talk more until they came to a decision, but that was still not enough time as they came back later yesterday afternoon still at an impasse. The new jury will not have any power . to change her guilty conviction, and they will be solely tasked with . determining how she will 'pay' for the first degree murder. The . decision follows a trial that has staggered on for five months over the . 2008 slaying of Travis Alexander, Arias' on-again off-again boyfriend . who she killed in his home in 2008. She stabbed him nearly 30 times, . slit his throat, and shot him. Fearful: Arias was surrounded by her legal team, and her relatives were not in the room though they had been regularly fixtures at the trial through much of the five months . Even . for the most fastidious of court followers who have developed a sense . of who Arias is over the past five months of the trial, her behavior in . the past week has been confusing as she gave conflicting statements . about her desire thoughts on a possible death sentence. Immediately after her guilty verdict . was handed down two weeks ago, she granted a local news station an . interview where she said that she was 'in shock' and that she would . rather be given the death penalty as opposed to a life sentence in . prison. Speaking to the local Fox affiliate KSAZ, Arias said that she would 'prefer to die sooner than later.' ‘Longevity . runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural . life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably . live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward . to. 'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.' Waiting game: Now the next jury will be impaneled on July 18 and this second portion of the trial- where the jury needs to determine the punishment for Arias- will be done for a second time . Those . comments prompted courthouse officials to order that she be placed in a . psychological hold and on suicide watch, which inevitably delayed the . second portion of the sentencing- where jurors were forced to decide if . the murder was especially aggressive. During the ensuing testimony, called . the aggravation portion of the trial, jurors heard from both sides who . were able to call witnesses arguing that she should and shouldn't be . forced to die, respectively. When . she addressed the court in her own defense, she she pledged, if allowed . to live, to donate her hair to cancer patients and start a prison . recycling program. 'I have . made many public statements that I would prefer the death penalty to . life in prison,' Arias told jurors. In each of those cases, 'I lacked . perspective,' she said. 'Until . very recently I could not imagine standing before you all and asking . for you to give me life,' she said. 'But as I stand here now I cannot in . good conscience ask you to sentence me to death.'","The jury could not come to a unanimous decision about whether to execute Jodi Arias or to sentence her to life in prison .

The New York mother who was killed in Turkey had been hanging out with 'a criminal element' while on the solo trip, a source familiar with the murder investigation has claimed. FBI agents investigating the killing of Sarai Sierra, who was found bludgeoned to death on Saturday, do not believe she had only travelled to the country to take pictures, as her family has claimed. 'The first people she met up with were a criminal element,' the source told the New York Post. 'There are some . witness reports that she was seen with sketchy characters.' Authorities are now trying to verify these claims amid reports that her casket will be sent back to the United States on Thursday, the Post reported. Murdered: . The body of amateur photographer Sarai Sierra was found in Istanbul on . Saturday; now authorities are investigating claims she hung out with a 'criminal element' while on the solo trip . Among various lines of inquiry investigators are looking into a possible connection to drug trafficking. Sierra, who had been unemployed and had declared bankruptcy in 2005, had also travelled to Amsterdam and Munich while on the trip, which was her first time leaving the United States. She had initially planned to visit the country for three weeks, but after 12 days she posted online that she had to cut the trip short. Her family, including her devastated husband Steven Sierra, have said she went to the country because of the photo opportunities. They say she used her iPad and iPhone to shoot the images. Sierra's body was . found stashed by Istanbul's ancient city walls on Saturday, more than a . week after she failed to catch her flight home. Police said she died . from a blunt force trauma. Heading home: Sierra's casket is seen inside the Surp Yerrortutyun church in Istanbul, Turkey on Wednesday. Her body is expected to be sent back to the U.S. on Thursday . Tragic: People carry the casket from the Surp Yerrortutyun church to an ambulances in Istanbul . Journey: Authorities said the mother of two had died from a blunt force trauma to the head . She was found with a head wound and a blanket near her body. She was . wearing jeans, a jumper and a jacket, and still had her earrings and a . bracelet on, but her iPhone and iPad were missing. To pay for her funeral, her family began selling some of her images online on Tuesday and soon had enough to cover her expenses. The photos remain on sale online and any other profits will go to her two young sons, who are nine and 11, her family wrote on the website. Photographs on sale include images taken during her time in Istanbul and pictures of New York City. They are being sold as canvases, framed prints, greeting cards and iPhone cases for $39.95 each. 'Sarai's passion for photography and love for capturing the beauty we see in culture, architecture and scenery was her reason for traveling to Istanbul,' her brother, David Jimenez, wrote on the site.

When Tony Blair made a low-key visit to Burma last October and met political leaders, including pro-democracy heroine Aung San Suu Kyi, it was said the trip was to boost ‘bilateral ties with Britain’. Now The Mail on Sunday has been told the former Prime Minister has won permission to expand his ever-growing personal empire known as Tony Blair Inc to Burma. Diplomatic sources say he has been helped by his growing contacts with the China Investment Corporation, the global commercial wing of the Beijing regime – although Mr Blair’s office last night played this down. Close ties: Tony Blair meet Aung San Suu Kyi during his visit to Burma last year . It is the latest stage in Mr Blair’s remarkable career since leaving Downing Street in 2007 that has seen him maintain his influence and build a fortune estimated at £20 million in his dual role as international statesman and entrepreneur. His success in winning permission to extend his activities to Burma is a major diplomatic and business coup. Since sanctions against the country were dropped last year, foreign firms have been in a race to get there. Burma is rich in oil, natural gas and other mineral resources and its impressive economic growth of more than five per cent a year is expected to be accelerated by more foreign money. The ‘gold rush’ follows reforms, including Aung San Suu Kyi’s release from house arrest two years ago, by the military junta that has ruled Burma since a coup  in 1962. Gold rush: Tony Blair is set to capitalise on Burma's burgeoning economic expansion for his personal gain . Neither Mr Blair nor the Burmese revealed full details about his October visit, during which he also met President Thein Sein. Days earlier, when Mr Blair visited Vietnam, China’s government-run news agency Xinhua was more forthcoming. It said he wanted to ‘share his experiences in restructuring economy and attracting investment’, among other things. It seems likely Mr Blair will be willing to offer the same advice to the Burmese. In addition to his standing as a statesman, he had another major advantage in securing a foothold in Burma: his close links with CIC, responsible for investing Beijing’s £300 billion reserves abroad. Mr Blair has made more than ten trips to China in two-and-a-half years, meeting representatives of CIC, and has developed close links with its chairman, Lou Jiwei. China has long-standing links with Burma’s rulers and ignored the trade sanctions imposed by Britain and other nations. Globe-trotting: Blair meeting Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono this month . Statesman and businessman: Blair has a range of business and political roles including a senior position in the quartet of Middle East peace mediators . As Prime Minister, Mr Blair was a fierce opponent of Burma’s regime and signed a pledge not to travel there while the junta was in power. Last April, after Aung San Suu Kyi’s pro-democracy party won a landslide election victory, David Cameron became the first Western leader to visit Burma. Trading restrictions imposed by the West were eased shortly afterwards. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘We are simply having wide-ranging discussions with the government on the development of the country because Mr Blair is interested in it. ‘He has no commercial interests in Burma, and if he does do any governance work there it will be pro bono. Our discussions do not involve the Chinese Investment Corporation and we do not have a commercial engagement with the CIC.’","Tony Blair has been busy building a fortune of £20 million .

Linda Carty, 53, who has spent 11 years on Death Row in the United States, is days away from becoming the first British woman to be executed in 50 years after losing her final appeal. Ms Carty was convicted of killing a young mother in Texas ten years ago and plotting to steal her four-day-old baby with three men, but has always insisted she was framed. British woman Linda Carty could receive a date for her lethal injection at any time after her conviction for killing a mother and planning to steal her baby . In an emotional final plea, she said: . 'I wouldn't ask the British Government to lobby for me if I knew that I . was guilty, because it would be an embarrassment to myself and my . family, but also to the country that I love. 'When I say that I am innocent and that I didn’t commit this crime, I mean that.' The prosecution claimed she masterminded the fatal kidnapping of her 25-year-old neighbour, Joana Rodriguez, who was found dead with duct tape over her mouth and a plastic bag around her head in a car Ms Carty was leasing. The baby was found unharmed in the car, but the mother-of-one could receive a date for her execution by lethal injection at any time.

The request for a retrial was based on claims she was given inadequate legal support during her original trial and the Government were blocked in their efforts to help her. Her daughter, Jovelle Carty Joubert, has been rallying MPs for support for two years following the US Supreme Court's refusal to re-open her case. The Foreign Office said it was lobbying the Texas authorities to stop her execution. A statement said: 'The Prime Minister and British Government are deeply concerned.'

An inmate on death row used his last breath to protest his innocence of the murder of a 12-year-old girl as he was executed in Texas last night despite his legal team arguing he was mentally ill. Jonathan Green, 44, was jailed for the abduction, rape and strangling of Christina Neal, 12, whose body was found at his home  a month after she was reported missing in 2000. Several last ditch appeals were made on the basis of his mental health in an attempt to save him from the death penalty but Green was given a lethal injection after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the arguments to spare him. Too mentally ill: Inmate Jonathan Green, left, was executed last night despite arguments by his legal team that he should be spared execution for the murder of Christina Leann Neal, right, because he was mentally ill . The 11th-hour appeals delayed the punishment nearly five hours past the initial 6pm execution time and as the midnight expiration of the death warrant neared. Asked by the warden if he had a statement from the death chamber gurney, Green shook his head and replied: 'No' But seconds later he changed his mind, adding: 'I'm an innocent man. I never killed anyone. Y'all are killing an innocent man.' He then looked down at his left arm where one of the needles carrying the lethal drug was inserted, and said: 'It's hurting me bad.' But almost immediately he began snoring loudly. The sounds stopped after about six breaths. Green was pronounced dead 18 minutes later at 10.45pm. The family of Green's victim lived across a highway from him in Dobbin, about 45 miles northwest of Houston, when she disappeared. Investigators questioned Green at least twice in the days following Christina's disappearance 12 years ago. Delusional belief: Jonanthan Green claimed he couldn't have killed the Montgomery County schoolgirl, who disappeared while walking home in Dobbin, because letters exist that show he was somewhere in Conroe when the victim died . His wallet was found in some woods near clothing and jewellery that belonged to Christina but authorities found nothing else of significance at the time. A few weeks later, a tip from a neighbour about an unusually large burn pile behind his ramshackle home brought them back again. While Green had been cooperative in the past, he grew testy and ordered them off his property when an FBI agent looking at the fire site detected the smell of a decaying body and inserted a metal probe into a patch of disturbed earth. The death penalty is currently a legal sentence for crimes ranging from drug trafficking to murder in 33 American states. There has been increasing opposition to capital punishment in the U.S. and seventeen states - including Washington, D.C. - have banned its use. But many states, such as Texas, Virginia, Oklahoma and Florida, still impose the death penalty. There have been a total of 486 executions in Texas since 1976 - the highest amount of all American states - with 317 inmates currently on death row. Green's lethal injection is the 10th this year in Texas and the first of four scheduled for this month in the nation's most active death penalty state. Virginia has the second highest number of executions with 109 since 1976 but has just 12 inmates on death row. And while California has only conducted 13 executions in the last 36 years, it has the highest number of prisoners on death row, with 721 awaiting their sentence. Florida - which has the fourth highest number of executions with 73 since 1976 - currently has the second highest number of death row inmates with 402. But the number of Americans in favour of capital punishment is decreasing. There were 37 executions in the United States in 2008 - the lowest number since 1994. In 2010, 46 people were executed and in 2011, 43 inmates were all killed by lethal injection. But a 2011 Gallup poll showed 61 per cent of Americans favored capital punishment in cases of murder while 35 per cent opposed it - the lowest level of support recorded by Gallup since 1972. They returned hours later with a search warrant and a dog trained to detect human remains. The dog led officers to the girl's body, stuffed inside a laundry bag in the home and wedged into a corner behind a piece of furniture. Green contended someone else had placed the body there and that he was being set up. Evidence at his trial indicated he had tried to burn the body, buried it in a shallow grave, then removed it when detectives left to obtain the search warrant. DNA from her remains tied him to the slaying. A carpet fiber from her panties found in the woods was traced to a carpet in his home. Christina's parents were among people to watch Green die. They declined to speak with reporters following the execution. Green's lethal injection is the 10th this year in Texas and the first of four scheduled for this month in the nation's most active death penalty state. Green's lawyers argued his hallucinations made him ineligible for the death penalty and said a state competency hearing for him two years ago was unfair. That led to a reprieve from a federal district judge in Houston. But the Texas attorney general's office persuaded the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn that ruling and lift the stay of execution late Tuesday. Green's lawyer, James Rytting, said his client hallucinated about the 'ongoing spiritual warfare between two sets of voices representing good and evil'. The appeals court ruled that none of Green's hearings had been unfair and it was reasonable to find Green competent for the death penalty. Green told a psychiatrist who examined him before the competency hearing that he didn't and couldn't have killed Christina, that false evidence was used against him and that he understood a murder conviction could result in him receiving an injection that would kill him. Supreme Court guidance says mental illness can't disqualify someone from execution if they understand the sentence and reasons for the punishment, the state lawyers argued.","Jonathan Green, 44, was jailed for the abduction, rape and strangling of schoolgirl Christina Neal, aged 12 .

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 07:37 EST, 22 October 2011 . Colonel Gaddafi's death has raised the question of what will happen to the missing billions he siphoned off and deposited around the world. The fallen dictator is believed to have had around $168 billion in assets abroad, most of which has been frozen since the start of the year. The stash includes a complex web of investment funds and a string of luxury properties. However, uncovering the financial trail will prove difficult and the cash has been invested under false names, holding companies and secret accounts. Luxury: Protesters pictured earlier this year on top of the £10m Gaddafi property in Hampstead which boasts a swimming pool and sauna . Plush: The suede-lined cinema room in the property, which was bought mortgage-free in 2009 by a holding company owned by Saif . About $19 billion in assets believed to have been under the control of Gaddafi or associates have been located and frozen by the United Nations and member countries, U.S. officials have said since rebel forces began fighting to oust him from power. But other estimates suggest Gaddafi controlled as much as $30 billion in assets in the United States alone, plus large holdings in Europe and South Africa, said Victor Comras, a former money laundering expert for the United Nations and U.S. State Department. 'Gaddafi was no dummy,' Comras said. 'The obvious and easy money, that held in Western banks and financial institutions, has largely already been located and blocked.' Like other despots such as Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Democratic Republic of Congo's Mobutu Sese Seko, Gaddafi ' is likely to have also squirreled away large sums in assumed names or secret numbered accounts, or lockbox/deposit box stashes of currency, precious metals and marketable art and collectibles,' said Comras. Other assets could include indirect . holdings of shares and stakes in businesses and property held under . assumed names or controlled by trusted associates. 'Finding this money will require very advanced financial forensics and it will still be quite difficult to locate,' Comras said. Gilded lifestyle: Gaddafi, right, in golden robes alongside other African leaders at a summit in 2009 . Dappa: Saif Gaddafi poses in one of many tailored suits at Claridge's in London. Right, the dictator's glamorous peroxide-blonde daughter Aisha in a designer dress . Playboy lifestyle: Gaddafi's son Saadi, a former professional footballer, at a nightclub in Germany . Recovery . could ironically be aided by the fact that Gaddafi and his family . regarded the Libyan state's wealth and assets as their own, said Roger . Tamraz, a Dubai-based financier who has had extensive dealings with . Libya. Seeing . Libyan state wealth as their own, they kept most money or assets they . held overseas in sovereign entities such as the Libyan Investment Fund, . which would be easier for Gaddafi's successors to recover than assets . converted to personal use and then concealed, he said. 'When they were running the show, (the Gaddafis) didn't feel they had (to distinguish) between what was government (wealth) and what was private,' Tamraz said. Yet the NTC is moving cautiously in its efforts to recover overseas assets due to the fragility of the Libyan banking system, European and U.S. officials said. Before they can haul in any assets, experts and officials said, the new authorities in Tripoli will have to establish government procedures and mechanisms for efficiently and accountably handling large amounts of recovered wealth. The United Nations gave approval last month for the U.S. government to release $1.5 billion in frozen Libyan assets to Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC), but a U.S. official said Thursday that the NTC had asked for the release so far of only about $700 million of that amount. European officials and private experts said there is no worldwide legal framework or treaty setting procedures for tracing, recovering and repatriating assets misappropriated or abused by deposed regimes. 'There is no single international . legal regime,' so assets will have to be recovered country by country, . said Jonathan Winer, a former U.S. State Department official. Efforts . to recover assets could be further complicated by legal claims, for . example from victims of violence such as IRA bombings in Northern . Ireland carried out with explosives allegedly supplied by Gaddafi, said . Winer. Dealing with . such claims and recovering all assets acquired over Gaddafi's 42-year . reign is going to be an 'unholy legal mess to sort out,' he said. Empty: Gaddafi's sprawling mansion in Englewood, New Jersey, which boasts a tennis court, swimming pool and even a shooting range . Bankers managing assets for Gaddafi and his family might 'now act as if the assets belong to them,' particularly with those converted into personal holdings, said Comras. 'Some of these culprits may eventually be brought to justice. Others are likely to remain undiscovered,' Comras said. Countries where Libyan sovereign assets deemed to have been under the control of Gaddafi or his family include the United States, Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Malta and several African nations. A State Department cable made public by WikiLeaks said that, as of 2006, a Libyan government fund's holdings in Italy included 2 per cent of Fiat, 15 per cent of Tamoil energy company, and 7.5 per cent of soccer club Juventus where Gaddafi's son Saadi once sat on the board. The cable said the fund, known as LFICO, also had over $500 million in investments in Britain.

Pearson, the British publishing giant which owns London's Financial Times, announced in March that, under legal advice, it had frozen a 3.27 percent stake in its shares held by the Libyan Investment Authority. 'We are monitoring the situation closely,' a spokesman for Pearson said on Friday. 'Once the relevant sanctions are lifted, Pearson will take the necessary steps to ensure that the shares and any dividends paid into a blocked account are unfrozen as soon as possible.' A significant amount is still in the hands of surviving members of the deposed tyrant’s family, and could be used to fund insurgents in the newly liberated Libya. Large sums are likely to be in neighbouring countries like Algeria, which are being used as safe havens for Gaddafi’s wife and grown-up children, and grandchildren. It is also thought that members of the Gaddafi family who fled to Algeria were carrying gold bars. In the UK alone, Gaddafi's family owned an £11 million house in Hampstead, north London, and a range of shops and offices in the city's West End. The palatial neo-Georgian townhouse was used by the tyrant's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi before it was taken over by squatters in March. It has a swimming pool and suede-lined cinema room and was purchased in 2009 - but its future is now uncertain. Today, officials claimed Saif has been captured close to Tripoli after suffering critical injuries in a bombing raid. The regime also owned Portman House, a 146,550 sq ft retail complex in Oxford Street, London, which houses retailers such as Boots and New Look, and an office at 14 Cornhill, opposite the Bank of England in the City. In Spain, Gaddafi's Libyan Arab Foreign Bank bought a 7,065-hectare (17,450-acre) property on the Costa del Sol in Andalucia in 1995. The Libyan Arab Foreign Bank, which is owned by Libya's central bank, had tried to build an 18-hole golf course and about 2,000 homes on the land. Another property owned by Gaddafi in the regime's name was a plush estate called Thunder Rock in Englewood, New Jersey. The Government has also held £12 billion deposited in UK banks. The U.S. has frozen £20 billion, Italy £6 billion, Canada £2.4 billion, Austria £1.66 billion and £680 million in Switzerland. Among Gaddafi's investments via the Libya Central Bank are a 3 per cent stake in Pearson Plc, publisher of the Financial Times. Since formally recognising Libya's National Transitional Council, the U.S. government has begun the process of handing back the war torn country's assets. In August the United Nations Security Council approved an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion that the U.S. had seized. Officials said the money was urgently needed to provide basic services, especially electricity. Since then billions have been unfrozen by countries around the world. However so far that has not run smoothly. With so much uncertainty over the governance of Libya, questions have been asked over whither it should go directly to the NTC or instead by used for humanitarian needs. And some countries, such as South Africa, have resisted the call to give Libya's billions back. Investigators around the world will be powerless to find much of the wealth because it will be hidden away with intermediaries and in secret accounts, said France-based Libyan financial analyst Mohammed Haraba. 'The Gaddafis spent years doing what super rich people all over the world do – they hide it,' said Mr Haraba. 'It will be in western financial institutions but also in the hands of those who run former allied countries like Algeria, Syria, and even Zimbabwe. 'The great fear is that survivors from the Gaddafi ruling elite, including members of the family, will be able to get hold of the money so as to fund revolutionary activity in Libya.' Mr Haraba said it was likely new Libyan regime would look to freeze all of the known assets of the Gaddafi family, as the new government in neighbouring Egypt did with the assets of deposed Hosni Mubarak and his family.","Tyrant owned sprawling estates in Spain, New Jersey and London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:25 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:06 EST, 21 September 2012 . An ex-convict who confessed to killing five people at a Dallas-area car wash a week after he was fired from his job there 12 years ago was executed Thursday evening. Robert Wayne Harris, 40, received his lethal injection less than two hours after the U.S. Supreme Court refused appeals to halt his punishment. Harris expressed love to his brother and three friends who were watching through a window. 'I'm going home. I'm going home,' Harris said. 'Don't worry about me. I'll be alright. God bless, and the Texas Rangers, Texas Rangers.' Executed: Robert Wayne Harris was pronounced dead at 6:43 p.m. on Wednesday, making him the eighth Texas inmate to be executed . He snored briefly as the lethal dose of pentobarbital began, then stopped breathing. He was pronounced dead at 6:43 p.m., making him the eighth Texas inmate executed in the nation's most active capital punishment state. Another execution is set for next week. Harris was convicted of two of the five slayings in March 2000 at the Mi-T-Fine Car Wash in Irving. He also was charged with abducting and killing a woman months before the killing spree and led police to her remains. Harris didn't deny the slayings, but his lawyer unsuccessfully contended in appeals he was mentally impaired and should be spared because of a Supreme Court ban on execution of mentally impaired people. Attorney Lydia Brandt also argued prosecutors improperly removed black prospective jurors from serving on his trial jury. Harris is black. Harris died 'without ever having had a fair trial' on the issues, Brandt said. Harris' brother asked to leave the death chamber before the procedure was complete. A half-dozen friends and relatives of the victims also were present, watching in another room. Harris never looked at them. Two of them hugged after it was apparent Harris was dead. They declined to speak with reporters afterward. State attorneys opposed Harris' appeals, saying IQ tests disputed the mental impairment claims and that no racial component was involved in jury selection. The Mi-T-Fine Car Wash in Irving, where Robert Wayne Harris shot five people in March 2000 . Harris had served an eight-year sentence for burglary and other offenses and had been working at the car wash for about 10 months when he was fired and arrested after exposing himself to a female customer. The following Monday, he showed up before the business opened, demanded the safe be opened and then shot the manager, the assistant who had fired Harris and a cashier. Three more employees reporting to work also were shot, two of them fatally. Harris was arrested the next day. 'I remember just the vicious nature of the offense and the fact it was very well thought-out and conceived by Robert Harris,' Greg Davis, the former Dallas County assistant district attorney who was the lead trial prosecutor, said this week. 'Guilt is just crystal clear.' Brad Lollar, one of Harris' trial lawyers, acknowledged that, and said: 'Our whole aim was to get him a life sentence.' Prosecutors tried Harris specifically for two of the slayings: Agustin Villasenor, 36, of Arlington, the assistant manager whose throat also was slit, and cashier Rhoda Wheeler, 46, of Irving. Harris was charged but not tried for killing Villasenor's brother, Benjamin, 32, a seven-year employee; car wash manager Dennis Lee, 48, of Irving; and Roberto Jimenez Jr., 15, an employee from Mexico. The day after Harris confessed to the car wash bloodbath, he led police to the remains of an Irving woman, Sandra Scott, 37, who had been missing for four months. He was charged but never tried for capital murder in her death. Court records showed Harris was 18 when he went to prison for burglary and other charges and after violating probation. He spent most of it in administrative segregation, a confinement level for troublesome inmates. Testimony at his trial showed he set fire to his cell, assaulted and threatened to kill prison staff and inmates, dealt drugs and engaged in sexual misconduct. Harris' mention of the baseball team in his last words isn't the first time a sports team has been referred to from the death chamber gurney. Several have thanked the Dallas Cowboys football team for providing them enjoyment.","Robert Wayne Harris received lethal injection less than two hours after U.S. Supreme Court refused appeals .

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 10:20 EST, 30 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:57 EST, 1 May 2013 . A little girl given a five per cent chance of survival after she developed a rare infection from chickenpox has made a miraculous recovery - thanks to doctors who battled to save her. Three-year-old Libbie Handley developed Streptococcus Toxic Shock Syndrome from a routine case of chickenpox. Within hours of showing symptoms, she was fighting for her life. By the time her mother Janine got her to . a doctor, Libbie's heart rate was at 200 beats per minute, rather than . the expected 140, and she was struggling to breathe. All doctors could do was to give her manual chest compressions to keep air going into her body and her blood circulating. Libby Handley nearly died after developing rare complication Streptococcus Toxic Shock Syndrome from chickenpox. But doctors battled to keep her alive by pumping her chest manually for three days. Remarkably, they did this day and night for three days until she could be transferred to a specialist hospital where she was put on a machine to breathe and circulate blood for her. Her mother Janine, 24, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester,  said: 'Libbie picked up chickenpox from her five-year-old sister Tialir and I didn't think there was anything to worry about. 'But within a few hours, she was being tested for meningitis and her health was rapidly deteriorating. She didn't look like my little girl anymore.' Libbie began struggling to breathe and her oxygen levels dropped, while doctors desperately tried to give her fluids and the correct medication to fight off the infection. However, as medics battled to save the youngster's life, her body began to shut down, so Libbie was put into an induced coma. Just one in 30,000 children contract Streptococcus Toxic Shock Syndrome each year and of these, only four in 10,000 will survive. Her only chance of survival was to be hand-ventilated until she was well enough to be hooked up to a ventilation machine. Ms Handley said: 'One doctor was having to hand-ventilate her because if he stopped, she would have died. I Just kept thinking, he's got to stop at some point, then my little girl will be gone.' Mother Janine Handley said she wasn't concerned when three-year-old daughter Libbie (left) caught chickenpox from five-year-old sister Tialir (right). But within hours, Libbie was developing worrying symptoms so Ms Handley sought medical help. Expecting the worst, Janine had Libbie baptised before she was moved from Tameside Hospital to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital for further treatment - still being hand-ventilated throughout the journey. Janine was told that the only hope was to hook Libbie up to an 'ECMO' machine - a specialist machine which would take over from her hand ventilation treatment. The machine takes blood out of the body, cleans it, while taking on the role of the heart and the lungs. But with just eight machines in the UK, at hospitals so distant that could put Libbie's life at risk, her chances seemed even slimmer than before. Doctors did not have the hi-tech ECMO machine they needed to keep Libbie's heart and lungs working so they took it in turns to manually pump her chest for 72 hours . Eventually Libbie was put on an ECMO machine which kept her alive artificially whilst she fought off the deadly infection she developed . However the Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool found her a place after specialists emphasised how serious Libbie's case was. 'I was told Libbie had just five per cent chance of survival. It was terrifying,' said Janine. Libbie was placed on the ECMO machine for eight days, but after just six, there was a malfunction, meaning she had to be taken off the ventilator while doctors removed it, risking her life. But, amazingly, she survived on her own, and her vital statistics remained consistent for 20 minutes while she remained unaided. Ms Handley says that while doctors said daughter Libbie (left) may struggle a little in school, she has been left with no lasting damage after the infection. Libbie caught chickenpox from sister Tialir (right). Janine said: 'I was petrified she wasn't going to make it but she stayed perfect throughout. It was amazing to see her without needing constant help.' Doctors replaced the ventilator to ensure her heart and lungs were not damaged, and she was taken off the machine after eight days. But Janine's worry wasn't over as she was yet to discover whether her daughter had suffered any lasting damage from the infection. She said: 'Eventually Libbie came round and I was expecting to get my little girl back. But she was having problems with her movement and coordination.' Back to normal: Young Libbie now enjoys playing with her big sister Tialir. 'My Tialir' were the first words Libbie uttered after spending days in an induced coma. Finally, with her mum at her bedside, Libbie spoke her first words following her ordeal. 'She whispered ""My Tialir"",' said Janine. 'I was over the moon because I knew she could remember her life before, and she and her sister were always so close.' After four further days, Libbie began to walk again and showed no serious, lasting damage. It is thought she may struggle slightly when she goes to school, but doctors have been amazed by her recovery. Janine said: 'They nicknamed her the ""ECMO Baby"" because they have never seen a baby on the treatment recover so well. 'We were told she's the worst case they have ever had to put on the ECMO machine. 'She's an amazing little girl and has totally changed since she was poorly. She sings everything now and makes herself heard with everything. She's a little miracle.'","Three-year-old Libbie Handley developed rare infection from chickenpox .

"By . James Chapman, Tamara Cohen and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 17:38 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:13 EST, 30 April 2013 . Upbeat: UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the press today while visiting South Shields to campaign with local candidate Richard Elvin . Tory voters tempted to switch to the UK Independence Party in Thursday’s local elections are being warned they risk letting in Labour. The Conservatives say a surge in support for Nigel Farage’s Eurosceptic party will merely help the pro-EU Ed Miliband. The warning came as a new poll showed one in five over-50s could vote UKIP at the next general election. The counter the threat, Tories hope to quell the turmoil in their own ranks by stressing a ‘Vote Farage, get Miliband’ message to counter the growing support for UKIP, who are likely to win more votes than the Liberal Democrats. The move follows Ken Clarke’s scathing attack on UKIP as a party of ‘clowns’ supported by racists and ‘indignant, angry people’. Senior Tory figures expressed dismay yesterday at the veteran Cabinet minister’s unscripted remarks. They warned that attacking UKIP in such intemperate terms and insulting voters tempted to back them is likely to prove counterproductive. Tory strategists claim to be encouraged that voters fed up with the Government are not turning to Labour and are instead expressing a protest vote through a Right-wing alternative. They believe many can be persuaded to return to the fold at the General Election, when the choice will be between a government led by David Cameron committed to an EU referendum, lower welfare spending and reform of human rights laws or one led by Ed Miliband proposing none of those. A new poll suggested almost a fifth of over-50s could back UKIP at the next general election, making it the second most popular party with older voters. UKIP's election operation descended into further chaos today over whether or not an MP's father is standing for the party in Thursday's elections. At 2.30pm UKIP leader Nigel Farage announced that Sushil Patel, father of Priti Patel, was running on a UKIP ticket. Just after 4pm it was reported that Mr Patel was standing down as a UKIP candidate. But shortly before 5pm UKIP insisted he was still on board, claiming he remains the candidate for the Bushey South Division in the Hertfordshire County Council elections. The party added that he is 'currently convalescing from a recent serious operation and is unable to conduct any further interviews'. Mr. Patel said: 'I am proud of being a UKIP candidate and very proud of the achievements of my daughter who represents the people of Witham in an exemplarily fashion. 'My views are my own and I am astonished that there has been quite so much interest in my candidacy.' The Conservatives topped the national poll of over-50s by Populus for Saga with 25 per cent, with UKIP second on 18 per cent. Its support is also lower among richer voters, unlike the Conservatives, the survey revealed. UKIP was most popular in the South East and South West of England, with 21% and 20% of those questioned saying they would give it their vote. The Prime Minister signalled a new strategy for dealing with UKIP yesterday when he insisted Thursday’s local elections are chiefly a choice between the ‘blue team and the red team’. Speaking in Bridgwater, Somerset, Mr Cameron declined to repeat the suggestion that UKIP is a racist party. He said: ‘It’s a simple and straight choice, at your county council and at the next election, between the blue team who want to keep getting the deficit down, who want to keep reforming immigration and welfare to make it fair, or you have the red team who put the deficit up and who don’t care if our immigration and welfare system works at all.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson agreed . that Tories should not ‘slag them [UKIP] off just for appearing to . think, in large part, what many Conservatives think’. ‘[Nigel . Farage] is a blooming Conservative, for heaven’s sake; and yet he’s in . our constituencies, wooing our audiences, nicking our votes, and . threatening to put our councillors out of office,’ he said. Tory . MP Chris Kelly said: ‘Yes, UKIP have a problem with some of their . candidates but Ken Clarke is plain wrong to use the word “clowns”.’ Mr . Farage insisted yesterday: ‘There is nothing in UKIP that is in any way . racist at all.’ Mainstream battle: David Cameron, left, warned that voters tempted by UKIP would only succeed in splitting the right wing vote and helping Labour's Ed Miliband, right . He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘We have one million unemployed, wages have been driven down and  I’m afraid to say, a crime wave in London being driven by Romanians. ‘I don’t want to be part of the European Union and I believe proper immigration controls  are in the interests of this country and I want to stop building wind turbines over the prettiest parts of Britain.’ The Tories are engaged in a bitter war of words with UKIP ahead of Thursday’s local elections. Here, Home Affairs Editor James Slack examines the parties’ policies: . EUROPEUKIP: Withdraw from the EU, its treaties and obligations. The party estimates a saving to the UK of £6.4billion in net contributions. UKIP quotes TaxPayers’ Alliance research that the overall cost of our EU membership to the wider economy is £120billion a year.Tories: Renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU then give people the ‘simple choice’ between staying in under those new terms or leaving. Referendum to take place no later than 2017. TAXUKIP: Introduce a flat rate tax at a suggested rate of 25 per cent. Make the first £13,000 of income tax-free, transferable between couples. Combined policy would cost £20billion a year.

CCTV images have captured the moment a woman brazenly stole a charity box full of cash from a mobility shop. The woman, accompanied by a young boy and appearing drunk, visited Eden Mobility in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, posing as a customer. Unaware she was being caught on camera, the woman picked up a collection box for the British Heart Foundation and shook it, seemingly checking how much money was inside. Captured: The woman who appeared drunk visited Eden Mobility in Wakefield posing as a customer . She is then captured putting the cash box into her handbag before a member of staff returns from the back of the shop. The thief then pretended she needed to get some cash because her credit card was damaged - but unsurprisingly, she did not return. John Heaton, senior manager at Eden Mobility, said: 'In my opinion stealing money that has been collected for charity is worse than stealing stock from the shop. 'It's a very callous thing to do. Brazen: The woman can be seen picking up the charity collection box . 'I don't think this was an impulsive decision. The woman smelt strongly of alcohol and the fact that she had a child with her makes it worse.' When staff realised the cash box had been stolen they checked CCTV footage and found these images. They are now appealing for anyone with information about the woman to come forward. When the member of staff went to the back of the shop, the woman puts the box into her bag . They have also passed the footage to police. The woman is described as white, in her late 20s with long dark hair and wearing a grey top with beige Ugg-style boots. The theft happened at around 4.45pm on Wednesday May 15. Inspector Richard Close, of the Central neighbourhood police team, said: 'This offence shows either extreme desperation or someone with no conscience. Caught: The woman then casually walks out with the charity box in her bag unaware she had been filmed . 'Thefts always end up having a victim, in this case there are numerous victims who would have benefited from other people's generosity. 'If you can identify the woman in the picture please contact the police.' A spokeswoman for the British Heart Foundation condemned the theft as as 'very sad'.","The woman appeared drunk when she entered the shop in Wakefield .

The Army commander of a remote Alaskan base is under investigation for sexual misconduct, after allegedly allowing officers to have affairs and for permitting scantily clad women soldiers to pose for a calendar. Soldiers at the anti-ballistic missile base claimed  Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley had created a 'toxic environment' by turning a blind eye to cases of sexual misconduct. It was claimed that women soldiers at Fort Greely were also being allowed to trade sexual favors for favorable treatment from officers. Target: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley's wife, Tracey, featured as the August picture on a racy calender he approved of women at the base . Even if sexual misconduct is consensual, the Army forbids commanders to have relationships with their subordinates. Marco Morales, spokesman for the Space . and Missile Defense Command, confirmed the commander was under investigation in an email . obtained by Bloomberg. Incidents of inappropriate sexual relations between officers and soldiers had increased because no disciplinary action was being taken, according to three sources, who spoke to the news agency on the condition of anonymity. Lieutenant Colonel Miley declined to comment about the allegations when contacted by Bloomberg, referring the news agency to unit’s public affairs office. The spokesman there directed queries to the Space and Missile Defense Command. An anonymous complaint was made against Lieutenant Colonel Miley earlier in the year, after he promoted a racy calender featuring his wife Tracey as the August shot, alongside women from the base. An alleged inappropriate relationship had formed between the soldier who took the photos and one of the soldiers who posed in it. The owner of a bar near the base, defended the $25 charity calender for the American Cancer Society as 'tasteful' and said it had been selling well. Family values: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, with his wife Tracey, and daughter . Criticized: Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, pictured with his wife Tracey and child, is accused of creating a 'toxic environment' Patsy Ewing, co-owner of Clearwater Lodge, told Army Times she had received no complaints about the calendar, which features a shot taken in her establishment. She added however, that the bar did not attract conservative customers. Lieutenant General Richard Formica, of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said the allegation would be investigated, but that he did not believe there had been any 'wrongdoing', according to the Army Times. He added that any potential impact on the command and its family readiness group would be monitored. In an email to Lieutenant General . Richard Formica, head of the Space and Missile Defense Command, soldiers . at the base complained that Commander Miley’s alleged condoning of sexual affairs left them fearing 'for our wives and even our children in this toxic environment'. At least 16 women serve at Fort . Greely, a launch site for anti-ballistic-missile missiles, such as the . ones the U.S. fears are being developed in Iran and North Korea. Military officials told NBC News that by allegedly condoning the behavior Lieutenant Colonel Miley had, in effect, created an 'open season' when it came to sexual activity among troops. One official said: 'It's as if that was the only thing to do' at the remote base. It comes as the Department of Defense . increases its efforts to prevent sexual assault, after reporting this . month that the number of cases has increased in the past year. Remote: The Army's Fort Greely anti-ballistic missile base is located in the Alaskan wilderness . Defense: Fort Greely is a launch site for missiles capable of taking down long-range weapons . On Friday, President Obama called on . Naval Academy graduates in Maryland to 'live with integrity' to improve . trust in the military. 'Those who commit sexual assault are not . only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that . make our military strong,' he said at the graduation in . Annapolis. Figures released by the Department of . Defense estimate there were 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, . from groping to rape, in 2012. This was a 35 per cent rise in the number . of cases reported in 2010. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is due to . address West Point graduates on Saturday, three days after a Sergeant at . the academy was charged with secretly filming and photographing women . there. Two Army officers assigned to prevent sexual assault are also currently under investigation for alleged attacks, according to CNN. An Army sergeant first class, who . worked at Ford Hood's sexual assault prevention unit in Texas, is being . investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual . contact and maltreatment of subordinates. In Arlington, an Air Force officer . responsible for an assault prevention unit has been charged with sexual . battery after allegedly fondling a woman in the car park near his . office. Force for good: President Obama calls on Naval Academy graduates in Maryland to help restore trust . A Fort Bragg soldier who helps run . the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program at the North Carolina base, said sexual assault . damaged the strong bonds within the Army. 'This crime of violence, soldier upon soldier, it breaks your trust,' Sgt First Class Josalette R. Simmons, said. 'A lot of victims are young soldiers . who have left home for the first time and they come in thinking they're . going to be part of another, bigger family, then this happens. It's . almost as bad as being sexually assaulted by someone from your own . family, just breaks that bond of trust,' the 25-year-old who won . official recognition for her efforts, added. In an open letter to troops this month, Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno said the Army was failing in its efforts to prevent sexual assault.

A six-year-old boy was lucky to be alive after being savaged by a neighbour's out-of-control dog  in his own back garden . Erfan Ali, of Cardiff, underwent a five-hour operation at the weekend after being bitten in the face by the Rhodesian Ridgeback on Friday afternoon. Medics told his parents their little boy, whose cheeks were torn away by the dog, will be scarred for life and will have to undergo surgery to rebuild his face. Erfan also suffered injuries to his right arm and hand and was lucky to escape with his life. His father, Dilwar Ali, 38, said: 'My child has lost both sides of his face. He will never get back to normal. 'The dog was really attacking my boy badly - it bit his right and left cheeks and his left hand has been damaged as well. 'There was blood everywhere.' The attack happened in family's back garden in Gabalfa as Erfan was helping his mother, Monowara Ali, take in washing. She fled into the house with her son but was unable to stop the dog forcing its way into the kitchen and continuing the attack. The dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Tyson which has since been destroyed, continued the attack until its owner managed to bundle it outside. Erfan was initially taken to University Hospital, Cardiff, and was later transferred to a special unit at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. Surgery: Erfan, six, also suffered injuries to his right arm and hand and was lucky to escape with his life The attack happened when he was helping his mother bring in the washing . Despite an urgent operation for his facial injuries he will have to undergo extensive further surgery, with skin grafts, as he grows up. The child initially received rapid treatment for his injuries at home after his quick thinking sister, Masudah, 12, called paramedics. 'My son went into the garden to help his . mother to collect the washing when the dog from next door jumped the . fence and grabbed my son's hand,' Mr Ali, told BBC Wales online. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are a South African . breed of dog known for their bravery. Male dogs are often more than 70 cm tall and weigh around 85lb. They are also known as African . Lion Hounds as they have been used to hunt lions. They are not banned in . the UK. They are said to be calm, gentle and obedient but can become highly strung if they do not get enough exercise . 'The dog was very aggressive. My son managed to get back to the house, but the dog would not let go and carried on attacking him.' Mr Ali, who operates the family run Nahin Spice Centre, in Caerphilly Road, Cardiff, said he arrived home on Friday, to find blood everywhere. He added: 'We've been told by the hospital consultant that Erfan will have permanent scars. 'My son is well known in our community and is a big Cardiff City fan.' He added: 'I don't want this to happen to other children.' The dog's owner, who did not want to be named, said: 'I am just feeling really bad, I am just devastated over the situation. 'I climbed over the fence because I could hear screaming and I could see the dog in next door's hallway. 'He was barking so I just quickly grabbed him. I didn't know what had happened. 'I saw the little boy and the blood on his face. You can imagine what I thought then - it was just panic.' The owner insisted Tyson had never attacked anyone before and had been 'a lovely dog.' 'He just flipped,' he added.' The incident is being investigated by South Wales Police and no one has been arrested.","Erfan Ali was 'lucky to be alive' after the vicious attack .

The second-highest official in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey is stepping down in the wake of a sex scandal involving a former priest accused of violating an agreement barring him from working with children. After the Reverend Michael Fugee was accused of molesting children, vicar general Monsignor John Doran signed a court document promising to supervise the priest in the future. However, Fugee was discovered to have violated his lifetime ban on ministering to children last week, leading to Doran's resignation.

Church officials say that Doran's resignation is among several changes the archdiocese says it's implementing to protect children.

'Appointing a new Vicar General will be just one step in a . comprehensive plan to strengthen our . internal protocols and ensure we are doing everything we can to . safeguard the children of our community,' Myers said in the letter. He continued to note that an outside review found 'operational failures' in the handling of the Rev. Michael Fugee, who also resigned this month. Rev. Michael Fugee broke an agreement with law enforcement to never work with children. He was forced to resign from the Catholic church, along with his supervisor John Doran . Myers statement doesn't blame Doran, who had been vicar general for six years, for the lax in oversight.. Fugee, 52, was convicted in 2003 of fondling a boy in Wyckoff. However, that verdict was vacated because of judicial error. Fugee . entered a program to avoid retrial, overseen by Doran, and agreed to never again work with . children. Fugee violated his agreement when he recently attended youth retreats and heard children's confessions. Myers has faced heavy criticism over his handling of the Fugee case, with victims' advocates and some politicians calling for him to resign. But in the letter, Myers said the archdiocese has an 'exemplary record of addressing allegations against our clergy.' Fugee, 52, was convicted in 2003 of fondling a boy in Wyckoff.

He had been fired from his job just two days after the explosion and his wife, Brittany, left him shortly thereafter.

'Last night was very hard, but I know I worried a lot of you and I am so very sorry,' Reed wrote. 'I am incredibly emotional right now, and it seems like every time I turn around somebody is critiquing me. I’m vertical/breathing so I really cant complain, but I would encourage all of you to follow this: LOVE, not fake love, but LOVE one another.'

INCREDIBLY kind people who are taking donations so I can get a HOME AND . LIFE back, however, never would I PROFIT from anyones death. I loved . and still love Cyrus A. Reed, and he loved me. I did and will do what I . thought was right. Was I emotionally devistated? Hell yes I was. Have . your brother die, your town explode, your crew be emotionally wrecked, . and in the midst of it have your wife leave you because you are lost in . your own emotions: ALL IN THE SAME WEEK, and see how you fare. People I . am doing my BEST to hold myself together, but please for the love of God . quit picking me apart. I have to bury yet ANOTHER friend tomorrow. God . Bless . Public grief: At last month's public memorial for the 12 people killed responding to the fire, Bryce Reed (pictured) gave a heartfelt and often humorous eulogy for his close friend Cyrus Reed (not related) WATCH MORE HERE . The sister of Cyrus Reed (not . related), the firefighter Bryce Reed eulogized last month, said her . family had been 'fooled' by him. 'He convinced us that he and Cyrus . were very close, like brothers,' Sarah Reed said. 'But I want people to . know they are not brothers, and he is not part of our family.' Sarah Reed told the Morning News that . she and her family had gone through Cyrus Reed’s computer and cell . phone records and, as the paper put it, 'found that the two first . responders might not have been as close as the suspect led the public to . believe.' Furthermore, Sarah Reed said, she had . asked police to guard Cyrus Reed’s apartment, because she was concerned . that Bryce Reed had been stealing from it. In fact, state health officials have . confirmed that Reed was fired from his EMT job at the Texas emergency . response squad just two days after the catastrophic blast, accused of . stealing from a fireman killed in the explosion. Speaker: Bryce Reed was a paramedic who essentially became a spokesperson for the town of West after last month's deadly explosion at a fertilizer facility . Charged: Bryce Reed, a first responder at the fertilizer plant blast in West, Texas, is facing a charge of possession of a destructive device . Still, Reed's arrest was drawing . attention in part because in the days following the blast, Reed didn't . shy away from media attention in West. He gave interviews to most major . news outlets. At last month's public memorial for . the 12 people killed responding to the fire, Reed gave a heartfelt and . often humorous eulogy for someone whom he claimied was a his close . friend of hit, Cyrus Reed. He gave lengthy interviews to reporters, while other emergency responders didn't want to talk. Another of Reed's bizarre claims came . in an interview outside the Czech Inn on April 21, when he spoke about . being sick and facing his own mortality. He said that he lost 60 pounds in . five months, and that doctors couldn't pinpoint the source of his ailing . stomach despite performing 26 biopsies. Three days after the explosion, Reed . climbed onto a coffee table at a local hotel where displaced families . picked over donated sweatshirts and pizza, telling the crowd, 'You're . safe where you're at.'If you're not, I'd be dragging you out of here myself.' Clearup: Students clean debris at a home in West, Texas, that was damaged due to the explosion. The blast caused tens of millions of dollars in damage to the surrounding area . Fatalities: Among the 14 people killed were 10 emergency responders . On Friday afternoon in West, several . of Reed's neighbors stood outside near his red brick duplex, a . neighborhood less than a mile from the plant where some homes' windows . remained boarded. They said they were shocked about his arrest. Crystal Le Dane said he was a good . neighbor who had changed her flat tire and sometimes gave medical advice . about her children's minor injuries and rashes. 'I would say he's an everyday guy. I never saw a red flag,' she said. Reed grew up in suburban Dallas and said he had lived in West for 12 years. On his LinkedIn profile, Reed said he spent time at the U.S. Biological and Chemical Weapon Depot in Ft McClellan, Alabama. Reed also lists one year from . 2010-2011 as a technician/regional safety officer for Allied . International Emergency LLC., where he said response teams dealt with . 'Weapons of Mass Destruction Response, Nuclear Event Management, . Chemical or Biological Weapons Containment, Large Scale Environmental . Loss Mitigation, to DOT/EPA small scale spill cleanup...' However, in a profile, the Dallas . Morning News found other inconsistencies in Reed’s self-portrayal, . including degrees listed on his resume that it appears he never actually . completed. Residents began to have more serious . questions about Reed after it appeared he had woven different stories to . different people about what had happened, and alternately telling . people he was a police officer and a government representative. The paper surmises that it is hard to know what is true and what is fabrication when it comes to Reed. By Wednesday of this week, Reed began . to buckle under the pressure and wrote that he was going to take a . break from Facebook to “reflect.” 'I assure you that I’m ok,' he wrote. 'God bless you all, and please if you heed nothing else I have said, . love one another. God bless. Bryce.' He'll have plenty of time to reflect now he is in police custody until his next court hearing in the middle of next week. Read the court's affidavit against Reed...","EMT Bryce Reed was fired from West, Texas' emergency response squad on April 19, two days after the devastating explosion at a fertilizer plant .

As the U.S. prepares to remember its war dead on Memorial Day, a 91-year-old who flew missions in the Second World War will be taking to the skies again over England. Clarence E ‘Bud’ Anderson is taking part in a historic flypast as the UK pays tribute to the bravery of US Airmen who served there in the Second World War. Mr Anderson's return to the UK is part of the first ever display by the specially-formed Eagle Squadron of four vintage warplanes. Memorial Day: Former U.S. airman Clarence 'Bud' Anderson stands by the P-51 Mustang at Duxford, in Cambridge, where the 91-year-old will take part in a fly past . The display will commemorate the role of the US Army’s Eighth Air Force at a spring air show at the Imperial War Museum's Duxford aerodrome. Eagle Squadrons were formed by American volunteers who signed up to fight alongside Royal Air Force’s pilots battling Nazi tyranny, before the U.S. entered the war after the  Pearl Harbor attack. Representing the aircraft they flew during the war in Europe will be a rare P-51C Mustang that has been shipped to England from the U.S. to take part in the show, alongside a Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. The aircraft will be piloted by Dan Friedkin, Ed Shipley, Steve Hinton and Paul Bonhomme. The Americans are best known as the Bremont Horsemen Flight Team and have performed spectacular P-51 Mustang displays at Duxford before. Mr Bonhomme is an airline pilot and Red Bull Air Race champion who has displayed historic aircraft at more than 700 air shows to date. Mr Friedkin said: ‘It is a great honor to present the Eagle Squadron, a vivid aerial tribute to the 70th anniversary of American involvement in the Second World War.' Air display: Paul Bonhomme with a Hawker Hurricane. The champion pilot will take part in the vintage fly past . Ready for take off: The Eagle Squadron's Supermarine Spitfire is pictured with the Hawker Hurricane above . Ready for action: The P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang will feature in the display . ‘We look forward to debuting this tribute, flying in the vintage fighters which once soared over Europe, in memory of the brave aces who piloted them and the greater Anglo-American air power alliance.’ Almost half a million airmen served with what became known as the ‘Mighty Eighth’ in England and of them about 26,000 flight crews were killed, and 21,000 ended up in prisoner of war camps. More than 3,300 fighters were destroyed as well as 6,500 B-17 and B-24 bombers being lost. Sunday’s air show takes place on the 70th anniversary of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visiting RAF Duxford to welcome the 78th Fighter Group of the US Army Air Force to Great Britain in 1943. The 78th was based at Duxford from where it flew P-47s on bomber escort missions, before later switching to P-51s. Royal visit: Princess Elizabeth visited US Airmen with her mother, Queen Elizabeth, in 1943 . Flying visit: The arrival of the 'Mighty Eighth during the Second World War was known as the 'friendly invasion' Mr Anderson, who was born in California, flew the P-51 Mustang ‘Old Crow’ while stationed with the 357th Fighter Group in East Anglia during the Second World War. The pilot notched up 16 and a quarter aerial victories and, at 91, remains an active pilot. He is due to make a spectacular arrival on the day of the show – flying in the rear of a two-seater Mustang. B-17 Flying Fortress ‘Sally-B’ has been gracing British skies for almost 40 years and serves as a flying memorial to the US airmen who gave their lives  during the Second World War.The four-engined aircraft is operated by a charitable trust and has survived with no official support. All its costs are met by voluntary donations, merchandise sales and an active club of supporters.The trust’s aim is to teach the public about the role of the aircraft and its crews who flew from the UK during the Second World War.Elly Sallingboe is the driving force behind the Sally-B Charitable Trust and has devoted her life to keeping the aircraft flying.She said: ‘This is a living piece of our national heritage and must be preserved for the enjoyment and education of today’s and future generations.’Built at the Lockheed-Vega production line at Burbank, California in spring 1945, Sally-B has featured in TV programs and movies, including Memphis Belle.The aircraft was brought to Britain by pilot Ted White in 1975. After he was killed in a flying accident in 1982, his partner Elly Sallingboe decided to take on the challenge of keeping it flying. She has been supported by a  team, led by chief engineer Peter Brown and Derek Smith, who is in charge of ground support. The four Eagle Squadron fighters will . also display alongside B-17 ‘Sally-B’, Europe’s only remaining Flying . Fortress bomber which has served as a flying memorial for the past 38 . years. Duxford, near Cambridge, is Britain’s best-preserved Second World War airfield and was in the front line of the Battle of Britain in Summer 1940 when missions were led by Douglas Bader, best-known for flying despite two tin legs. It has a history dating back to the First World War and also houses the American Air Museum, which is the biggest memorial to US airmen in Europe. During the so-called friendly invasion of America’s armed forces in wartime Britain, Duxford became known as the ‘country club’ of the European theater of operations. Because it was a permanent RAF station, it had brick buildings and central heating. This was in stark contrast to many of the hastily-erected airfields the 8th Air Force occupied, which featured poorly-heated temporary huts and tents. A book by John Nicol and Tony Rennell, describes the impact of the Eighth Air Force. Tail-End Charlies recalls: ‘[More than] 25,000 of America’s finest young men had died in the air battles over Germany. Unlike the British, their land had not been bombed; they were not under threat of invasion. ‘They had come to a strange country far from home and from their loved ones to fight an enemy who threatened freedom. They had died in that cause and they deserved to be honored by those who survived while they still could.’","91-year-old American airman returns to British skies for air show .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:49 EST, 15 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 15 May 2013 . Devastated: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her California home last month . Tapes of the frantic 911 call made by . Leila Fowler's step-mother on the day that the eight-year-old was . allegedly murdered by her brother have been released. Leila's father's girlfriend wasn't home at the time of the attack but she was the person to place a call with emergency services. In a recording released Tuesday, she can be heard calling 911 and saying that the children, . including Leila Fowler, were OK. 'My children are at home alone and a man just ran out of our house. My . older son was in the bathroom and my daughter started screaming. He came . out and a man was in the house,' the panicked caller says in the call . made April 27. 'They said they're OK.' She added, 'My daughter is freaking out right now.' In fact, Leila Fowler was dying of stab wounds. Leila's brother has since been arrested and charged with second-degree murder with special circumstances for using a dangerous weapon in the crime. On Tuesday, attorney Mark Reichel admitted the youngster . might have lied about seeing a long-haired man fleeing the scene, but . that doesn't make the boy the killer. He said his client might have made up a 'macho' story about scaring away the intruder because he was scared. Scroll down for video . Vigil: Barney Fowler, pictured with his family (including Leila's siblings who are not identified) mourned the loss of the little girl but said that he backed his son until evidence proved otherwise . Reichel said that after visiting with the boy, he and law partner Steve . Plesser met with the family and toured the hillside home where the . stabbing took place. Reichel declined to say what they spoke about. 'They're all doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances, and the circumstances are not good,' Reichel said. The boy was expected to make his first court appearance on Wednesday, but his name has not been released since he is a minor. ""How does a 12-year-old commit the perfect crime?"" said Reichel, whose . firm was part of a team that two years ago successfully defended members . of the Hmong community, including former Gen. Vang Pao, against charges . they plotted to overthrow the government of Laos. Reichel declined to comment on the emotional state of the boy or his family. 'They're going through a very difficult time,' he said. Leila's father Barney Fowler spoke briefly on Monday and said, 'Until they have . the proper evidence to show it's my son, we're standing behind him. If . they have the evidence, well that's another story. We're an honest . family.' The boy told investigators on April . 27 that he encountered a random attacker in the family home while his . father was attending a Little League game. He described the man as tall . with long gray hair. The boy said the man fled on foot and he found his sister, Leila Fowler, bleeding. Defending her son: A day before a 12-year-old boy was arrested for the stabbing to death of his 8-year-old sister, Leila Fowler, his mother Priscilla Rodriquez described him as 'protective' of his younger sibling . Leila's death set off an intense manhunt in the rural community where some residents had moved to escape big city crime. The Calaveras County Sheriff's Office spent more than 2,000 man-hours amassing evidence and searching door-to-door. Residents . of the rural community began locking their doors and calling . authorities when they thought they saw men who fit the description. They also held fundraisers for the Fowler family and turned out by the thousands for a candlelight vigil in Leila's honor. 'We're thankful to the community and all they've done for my daughter,' Mr Fowler said. He . echoed comments made earlier on Monday by his son, Justin Fowler, 19, . who said the family was in shock and extremely sad about the boy's . arrest. Justin said the . family is 'in a fog' over the boy's arrest that has rocked the . community of Valley Springs. Horrifying: Leila Fowler's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs when he claimed he had encountered an intruder . The . arrested boy had appeared at a vigil for his sister on April 30, along with . brother Justin, who was photographed with the name 'Leila' written on . his forearm. Calaveras Unified School District made counselors available on Monday at all schools. Police released no information about . what led them to arrest the unidentified 12-year-old for the April 27 . attack. Following the crime, investigators . did a door-to-door sweep of . homes, storage sheds and horse stables scattered across the oak-studded . foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Divers also searched two nearby . reservoirs in search of clues. A neighbor told detectives she saw a man flee the home . but she later recanted the story. Police said there was no sign of a . burglary or robbery. As part of the investigation, authorities seized . several knives from the Fowler home, where Leila lived with her father, . stepmother and siblings.

Leila's brother was taken into custody at 5:10 p.m. Saturday and police hastily called a news conference to announce the arrest. ‘Citizens of Calaveras County, you can sleep a little better tonight,’ Kuntz said. Authorities spent over 2,000 hours on . the investigation ‘to provide Leila Fowler's family answers to her . death,’ the sheriff said. Kuntz said at the time the investigation was ongoing. He declined to provide further details. Several days after the killing, . hundreds of people gathered at Jenny Lind Elementary School where Leila . was a popular 3rd grader.

Millions of Italians cannot afford to heat their homes properly or eat meat as their country is racked by recession and soaring unemployment, according to a new report. Researchers found the number of people considered seriously deprived has doubled in the past two years. The findings from national statistics institute ISTAT underline the scale of the challenge faced by the new coalition government of Enrico Letta, which has vowed to stimulate growth and tackle a youth jobless rate of almost 40 per cent. One in seven Italians say they cannot afford to eat meat once every two days as poverty in the country doubles . A recession that has lasted almost two years has taken a heavy toll on ordinary Italians who are increasingly digging into their savings, ISTAT said in its annual report. Italy has the highest level in Europe of young people who are neither in education nor employment, at 23.9 per cent, the study showed. In Italy's impoverished south, one in three people aged 15-29 fell into this group. The number of people living in families considered to be seriously deprived has doubled in the past two years to 8.6million, or about 14 per cent of the population, ISTAT said. Families who meet more than four of nine poverty indicators are considered seriously deprived. Pictured: Perugia University. Italy has the highest number of young people not in work or education in Europe . Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has vowed to stimulate growth and reduce the youth unemployment rate of 40 per cent . These include not being able to heat their home adequately, which affected one in five people in 2012 according to the report, twice as many as in 2010. The percentage of people in families who could not afford to eat a protein-based meal such as meat every two days rose to 16.6 per cent in 2012 from 12.4 the previous year and 6.7 per cent in 2010. More than 50 per cent were unable to afford one week of holiday away from home last year, ISTAT said, with the figure rising to 69 per cent in the south. About 14.9million people, or a quarter of Italy's 61million population, are living in families that meet three of more of ISTAT's poverty indicators. Just 57.6 per cent of young people who graduated within the last three years are in employment, well below a European average of 77.2 per cent, the data showed. Italians' purchasing power fell by 4.8 per cent last year, an 'exceptionally steep' decline caused largely by aggressive tax hikes aimed at strengthening public finances, following four years of smaller falls, ISTAT said. A traditionally high savings rate in Italy has dwindled steadily and is now far below those of France and Germany, with the situation becoming particularly acute in the poor south, the report said.","Italians struggle to heat homes or buy meat as poverty doubles in two years .

Even when his own parents begged him to cooperate with the police and implicate her in the murder, Sollecito said he couldn’t because he knew she was innocent. ‘(Amanda) told me that she thinks that I’m a kind of hero, but I don’t feel so,’ Sollecito told the Today show on Friday morning. ‘And I don’t need any kind of gratitude...

Then two months ago, Italy’s highest court overturned that decision and ordered a new trial to begin within the next year.

Knox received a grilling from various U.S. media outlets following the release of ‘Waiting to Be Heard' on April 30. Earlier this month she told CNN's Chris Cuomo that despite her characterization in the Italian media as a sexual deviant, she has not experimented with any sort of sex games. Knox was adamant as she told Cuomo: 'I've never taken part in an orgy - ever.'

She said she was shocked during the trial, when lawyers for the prosecution were calling her a 'whore' and a 'deviant.' She says that Italian prosecutors made up allegations that she was a sex and drug-crazed party girl to bolster their case. Knox said that her book, Waiting to Be Heard, is aimed at debunking those criticisms. She said: 'In the book I talk about all my sexual experiences... I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip.' Knox added: 'No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, no witnesses have ever come out saying things like that.' She also told Cuomo that now that she's home in Washington, she doesn't go to parties - and no longer smokes pot. Watch video here .

Vivacious spirit: Catherine Gorayeb, pictured, was at a breakfast conference in the North tower of the World Trade Center when the planes struck . A woman whose sister was killed on 9/11 is in court today fighting to adopt the 14-year-old niece she's raised as her own after the girl's biological father gave her up at birth. Catherine Gorayeb, a single mother after banker Edward Kranz first denied paternity and then gave up custody rights, was attending a breakfast conference in Windows on the World in the North tower when the planes hit and she tragically died after making a panicked call to her brother. Immediately following her death, Catherine's sister, Claire Gorayeb, who was three-months pregnant herself, uprooted her life as a travel agent in Boston and moved back to her native New York City to raise her two-year-old niece who had suddenly been left motherless. But in 2004, soon after the young girl, who MailOnline isn't identifying, was awarded $2 million from the 9/11 victims compensation fund, Kranz reappeared in his daughter's life, and has been fighting Gorayeb for custody or at least access since, as she strives to adopt her niece. After a nine-year court battle, the . fight will come to a head today with a hearing in Manhattan Surrogate . Court to determine what is in the best interest of the teenager, . according to DNAInfo. Gorayeb, . 54, claims Kranz disappeared from his daughter's life for four years . and should have no say in the adoption he is attempting to scupper. But . Kranz, 50, of Murray Hill, claims Gorayeb, who has allegedly blocked . him from seeing the girl, shouldn't be allowed to adopt his daughter. '[Her] best interests require regular visitation with me, her father,' he says in court papers, according to DNAInfo. Catherine, who was 41 when she died, was described in a New York . Times article in December 2002 as a witty and adventurous woman who . would do anything for those she loved, especially her daughter. The . successful marketing director fell pregnant after a short-lived fling . with Kranz, a New York City banker, and decided to go ahead with the . pregnancy. Fight: Claire Gorayeb, pictured, is fighting to adopt her niece whose mother died on 9/11 . After her daughter was born in . February 1999, Kranz denied he was her father though a court-ordered . paternity test that September showed a strong probability that he was. Court papers show that the following January, the former lovers came to an agreement whereby Kranz withdrew any custody and visitation rights in exchange for Catherine giving up on child support. It was four years before he saw or contacted his daughter, the documents state. When Catherine died, she was living in Battery Park City, close by her parents and within walking distance of her job at Random Walk Computing. And, from accounts, being a single mom suited her just fine. A woman who worked at her daughter's . nursery, where Catherine was never late at pick up time, . said she was known to everyone as 'Bagel Mom' because every single morning she arrived armed with fresh bagels from . the bakery. 'Catherine . would come in the door and would enthusiastically proclaim ""I am the . bagel mom"" and would pass out bagels with (her daughter) to all of the . children in the classroom,' the woman said. 'She . was very vivacious and had so much energy. Catherine always addressed . every child in the room by name before taking (her daughter) home. I didn't know Catherine well, but I do know that she loved (her . daughter) to pieces and that (her daughter) loved her.' But after her death, her sister was quick to assume the 'mommy' role as best she could. Tragedy: Single mother, Catherine Gorayeb, was at a breakfast meeting when a plane hit the twin towers . Using cash from the 9/11 compensation fund, Gorayeb rented and later bought an Upper West Side apartment for her niece, her biological daughter and herself to live in. Around this time she was . appointed the child's legal guardian and the pair quickly formed a deep bond. According to a Boston Globe article, the then three-year-old interchangeably called Gorayeb 'Claire' and 'mommy.' In court papers, her lawyer said Gorayeb gave the girl 'a safe, loving and caring home' and paid for summer camp and a private school for both girls as well as taking them to museums. Kranz reemerged in the family's lives just two weeks after his daughter was rewarded the payout in 2004, the same year he filed for bankruptcy. He called Gorayeb to say he'd read . that Catherine had been killed in the terrorist attack after searching . her name online and weeks later, in February 2004, sent his daughter a . photo of himself, which is when Gorayeb filed for adoption. Kranz . later claimed his absence in the child's life was because he was . waiting for his daughter to turn five before getting in touch. The . messy court battle began in June that year, when Kranz attempted to get . custody of the girl and reverse Gorayeb's guardianship. Remembering: Catherine Gorayeb's family erected a memorial bench, pictured, in their loved one's honor after 9/11 . In March 2012, a state court of appeals upheld a decision made earlier by Manhattan Surrogate Court that because Kranz previously had no interest in his daughter his consent wasn't required for the adoption to proceed. But a judge later took objection to Gorayeb's denying Kranz visitation rights and appointed a guardian who audited the aunt's use of her niece's compensation cash. Gorayeb had transferred the money to her own bank account and purchased the $900,000 Upper West Side apartment in both her and her niece's names. This audit further delayed the adoption process and Kranz took the time to petition the court for today's best interest trial. Claire Gorayeb and her lawyer declined to comment to DNAInfo on the story but in court papers the attorney said: 'At . all times Claire has been ready, willing and able to adopt and has made . every effort to move the adoption forward.' Kranz and his lawyer also declined to comment to the news website.","Single mother Catherine Gorayeb was killed in the attacks when her daughter was just two years old .

Tracey Emin never had children because her desire to be a successful artist overrode any maternal feelings. In an interview for today’s You magazine, Emin, 49, best known for My Bed – featuring bed linen stained with bodily secretions – tells Liz Jones she would have resented having to leave her  studio to look after children. Emin, who had an abortion at he age of 26 and has never married, said: ‘It’s not because I didn’t meet anyone; if I wanted to have a baby, I could’ve. ‘I didn’t want to because the creative yearning and wanting  to be an artist far overrode the physical feelings of wanting to be a mother. The mother who is the CEO of the company or whatever can’t wait to get home and see  her children. ‘The mother who’s in the studio painting will resent going home to her children.’ The multi-millionaire artist, who has homes in London and St Tropez, added: ‘When people have children, they have a sense of purpose. ‘When you don’t have children you have to define and make your own purpose, and make your own reason for being here. ‘I’d like to think I inspire young people to be creative.’ Emin also admitted she worried about growing old. ‘I’m nearly 50 and that’s where I am,’ she said. ‘I know I’m supposed to say ageing doesn’t bother me, then suddenly you’re like, “Yeah, I care about it, I really worry about it. I’m getting old. I’m old!” ’ Emin, who made her name as one of the original Young British Artists with the likes of Damien Hirst in the Nineties, said she wanted to carry on working for as long as possible and is trying to curb her drinking to stop her brain turning into ‘mush’. She said: ‘I feel physically ill if I don’t make work, I don’t create .  .  . ‘Hopefully the last bit of me to go will be my brain. Memorable: One of the artist's most famous pieces is My Bed, an installation featuring bed linen stained with bodily secretions . ‘For the future, drinking is a big question mark. ‘It’s not being holier than thou, it’s that I know what I’d rather be doing when I’m 95. ‘And it would be so stupid not to be able to do that because my brain had gone to mush.’ Emin also revealed that she will leave her estate to animal charities, a children’s library she set up in Uganda and Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust. From wild Young British Artist to Royal Academician, Tracey Emin has evoked acclaim and controversy for nearly two decades. Britain's most provocative artist opens up to Britain's most controversial columnist... I'm in Tracey Emin’s Spitalfields studio. It’s so big, on four floors, you could park an aeroplane in here, yet it’s full to the rafters with works of art in wooden crates, canvases in floor-to-ceiling cubbyholes, a huge desk covered in neat rows of tubes of oil paint (and I thought she’d be messy). There are two works in progress: sculptures of her beloved cat Docket, asleep in the shape of a comma. It’s so very much a cat, you feel you want to stroke it. One day, 100 years from now, I say, as Tracey appears, all honed thighs and knee boots, a jaunty scarf over a jumper, hair expensively dyed and in a neat ponytail (she eschewed our offer of hair, make-up and stylist), this will all be preserved in aspic. There’s enough here to fill a museum. Does she worry she’s producing too much? ‘Doesn’t happen. When Edvard Munch died he had over 2,000 drawings, 500 paintings and 1,000 watercolours in his house.’ Does she work all the time? ‘I can sit here and sew while talking to you, but that’s not work, it’s production. Me working is me experimenting, me trying something new, me doing something badly but seeing something good in it, having time to open stuff up and reinvent things.’ Does she feel guilty if she isn’t working, could quickly become out of practice, maybe? ‘I feel physically ill if I don’t make work, I don’t create. I don’t feel very good, I don’t feel right, I feel wrong.’ She sounds a perfectionist, disciplined. ‘Sometimes magic things happen; it’s just something within the process. I don’t like it when the drawings get too neat. It looks like a machine’s done them, so it’s no good, it’s got to be real, you know? I’m disciplined in the fact that I get everything done but I’m prone to change my mind on things. ‘I’ve planned my death, what happens afterwards. As an artist you have to, otherwise what would happen? It would just be such a mess, wouldn’t it? 'One thing about an artist, it doesn’t matter how much your work sells for in your life, it’s going to sell for ten times more than that after you’re dead, and that’s what you have to protect.’ 'I wouldn’t want to be really thin now. I don’t not eat, but I do exercise and I watch more what I eat and I try not to drink as much now [she’s had some famously drunken episodes in the past]; I never drink at home alone any more’ It’s a gruesome contradiction, talking about what will happen after her death, when we are meant to be discussing her new book, My Photo Album, which is largely about her childhood and teenage years, before she found success as a conceptual, confrontational artist. It’s a wonderful, evocative edit from a personal stash of 10,000 photos. Can she see she was destined for great things in those early snapshots? Philanthropist: Tracey will leave all her estate to a variety of charities . ‘I was brought up with a lot of love from my mum and dad. Being wilful meant I had an idea of what was wrong and what was right for me. 'I spent quite a lot of time alone as a child, too, so I think I was always introspective. And even when I was little, I liked creating things. I used to make doll’s houses out of cardboard boxes.’ She must like looking at herself, I venture; much of her art consists of her own body, photographed, drawn or painted. (She works in many different media: at the moment, watercolour.) Not vain, exactly, but self-obsessed. Did she realise she was, is, beautiful? ‘I never realised what I looked like and I wish I had; I would have made much more of it. 'I’ve always had a thing about my body, always not felt good about it. The happiest I am is the thinnest I can be. I think the less of me there is the better I feel about it. 'It’s a thing you shouldn’t really say, but that’s the truth, that made me feel good. I was super-fit as well, rode a bike everywhere, swam a kilometre every day… You’re not going to be fat if you do that, and also I was never a big eater.’ And now? ‘Not now. I wouldn’t want to be really thin now. I don’t not eat, but I do exercise and I watch more what I eat and I try not to drink as much now [she’s had some famously drunken episodes in the past]; I never drink at home alone any more.’","Artist Emin had an abortion at 26 and has never married .

"By . Chris Hastings . PUBLISHED: . 15:58 EST, 11 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:13 EST, 11 May 2013 . A set of portraits drawn by one of the key figures in the Profumo Affair has been discovered – 50 years after they were ‘disposed of’. The pictures were drawn by Stephen Ward, the ‘fixer’ in the 1960s scandal who was accused of introducing Minister of War John Profumo to showgirl Christine Keeler. The pair enjoyed an illicit affair but after Keeler was subsequently discovered to be sleeping with  Russian naval attaché Yevgeny Ivanov, Profumo was forced to resign from the Cabinet and Ward was prosecuted for living off the immoral earnings of prostitution. Portraits: Christine Keeler has identified the picture on the left as a portrait of her. The right portrait is said to be of Mandy Rice-Davies. The pictures were drawn by Stephen Ward, the ‘fixer’ in the 1960s scandal . Leaving court: Christine Keeler (right) with Mandy Rice-Davies (left) leaving the Old Bailey when Stephen Ward was on trial facing vice charges . Lawyers acting for Ward, who committed suicide in 1963 while on trial, considered the portraits sensitive and gave orders for them to be removed from public view. But the artworks, which are reproduced today for the very first time, survived because the clerk of the now-defunct law firm M. A. Jacobs & Sons secretly gave them to one of his best friends for safe keeping. The distinctive pencil, chalk and charcoal sketches include portraits of 14 sitters, including Keeler  and Ivanov. Keeler, who has studied the portraits on behalf of The Mail on Sunday, last night identified a picture of a young woman with her hair in a bun as a portrait of her. Other sitters are believed to include Profumo and Mandy Rice-Davies, a friend of both Ward and Keeler who had a string of affairs with high-profile figures of the day. Ward, who met many of his portrait subjects through his work as a high society osteopath, was instrumental in introducing some of the key players in the controversy to each other and was at the infamous party at Lord Astor’s Cliveden estate where Keeler, who was just 19 at the time, met Profumo.

Ward, who prior to the scandal had been one of the best connected people in London and counted Prince Philip, Princess Margaret, Harold Macmillan and Sophia Loren among his friends, quickly became the scapegoat for the affair. He took an overdose on the day before his trial ended. He was still in a coma on July 31 when the  jury found him guilty and he died on August 3, 1963. It is believed the portraits may have been destined for an exhibition at the now-defunct Museum Street Galleries in London’s West End. Artist: Lawyers acting for Ward (pictured), who committed suicide in 1963 while on trial, considered the portraits sensitive and gave orders for them to be removed from public view . At the time of his trial, Ward was represented by flamboyant celebrity lawyer David Jacobs. It is believed that Jacobs ordered his clerk Eddie Marks to get rid of the portraits. But Marks instead decided to give the works to his friend George Olaf Spanswick, an avid art collector. Spanswick died  in 1988 but his family held on to  the sketches. His daughter Carolyn Bartlett said: ‘Eddie decided to get rid of the sketches but did it in his own way. He knew my father would look after them.’ Stephen Dorril, who wrote the book Honeytrap about the Profumo Affair, said: ‘It is quite likely these pictures were among those which were to be shown at the Museum Street Galleries exhibition.’ By Walter Harris . Talented: Stephen Ward's illustrations had attracted the attention of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who gave unique permission for Ward to draw MPs in session in the Commons . On a spring evening in 1960, I went to dinner at a small nightclub called The Paint Box in Foley Street, one of a tangle of narrow thoroughfares between Broadcasting House and Great Titchfield Street in London. The club had a semi-circular stage, around the perimeter of which hung a red curtain. In front of the stage were half a dozen easels, with paper and crayons. The curtain would draw back to reveal a nude sitter in a chair. The club was managed by a tiny model, Adele de Havilland, who tried to increase her height with  a beehive hairdo and stiletto heels. On this particular evening, there was only one man sitting at an easel, whose portrait of the model was remarkably accurate. I commented on it to Adele. ‘Oh, that’s Stephen Ward; he’s getting quite well known as an artist. Would you like to meet him?’ ‘Yes please.’ She fetched him and, after the introduction, left us to sit down over a drink. Ward had hair brushed straight back, a soft voice and great charm. His talent as an osteopath had brought him patients from the upper reaches of society. His illustrations had attracted the attention of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who as a consequence gave unique permission for Ward to draw MPs in session in the Commons. Ward and I had dinner and became friends, often meeting for coffee. When a distinguished journalist of the day, Brian Inglis, needed an osteopath to review a chapter of a new book on homeopathy he was writing, I suggested Stephen Ward. ‘I’ve never heard of him, but do bring him round for lunch.’ The three of us had an omelette and a flagon of burgundy, and Stephen took away the chapter for checking. Not long afterwards, he invited me to the first night of an exhibition of his drawings at the Leggatt Brothers’ Gallery in Jermyn Street, mounted as a reward after he healed the neck  of one of the brothers which had been broken in a riding accident. Among the sitters attending the exhibition I remember Robert Boothby, who had had a prolonged affair with Lady Dorothy Macmillan, the Prime Minister’s wife; Duncan Sandys, Churchill’s son-in-law and Secretary of State for Defence; and the Conservative MP for Lewes, Major Tufton Beamish. All of them greeted Ward as a friend, the aloof Sandys putting an arm round him. Affair: John Profumo, the newly-appointed Secretary of State for War at the War Office before the scandal of his affair with call-girl Christine Keeler . Then the Profumo Affair hit the headlines, and they, together with the rest of Ward’s society ‘friends’, were gone, the shelves in his consultancy empty of invitations. Inglis, Ward and I had one more lunch together, at a restaurant in Manchester Square. It was obvious that ‘Bovine’ Henry Brooke, the Home Secretary, was intent on framing Stephen Ward as a pimp and a Russian spy. ‘Stephen, what really happened? I’ll guarantee you any organ of communication – the BBC, The Times, the Sunday Despatch – to put your side of the case.’ Ward, however, had become a fantasist. ‘Dear boy, England’s a brothel and Macmillan’s the madame. I’m acting as liaison between Macmillan, Kennedy and Khrushchev in the cause of peace.’ He chuckled; Inglis shrugged in despair. There was now no way to cleanse the smears, no way to win back any social status and no way to deflect the inevitable. Three days after our final lunch, Ward was arrested, and six weeks later died by his own hand.","Sketches include portraits of 14 sitters, including showgirl Christine Keeler .

Elusive: Viewers have been asking where The Voice presenter Holly Willoughby is . It's the Saturday evening talent-spotting TV show in which the judges famously don’t get to see the contestants. But a chorus of fans of BBC1’s The Voice are now asking: Where are the presenters? Or, in particular, where is Holly Willoughby, who is pocketing £400,000 for the 14-part series or £28,000 per episode? On Saturday night Miss Willoughby appeared for just 25 seconds, meaning she was being paid at a rate of £67,200 a minute or £1,120 for each second she was seen. Last week Miss Willoughby, 32, who co-hosts with Radio 1 DJ Reggie Yates, was seen for just 50 seconds of the 70-minute programme and the week before she was on screen for just under two minutes of a 90-minute show. Fans of The Voice, which has cost the BBC £22million to screen two series, have taken to Twitter to question the value for money she brings. ‘Are Holly and Reggie even in #TheVoiceUK this year...?’ asked viewer Simon Cossons. Another, Caeshia St Paul, enquired: ‘What’s the point in Holly and Reggie being on TheVoiceUK?  I haven’t heard them say 1 word between them today.’ Miss Willoughby, a former lingerie model who is reported to have built up a £10 million fortune through her work as a presenter, was lured to the BBC last year to help drive ratings for The Voice, a reality format the Corporation bought to take on ITV’s Britain’s Got Talent. When the two programmes went head to head last week The Voice was trounced in the ratings, pulling in a peak audience 7.7 million compared with the 11.4 million for Britain’s Got Talent, which features Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, comedian David Walliams and Alesha Dixon as judges. Last night in a bid to avoid another embarrassing showdown, the BBC moved the starting time of The Voice from 7.45pm to 8.20pm so there was a shorter crossover time with its big rival, which starts at 7pm. A BBC source said Ms Willoughby’s role in The Voice would increase when the show went live next month. Scroll down for video .

Home to stars: Actress Jerry Hall working at TV Centre on Strictly Come Dancing . The BBC’s closure and sale of Television Centre has been branded ‘insane’ after it emerged the Corporation will continue to spend more than £3 million a year renting back ‘a significant’ part of the premises. Last week the Corporation staged a series of lavish goodbyes to the iconic building, affectionately known as The Doughnut, which included emotional tributes from star names including Bruce Forsyth and Terry Wogan, a four-hour television special and even a concert by chart-toppers Madness. But far from vacating the premises, which have been the broadcaster’s headquarters for more than half a century, the BBC plans to fork out licence fee payers’ money to rent back what the Corporation last night admitted was ‘a significant’ part of the 14-acre site. Details of the arrangements have infuriated critics who claim TV Centre, the listed building which was home to classic BBC programmes such as Morecambe and Wise, Fawlty Towers and Strictly Come Dancing, has been sacrificed to foot the bill for a series of other high-profile property ‘blunders.’ The BBC has spent more than £1 billion on a controversial revamp of Broadcasting House in Central London, just five miles away from TV Centre; while its decision to relocate key departments including children’s programming and sport to Salford, to ensure its shows are less London-centric, is expected to end up costing just under £900 million, including contentious staff relocation packages. One BBC star, who asked not to be named said: ‘The BBC has had to sell TV Centre to balance the books. What other company in the world would voluntarily decentralise from such a perfect location and enter into decades of deal making with commercial landlords. It is insane.’ Another BBC presenter said: ‘It  is easy to imagine the fun that  Robert Peston or another BBC business reporter would have with a company that sold off its premises in a great media fanfare and then leased them back. ‘Regardless of doubts about the financial sense of the deal, the decision may encourage the feeling among viewers and staff that this is another example of BBC chiefs not getting the best value for licence payers.’ Private developer Stanhope paid £200 million for a 999-year lease on the West London site last July, £100 million less than the BBC had initially hoped to raise. It plans to develop a hotel, office space, leisure facilities and up to 1,000 apartments there. Costly: The BBC admitted last night it will rent back 'a significant' part of the 14-acre site at the former Television Centre . As part of its deal with Stanhope the BBC has agreed to lease the entire area for the next two years while staff carry out ‘decommissioning’ work. But even when the new owners take possession in 2015 the BBC will continue to rent 20 per cent of the site. The Corporation will pay to refurbish and then rent back three studios including the huge Studio One which is currently home to ‘shiny-floor’ shows such as Strictly Come Dancing. Its commercial arm BBC Worldwide will also move its entire operation to a significant part of the building, known as Stage 6. In the meantime the BBC is having to fork out extra cash to find temporary homes for some of its most popular shows. Strictly Come Dancing is being relocated to Elstree and Later With Jools Holland is going to Maidstone in Kent. These type of sale and leaseback deals are usually struck to provide a significant cash flow boost and allow a company to operate from the same premises while avoiding some of the obligations associated with owning the property. Goodbye... for now: Stars lincluding Michael Grade, Penelope Keith, Ronnie Corbett, John Cleese and David Jason paid emotional tributes to Television Centre but the BBC will be back - at a cost . But when TV Centre was initially put on the market in 2007, a BBC spokesman said unequivocally: ‘This is a full-scale disposal and we won’t be leasing it back.’ However, the deal struck with Stanhope includes renting 122,000 sq ft. Experts say the market rate is about £30 per square foot which would leave the BBC with a bill of just over £3 million a year. Critics claim the Corporation would not have had to enter into such a deal had it not overspent on other property deals. In 2010 the National Audit Office criticised the Corporation for embarking on vast building projects without ‘clear assessments of the intended benefits in terms of value for money.’ John Whittingdale, the Tory chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said: ‘At first sight it is difficult to see how this will represent a significant saving for licence fee payers. Indeed, I would be concerned that it might actually end up costing more.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The sale of Television Centre has already secured the sum of £200 million and will deliver further annual savings of about £30 million a year by 2015. ‘We believe this to be the best deal for licence fee payers, allowing  TV Centre to continue to make an important contribution to British broadcasting.’","Corporation has admitted it will lease back 'a significant' part of former home .

An Indian woman was forced into modern-day slavery by two women who locked her indoors and forced her to work 16-hour days. The victim was also raped by the women's accomplice, 54-year-old butcher Enkarta Balapovi. At a sentencing of three people today, the court heard he subjected the 39-year-old to four months of sexual abuse behind his wife's back while forcing his victim to sleep on the floor of his single room flat. He forced the woman to cook and clean for him, and threatened to burn her passport unless she stripped naked and performed sex acts. Convicted: Shamina Yousuf (left) and Shashi Obhrai (right) treated the woman like a 'slave' When the married victim resisted his advances, Balapovi threatened to throw her on to the streets without any identity documents if she did not sleep with him. The illiterate woman had been lured to the UK with the promise of work as a nanny, hoping to earn money for her poverty-stricken family in India. But she found herself locked indoors and forced to work 16-hour days during a four-year ordeal at the hands of Balapovi and co-accused women Shamina Yousuf, a secretary, and optician Shashi Obhrai. The mother-of-four was burned with an iron, threatened with hypodermic needles and had a knife held to her throat by Obhrai, 54, when she tried to escape. Her passport was seized by Yousuf, 33, as soon as she arrived, and the woman was passed between three families as a 'dogsbody', earning just £2,300 for year's of gruelling work. Despite dubbing Obhrai as 'wicked', Judge Shani Barnes spared her a jail sentence because she is the primary carer for her terminally ill millionaire husband Balram Obhrai, 59. Mr Obhrai had been accused of trafficking and making threats to kill but the prosecution offered no evidence against him because he has a brain tumour and is on his death bed at home. Yousuf, 33, had first recruited the woman when she came to the UK in 2005 to earn money for her poverty-stricken family in Hyderabad, India. After nearly three years as a 'servant' for Yousuf's family and friends, the woman confronted her. Yousuf, whose marriage was breaking up, threw a mug at the woman's foot which left a two-inch gash. Slave: The victim was made to sleep on this kitchen floor in Balapovi's flat . Escaped jail: Shamina Yousef (pictured outside court, left, and in a police mugshot, right), who forced the woman to work as a 'servant', was sentenced to 40 hours unpaid work . Rapist: Butcher Balapovi was found guilty of five counts of rape . Obhrai employed the victim from October 2007 and forced her to work from 6am to 11pm. During . her time there, she was burned with an iron, threatened with a . hypodermic needle and hit over the head with a rolling pin after a row . about chapatti recipes. Balapovi, Yousuf, and Obhrai appeared in the dock together at Croydon Crown Court today to be sentenced. Balapovi . was jailed for 11 years, while Yousuf was sentenced to 40 hours . community service and Obhrai was given a 20 month suspended jail . sentence. Prosecutor . Caroline Haughey said the uneducated victim was 'one of the most . vulnerable members of society' who had been targeted because she was . unaware of her basic human rights. 'She has been bullied physically, psychologically, she has been sexually assaulted, she has been raped,' she said. 'She . was clearly viewed as a belonging by the defendants in this case, each . one of them separately contributing to the violation of her right. 'Her . naivety, her innocence, her lack of education, has been exploited with . threats and physical violence preying on her lack of understanding of . western norms.' Terminal illness: Obhrai (left) was given a suspended sentence as she is caring for her husband (right) who is dying from brain cancer. The prosecution did not bring any evidence against him as he is on his death bed . In a statement to the court, the . victim, who has been given compassionate leave to stay in the UK for . five years, said: 'They have made my life hell. I have suffered with . depression and sleepless nights for a very long time. 'I . have to take medication so that I can get some sleep. They have treated . me so badly that I worry at night that they will come for me. 'These . people are dangerous they have ruined my life and kept me away from my . children. Each should be punished for their wrongdoings.' During . a six-week trial, the court heard how Yousuf had forced the woman into . servitude at her home in London by taking away her . passport and promising to help her get a UK visa. But . she refused to return the passport and the victim found herself trapped . for three years before she was passed on to Balapovi, a butcher living . in north London. He . downed alcohol and repeatedly forced himself on her when she spurned . his advances, grabbing her hair, kissing her so violently he cut her . lips, and promising her a visa for her if she had sex with him. The woman said: 'When Salim [Balapovi] used to have sex with me, my whole body used to ache. I can't move on - he raped me.' When . passed to Obhrai's house in also in north London the woman was beaten . with high heel shoes, jabbed in the head with a comb and pushed her down . the stairs. Of one incident, the woman said: 'Shashi Obhrai put a hot iron on my arm when I asked her for my earnings to be paid. 'She . told me that she would do it. I told her that the iron was on and she . said, ""Have a look, is it hot or not?"", and put the iron on me.' Threats: Obhrai used this knife to threaten the Indian victim who she kept as a slave . She was also forced to survive on out-of-date food and the spat-out leftovers of Obhrai's children. When she was sick from tiredness, Obhrai made her clean up the vomit with her own clothes. The woman managed to escape from Obhrai's clutches to a crisis centre, but her tormentor found her and threatened to kill her with a knife if she did not return. She eventually escaped again and contacted refuge charities and the police. In May last year, officers charged the trio with a variety of abuse offences. Obhrai was convicted after trial of making a threat to kill and ABH after a trial. She was given 18-months in prison for ABH and 20 months in prison for making threats to kill, with both sentences running concurrently and suspended for 20 months. Yousuf was convicted of ABH, and order to carry out 40 hours unpaid work. Her husband, supermarket manager, Aleemuddin Mohammed, 35, was cleared of sexual assault at the trial. Butcher Balapovi's wife Shanaz Begum, 57, was found not guilty of people trafficking offences on the direction of the judge.","The woman was also raped by a butcher who made her sleep on his floor .

Tia’s killer betrayed the ‘ultimate trust’ placed in him by her family, the schoolgirl’s mother said yesterday. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Natalie Sharp said she wanted to hurt Hazell for the misery he had caused. ‘When Tia came along I had a reason to keep out of trouble; if it had not been for her, my life would have been very different,’ said the 31-year-old. Natalie said she wanted to confront her daughter's killer, admitting 'Sometimes I feel pity, but I want to hurt him'. Speaking about Tia she said: 'I grew up in a very close family. I had a special relationship with my Nan, my mum's mum. When I knew that I was expecting Tia, I was so happy that I would have something to love. 'Tia's father Steven disappeared before she was born and I realised that the unique relationship I had with my Nanny would be repeated with Tia and my mum. 'I did try to keep Tia in her father's life but when he had a new family, it was obvious to Tia that he didn't want to know. So there was always me, Mum, my brother and Tia. A small but really close family unit. 'My parents gave me a good childhood. They were together until 1999 and at the time they broke up I was angry. When Tia came along I had a reason to keep out of trouble; if it had not been for her, my life would have been very different. She was mine and no one else's and I had someone to love. ''When I was told Tia had gone missing I always believed that she would come back. At the very worst I thought I'd have to face the fact that someone had touched her and scared her and hurt her. I never really considered that she would be dead. How could I? Worse still was the false hope from the hoaxer who said they had her. I thought she was coming back. 'Since Tia was taken, I have lost my trust in everyone. It is too hard for me to believe that she is really gone. I try to think of her being on a sleepover at her friend's house. 'Jack, my eldest son who is three, asked me just this week if Tia was coming home from school soon. I've had to tell him the truth. It made him really cry. I told him that Tia is a star in the sky and now when we go up to say goodnight, we look out of the bedroom window and speak to the star, the one that was bought in Tia's name. 'I breathe for my children. I fear anyone hurting my boys. I fear that if anyone touches my sons or does anything to them, what I might do, I am so scared and angry.

Abuse: Natalie Sharp (front), pictured at court today with her mother Christine Bicknell (behind), said she had received verbal and physical attacks since her daughter went missing . 'People have said the most terrible things about me as a mother and Tia's life. I can't understand how people who know nothing about somebody can send such awful messages. Then the other day a cabbie just asked me ""how is everything going?"" He apologised and said ""I expect everybody asks you"". 'I realised he was the first person to ask me to my face without condemning me behind my back. I've been stared at and physically attacked and I know people judge me when they see me buying something nice for my sons. 'My close family are closer still, but this has hurt them so badly. My brother is struggling to work, my mum was suspended from her job when Stuart was arrested. I've heard people saying Tia was mistreated and that she's lucky to be away from this world. 'My Tia wanted for nothing. I have gone without so many times to give my children everything and the truth is that strangers have said things that have been repeated in the press and social media that have been unbelievable. 'Tia was my mum's life. She was as close to my mum as I'd been to my nan. We'd all lived together when Tia was a baby and she was my mum's 'mini-me'. Tia loved to be with my mum.

'I can't say what'll happen after the trial. It's my last hurdle. I haven't allowed myself to grieve yet, I need to finish this first. When the trial is done, everything is over for everyone else, but it won't be for us. 'At the moment Tia is still talked about. After this we still have to live with the next hurdles. Will Stuart appeal, will he get parole, will he be out and about in a few years? 'I gave the ultimate trust to Stuart. I have so much I want to ask him.

His comments follow reports police in Lancashire had interviewed two women about historic allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the last week. Mr Buswell said he had never met the woman involved and denied any wrong-doing. Return: Mr Buswell's character Ray was written back into the show in 2005 for a six-week run . The actor, 70, played Ray Langton in the soap during the 1960s and 1970s, and was written back in for a six-week run in 2005 before his character was killed off. Speaking from his home in Las Vegas this week, he told the Sunday Mirror he had been following news of the arrests and charges of his former co-stars Bill Roache, Michael Le Vell and Andrew Lancel over sex offences. He said: 'It is amazing what is going on over there. It's terrible what's going on and I will be honest, I have been following it.' One of his former colleagues, who was not named, told the paper Mr Buswell was 'a lovely bloke'. They added: 'It's hard to believe he'd get himself in bother with anyone. The idea that he would expose himself to a young girl seems laughable.' Mr Buswell first appeared in the long-running soap in 1966. His womanising character had several flings before marring Deirdre Hunt in 1975. He ended his contract in 1978 and was . written out of the show after having an affair with waitress Janice . Stubbs that ended his on-screen marriage. Early fame: Mr Buswell in a 1976 episode of the soap with co-star Barbara Knox as Rita Littlewood . The actor left the UK and moved to the US with his wife, where he worked as a croupier and manager in a casino for 13 years. He . appeared in a one-off special edition of Coronation Street in Las Vegas . in 1997, before being written back into the show in 2005. After six . weeks on air, his character died of cancer. The allegation follows those against Bill Roache, Michael Le Vell and Andrew Lancel. Roache has been charged with two counts of rape and will appear in court next month. He strenuously denies the claims. Lancel will also appear in court in June charged with six counts of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 15 - something he also denies.

"By . Rosie Taylor . PUBLISHED: . 13:08 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:28 EST, 10 May 2013 . A father was jailed for seven years today after admitting killing his disabled seven-month-old son. Nathan Pick, 38, lashed out at James-Lee because he could not get him to stop screaming at their home in Chaddesden, Derbyshire. The baby, who was born with a heart defect and had to be tube-fed, suffered brain injuries and died the next day in hospital as a result of the blow to the back of the head. Pick was arrested on suspicion of murder and and charged, but originally claimed to police that James-Lee had begun to fit and hit his head in his swing chair. But on Wednesday, a week before his trial was due to start, he admitted manslaughter at Nottingham Crown Court. Frustrated: Nathan Pick (left) lashed out at his son James-Lee (right) because he could not stop him crying . In mitigation today, Shaun Smith QC, defending Pick, said it had not been a deliberate act to kill or cause serious injury to the child. Mr Smith said: 'He was frustrated by his inability to be accepted by his baby son. 'He is truly sorry for this. He would not want this to happen to anybody else.' The court heard James-Lee spent three months in hospital after being born with a heart defect in October 2011. His mother Hannah Goldby, who was Pick’s partner at the time, called James-Lee 'her little fighter'. He required medication and care each day, the court heard. Pick struggled to bond with his son and grew frustrated that he could not calm the child. On May 7 last year, Pick 'snapped' and lashed out at his son while the child was sat in his swing chair. He called Ms Goldby, who had gone to the fish shop, and said: 'Come back quick. He’s fitting. I think he’s dead,' then called 999. Paramedics attended and found James-Lee 'very blue and flaccid ... lifeless and still'. The baby was taken to Royal Derby Hospital before being transferred to the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham. An MRI scan revealed he had suffered brain injuries, swelling to the brain and bleeding into his spinal cord. His life support machine was switched off on May 8. Jailed: Pick was sentenced to seven years in prison at Nottingham Crown Court today . Tragically he was the second child Ms Goldby had lost in three years. Her daughter Zoe died of sudden infant death syndrome in 2009 when she was seven weeks old. There were no suspicious circumstances, the court heard. Sentencing Pick at the same court today, Lord Justice Julian Flaux said: 'You clearly found the reaction from your son frustrating and upsetting.' He said he accepted Pick had not set out to kill or seriously harm his child but that his son could not be blamed for crying. He also accepted Pick, who has a 12-year-old son, was not a violent or bad man. There was no history of abuse or violence, he added. The judge added: 'The stress caused you to snap. You did not intend to kill him or cause him serious injuries but you now accept that blow was an unlawful act.' The judge told Pick he would need to pass a sentence of imprisonment because a 'defenceless and vulnerable' child had died as a result of his actions. He jailed Pick, who appeared tearful in the dock, for seven years. Lord Justice Flaux told family and friends in the public gallery that he hoped the conclusion of the case would provide them with some comfort. Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Cox, from the East Midlands Major Crime Unit, said: 'This is a tragic case. I hope today’s sentence allows James-Lee’s family to move forward with the grieving process. 'I would urge anyone struggling to cope with being a new parent to access the help and support available to them so tragedies like this can be avoided in the future.'","Nathan Pick 'snapped' after struggling to bond with son James-Lee .

"By . Rosie Taylor and Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 13:50 EST, 11 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:50 EST, 11 May 2013 . The Archbishop of York has ordered an independent inquiry into claims against a former cathedral dean. Dr John Sentamu said the Church of England treats child abuse allegations 'with the utmost seriousness'. His statement comes after his predecessor, Lord Hope of Thornes, denied suggestions he covered up allegations against Robert Waddington, a former Dean of Manchester Cathedral, who died from cancer five years ago. Lord Hope, who was Archbishop of York between 1995 and 2005, was twice informed about allegations against Mr Waddington, who is said to have abused chorister Eli Ward in Manchester in the 1980s and a school boy in Australia. Inquiry: Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu has ordered an independent investigation into claims against Robert Waddington . Eli Ward said he was first singled out . by the Dean of Manchester, the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, at the . age of 11 and was then a close companion of his over a five-year period. The . allegations made in public by Mr Ward for the first time this week led . to suggestions of a cover-up over the Church’s response following . complaints to bishops in 2003. But the former Archbishop of York, . Lord Hope of Thornes, who at the time oversaw the Manchester diocese, . said he did not tell police and social services because Church rules . then did not require it and because the Dean was dying of cancer. Mr Ward, now 40, said he was sleeping . in the Dean’s bed by the time he was 13 and by his mid-teens was . spending almost every weekend and many nights at the cleric’s house. He . went with him on holidays to Cornwall, the Lake District, Paris and the . South of France. The abuse started when Mr Waddington . began the grooming process in 1984 and ended after suspicions were . raised in the Manchester diocese in 1989, Mr Ward told the Times . newspaper. In 2004, Dean Waddington, who had by then retired, was . stripped of his right to lead Church services by Lord Hope but no . information was passed on to police or social services. The Dean died in . 2007. Scandal: Former Archbishop of York Lord Hope, . left, was told of child sex abuse allegations against Dean of Manchester . Robert Waddington, right, but did not report them to the police . Yesterday Lord Hope said in a statement: 'Throughout my time as bishop and archbishop I always adhered to the statutory practices of the Church of England concerning safeguarding. 'I strenuously deny (and am obviously disappointed at) the suggestion that myself or my team at the time would have acted negligently in this or any other safeguarding matter.' He said the Church of England's 1999 Policy on Child Protection, which was in effect at the time but which has subsequently been reviewed, stated that there is no automatic legal obligation on the Church to refer allegations by adults to the police or social services. But he said the policy stated it was essential to consider whether children may still be at risk from the alleged abuser and, if so, report the matter to the police or social services. He said: 'In considering whether children would be at risk from Robert Waddington I decided under these guidelines that this would not be the case given his serious ill health following cancer surgery. The following year I revoked Robert Waddington's permission to officiate. He died two years later.' And Lord Hope added: 'I am deeply aware of the pain caused to any victim of child abuse, especially at the hands of a trustworthy person within the church. I do encourage any person who believes they have been a victim of abuse to come forward and to inform the police.' Dr Sentamu's office issued a statement today which said: 'The Archbishop of York is in the process of setting up an Independent Inquiry specifically into the issues surrounding the reports relating to alleged child abuse by the late Robert Waddington. 'When any church related abuse comes to light the Church's first concern must be for the victim offering support and apologising for the abuse, acknowledging that the effects can be lifelong. 'When the Inquiry makes its report the Archbishop will make its findings public. 'The Church of England continues to review its Child Protection and Safeguarding policies regularly to ensure that the Church is a safe place for all. 'Child abuse is a heinous and personally damaging crime, it is therefore incumbent on the Church to treat such matters with the utmost seriousness.' Mr Ward’s lawyers have now made a personal injury compensation claim against the Dean and Chapter of Manchester. He said that until last year he . thought he could deal with the memories but then he felt ‘there’s . something drastically wrong with me and I then started to scream very . loudly that I needed help.’ Mr Ward said he came from a poor background in Salford and joined the cathedral choir in Manchester at the age of seven. Four years later Dean Waddington, a . former headmaster and then the most senior education official working . for the Church’s parliament, the General Synod, arrived in the city. He . said the Dean showed him special favour, helping him with his homework, . picking him up in his car to take him to choir practice, asking him out . to tea and taking him for days out. He asked Mr Ward’s mother if the boy . could stay with him overnight. The room in which the boy slept had a . large poster of a horrifying painting by 16th century artist Hieronymus . Bosch, which gave him nightmares. Cathedral: Waddington targeted a Manchester choirboy as well as a pupil at an Australian boarding school . Mr Ward said: ‘He turned round to me . one day and said, “Would you rather stay in my room? Is that painting . too scary for you?” and of course I said yes.’ Mr Ward began sleeping in the Dean’s bed, where eventually hugs became kissing. He said that sexual contact began . after he was distressed over a break-up with a girlfriend. He said he . felt obliged to perform sexual acts when the Dean asked: ‘Do you love me . this much?’ Mr Ward told the Times he had now . broken off contact with his own family. He said: ‘I have no relationship . with my family now because I asked severe, strong questions of my . family: why did you let it happen? I was the boyfriend of a monster – so . what does that make me?’ Mr Ward said that he was told by the Dean that if questioned by the Press he should lie about what was going on. After a senior cathedral official did . begin to inquire about the relationship, the Dean told Mr Ward to quit . the choir in 1989 and he did so. He last saw the Dean on his wedding . day, when the Dean conducted the ceremony. Mr Ward later told his wife . about the abuse. ‘As soon as I told her, our relationship split like an . axe,’ he added. The Right Reverend Paul Butler, the . head of the Churches National Safeguarding Committee, said: ‘As a Church . we will always apologise for past systems that let down the vulnerable . and offer support to anyone whose life has been affected. Today we have . robust safeguarding policies in place.’","John Sentamu orders inquiry into claims against late Dean of Manchester .

Michael Gove today faced the wrath of headteachers over the state of the education system, just hours after they passed a landmark vote of no confidence in the Government's school reforms. The Education Secretary was greeted with the most hostile reception he has faced during his time in office as members of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) warned that they are under intense stress amid major changes to education and the threat of Ofsted inspections. Mr Gove was heckled as he told the NAHT's conference in Birmingham that they would 'part company' over concerns about Ofsted, and was jeered by delegates when he suggested that no school would be marked down in national curriculum tests because one child was off sick. Union president Bernadette Hunter told Mr Gove children and their teachers had 'never had it so bad' and described him as a 'fanatical personal trainer' forcing . schools to keep jumping through hoops without realising 'the damage he . is causing to the body or the system'. As she introduced Gove to the conference for a question and answer session, she said: 'You cannot fail to be aware that the morale of the profession is at an all time low. Many are angry at what is happening to the education system. 'Some school leaders are taking early retirement, while others do not want to take on headships because of the pressure. 'Those of us in education, leaders and learners, have never had it so bad. It is within your power to put this right.' Mr Gove clashed repeatedly with delegates during the hour-long debate. Denise Wells, head of Field House Infant School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire said: 'The culture we've got at the moment is one of bullying and fear, you ask why headteachers are going down with stress. 'It is because they are spending Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday waiting for Ofsted, not because they are not doing well, but because it (the outcome) depends on the people that come. 'It's because we're working in a culture of fear, not one of working together.' Mr Gove told the conference: 'If Ofsted causes you stress, then I'm grateful for your candour, but we are going to have to part company.' One delegate responded with 'Are you leaving them?' In a robust defence, Mr Gove went on to say: 'What I have heard is repeated statements that the profession faces stress, and insufficient evidence about what can be done about it.' He added: 'What I haven't heard over the last hour is a determination to be constructive, critical yes, but not constructive.' Conflict: Mr Gove (pictured speaking at today's conference in Birmingham) had a heated debate with headteachers . Delegates suggested he was the cause of headteachers' stress and groaned when he responded: 'If people find it stressful that I'm demanding higher standards, then I'm not going to stop demanding higher standards.' During the morning's session the union overwhelmingly passed a vote of no confidence in the Government's education policies. Many of Mr Gove's reforms are ""not in the best interests of children"", it said. Heads raised particular concerns about the new national curriculum, major test and exam reform and schools being forced into becoming academies. Tim Gallagher, proposing the motion, said: 'Enough is enough. This motion's intention is to send the strongest message possible to this government that many of their education policies are failing our children, their parents and the very fabric of our school communities.' The NAHT is the first union of headteachers to pass a vote of no confidence in the Government's education reforms. The UK's three biggest teachers' unions, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the NASUWT passed similar votes at their Easter conferences. The NUT and the NASUWT are planning regional strikes in the North West next month in a continuing row over pay, pensions and workload with the prospect of a national walkout looming in the autumn. The latest vote of no confidence is a further sign of the worsening relations between the Government and the teaching profession. Mr Gallagher, a consultant headteacher from Worcestershire said that many of the government's education policies were 'ill-thought-through, not based on empirical evidence and devoid of meaningful consultation and lacking in understanding.' Conference: Gove spoke at the NAHT event after being given a vote of no confidence by attendees . He also suggested that ministers are attempting to push reforms through in a way that is 'disruptive, damaging and pernicious'. 'With this government it is ideology gone mad,' Mr Gallagher told the conference. Vince . Burke, senior vice principal of All Saints Church of England Academy in . Plymouth suggested that the government is trying to reform too much of . the education system at once. 'If . the Secretary of State had a business plan he would know that to be . successful you don't change everything at the same time.' Ministers are currently attempting to overhaul the curriculum, assessment, accountability and funding, he said. The . resolution called on the NAHT's executive to ensure that the government . is left in no doubt that that the union represents the 'serious . concerns' of the profession. It was passed with 99.3 per cent of the vote. Delegates also passed a second resolution raising concerns that 'too much power is currently given to one person to determine national policy on the basis of personal preference and ideologically-driven assumption.' Steve Kirkpatrick a deputy headteacher and member of the NAHT's executive said that he had two children and was concerned about their education. He said. 'This is so important because I want to stop people playing political ping pong with my children's education.'

Heckled: The Education Secretary did not get a warm welcome from the conference audience . A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We need to raise standards so we have an education system that is on a par with the world's best. 'Our academies programme is turning around hundreds of underperforming schools, we are introducing a world class curriculum and our reforms to exams will create qualifications that will keep pace with the demands of universities and employers. Surely this is something the NAHT should be supporting. 'We will not stand by when schools are failing our children. Sponsored academies are turning around hundreds of underperforming schools and ensuring pupils are given every chance to fulfil their potential. 'We are also overhauling special educational needs provision to put young people and their families at its centre, with more say in where they study and more control over the support they receive.' Mr Gove told the conference that he is 'always happy to debate, discuss, hear about and engage with the profession about what their concerns are'.","National Association of Head Teachers conference votes against Government's policies .

A hoarder stuck in a tiny bedsit piled high with rubbish had to be rescued by firefighters after care workers became concerned about her health. Emergency crews used a cherry picker to reach the first floor flat above a takeaway shop and cut out the window frame to reach the stricken woman. Rubbish piled high against the window came crashing down as it was removed, revealing a room crammed almost to the ceiling with binbags, cardboard, bottles and cans. Rescue: As firefighters removed the window to reach the woman piles of rubbish fell from the crammed flat onto the street below .

Pictures show a vast pile of clutter with a shopping trolley abandoned on top and what appears to be the top of a fridge just visible. The woman, who has not been named, lived in the flat with her adult son. Both were described as 'vulnerable' by social services, and neighbours said the woman appeared 'well-educated' but was a 'loner'. Social services raised the alarm after losing contact with the pair and being unable to get through the front door of the flat in Rush Green, Romford, Essex. Neighbours said the woman's son had spoken to firefighters throughout the seven-hour rescue on Tuesday, May 14, and had said: 'She's not going to come down the stairs.' Bernadette Angel, who owns a florist next to the flat, said. 'Social services had been knocking on the door for months. I don't think she could come out through the door. 'She was a hoarder and she was refusing to move. 'I don't think she actually mixed with anybody, it was just her and her son.'

'She was a hoarder. When they took the window out, it was piled up.' Other neighbours said they hadn't seen the woman for about a year, but that she appeared physically mobile then. June Gundlack, who witnessed the rescue, said: 'The flat looked odd from the outside. When the firefighters were breaking in, you could see rubbish right up to the ceiling.

Tony Blair’s former chief of staff flew 3,000 miles to an oil-rich former Soviet state run by a brutal dictator to tell them how they could learn from Britain’s long history of democracy. Jonathan Powell started out by explaining how Kazakhstan would be a vastly better country if it could have its own Rolls-Royce-class Whitehall civil service system, free of corruption. But he ended up reopening an old domestic feud by launching a personal attack on a fellow former British mandarin who compared Mr Blair’s New Labour government to Hitler’s Third Reich. Feud: Jonathan Powell, left, reopened an old domestic feud by launching a personal attack on former British mandarin Sir Richard Packer, right,  who compared Mr Blair’s New Labour government to Hitler’s Third Reich . After complaining how hard it was to get rid of troublesome civil servants in Britain, Mr Powell said the Government was forced to give a £1 million payoff to the official who was ‘to blame for the mad cow  disease’ crisis in the early days of  Mr Blair’s Premiership. He did not name the official, but he didn’t have to: Sir Richard Packer,  permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture in the late Nineties, last night said he had no doubt Mr Powell was referring to him. Mr Powell, along with Mr Blair,  has been advising Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev in a deal reportedly worth up to £16 million. Kazakhstan has faced widespread concern over human rights abuses, the treatment of the president’s political opponents and brutality and murder by its police force. Its civil service is riddled with corruption and nepotism. Speaking at Nazarbayev’s State Management Academy, Mr Powell told his audience of the dictator’s apparatchiks: ‘When we came to power in 1997, there was a high-ranking official in the  Agriculture Ministry who was fully accountable for the outbreak of mad cow disease in the country.’ Aide: Jonathan Powell is pictured with Tony Blair in 2007 . According to a Kazakh news agency, Mr Powell said: ‘Nothing happened when we asked him to resign. We were told it was impossible to fire him and the best option was to promote him off this position. 'In the end, we had to pay him £1 million worth of termination fee. It is very difficult to get rid of such unwanted officials.’ Sir Richard told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have come across reports of Jonathan Powell bad-mouthing me before. It is something he has got in his head for some reason, I don’t know why. I might have spoken to him twice. ‘It all seems very strange and is also quite factually wrong. He seems to be accusing me of being responsible for BSE. I don’t see how anyone who knew anything, which doesn’t include  Powell, could say that. The BSE report says something completely different. Mr Powell should check his facts.’ After leaving his Whitehall job, Sir Richard was fiercely critical of the Blair government. He told the BBC: ‘In one respect . . . [the Blair government] reminded me of the Third Reich where . . . nobody would know where ultimate responsibility lay.’ Last night, Sir Richard denied having received a £1 million payoff, saying: ‘It depends how you add it up. I was there for more than 30 years (and) you can make up a very big figure with pensions and what have you. ‘The implication of the £1 million is that I was paid over and above what  I was entitled to. It was fully within the rules. Once again, Powell’s rhetoric is completely at variance with  the facts.’ Mr Powell was unavailable for  comment.","Jonathan Powell gave speech in oil rich former Soviet state Kazakhstan .

As Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson has already upset animal rights activists with his strong support for a badger cull to halt the spread of TB to cattle. Now the Tory MP – whose role includes responsibility for wildlife – is set to provoke controversy after being photographed proudly holding specialist traps containing the bodies of dead grey squirrels that were damaging trees on his estate in Shropshire. Tory colleagues who have visited the Cabinet Minister’s mansion near Shrewsbury have been shocked to see him showing off a photograph of himself holding a squirrel trap in each hand. Controversy: Owen Paterson has been photographed holding specialist traps containing the bodies of dead grey squirrels . The dead animals’ heads are inside the devices, while their bodies and bushy tails hang limply below. ‘I’m not sure what was more shocking – the dead squirrels or the smile on Owen’s face,’ said one Conservative who has seen the picture. ‘If the animal rights mob saw it they would have a fit. Owen insisted that we look at the photo and then he said, “Look at this – these traps are the real deal. No squirrel is going to get out of that.” ‘Everyone laughed but I felt embarrassed. Owen said the squirrels had inflicted terrible damage to his trees.’ Right-winger Paterson, 56, who is married to aristocrat’s daughter Rose Ridley and has been tipped as a future Tory Party leader, is thought to have installed a number of the Kania 2000 traps in the grounds of his home. They cost about £60 each and are, according to the manufacturers, ‘by far the most powerful spring trap available in the UK’. They can be attached to trees, placed in lofts or left on the ground. The makers recommend using peanuts or peanut butter as bait to lure the squirrels inside. The animals are then crushed in an instant. Lethal: The Kania 2000 traps, pictured in action, are described as 'by far the most powerful spring trap available in the UK' There is no suggestion that Mr Paterson has done anything illegal. Unlike the endangered red squirrel – which is extinct in most parts of the UK – grey squirrels are officially classed as vermin. They are known to damage trees and gardens, and also roofs as they try to gain access to attics. The Kania 2000 was originally developed in Canada for the fur trade. It was made legal in the UK in 1993 for use against grey squirrels, mink, stoats, weasels, mice and rats. Vermin: Grey squirrels are officially classed as vermin and cause damage to trees and gardens . Kania’s UK website says it is ‘one of the safest and most humane traps in the world – perfect for the grey squirrel. Although a little on the expensive side it is well worth having a few in the armoury. ‘It is suitable for people wanting to trap squirrels in their gardens but do not  want to have to dispatch the squirrel themselves.’ The website advises: ‘For the best results pre-bait for up to a week before actually setting the trap. 'This gets all the local squirrels used to eating at the trap and they lose all fear of it, even if they see another of their kind dead in it.’ Kania’s Canadian website also features an article by a farmer in California who describes how installing the traps stopped squirrels destroying his fruit crop. The man, who insisted on remaining anonymous because he is ‘not sure this method of trapping is legal’, says: ‘Folks, the Kania trap works as advertised. Period. I have been plagued by “fuzzy tails” for years. Then the Gardener’s God of the Backyard smiled upon me. 'I spotted an advert for the Kania 2000. Since then I have sent about 70 fuzzy tails to that great walnut tree in the sky. It is humane and efficient – I’ve never had a miss.’ A spokesman for Mr Paterson said: ‘Programmes for the humane control of grey squirrels have been in place in the UK for more than 40 years. These programmes protect our  woodland and wildlife.’","Tory colleagues have been shocked to see him showing off the photo .

"By . Simon Walters . PUBLISHED: . 17:51 EST, 18 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:51 EST, 18 May 2013 . David Cameron has threatened to pull the rug from under his  Coalition with Nick Clegg after a series of bitter rows that have rocked the Government. The Prime Minister said he is prepared to run the country without his Deputy PM unless Tory-Lib Dem feuding that has paralysed his administration ends. Mr Cameron added he hopes to cling on to his ailing alliance with Mr Clegg as they tackle the economic crisis and other vital issues together. Cameron said that he will govern without Clegg if the feuding doesn't end . But in a move that could trigger an early General Election, he said: ‘The best way to do that is to continue with the Coalition, but if that wasn’t the case then we’d have to face the new circumstances in whatever way we should.’ The innocent-sounding ‘new circumstances’ he refers to are the sensational prospect of an end to the Coalition. It is the first time Mr Cameron has publicly aired his fears his political marriage to Mr Clegg, sealed with sunny optimism at their Rose Garden joint press conference in Downing Street three years ago, is about to end in divorce. Revealing his frustration in a candid interview in Total Politics magazine, Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m here to deliver good government for the country and we’ve still got important work to do – paying down the deficit, turning round the economy, and all the rest of it. ‘What matters to me, though, is can we get things done? Can we improve the state of the country? Can we fulfil our manifesto?’ If not, he continued, he was ready to ‘face the new circumstances’ – in other words, break up with Mr Clegg and run a minority Tory Government. Potentially, that could cause far more chaos than any Coalition infighting. But Cameron added that he would rather be with Clegg when attempting to solve the economic crisis . It was the lack of a Commons majority in 2010 that forced Mr Cameron to team up with Mr Clegg. Without the backing of Lib Dem MPs, there are insufficient Conservative MPs to get Mr Cameron’s legislation through  Parliament on their own. In turn, that could force Mr Cameron to ask the Queen for permission to call an early General Election, instead of waiting until 2015, a key part of his 2010 pact with Mr Clegg. Alternatively, Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg could agree to an amicable divorce, with the Lib Dem leader stepping down as Deputy PM but supporting the Tories on some issues, making it possible for Mr Cameron to cling on to power – for the time being. It would allow them both to pursue their own separate manifestos in the run-up to the Election.There are advantages to both leaders in a friendly split. Mr Clegg would get the chance to repair his battered reputation with Lib Dem activists. And Mr Cameron, although weakened, would be freed of constant bickering between Tory and Lib Dem Ministers and aides. Mr Cameron’s comments follow reports that both he and Mr Clegg are facing up to going it alone in the run-up to the next Election. In the Total Politics interview with Tory MP and author Rob Wilson, Mr Cameron vented his fury over the root cause of the Tory-Lib Dem schism – Mr Clegg’s U-turn on a pledge to back parliamentary boundary changes that would have made it easier for the Conservatives to win the next Election. ‘That was immensely frustrating,’ said Mr Cameron. ‘The Coalition has its frustrations, there’s no doubt about it, and we have disagreements. Sometimes those disagreements mean you can’t take actions in the areas that you want to.’ Mr Wilson said the PM’s comments could be a clear warning to Mr Clegg that he may be about to call an Election. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Coalition will continue until 2015.’ Ed Miliband's economic policy has been savaged by his former guru as a ‘beg, steal and borrow’ approach,  writes Glen Owen. Lord Glasman told a private audience of activists the Labour leadership was showing ‘tin-eared contempt for the public’ by sticking to the left-wing belief that the Government should borrow billions to fund schools and hospitals. And the Labour peer quoted The New Seekers’ 1972 Eurovision Song Contest entry Beg Steal Or Borrow to bolster his argument against Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. Lord Glasman said that the Labour leadership have showed a 'tin-eared contempt for the public' He said: ‘I think our position is like that 1970s terrible song .  .  . We’re going to beg, then we’re going to steal and then we’re going to borrow to get the money – that’s going to further humiliate people.’ Last night the Conservatives  seized on the remarks as a sign of a ‘choreographed move’ at the top of the party to unseat Mr Balls – amid renewed speculation in the party about Mr Miliband’s leadership. Lord Glasman’s remarks emerged days after a poll showed that Mr Miliband’s lead over the Tories  had fallen to only three points. Lord Glasman, one of Labour’s most influential thinkers, made his remarks in a private discussion on ‘reforming the public services’ at last week’s Progress conference, at which senior party figures gathered to discuss tactics for winning the next Election. Lord Glasman quoted the New Seekers 1972 Eurpvision entry Beg, Steal or Borrow . He condemned the Miliband- Balls approach for showing ‘this tin-eared kind of contempt for the public that still permeates – no,  no, no, if you spend more it will  be better’. He added: ‘I think the State should be helping you help your mum – not we will help, we will take care of your mum. We’ve got to partner up with people.’ His intervention comes as Mr Miliband faces increasing pressure to flesh out the party’s economic policies. He admitted for the first time three weeks ago that Labour would have to borrow billions of pounds to fund its policies. When The Mail on Sunday contacted Lord Glasman last night, he burst out laughing and said: ‘It just came to me suddenly – beg from the IMF, steal from the poor and borrow the rest.’ Asked if he realised his comments would be seen as a direct attack on the Miliband-Balls economic strategy, he said: ‘Well, we don’t even know what that is.","Prospect of minority government could trigger early General Election .

Warden Kit Hancock and RSPCA officer Simon Kite took a boat to the water to recover the distressed goose, which had been shot all the way through its body. Despicable: An injured goose is seen to by vets after an unknown person shoots them with a crossbow bolt . Mr Hancock said: '[The goose] was still swimming. We managed to net it after about ten minutes and get it aboard. it didn't put up much of a fight as by then it was so worn out. Its partner was naturally not very happy and after the injured goose was taken away by the RSPCA it kept honking, calling for its mate, for about three hours afterwards. I've been doing this job for five years and thankfully incidents like this are very rare occurrences.' Neil Reeves, countryside manager for Dartmoor, said: 'It is disgraceful behaviour to do something like this to a wild animal. I just don't understand why anyone would want to. Perhaps they wanted it for their dinner but to carry around and use a crossbow in this manner is deplorable.' The goose was taken by Mr Kite to Drakes Vets in the nearby village of Yelverton. Vet Ulrika Hoffman-Johnson who treated the animal said: 'The arrow went through its body just behind the legs and the tip came out the other side, just missing its ribcage and the vital organs. We gave it an X-ray, antibiotics and painkillers and stitched it up.' The goose was returned to the RSPCA where it is now recovering at the West Hatch Wildlife Sanctuary in Taunton, Somerset.

Gabrielle Molina's 15-year-old sister . found the young girl hanging in the bedroom they shared at their home in Queens . Village, New York on Wednesday afternoon, police said. The girl, a seventh grader at a local middle . school, left a heartbreaking note explaining that she had taken her . life after suffering relentless taunts online and at school from her classmates. Her father George told the New York Post that . they called her a slut and a whore and told her she looked like she . suffered from Down syndrome - and that a recent breakup pushed her over . the edge. 'I was trying . to comfort her because she was getting weak,' said the distraught . father, who was seen sobbing outside the family's home on Thursday. 'I . wanted to make her happy.' She . was also teased after a sickening video entitled 'Gabby's Fight' appeared on YouTube, friends said. It showed the girl, who was barely 5ft tall, being beaten up by a former friend. George . Molina said that the school failed to address the incident quickly . enough and the footage was not immediately removed from the internet. Loss: Schoolmates bullied the young girl for her looks and because she self harmed, her friends said . After the fight a school counselor set up a meeting with Gabby's parents and between the girls, who made up, her mother said. Fellow students also knew that Gabby was self harming, and also teased her for that, friends told the New York Daily News. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said . that investigators had taken two computers from Gabby's home to see if . she was being bullied online. 'It's a terrible tragedy,' he said. But Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott . said that a preliminary investigation did not show any . serious bullying problems at the school - which its students denied. Gabby 'said that she wanted to move . schools because she felt uncomfortable. People wanted to jump her and . people bothered her,' her friend Samantha Martin, 12, told the Daily News. Scene: Gabby's sister returned to their family home on Wednesday and found the girl hanged in their room . Police questioned students at the school on Thursday but no charges have been brought. Gabby's mother said that the girl had not come down for school in the morning on Wednesday and that her door was locked, which was not unusual. Her grandparents knocked on the door throughout the day but, when she did not respond, they thought she was sleeping. But when her sister returned home from school, she forced the door open and found her body. In a letter she left behind, Gabby apologized to her family - her sister, 21-year-old brother Geonel, and parents George and Glenda - for taking her life. Family members said she had wanted to . become lawyer. Her aunt, Irma Molina, told the Post that she . didn't understand the young girl's death. 'She's very quiet, very friendly,' she said. 'She wanted . to dance and sing. She’s so young.' 'Cruel': Students at her school, IS 109, posted a video of her being beaten up online, friends said . Neighbors also told the Post of their shock at the death of the young girl, whose family has lived at the home for nearly 10 years. 'They're just a wonderful family,' said a neighbor. 'It's just so sad. I don't know how they are going to get by.'

A 63-year-old man who only leaves his Michigan apartment to make frequent trips to the doctor's office is now being summoned to a prison in Arkansas because he never served his full term for killing his father as a teenager. The case of Lester Stiggers is bringing a decades-old interstate turf battle back to the forefront as the Governor of Arkansas has called for Stiggers to be extradited back to Arkansas. Stiggers was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for killing his father as a teenager in 1965. Back to his past: Lester Stiggers was arrested in 1965 for murder but has been out of prison since 1971 because of the former Governor of Michigan's ruling in his favor . When he was granted a five-day leave from prison for good behavior, he headed to Michigan, where his mother lived. He's been there ever since - thanks to the then-governor of Michigan who, in 1971, refused to send him back to Arkansas and its notorious prison system. Enforcing the law: After Stiggers was discovered recently, Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe ordered him to be sent back to the state to serve his time . Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe on Wednesday defended his request to have the elderly fugitive returned in spite of his poor health. ‘I'm an invalid now. I'm half dead. What would their interest be to have me back?’ Stiggers said. Beebe told The Associated Press he wasn't aware of Lester Stiggers' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the Arkansas prison system, but that will not make him revoke his request. 'We can't pick and choose which laws that we like and which laws that we don't like,' Beebe told the AP. 'And . once the Department of Correction was given information about his . whereabouts, and... they requested me to sign an extradition warrant, . then that's my duty and that's the law and that's what we did.' The AP recently found Stiggers living in a one-bedroom apartment along a busy road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan. He gets by on $700 a month in Social Security benefits, usually making trips outside only to see a doctor. His life now: Stiggers is 63-years-old, in poor health, and lives with his companion Delphine Hopkins in a small apartment in Warren, Michigan. He is seen holding Ms Hopkins' granddaughter in this photo . He needs an inhaler and 10 pills a day for his diabetes, high blood pressure and other ailments. A stocky man with thick arms, Stiggers grappled with sewer lines as a plumber until two strokes ended his working days and made his speech difficult to understand. He was astounded to learn that Arkansas has renewed its efforts to bring him back to prison - more than four decades after then-Governor William Milliken blocked the state's initial request. At the time, Milliken wrote that the notorious Arkansas prison system was a form of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’. 'No purpose would be served now by sending that man back,' the former governor told the Associated Press. Now 91-years-old, Mr Milliken said that . he does not remember Stigger's case specifically but the move to allow . the young black man to stay in the midwestern state does seem fitting. Then and now: Former Michigan governor William Milliken, seen in 1978 at left and 2008 at right, initially allowed Stiggers to stay in his state because the Arkansas prison system was notorious at the time . 'Knowing how distressed I was about the shameful state of race relations in our country, I would have wanted to give that man another chance,' he said. Beebe, a Democrat, sent a letter this year to Republican Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, seeking Stiggers after his Social Security benefits put him back on Arkansas' radar. State prison officials said they didn't know that Stiggers was sick, either, but Department of Correction spokeswoman Shea Wilson told the AP that it's not the agency's role to make judgments about whether Stiggers should be brought back to Arkansas. 'It's our job to carry out the mandates of the court,' Wilson said. 'And that's simply what we're doing in our efforts to seek him.' Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said the matter was still under review and 'there's not currently a timeframe for when that may be concluded.'","Lester Stiggers was arrested for his father's murder as a teen in 1965 .

An American World War II veteran who lost his dog tag in France nearly 70 years ago was reunited with it by Cory Booker in a ceremony Wednesday. As rain fell outside, 90-year-old Corporal Willie Wilkins was honored in a ceremony under Newark City Hall's soaring rotunda, where Mayor Booker presented Wilkins and his daughter Carol Wilkins with the dog tag on Wednesday, Victory in Europe Day. Carol Wilkins leaned over the side of her father's wheelchair and handed him a small red box, a heart-shaped cutout revealing its contents: a weathered, bent silver dog tag. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocked: Corporal Willie Wilkins, 90, shakes the hand of Mayor Cory Booker, who returned the dog tags Wilkins lost in France 70 years ago . ‘Oh, Daddy, look,’ Wilkins exclaimed as her father opened it, his eyes beaming and smile wide. ‘They're back.’ Sixty-nine years after losing his dog tag on the battlefields of southern France, Willie Wilkins reclaimed it Wednesday after a trans-Atlantic effort to return it to him that started more than a decade ago in a French backyard and ended with a surprise ceremony in Newark City Hall. This is an amazing story of a man of great courage, and great valor and great honor who served his nation,” said Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who presented the stunning find to Wilkins, who is native to the New Jersey city. ‘I am so happy,’ Carol Wilkins said. ‘You don't know what joy is on my heart for what you have done for my father.’ Morbid: Wilkins lost this tag while hauling American bodies from a battlefield in Southern France in 1944 . Lost & Found: Anne-Marie Crespo, left, found the tag while digging under an olive tree in her Istres, France back yard in 2001. She wrote letters, right, to American officials and eventually the Wilkins family and 12 years after she found them, the tags were returned to their owner . In August 1944, Willie Wilkins was an Army corporal fighting in the Allied invasion of southern France. Amid the horrors of battle, Wilkins's job was one of the grimmest. A quartermaster, Wilkins was responsible for removing and identifying the bodies of dead American servicemen and having them buried or transported back to the United States. At some point during the invasion, Willie Wilkins's silver dog tag slipped off his neck. It's unclear how it happened. ‘It could have been an arm, it could have been a hip that dragged it off, because he was picking up dead bodies,’ Carol Wilkins said. ‘He said it was horrible. Blood everywhere. Parts. All he knew was to pick up those bodies for the family members of dead soldiers.’ Wilkins returned to Newark, and worked on the assembly line at Western Electric in nearby Kearny. Grim: Wilkins' job was to haul the bloody parts of dead soldiers from the battlefields of Southern France when he lost his tag . He was a happy man who doted on his only daughter, but his service as a quartermaster took an enormous toll. He had a nervous breakdown and post-traumatic stress disorder and retired at age 44, Carol Wilkins said. Willie Wilkins would sometimes talk about his war experience, especially when Carol was young, mentioning that he lost his dog tags. He and his family were convinced the small medallion would remain a tangible piece of the history of the invasion, buried somewhere in what were once the bloody battlefields of Provence. Back in 2001, in a backyard 4,000 miles from Newark, Anne-Marie Crespo was tilling the soil around an olive tree tucked into a corner when she found the dog tag. She was enjoying an early spring day in Istres, France, a village about 35 miles northwest of Marseille, when she hit a small piece of metal stamped with a name and numbers. She brought it inside, cleaned it and tried to straighten out the tag's bend, only to break it slightly. Crespo knew the tag belonged to a soldier and kept it on a bookcase shelf. She presumed the soldier died on the battlefield, and held a ceremony at her home to honor Wilkins and other American war dead. ‘I often thought of this poor soldier dead for FRANCE + FREEDOMS,’ Crespo later wrote in a handwritten letter to Carol Wilkins, dated April 13, 2013. ‘WILLIE WILKINS what a pretty name, as it sounds good for us French, for me anyway.’ Crespo would often show the dog tag to visitors, proud of the ‘treasure’ she found in the backyard but unsure how it got there. She showed the artifact to a friend over a meal. The friend mentioned that her brother had a passion for history, so she took photographs of the dog tags and emailed them to him. Amazing: In a letter to Wilkins' daughter, Crespo marveled that she'd found the tag under an olive tree, a 'symbol of peace' Hero: Newark Mayor Cory Booker speaks to reporters at Wednesday's event, where the 'Super Hero Mayor' presented a war hero with his tags . The brother, Philippe Clerbout, posted the photos in an online history forum. He got a reply from the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C., which said Wilkins joined the military on Dec. 31, 1942, in Fort Bragg, N.C. Clerbout became a man with a mission: finding Willie Wilkins. His quest to help an American soldier was personal. Cherbout's father was a prisoner in Germany from June 1940 until the camp was liberated in 1945. He returned to France with American troops and married Cherbout's mother. Cherbout sent emails to anyone he thought could help, from the White House to media outlets. A woman from the U.S. Department of Veteran's affairs in Minneapolis located Willie Wilkins in Newark. Carol Wilkins thought the phone call was a prank. It was the woman from Minneapolis, asking for her father's honorable discharge number because someone found his dog tag. Courageous: Booker called Wilkins' 'an amazing story of a man of great courage' at the event held at Newark City Hall May 8 . Carol Wilkins didn't believe the woman and insisted on calling her back. The call was legitimate. ‘I said, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,’ she said, ‘They found your dog tags. You know you never had them.’ Wilkins said her father ‘was just smiling. He was so happy.’ Veteran's affairs got in touch with the GI Go Fund, a Newark nonprofit that connects veterans with services and helps them make the transition to civilian life. The organization brought the dog tag to New Jersey. Dog tags are ‘who you are in the military. It's how you're identified. This is me. This is who I am,’ said Jack Fanous, executive director and co-founder of the GI Go Fund. The ceremony was attended by Bertrand Lortholary, the Counsul General of France. ‘The people of France are very grateful for the courage it took, the incredible courage, it took for American soldiers to come fight on French ground,’ he said. Carol Wilkins plans to display the tag in a case on her father's dresser. Willie Wilkins has been in a rehabilitation facility and suffers from Alzheimer's Disease and other ailments. She expects him to return to their home soon. When asked if he ever thought he would see his dog tag again, Willie Wilkins shook his head. ‘I never did,’ he said. Long haul: Wilkins is now 90. Asked if he thought he'd see his dog tags again, he replied 'I never did.'","Newark, New Jersey native Cpl.

The inquiry into claims of rape against Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was launched after a fellow Tory MP accompanied an alleged victim to a police station, it has been claimed. Mr Evans, MP for Ribble Valley, was arrested earlier this month over allegations that he had raped one man and subjected another to a sexual assault. He vigorously denies the claims and has refused to stand down as deputy to Commons Speaker John Bercow. The arrest caused a sensation in Westminster, but the claim that it came about thanks to the intervention of a fellow Conservative is even more of a bombshell. The MP who apparently accompanied the young man to the police station told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is important for legal reasons that I make absolutely no comment.’ Mr Evans says the allegations, which date from 2009 to last month, are ‘completely false’. He has not yet been charged with any offence and has been bailed until June 19. He has temporarily stepped aside from his duties as Deputy Speaker, but says he intends to return to the chair of the chamber after the debates on the Queen’s Speech. The MP has confirmed that in 2009 he was interviewed by the then Tory chief whip Patrick McLoughlin over allegedly making an unwanted advance to a man, but has said it was a ‘misreading of signals’.

Tragic: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her own home in Valley Springs, California, last month . Police have arrested the 12-year-old brother of an 8-year-old girl who was mysteriously stabbed at her home in a rural Northern California community last month. The boy, who has not been identified, will be charged with homicide, Calaveras County Sheriff Gary Kuntz told reporters on Saturday. The April 27 attack on Leila Fowler shook the tightknit Valley Springs community of about 7,400 people and set off a massive manhunt. The boy had told police he found his sister's body and encountered an intruder in the home while their parents were at a Little League game. He described the man as being tall with long gray hair. Police have said there was no sign of a burglary or robbery at the house. Investigators did a door-to-door sweep of homes, storage sheds and horse stables scattered across the oak-studded hills foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Divers also searched two nearby reservoirs in search of clues. As part of the investigation, authorities seized several knives from the home Leila shared with her father, stepmother and siblings to determine if one could have inflicted the fatal wounds.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:58 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:59 EST, 9 May 2013 . American unemployment has fallen to a five-year low, latest figures reveal. The number of U.S. citizens who applied for unemployment benefits dropped by 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 323,000. Layoffs have returned to pre-recession levels, a trend that could lead to more hiring. The Labor Department said today that the less volatile four-week average dropped 6,250 to 336,750. Returning to work: The U.S. job market has also improved over the past six months. Net job gains have averaged of 208,000 a month from November through April . That's the fewest since November 2007, one month before the Great Recession began. Applications are a proxy for layoffs. Weekly applications have fallen about nine per cent since November and are now at a level consistent with a healthy economy. The last time weekly applications were lower was in January 2008, when they were 321,000. Economists were largely encouraged by the decline. 'This is a very positive trend and we . should embrace it,' Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, . said in an email to clients. The . job market has also improved over the past six months. Net job gains . have averaged of 208,000 a month from November through April. That's up from only 138,000 a month in the previous six months. Much of the job growth has come from fewer layoffs - not increased hiring. Layoffs fell in January to the lowest level on records dating back 12 years, though they have risen moderately since then. Overall hiring remains far below pre-recession levels and unemployment remains high at 7.5 per cent. Graph showing U.S. unemployment figures from April 2011 to April 2013 . For hiring to increase enough to rapidly lower the unemployment rate, companies must gain more confidence in the economy. But some have held off adding new workers in recent months, possibly because of concerns about the impact of federal spending cuts and tax increases. And an increase in Social Security taxes could slow consumer spending, which drives nearly two-thirds of economic activity. The Federal Reserve said last week that the federal government's policy changes are 'restraining economic growth.' But Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital, pointed out that the decline in unemployment aid applications suggests companies are not too worried about the fiscal drag. He notes they are responding to the government's actions by reducing hiring and cutting back on their employees' hours - not laying off workers. That means they anticipate the weakness will be temporary. Even modest job gains could provide consumers with more money to offset the impact of the tax increase. Total wages rose 3.6 percent in April compared with a year earlier. That's comfortably ahead of the 1.5 percent inflation rate. The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent from January through March, a big improvement from the anemic growth of 0.4 percent in the final three months of last year. But most economists expect growth will slow in the current quarter to 2 percent or lower. About 4.9 million people collected unemployment aid in the week that ended April 20, the most recent period for which figures are available. That's about 90,000 fewer than the previous week.","U.S citizens applying for benefits dropped by 4,000 last week .

The Japanese military's forced prostitution of Asian women before and during the Second Word War was necessary to 'maintain discipline' in the ranks and provide rest for soldiers who risked their lives in battle, an outspoken politician has said. Asian countries that bore the brunt of Japan's wartime aggression have long complained that Japan has failed to fully atone for wartime atrocities. Speaking yesterday, young, brash Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, who is also co-leader of an emerging conservative political party, told reporters there was no clear evidence that the Japanese military coerced women to become what are euphemistically called 'comfort women'. 'Disappointing': Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto has said a 'comfort women' system was necessary in order to maintain discipline among soldiers . He said: 'To maintain discipline in the military, it must have been necessary at that time. For soldiers who risked their lives in circumstances where bullets are flying around like rain and wind, if you want them to get some rest, a comfort women system was necessary. That's clear to anyone.' Historians say up to 200,000 women, mainly from the Korean Peninsula and China, were forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers in military brothels. An unidentified South Korean government official told Yonhap news agency it was disappointing that a senior Japanese official 'made comments supportive of crimes against humanity and revealed a serious lack of a historical understanding and respect for women's rights'. Mr Hashimoto's comments come amid mounting criticism at the prospect of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative government revising Japan's past apologies for wartime atrocities. Before he took office in December, Mr Abe had advocated revising a 1993 statement by then-Prime Minister Yohei Kono acknowledging and expressing remorse for the suffering caused to the sexual slaves of Japanese troops. Outspoken: Osaka's Mayor is also the co-leader of emerging Conservative party the Japan Restoration Party together with strident nationalist Shintaro Ishihara . Mr Abe has acknowledged 'comfort women' existed but has denied they were coerced into prostitution, citing a lack of official evidence. Over the past two days, top officials in Mr Abe's government have appeared to ease their concern over Japan's past apologies, apparently to calm tensions with South Korea and China and address US concerns about his nationalist agenda. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters today that 'the stance of the Japanese government on the comfort women issue is well known. They have suffered unspeakably painful experiences. The Abe Cabinet has the same sentiments as past Cabinets'. Mr Hashimoto is co-head of the newly formed Japan Restoration Party with former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, who is a strident nationalist.","'Comfort women' were forced to provide sex for soldiers in military brothels .

A day before a 12-year-old boy was arrested for the stabbing to death of his 8-year-old sister, his mother described him as ‘protective’ of his younger sibling. Leila Fowler's killing last month shook the quiet community of Valley Springs, southeast of Sacramento, and set off an intense manhunt. Her brother was in the home at the time and told police he saw a man run from the scene. Days later, the boy appeared with his father and stepmother at a vigil for his sister. On Friday, as speculation in the community built that perhaps the boy was involved, his biological mother told Sacramento television station KOVR her son ‘could never hurt his sister.’ 'I've never seen him be mean to her,' said Priscilla Rodriquez.

Carlos the Jackal, the flamboyant terrorist and self-proclaimed revolutionary who was once one of the Cold War's most wanted men, today launched an appeal against his life sentence for orchestrating bombings that killed 11 people in France two decades ago. Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, is serving two life sentences in France for a triple murder in 1975 and for the bombings in France in 1982 and 1983. He's been behind bars since 1994 after French agents seized him in Sudan. Today, as he launched an appeal, he demanded new lawyers and accused the Venezuelan state of seeking to sabotage his defence by not supplying promised financial support for his existing legal team. When the court agreed to provide him . with two lawyers funded by the French state, a laughing Ramirez called . out 'one blonde, one brunette' - a remark for which he was rebuked by . the court president. Behind bars: Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez . Sanchez, is serving two life sentences in France for a triple murder in . 1975 and for bombings in France in 1982 and 1983 that killed 11 people . and injured over 140 . He was convicted of the triple murder in 1997 and the bombings in 2011 after a trial that captivated the world for months. But now his lawyer, Isabelle . Coutant-Peyre, who is also his wife, is demanding he be sent back to . his homeland of Venezuela on the grounds that his capture was illegal . because he wasn't convicted of a crime until 17 years later. For the defence: French lawyer Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, who is also married to Carlos the Jackal . His alleged ties to attacks by . far-left and Palestinian terror groups made him feared among governments . in Western Europe and the Middle East, but also brought him admirers . including the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. In France Ramirez began an appeal against his life sentence for the bombings. The hearing began with him demanding a new lawyer. Ms Coutant-Peyre told one of Venezuela's state-run radio stations that she hoped to meet government officials to discuss the matter. It has been 16 years since the . Venezuelan was handed his first life sentence for the 1975 killing of two unarmed . policemen and one of their informers in the French capital. For many, . his 1997 incarceration in La Santé prison was the end of the story. But in 2011, he was convicted of masterminding four attacks across France in 1982 and 1983, . which killed 11 people and wounded more than 140. But if there was any question that . the ageing Jackal felt any remorse for his crimes, the clenched-fist . salute he delivered at the end of that second trial in 2011 made his position very clear: the Marxist Islamist . terrorist is still at war with the world. Ramirez' long-running custody battle has, at times, been overshadowed by his love life, that saw him marry his lawyer, Ms Coutant-Peyre - a petite and highly distinguished 58-year-old barrister. The couple married in La Santé prison 12 years ago, with Carlos handing over a platinum Cartier ring in front of armed guards, before returning to his cell alone. Indeed, his thoughts at the moment appear to be less concerned with the horrific crimes of which he now stands accused - including causing an explosion on an express train which killed five people — than his 'human right' to consummate his marriage. While his wife claims that - legally - too many years have passed for him to be tried for the bomb attacks, Carlos has been telling friends of his desire to assuage the 'burning passion' he and wife both hold for each other. He regularly sends the previously married mother-of-three love poems from his cell. 'Ten years is a long time. We have every right to be together and to be free,' said Carlos, during a recent telephone conversation with a close friend from inside La Santé. He has since been placed in solitary confinement for phoning out of the prison without permission. 'My wife has been waiting long enough and we deserve a honeymoon,' said Carlos during the call, adding: 'By the grace of God and wheeler-dealing between France and Venezuela, we'll get one.' For her part, Madame Coutant-Peyre . says she is determined to remould her husband's image as an unfeeling . killing machine into that of warm human being who was 'illegally . captured and imprisoned' by 'politically-motivated' police. 'He . is not a criminal,' she has said, 'but a politician, like Nelson Mandela.' She has pledged to clear his name 'for all time' and see him return to . Venezuela as a released 'political prisoner'. She has her work cut out in pleading his case: for Carlos's reign of terror stretches back to the early 1970s. War with the world: If there was any question that the ageing Jackal felt any remorse for his crimes, the clenched-fist salute he delivered at a court appearance in 2011 made his position very clear . Rescuers and policemen are seen on the site where a bombed car exploded in Rue Marbeuf, near Champs Elysées in Paris on April 22, 1982. The attack was attributed to Carlos the Jackal . One person died and 63 were wounded in the 1982 Paris attack in front of the office of pro-Iraqi publication Al Watan al Arabi . The son of Left-wing millionaire . Venezuelan lawyer Jose Altagracia Ramirez Navas, who named his three . sons Vladimir, Ilich and Lenin after the leader of Russia's Bolshevik . revolution, Carlos was a paid-up member of the Communist party by the . age of ten, and spent time as an undergraduate at Moscow's Patrice . Lumumba University, established by the Soviets as a training ground for . revolutionaries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. By . 1970, he had volunteered for the Popular Front for the Liberation of . Palestine — which is thought to have first given him the codename Carlos . because of his South American lineage — playing an active role for the . group in the north of Jordan during the Black September conflict against . King Hussein's forces. He was also allegedly a part of an attempt on the life of Joseph Sieff, the Jewish chairman of Marks & Spencer, in London. In . 1975 - the year he converted from Catholicism to Islam - he killed two . unarmed policemen and one of their informers in Paris after they turned . up at his hide-out flat on the Left Bank. He shot them dead and fled . through a window, leaving his fingerprints on both the discarded gun and . a whisky bottle. In . December that year, while still on the run, he became a household name . after leading a six-man attack on the Vienna HQ of OPEC, the . Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries. Carlos, . flamboyantly handsome in sunglasses and a Che Guevara beret, took some . 70 people hostage, including 11 government ministers. Three . hostages were killed, but dozens of others ended up being forced to fly . with him to Algeria, where a ransom - thought to have been in the . region of £10 million was eventually paid for their return home. Then in 1982 and 1983 he masterminded . But with the fall of the Berlin Wall . in 1989, safe havens were harder to come by.

Incident: David Chandler, left, identified 35-year-old Ricardo Woods (right), who has now been found guilty of murdering Chandler . Eye contact: Shooting victim David Chandler blinked his eyes hard three times, opening them wide in between each blink, after he was shown a picture of Ricardo Woods and asked if he was his attacker . Prosecutors showed jurors a videotaped police interview in which they . say Chandler blinked three times for ""yes"" to identify a photo of Woods . as his shooter. The defense had tried to block the video, saying . Chandler's blinks were inconsistent and unreliable. Woods' attorney, Kory Jackson, said Chandler's condition and drugs . used to treat him could have affected his ability to understand and . respond during the police interview. Judge Beth Myers had watched the video and said that she found the . identification reliable. She noted that Chandler's identification was . made by pronounced, exaggerated movement of the eyes and not by . involuntary movements. A doctor who treated Chandler also testified that . Chandler was able to communicate clearly about his condition. Back to prison: Ricardo Woods is shown being taken from court after he was found guilty . In the video, police had to repeat some questions when Chandler . failed to respond or when the number of times he blinked appeared . unclear. But Chandler blinked his eyes hard three times when police . asked him if the photo of Woods was the photo of his shooter. He again . blinked three times when they asked him if he was sure. A jailhouse informant testified that Woods told him he shot at . Chandler because he caught him buying drugs from someone else while . still owing Woods money for drugs. The defense argued that the informant, who faced armed robbery . charges, was trying to use testimony against Woods to get a lighter . sentence for himself. The defense also said Chandler had stolen drugs . from dealers, was considered a police ""snitch"" and had many enemies. Defense: Woods had pleaded not guilty in the crime. He is seen reacting as his conviction was read . The defense insisted that Woods was a victim of misidentification and misinformation. Legal experts say such cases — where prosecutors attempt to show a . defendant was identified by a gesture — are not unheard of but are . unusual. Dying identifications relying on gestures rather than words are . often not used in trials because of concern over reliability or . differing interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases . around the country that have ended in convictions.

Inked stars such as the One Direction boys, Cheryl Cole and David Beckham are idolised by their fans, who often rush to copy their heroes. But now a renowned celebrity tattoo artist, who has created some of the tattoos on Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran and James Arthur has spoken out about the terrifying dark side to this body art trend. Kevin Paul has launched a campaign, ‘Tattoo Regulation 2013’, to introduce regulations on the tattoo industry after hearing too many horror stories of work going wrong or becoming infected because it was done by unqualified tattooists with kits that are easily available for anyone to purchase online. Tattoos done by totally untrained artists or by those who have bought a kit online, can result in poor tattoos and dangerous infections . Kevin Paul asked people to send in their pictures of badly done tattoos as part of the campaign and was inundated with responses . Even if unprofessional body art doesn't become infected, the results are often a long way from the desired result, with poor colouring (left) and bad drawing (right) commonly seen . Currently there are very limited regulations on the industry. There are no qualifications required and no proof of training or experience is needed to open up a tattoo studio or - even more disturbingly - set up a 'mobile' business from home. In order to open a tattoo parlour all that is required is that the premises must have wipeable . surfaces, hot running water and must have an autoclave, easy to pick up online, which is used to . sterilise certain equipment. 'Literally anybody can open up a tattoo studio,' Kevin Paul told the MailOnline. ‘This is putting members of the . public at risk as there are thousands of people who are untrained and . unaware of the necessary health risks involved setting up . shops. ‘Anybody can buy both cheap and . professional tattoo equipment off the internet and there is no law to . stop or prosecute people doing this. ‘ . One Direction singer Harry Styles is a client of Kevin Paul, but has also let his untrained friends tattoo him . James Arthur (left) and Jamie Laing (right)  have both had work done by Kevin Paul,  tweeting from the studio . Ed Sheeran is just one of Kevin's celebrity fans . X factor winner James Arthur tweeted his enthusiasm of Kevin's work . Kevin's celebrity clients have been tweeting about the campaign . Speaking about the consequences of such equipment being so readily available to anyone, Kevin, who has been a full time tattooist since 2002 says: ‘Cheap equipment combined with someone who is untrained is a huge risk to people who are unaware of what to look for when getting a tattoo. ‘People who are untrained in tattooing are unaware of the infections and diseases that can be caused by using cheap and unsterile equipment. ‘Permanent scarring to the skin can be caused if the tattoo is not done correctly and bloodborne diseases such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV can be spread.’ Kevin Paul is hopeful that his celebrity influence means that the campaign to . introduce more regulation into the industry will be successful, and he . has launched a huge media and social campaign to spread the message . about the dangers of unprofessional tattoos. He will appear on Radio 4 later this week and is to visit the House of Parliament to discuss legislation with MPs. The . movement's Facebook page ‘Tattoo Regulation 2013’, is filled with . pictures of body art that has gone wrong to illustrate the prevalence of . the problem. A simple search on eBay reveals huge number of kits, including 'starter kits' available to buy for as little as £20, with no restrictions . Kevin says: ‘Members of the public assume that a tattoo studio is going to be run by professionals as it has been allowed to be opened, but the problem is that the council will currently allow anyone to open up a studio. ‘There needs to be a certain level of training required to open up a studio, preferably at least two years, and also a basic level of knowledge about tattooing and how to be safe and sterile, possibly a test needs to be taken and a certificate awarded when passed to prove this. ‘And not all of these people are opening studios, the majority of them are working from their homes where it is even harder to keep hygienic and sterile. The council are actually licensing these people to work from their homes which is outrageous, but only a small number of them even bother obtaining a license to carry out their work. Kevin say the worry is that people just don’t realise they may be putting their health, not to mention their appearance at risk by visiting some tattoo parlours, or going to ‘artists’ homes . ‘Due to these people working from home, the number of underage kids getting tattooed has increased massively. We have contacted many schools which are aware of this but take no further action against it. ‘This needs to be stopped and changed to ensure the safety of the general public and to make tattooing a much safer business. We need to make people aware of what to look for when getting a tattoo. Until the regulation of the industry is . in place, Kevin has some advice for anyone thinking of getting ‘inked: . ‘People need to go into these studios and ask to see portfolios of . healed work that has been done there before even considering getting . tattooed by them. Going off of a recommendation is another good way of . finding a decent tattooist.' Currently there is no qualification required and there is no proof of . training, experience or knowledge about tattooing needed to open a parlour or buy kits online .

Astronauts on the International Space Station have discovered that it has a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system.

On Thursday the six-member crew noticed white flakes of ammonia leaking out of the station. Astronauts on the International Space Station have discovered that it has a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system . Chilled liquid ammonia runs through multiple radiator loops to cool the station's power system on its eight giant solar array panels. NASA said the leak is increasing from one previously leaking loop that can be bypassed if needed. A minor leak of this ammonia was first noticed in 2007, and NASA has been studying the issue ever since. In November 2012 two astronauts took a spacewalk to fix the problem, rewiring some coolant lines and installing a spare radiator due to fears the original radiator was damaged by a micrometeorite impact. Space station Commander Chris Hadfield of Canada has tweeted that the problem, while serious, has been stabilized .

The library fire was reported minutes after the twin bombing near the finish line at Monday's Boston marathon. It first appeared that the incidents were related, a belief that officials later denied. But now, officials are turning to the facility, located next to UMass Boston's campus, as possibly being linked to the terror attack. Damage: The fire at the John F.

Shuttered: The library, seen in a 2009 photo, is now closed to the public while officials take a look at the cause of the fire there . The library said in a statement yesterday that the facility will remain closed 'until further notice.' Library director Tom Putnam told the New York Daily News that the cause of the fire is not yet known. No injuries were reported at the library, which is located about three miles from the marathon's finish line where two blasts killed three people and injured 183 others. Putnam originally said that the fire was caused by an electrical problem during the mass panic of the bombing at the marathon. A photo from the scene showed a charred exterior near the building's front entrance. The library's communications director, Rachel Flor, told The Boston Globe: 'There was a fire, and it’s still unclear how it began. We did hear something that sounded like an explosion.'

It is 70 years since the Ministry of Food’s leaflets taught Britons to eat well on rations and stay ‘fit for the fight’ during the Second World War. But much of the long-forgotten dietary advice still stands and, says a leading nutritionist, could help improve our diet today. A new book, Eating For Victory, reproduces the leaflets distributed along with posters in the 1940s. Here is some of the advice as it was printed. It’s accompanied by wartime illustrations – with a modern interpretation of the old wisdom... A new book, Eating For Victory, contains posters which were distributed by the Ministry of Food to try and encourage Britons to eat healthily during WWII. Dr Carrot, pictured, and his companion Potato Pete were two of the Ministry of Food's most popular creations . POTATOES . There is no vegetable more useful than the homely potato. It is a valuable yet cheap source of energy, and one of the foods that help to protect us from ill-health. It contains Vitamin C and 1lb of potatoes daily will give half the amount of this vitamin needed to prevent against fatigue and fight infection. So don’t think of potatoes merely as something to serve with the meat. A stuffed baked potato can be a course in itself. Bridget Benelam, a scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, says: ‘A medium-sized baked potato, with skin, provides a third of the recommended daily amount (RDA) of Vitamin C – twice that of an apple. It will also provide half the RDA of potassium – important for blood pressure and water balance – iron, zinc and B vitamins.’ The homely potato: Britons were encouraged to eat potatoes in the 1940s, pictured left, as they are a cheap source of energy and packed full of vitamin C. Leaflets were also distributed encouraging people to eat cheese because it is a 'concentrated energy-giving food', pictured right . CHEESE . Cheese is an A1 food because it is an excellent body-builder, better than meat for building firm muscles. It builds strong bones and teeth, too. Therefore, it is invaluable for growing children. Plenty of cheese in childhood means less dental trouble in later life. It is a concentrated energy-giving . food, especially suitable for heavy workers as it gives a large amount . of energy in small bulk. It contains a high proportion of fat and so gives a feeling of satisfaction after a meal. Eat like a granny: Bridget Benelam says much of the advice given in the 1940s is still relevant today . Bridget says: . ‘A matchbox-sized serving, 30g, of cheese provides a quarter of our . daily calcium needs – crucial for maintaining bone density – although . milk or yogurt might be better choices as they are lower in fat. ‘Cheese is as good a source of protein as meat but generally contains more fat, so should be eaten less.’ HERRINGS . ‘Of . all the fish that swim in the sea,’ runs the old saying, ‘the herring . is the king.’ Consider the herring’s food value. It is a very cheap . source of the best body-building protein. Herring . oil not only supplies an extraordinarily high number of calories and . energy-giving units, but it also contains two vitamins, A and D. Vitamin . A strengthens resistance to disease and Vitamin D is essential for . bones and teeth. Bridget says: . ‘This is still true – herrings are an excellent source of fish oil. Research since the 1940s has shown the omega 3 in oily fish is important . for good heart and brain health. 'We should eat two portions of fish a week, one oily. Nowadays other types of fish are readily available, such as tuna.’ DRIED EGGS . Dried egg is pure fresh egg with no additions, and nothing but the moisture taken away. It is pure egg, spray-dried. Eggs . contain first-class body-building material. They also help us to resist . colds and other infection because of their high protective properties. They are easily digested, and for this reason are especially good for . children and invalids. Bridget says: . ‘Transporting food is easy now so we generally eat only fresh eggs. Two . medium eggs provide your entire RDA of B12, important for blood and . brain function, and 60 per cent of our Vitamin D requirement. They are . also high in protein.’ King of the sea: Herring was a cheap, readily-available fish that provided a lot of protein and vitamins, pictured right, while Britons were encouraged to eat dried eggs for their protein, Vitamin D and B12 content, pictured right, as food transportion in the 1940s wasn't what it is today and fresh eggs were harder to come by . VITAMINS . Enemies . of Vitamins: air, water, heat. Too much of any of these will destroy . the Vitamin C. Therefore, have your vegetables as fresh as possible. Best . of all, grow them yourself. Wash your vegetables in salted water but do . not soak them overlong. Shred them before cooking to cook quickly. Bridget says: . ‘Oxidisation occurs when certain vitamins in food are exposed to heat, . air or light, meaning they degrade and become ineffective. This is . particularly true of Vitamin C, often lost in cooking water. 'It is best not to cut up veg in advance as the air will degrade the vitamins. Steaming is the best method of cooking.’ GREEN VEGETABLES . When . fresh fruit is short, we need green vegetables more than ever because . they all contain the important fresh-fruit vitamin, Vitamin C. Some have more than others. Brussels sprouts, parsley and watercress . all contain more than oranges. For healthy eating, plan to have a green . leafy vegetable at least once every day. Bridget says: ‘This . all holds true – vegetables can have just as much Vitamin C as fruit. In fact, a pepper contains double the Vitamin C of an orange and will . provide your entire daily requirement. ‘Dark . green leaves are an important source of antioxidants, which protect . cells from a host of diseases from cancer to age-related sight loss.’ Dig for Victory Now: Britons were encouraged to grow their own vegetables to help with food rationing during World War II, pictured left, while soups were suggested as a quick and healthy dinner, pictured right . SOUPS AND BROTHS . Once upon a time cooks used to think a good soup needed three or four hours’ cooking, and that to be nourishing it must be made from meat and bones. Today we know better. Tasty soups can be made quickly using vegetables and vegetable water, or stock from meat cubes or vegetable extract. Bridget says: ‘Soup has a good reputation for being healthy because it’s low-calorie but fills you up because it contains a lot of water. 'The vegetables added will provide different vitamins, which won’t be lost in cooking as they just leach into the liquid. 'Soup can also be high in fibre, which keeps the gut healthy. Stock cubes can be high in salt, though.’","New book, Eating For Victory, reproduces leaflets distributed in the 1940s .

President Obama today defended his administration’s slow response to reports of chemical weapon use in Syria, in spite of his earlier promises that the use of such weapons would be considered ‘crossing a red line’. The President said at a press conference on Tuesday that ‘there is a whole host of steps that we've been taking’ but he did not specifically say whether his administration would be prepared to take military action against Bashar al-Assad’s regime. He said the war-torn country is ‘a blemish on the international community.’ Scroll down for video . Pausing: President Obama said that there are a 'host of options' for how the U.S. reacts to news of Syria using chemical weapons though they have not determined whether they will or not . ‘Generally when you use these kinds of weapons, you have the potential of killing massive numbers of people in the most inhumane way possible,’ Obama said. ‘We don’t want that genie out of the bottle.’ Photos and videos of civilians were released online last week that reportedly showed victims of chemical weapons attacks in Aleppo. The President said that his administration is still working to establish a ‘chain of custody’ for the weapons used in the attacks, as he says it is unclear exactly who fired them. ‘We don't know when they were used, how they were used. We don't know who used them,’ Obama said. ‘If we end up rushing to judgement without hard effective evidence... there may be objections even among some who are sympathetic with the opposition in the region. ‘By game changer I mean we would have the rethink the range of options that are available to us. Like I said we're already invested in trying to find a solution that is available in Syria.’ He said that his military teams have been compiling ‘a spectrum of options’ in terms of possible American use of force in the region since ‘as early as last year’ but they are still evaluating their plan. Addressing the issue: Tuesday's press conference was the first made by the President since the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday but relations seemed tense . The talk covered a wide range of issues, including his approval of the FBI’s work both leading up to and in response to the Boston Marathon bombings, his continued disapproval of Guantanamo Bay prison camp, and the sequester. He took the opportunity to reassure Americans in the wake of the April 15 bombing, saying that one of the things he was ‘most proud of’ following the attack was the resilience that he saw in Bostonians. ‘You don’t get a sense that anybody's intimidated when they go to Fenway Park a couple of days after the bombing,’ he said. He defended the work of the FBI, even though they have been subject to criticism following the revelation that both the FBI and the CIA had the elder suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev on terrorist watchlists but he was allowed to re-enter the country following six months abroad where it is believed that he may have become more radicalized. ‘It’s not as if the FBI did nothing: they not only investigated the older brother they interviewed the older brother. The question then is is there something that happened that triggered radicalization. Search: President Obama said that investigators had identified the perpetrators 'hours' after they secured the Marathon crime scene on Monday, but the photo of the suspects was not released until Thursday . ‘Are there additional things that could have been done in that interim that could have prevented? We won’t know that until that review is completed. ‘Based on what I’ve seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it is supposed to be doing, but this is hard stuff.’ He said that Russian intelligence forces have been cooperating fully with the investigation, though the relationship between the two countries is still frosty, as a residual side effect of the Cold War. 'You know, obviously, old habits die hard. There are still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10, 20, 30 years, back to the Cold War. But they're continually improving,' he said. 'I've spoken to President Putin directly. He's committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation but how do we work on counter-terrorism issues generally.' On the agenda: President Obama said that the continued usage of Guantanamo Bay prison camp is hurting American credibility abroad and is being used as a recruitment tool for terrorists . President Obama also said that another factor hurting our ability to fight terrorism is the continued usage of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, where prisoners are currently holding a hunger strike to show their disgust with their treatment. 'I don't want these individuals to die...all of us should reflect on why are we doing this? Why are we doing this?' Obama said. 'I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.' Facing the critics: President Obama has been criticized for not speaking to the press and holding the fewest conferences of many recent presidents, so he took an hour on Tuesday to address that point . The press conference was the first that the President held since the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on Saturday night, where funny speeches were used to show a lighter relationship between the White House and the press. The weekend revelry evaporated during one tense moment when reporter Jonathan Karl asked the President if he had enough ‘juice’ to get through the rest of his term, even though a number of his initiatives- including the gun control bill- have been overturned in the first 100 days of his second term. ‘If you put it that way Jonathan maybe I should just pack up and go home, golly,’ the President said jokingly. ‘As Mark Twain said “rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point.”’ The last question of the conference was taken on the fly as he was headed out of the briefing room, when someone asked his thoughts on the revelation that basketball player Jason Collins is gay. 'I had a chance to talk to him yesterday. He seems like a terrific young man, and, you know, I told him I couldn't be prouder of him,' President Obama said. 'Given the importance of sports in our society, for an individual who's excelled at the highest levels in one of major sports go ahead and say, this is who I am, I'm proud of it, I'm still a great competitor, I'm still seven feet tall and can bang with Shaq and, you know, deliver a hard foul -- and for, you know, a lot of young people out there who, you know, are -- are -- are, you know, gay or lesbian, who are struggling with these issues, to see a role model like that who's unafraid, I think it's a great thing.'","President held press conference talking about Syria's reported use of chemical weapons, but toned down rhetoric .

The former starting quarterback at Stanford University has ended his short football career following a gruesome injury he suffered while weightlifting. Josh Nunes retired yesterday after a complete tear of his right chest muscle, cutting short a collegiate career filled with dramatic highs and devastating injuries. Nunes' father, Tim, told The Associated Press that his son ruptured his pectoralis major tendon while doing his normal bench-press routine during an offseason workout in February. He dropped the weights on his chest - though the tendon had already ruptured - and had surgery a few days later to reattach it with screws. The tendon connects the pectoral muscle to the humerus bone in the arm. No further damage was caused by the falling weights other than some bumps and bruises. Josh is expected to make a full recovery, but it will take time - up to 12 months following surgery - but he says it's not worth risking an even more serious injury he could suffer on the field in 2013.

Work: An official in a protective suit enters the site where the plane part was discovered, as an NYPD officer stands guard . 5-feet: The chunk found Wednesday was 5-feet long and police say they've secured the area, pictured, 'like a crime scene' The search for remains at the . location is the second effort this year to find possible victims from 9/11. The other attempt began on . April 1 on Staten Island, and is focused on construction debris collected in the months after the terror attack.

A closer look: Officials gather in front of the site as the effort begins to find human remains . Investigators initially thought it was part of the landing gear because both pieces have similar-looking hydraulics.

It seems that the impossible has occurred: The nation's most congested city has become a model for traffic control. Yes, . gridlock still prevails and drivers' blood pressure still spikes as . LA's traffic arteries seize up during every morning and afternoon rush . hour. Yet, with the flip of a switch earlier . this year, Los Angeles became a worldwide leader by synchronizing all of . its nearly 4,400 stoplights, making it the world's first major city to . do so. Synched up: all of Los Angeles' 4,400 stop lights are now synched up . The result? Well, it can still be hell . to cross the City of the Angels by car. Synchronization has allowed LA . to boast of real improvements on paper, however, the average driver . won't always be able to discern the difference of a project that took . nearly 30 years to complete. ""To be honest . with you, I haven't felt it, yet,"" said Jack Abramyam, who has been . driving a cab across LA's mean streets for 20 years. ""Late . at night, maybe, yes,"" Abramyam said as he sat outside his cab on a . street in Chinatown recently, waiting for a fare. ""But it was never . really bad then anyway. During the day it was bad. And it's still bad."" The . way synchronization works is simple enough: With all the signals . synchronized, if you drive down a street at the posted speed limit you . should be able to make every green light - from one end of this . sprawling city of 469 square miles to the other. Of course there are any number of obstacles that can prevent that. Congestion: transportation engineer associate Abeer Kliefe works at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation's Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control Center . On . a recent mid-afternoon test drive down eight miles of Wilshire . Boulevard, for example, I was cut off by a bus, stuck behind more than . one right-turner waiting for pedestrians to cross the intersecting . street and at one point had my lane blocked by a delivery truck. Approaching . the world famous La Brea Tar Pits - where prehistoric dinosaurs once . got stuck in muck, not traffic - so many people were waiting to turn . left into a parking lot that the street became gridlocked for more than . two blocks. The numerous synchronized green lights didn't wait for me. But why would they? With the posted speed limit 35 mph, I was only . averaging 15. Still, once the LA County Museum . of Art, the high-rise apartments, the headquarters of porn publisher . Larry Flynt and the various other Wilshire Boulevard landmarks were in . the rear-view mirror, the pace did pick up. So much so that 11 green . lights in a row suddenly materialized. That string ended on the edge of . downtown, however, when Wilshire simply became clogged with too many . cars. It was a non-rush hour jam that demonstrated that, good as . synchronization may be, it isn't a magic, traffic-breaking bullet. Los Angeles Department of Transportation officials agree. City of angels - and gridlock: Los Angeles freeways are amongst the most congested in the world . As . they stated in a recent report praising the benefits of synchronized . signals, ""No traffic signal system is capable of `fixing traffic.'"" If . more motor vehicles show up in the years ahead (and there are already . more than 7.1 million of them registered in Los Angeles County, a number . greater than that of most states), then officials say LA traffic jams . will probably get worse. That's why, said . Clinton Quan, an engineering associate with the Department of . Transportation, planners are continuing to push people to ride bicycles, . take commuter rail lines and other public transportation and move close . enough to work that they can walk there. The . city has added three light rail lines in the last seven years and has . more planned. Officials also recently approved plans to allow high-rise . apartment and condominium buildings along a corridor in Hollywood where a . subway connecting the city's West Side to downtown is supposed to go. In . the meantime, Quan says, the synchronized signal program is putting up . some pretty impressive numbers, even if the average driver isn't . noticing them. It has reduced the drive time on several major LA . corridors, for example, by about 12 percent. In driver-speak, that means the trip across town that used to take you an hour has been reduced to about 53 minutes. And . that's nothing to shrug at, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow with . the Brookings Institution's metropolitan policy program, which studies . among other things the impact of traffic on the quality of life in . metropolitan areas. Several other . traffic-clogged cities are looking into instituting similar programs and . New York already synchronizes some of its stoplights, said Puentes, who . works in Washington, D.C., the ninth-worst traffic-clogged city in the . country. ""If you can get a 12 percent reduction on, say, the Washington Beltway, that would be phenomenal,"" he said.","Los Angeles became a worldwide leader by synchronizing all of .

Alleged bomb plot: Oregon teenager, Grant Acord, pictured, is accused of meticulously plotting to blow up his school in an attack 'forged and inspired by' the Columbine shootings . A high school student who was arrested after plotting to blow up his school reportedly talked to friends about bomb-making a week before his capture. Grant Acord, 17, was arrested on Thursday night after police received a tip that he was making a bomb to blow up West Albany High School after being inspired by the Columbine High School shooting 14 years ago. On Saturday, investigators found six explosives hidden under floorboards at his mother's house. The weapons included pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, a Drano bomb, a napalm bomb and explosives made from drain cleaner. Now his friends have spoken out about how they should have been more suspicious when Acord started talking to them about the materials that one needs to build a bomb. 'He was just, just kind of randomly came up to us and started talking about the different materials that you need to make a bomb,' Thomas Stone told local ABC affiliate KATU. 'You know, I didn't think much of it 'cause he's kind of a strange kid, so I wasn't surprised he had some strange hobbies, you know?' Another friend said that the relaxed way in which the issue came up didn't tip them off to the fact that they should think of it as a sign of a darker plan of action. 'It wasn't like '""Oh, I'm making bombs, I'm gonna blow stuff up,""' classmate Keegan Boggs told KATU. 'It was just talking about it, like something that you wouldn't really think like ""Oh, he's gonna blow something up. Like a school.""' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Target: Police say Acord planned an attack on West Albany High School modeled after the deadly 1999 Columbine school shooting . He also had 'plans checklists, diagrams, inspirations, sources and a focus on recreating the model of Columbine, with adjustments that would make it more successful,' according to Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson. The 1999 massacre in Littleton, Colorado, . which was carried out by two Columbine High School seniors, Eric Harris . and Dylan Klebold, left 13 dead and 21 others wounded. 'This was a very methodical process,' Haroldson said. 'He took time to even get to this point.' Police have not yet pinpointed a motive for Acord's plot. Attorney Mr Haroldson said he wasn't aware that the teen was having trouble at school, or being bullied. He was described as quiet and a loner by other students, though one student said he seemed like 'a pretty nice guy.' Search: Bomb squads, pictured,fond six bombs at Acord's home . Secret compartment: The student at West Albany High School allegedly hid at least six bombs and bomb-making material in a secret compartment under the floor of his bedroom . 'In . any case that you have a young person that in essence plans to take a . video game approach to killing people at school, you have to take a . close look at the mental health issues,' he said. 'And the process will . certainly provide for that once he's represented by counsel.' The teen will be arraigned Tuesday as an . adult on one count of aggravated attempted murder and six counts each . of manufacturing a destructive device, possession of a destructive . device and possession of a weapon with intent to use it against another . person. According to KPTV - FOX 12, police accompanied by K-9 dogs found no . bombs during two searches of West Albany High, which is about 75 miles . south of Portland.

Officers who searched the premises for evidence also uncovered a detailed plan, checklists, a diagram of Acord's school and a timetable for when he allegedly planned to carry out a mass murder using bombs and gunfire, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported. 'This is beyond a kid playing with a . couple of cherry bombs. It was serious enough to warrant calling out the . bomb squad,' Albany police Capt. Eric Carter told KATU-TV in Portland. Grave charges: Grant Acord, 17, was arrested in Oregon on suspicion that he plotted to bomb his high school using six homemade explosives .

Charlotte Motor Speedway said 10 fans were injured Sunday at the Coca-Cola 600 and three of them were taken to the hospital after a nylon rope supporting a Fox Sports overhead television camera fell from the grandstands and landed on the track surface. CMS vice president of communications Scott Cooper said after the race that all three fans were treated and released from the hospital. He said he couldn't discuss the nature of their injuries due to privacy laws. Scroll down for video . Injured: Security personnel tend to a fan injured by a broken TV camera cable during the NASCAR Sprint Cup series Coca-Cola 600 in this photo provided by Fernando Echeverria . Clean-up: Track workers round up cable from an aerial Fox Sports camera on the front stretch during a red flag in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Coca-Cola 600 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway . Cooper said seven other people were treated with minor cuts and scrapes at the track and released. Fox Sports released a statement Sunday night saying it hasn't determined the cause of the accident and it is suspending use of the camera system indefinitely. 'Our immediate concern is with the injured fans,' Fox said in the statement. NASCAR said it would wait on Fox Sports' investigation of what caused the rope to snap before deciding if such technology will be used in future races. NASCAR spokesman Kerry Tharp told The Associated Press on Monday that there were no plans to use the system at upcoming races 'so we'll have ample time to review.' Fox said the camera system consists of three ropes - a drive rope that moves the camera back and forth, and two guide ropes on either side. Fox said it was the drive rope that failed near the first-turn connection and fell to the track. Hazard: Cars race by as the cable hangs over the infield from an aerial Fox Sports camera . 'The camera itself did not come down . because guide ropes acted as designed,' Fox said in the statement. 'A . full investigation is planned, and use of the camera is suspended . indefinitely.' Fox said it has used the camera system at the Daytona 500, at last week's NASCAR Sprint All-Star race and other major sporting events. 'We certainly regret that the system failure affected tonight's event, we apologize to the racers whose cars were damaged, and our immediate concern is for the race fans,' Fox said in the statement. 'We also offer a sincere thank you to the staff at CMS for attending to the injuries and keeping us informed on this developing situation.' The incident occurred on lap 121 of the 400-lap NASCAR Sprint Cup race. Camera mishap: The Fox Sports camera is seen during the Coca-Cola 600 shortly after a nylon cable fell into the stands and over a portion of the track . Trouble on the track: Track workers clean up cable from an aerial Fox Sports camera on the front stretch during a red flag in the race . The race was delayed for 27 minutes while crews repaired damage to their cars. Kyle Busch, going for a sweep at Charlotte Motor Speedway after winning the Nationwide and Truck series races, was leading when he incurred damage to the right front wheel well of his No. 18 Toyota. Marcos Ambrose and Mark Martin also reported damage. No drivers were injured. The cars were initially brought along pit row as workers cleared the ropes from the track. NASCAR first threw a caution flag before two red flags came out. It eventually allowed the cars to come into the pits, giving crews 15 minutes to work on their cars. Affected: The cars of Kyle Busch (18), Kasey Kahne (5) and Matt Kenseth (20) were believed to have been damaged by the fallen cable . During the break, Busch's crew frantically worked to repair a number of problems to the right front wheel well. After completing repairs to the car, the crew slapped high-fives after getting the car back on the track. Busch remained competitive and was running in the top five at the midpoint of the race. But his night ended in frustration when his engine blew up on lap 253. 'I commend NASCAR for taking the initiative and letting us repair our damaged cars from the issue we had,' Busch said. Busch said he never saw the nylon rope. Round-up: A worker cleans up a broken television camera cable that damaged several race cars during the NASCAR Sprint Cup series Coca-Cola 600 . 'I just heard a big thunk on the right-front side tire and thought the right-front tire blew out,' Busch said. 'That's how hard it felt... It did have an effect slowing my car down and I could feel it like, ""Whoa, that's weird."" I don't know that anybody has ever seen that. Maybe now we can get rid of that thing.' It was more bad luck for Busch, who has never won a Sprint Cup race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and suffered his share of bad luck. Kasey Kahne, who wound up finishing second behind Kevin Harvick, said he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him when he saw something strange on the track. 'I have never seen anything like it,' Kahne said. 'I came off turn four and I saw it wrapped around Kyle's car and it hit mine and I thought I had to be seeing things because there's no way there could be a cable on the race track. Teamwork: A crew gathers the cable from the track during a red flag in the race . By the time we got to turn one I saw it again and saw Kyle's fender and saw his car go down a little. That's when I knew I wasn't seeing things.' NASCAR said the camera system in question is from CamCat. The CamCat camera system is the product of an Austrian company that does work with many outfits around the world, including the Olympics, NBC and others. The company has been handling sporting events since 2000 and hasn't had any prior known incidents with its cameras. In May of 2000, more than 100 fans were injured outside of the CMS when an 80-foot section of the walkway fell an estimated 25 feet onto a highway below. Fans were crossing the bridge to a parking lot following the completion of the NASCAR All-Star race.","Three fans were treated at a nearby hospital, while seven others were treated at the track and released .

Bristol University graduate James Hill (left) is the 'President' of the group, while City lawyer Daniel England (right) has been given the title of Vice Captain . George Boulton-Lea (left with a female friend) is a self-styled 'party animal' while Rory Jones (right) 'can be compared to a true Viking warrior', according to the memo . The four drew up their checklist ahead of their trip to the Dubai Sevens rugby tournament next month. It included plans to have and . photograph group sex acts, to chant about their wealth and drink heavily . while being offensive to local residents. After spanning the globe, the email . has heaped embarrassment on the group and their employers, which they . proudly named in pen portraits of themselves. Last night the top law firm employing . the ‘vice captain’ of the group, solicitor Daniel England, 27, had begun . an inquiry into the offensive email. The rest of the group are ‘president’ James Hill, 27, an international insurance broker, ‘senior . vice-president’ George Boulton-Lea, 24, a ship broker, and ‘captain’ Rory Jones, 27, a marketing executive in Singapore. The saga began when the four, calling . themselves G4, shared their ‘tour rules’ by email. It began with an . endorsement of infidelity – ‘Cheating is allowed’ – and went on to say . ‘No anti-lad behaviour allowed ie calling girlfriends, being nice to . random expats’, before becoming even more offensive. The rules include, at point (v) ‘Compulsory gunning of parents’ affairs’ – meaning that whenever one of . the group mentions an affair involving another’s parents, he will have . to swallow an agreed portion of alcohol as a forfeit. Another says ‘Chants about your surrounding environment, being oily and how rich we are, are compulsory’. They vowed they would be ‘Mentioning . parents salaries once a day’ before saying that cameras would only be . allowed underwater, or to film group sex acts ‘for evidential purposes’. The ‘rules’ go on to declare that . during group sex acts, they must degrade the woman involved, and . ‘high-five’ each other throughout. Mr Hill, an old boy of Tonbridge . School in Kent, Mr Boulton-Lea, who attended Epsom College, and Mr Jones . and Mr England, who both went to the City of London Freemen’s School, . were yesterday unavailable for comment. James Hill President (pictured left) James is a Terrorism and Political Violence Insurance Broker at Willis.

James attended Tonbridge School where he played Rugby, Hockey, Cricket and Rackets to a very high standard. He is a remarkably good looking individual who is permanently tanned and has an extremely muscular body.

Rory attended the University of Nottingham where he achieved a Distinction in his Masters. Before this he attended City of London Freemen’s School where he captained the 1st XV Rugby team. Rory’s ability to be a team player and push himself and others beyond . their normal boundaries means his role as Captain will be central to a . successful Dubai tour.

'Monster:' Jordan Prince, 24, is facing first-degree murder, child abuse and forcible sodomy charges for allegedly assaulting a 4-month-old girl he was baby-sitting and then strangling her to death . A convicted sex offender suspected of murdering his girlfriend’s infant daughter in Missouri last year is now accused of sodomizing the little girl before allegedly killing her. Jordan Lafayette Prince, 24, of St Charles, was originally charged with second-degree murder and endangering the welfare of a child in connection to the December 2012 death of a 4-month-old girl. Prince’s murder count has since been upgraded to first degree, and this week he was also indicted on additional charges of forcible sodomy and abuse of a child. Court records cited by St Louis Post-Dispatch show that the cause of death was asphyxiation, but the child also suffered serious injuries related to sodomy, which caused internal bleeding. Prince told police he became frustrated with the baby because she wouldn't stop crying. He's been jailed on 150,000 cash bail. Online records show that Prince was convicted in September 2007 of lewd conduct with a minor under age 16. First responders were called to a home in the 3600 block of Fremont Drive in St Charles shortly after 11.30am on December 3 because the baby, Ashlynn Peters, was not breathing. The infant was rushed to a local hospital being airlifted to Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead the next day. An autopsy conducted at the hospital December 5 revealed that the baby died from asphyxiation. Prince told investigators that he had been looking after baby Ashlynn while his girlfriend, Jessica Howell, was sleeping.

Veterans in suburban Boston gathered in a park to mark Memorial Day this year rather than hold a parade because of failing health and dwindling numbers. The city of Beverly called off its parade this year because so few veterans would be able to march. The parade has been a fixture in the town since the Civil War. Aging population: With most WWII veterans now in their 90s, fewer are able to take part in parades and there seems to be little interest from veterans from younger generations in certain areas . Red, white & blue: A couple photograph themselves amongst a sea of flags on Boston Common in Boston. The flags were placed by the Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund in memory of every fallen Massachusetts service member from the Civil War to the present. Vietnam veteran Ron Innocenti tells WBZ-TV he hates canceling because of the message it sends to current service members. But he does understand the reason. Many veterans who were gathered at the Herman A. Spear American Legion Post this weekend are upset by the decision. 'It’s not right to me,' says Ron Innocenti. He is a Vietnam veteran who has not only marched in the city’s Memorial Day parade in the past, he says he has also been its grand marshal. He hates to cancel because of the message it sends to men and women serving now. In our own way: The town of Beverly in Massachusetts has cancelled its Memorial Day Parade for the first time since the civil war because of its aging veteran population . Remembering: Bob Lewis looks over a field of crosses with names while participating in the College Point Memorial Day Parade in New York. Lewis made the crosses, 137, for all the service members that were killed from the Civil War to the Vietnam War . 'It’s a slap in the face to them that we’re not doing it,' he says. 'But on the other hand, I can see why we’re not doing it because of the age of the veterans we have now.' That gets to the heart of the problem. In Beverly, there just are not enough veterans alive who are well enough to march in the parade anymore. As for younger veterans – like the men and women who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan – they are often too busy to take part. World War II Navy veteran Bill McPherson tells NECN he's upset about parade cancellation but 'there aren't that many of us left.' 'My wife and I have both been quoted as saying we are upset by the whole thing,' said McPherson. There are veterans that are OK with the fact there is no longer a parade. People like the town's Veteran's organizer Jerry Guilebbe . He says it can be difficult for older vets to take part. 'It's not about parades and down the . street and waving flags, it is about what we did all week long, spending . countless hundreds of hours putting flags on every veteran's grave, and . remembering who they were,' said Guilebbe. Calm: Some veterans are fine without there being a parade. Showing their support in other ways, such as placing flags on the graves of the fallen, can help . The show must go on: Other parades still take part in many towns and cities across the country. Here. a float passes by during the College Point Memorial Day Parade in New York . Tom Condon is the town's oldest veteran, at 93, he recalls those who were lost. 'That people remember, who left and never came back, which is a lot of them, that's who I remember,' said Condon. Tom's daughter Suzanne, believes that it is about more than older vets who can no longer march a mile. 'It's a little bit of a reflection to people who are in younger generations not really realizing how many people fought for us and how hard life was for them to make life great for us,' she said. 'It’s very disappointing to me; I think it’s a shame,' says Robert Driscoll, a local veteran who served in Korea. 'Hopefully maybe next year we can change that.' City officials think that if enough veterans come forward to participate next year, or if the city can come up with another way to have them be a part of the parade, then the city will bring it back.","Lack of veterans cited as reason for cancelling parade for first time since the Civil War .

Service: Cameras captured the expressions of consumers as they were greeted by a member of staff at three Mothercare stores . These were then cross-checked with the spending to see whether this American-style ‘have a nice day’ welcome had an effect. Those shoppers who responded to the service with a smile ended up spending an average of 67 per cent more than others. The results could help end the ‘service with a scowl’ that often characterises British shops. The appeal of just such a friendly approach was shown this week by a survey from Which? that found Apple stores came top in a league measuring shopper satisfaction. The research at Mothercare was carried out by Realeyes, which describes itself as an emotion measurement tech company. Profits: Shoppers who were greeted at the door spent 67 per cent more than others . It uses cameras to capture, measure and interpret facial expressions. A video demonstration on the firm’s website demonstrates how movements in the face are measured and interpreted to give a bar chart score under the headings happy, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust and fear. In a shop, the system can tell how people respond to posters, promotions, the layout of products and the behaviour of staff. The trial compared facial expressions for around 600 shoppers when they were greeted at the door over a one-week period. Realeyes managing director, Mihkel Jaatma, said: ‘We found that when a sales person greeted them at the door, the customers that smiled back made a 67 per cent bigger purchase on average than those who didn’t. ‘If greeters can engender that positive reaction more often, the impact on sales is clear.’He said the technology could be used to help particular staff improve how they interact with customers.","Shoppers who were welcomed at the door spent more .

TV presenter Phillip Schofield has become the latest celebrity to lose weight using the 5:2 diet. The This Morning co-host, 51, told audience members at a recent filming of Mrs & Mrs that he had already lost 9lbs on The Fast Diet. The new diet sees followers fasting for two days a week, reducing their calorie intake to 600 for a man or 500 for a woman. Slimming down: Phillip Schofield, pictured last Thursday with Holly Willoughby, is on the 5:2 diet . Speaking in between filming for the ITV game show, Phillip told the crowd: 'I am on the new 5:2 diet. I’ve been doing it for about three weeks and am really hungry.' He admitted he had already shed half a stone and he has since lost a further two pounds. Phillip is the latest in a string of stars who follow the diet, which was created by medical journalist Dr Michael Mosley and appeared on a BBC2 Horizon documentary Eat, Fast & Live Longer last year. Healthy sized: Philip looking slightly fuller last year . Popular: Dr Michael Mosley and Mimi Spencer's book The Fast Diet . Michael teamed up with journalist Mimi . Spencer to co-write The Fast Diet book, which has sold over 340,000 . copies and has been reprinted 13 times. It has been at the top of the Amazon UK book charts over the past few weeks and recently hit the top 10 in the health and fitness book bestsellers on the US site. Explaining the diet, Mimi recently wrote in You magazine: 'A food-free window twice a week helps the body repair itself. Get that body back on the scales after a few weeks and it should weigh a bit less.' Food writer Hugh-Fearnley-Whittingstall admitted in January he had lost 8lbs on the diet. He said at the time: 'I’ve lost eight pounds already, and I find the whole thing rather exhilarating. I feel I might just be part of a health revolution. 'But is it really sustainable, for me or for significant numbers of others? Can I honestly say I’m backing myself to be fasting regularly a year from now? I very much want the answer to be yes.' Australian model Miranda Kerr, Beyonce, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck and Christy Turlington are also rumoured to have tried the diet. The 5:2 diet tells followers to eat normally for five days a week – up to 2,000 calories a day for woman and 2,500 for men. However, for the remaining two, women limit their food intake to 500 calories a day and men 600. Supporters claim the regime is easier . to stick to than a traditional diet, and research has found links . between fasting and the body’s ability to repair itself. However, critics question whether extreme calorie restriction is healthy and warn that fasting can be addictive. MailOnline has contacted Phillip's representative for comment.","Diet involves eating normally for five days, then reducing calorie intake to 500 or 600 for two days.

But it appears that when it comes to equality of the sexes, Diana Rigg is much less strident in real life. Despite being an icon to women’s rights campaigners since the Sixties, the 74-year-old actress has denied being a feminist, saying she likes it when a man displays old-fashioned courtesy. Avengers star Diana Rigg has said that she was not the feminist that everyone assumed she would be . Dame Diana also criticised women for being ‘more bitchy than men’, saying they are ‘dangerous and deeply competitive’. The actress is best known for playing catsuit-clad spy Emma Peel in Sixties TV series The Avengers. Her character was hailed by feminists for her intelligence, independence and martial arts skills. But Dame Diana denied she was a feminist icon, telling the Radio Times: ‘I was thought to be, but never was really. ‘I kept my mouth shut for the most part. It’s a question of economics. If you’re paid the same as a man, which now you are in this profession, you’re equal. If a man holds a door open for me or pulls back a chair so that this old bag can sit down, I’m delighted. Diana said that she is not a feminist and likes it when a man displays old fashioned courtesy . ‘If they [men] put an arm round a woman and say, “You look good today”, they could find themselves in the small claims court. ‘Women who moan and carp about that sort of thing are stupid. They find it belittling, but it’s just good manners.’ However, she added: ‘You can’t pat bottoms, though. You deserve to be slapped for that. It’s condescending. I wouldn’t allow it.’ She said that women are capable of being much more bitchy than men. ‘Most women won’t agree, but it’s true. I love women but am aware we’re dangerous and deeply competitive, although I gave up being competitive long ago. Feminists deny it... but basically it’s all about men and sex.’ Diana Rigg has been an icon to feminists since she starred as Emma Peel in Sixties TV show, the Avengers . Dame Diana is not the first high-profile older woman to criticise women’s rights. A month ago, Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry, 78, was chastised by broadcaster Joan Bakewell for saying feminism was a ‘dirty word’ and that she is ‘thrilled to bits’ when men offer to look after her. Dame Diana has been married and divorced twice and has one daughter, actress Rachel Stirling, 35. Her roles after The Avengers included playing a Bond girl in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. She was recently in Game Of Thrones. Yesterday feminist author Ellie Levenson criticised Dame Diana’s comments, saying: ‘All these older women slagging off feminism have benefited enormously from feminism so it’s a shame they hate the word so much. They’ve had education, careers, financial independence and a sex life they are in control of... like it or lump it they’re part of the feminist movement.’","Diana Rigg said that she prefers when a man shows old fashioned courtesy .

A mother who left her newborn baby on a beach in Hawaii shortly after it was born is being hunted by police. The full-term, eight-pound newborn, was found crying in the sand at Sandy Beach in east Honolulu soon after she was born on Sunday. State Department of Human Services Director Patricia McManaman said police were investigating the case as endangering the welfare of a minor and child abandonment. A woman parked at Sandy Beach in east Honolulu sometime between 11p.m on Sunday and midnight heard several people screaming, police spokesman Michelle Yu said. A few minutes later the screaming stopped and the woman heard a baby crying. She walked toward the ocean and saw an infant on the sand. The woman took the baby, which was naked, to the nearby Queen's Medical Center. Ms McManaman said the baby was ""recovering well"" in hospital. She said. 'We're just very grateful this child is alive and doing well.' If no one comes forward to claim the child, the Department of Human Services will file a petition this week with family court, asking for custody. If no family is identified, the state will ask the court for permission to release a photo of the infant. In 2007, Hawaii became the 48th state with a baby safe haven law which provides mothers with  immunity from prosecution for leaving an unharmed newborn within 72 hours of birth at a fire department, police station or hospital or with emergency services. No one has taken advantage of the law since it was enacted, Ms McManaman said. The baby safe haven hotline is 800-494-3991.

The female zookeeper mauled to death by tigers entered their enclosure on one of their ‘starvation days’, it was revealed yesterday. As the mystery surrounding Sarah McClay’s death deepened, it also emerged that just days before she was killed she changed her Facebook profile picture to one of a painting of a face slashed by claws. Police have not ruled out the possibility that the 24-year-old committed suicide by walking into the tiger enclosure at the animal park. Police have not ruled out possibility zookeeper Sarah McClay, pictured on a night out, committed suicide . This picture from Disney's Beauty And The Beast was posted on her Facebook days before she died . Miss McClay suffered ‘very traumatic’ head and neck injuries in the attack and went into cardiac arrest. Although resuscitated by paramedics, she died in hospital. The zoo owner said the keeper failed . to follow the ‘strict protocol’ of radioing for permission to enter the . enclosure before opening the padlock and two slide bolts. He said it was ‘inexplicable’ that she . then went inside without ensuring the Sumatran tigers, Padang and . Alisha, were locked away.

Miss McClay died after being attacked by a tiger at South Lakes Wild Animal Park. One of the park's tigers is pictured . 'She didn’t radio for permission and . she didn’t let anyone know she was going in.

Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, heard a scream over the radio and ran to the . scene, where they found the two tigers on top of her. Park owner David Gill, 42, said . Padang, the male Sumatran, had instigated the attack. He added that at . the time Padang and Alisha were on what is known as a ‘starve day’, when . they are not fed – to mimic conditions in the wild where tigers may go . for some time without catching any prey. ‘The males are twice the size of the females and Padang had taken control,’ Mr Gill said. The Zoo was closed after Miss McClay was mauled in the enclosure, during one of the tiger's 'starvation' days . He fired two shots with a rifle to . scare away the animals, but Miss McClay, who lived with her boyfriend in . Barrow-in-Furness, had already suffered serious injuries.

A necklace worth at least 1.7 million pounds and due to be worn by Hollywood beauties like Cameron Diaz has been stolen at the Cannes Film Festival. The mystery theft is the second to blight the glamorous French Riviera showbusiness spectacular inside a week. It happened at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, where the cheapest rooms cost more than 800 pounds a night. Scroll down for video . Not laughing now: Sharon Stone, wearing a De Grisogono bracelet, shared a laugh with with the jewellery firm's president Fawaz Gruosi at the party where the necklace was stolen . Stars including Sharon Stone and Ornella Muti were enjoying a lavish party in the hotel, which is a few miles along the coast from Cannes in Cap d'Antibes, when the thieves struck on Tuesday night. The necklace, by Swiss jeweller De Grisogono and with a list price of 1.7 million pounds, vanished despite 80 security guards being in the building. Its link to the movie world will also add to its value on the black market. The jeweller house, which was celebrating its anniversary, regularly loans its pieces to celebrities including Miss Diaz and socialite Paris Hilton. 'It is actually the first time it has happened in our 20-year history,' reads a company statement, adding that the theft happened 'despite the large security measures set in place: over 80 security guards plus police'. Lost jewels: Fawaz Gruosi, pictures at the party with Sharon Stone and model Alessandra Ambrosio, said the £1.7m necklace was one of De Grisogono's 'most beautiful items' ‘We don't know exactly what happened, it . was one of the most beautiful items we had,’ founder Fawaz Gruosi said. ‘The police are trying to figure out what happened.’ Last Friday jewellery worth around £1m was taken from an uninsured room safe in the Cannes Novotel. An . American woman working for the Swiss jewellery house Chopard was said . to have been enjoying a champagne-fuelled night out on the town when a . thief struck. Chopard has . 40 staff at Cannes whose job it is to persuade stars like Julianne . Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne to wear their pieces. Nobody . has yet been arrested in connection with the crime. French . police also reported today that at least two flats being rented by film . executives at this year's festival have been burgled. Glitter gone: The bash was attended by Paris Hilton who wore a headpiece believed to be by De Grisogono . Cannes is notorious for jewellery thefts, with organised gangs frequently targeting boutiques and hotels, especially during parties, and when stars are on the red carpet. Many turn of the raids turn out to be inside jobs, with staff helping the thieves to locate and then steal items. Today detectives were inspecting the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc for clues.

Even in Spain, which has been forced to live with stringent austerity measures resulting from a German-led rescue package, 68 per cent felt good about the country - up on last year.

More people in Britain also shared the opinion, with favourable attitudes up eight points to 78 per cent, with France the keenest towards its neighbour at 81 per cent. But Greeks, included in the annual BBC World Service poll for the first time, gave it the worst rating with 52 per cent saying it was a bad influence. The country has seen anti-German protests depicting Chancellor Angela Merkel as an enemy for her insistence on fiscal belt-tightening. The UK registered the most improvement this year in the wake of the 2012 Olympics, helping it rise one spot to third position with 55 per cent positive ratings, behind Canada.

After improving for several years, views of China have sunk to their lowest level since polling began in 2005. India saw a similar decline, with negative views up eight points to 35 per cent and positive views down six to 34 per cent. Overall, China is ranked ninth and India twelfth.

In a letter in the Guardian today, 11 equal rights lawyers say there have been previous cases of staff suing employers in respect to exposure to pornographic material at work, and called on retailers to stop selling 'lads' mag' publications.

Record numbers of headteachers and other school leaders are earning six-figure salaries, official statistics reveal. About 800 state school heads, deputies and assistant heads were paid at least £100,000 last year, up from 700 in 2011. A quarter of them received more than £110,000. A hundred were employed by primary schools, with 700 secondary school leaders in the same pay bracket. It means more than a fifth of heads at senior schools earn £100,000 or more. Around 800 school leaders earned more than £100,000, new government figures reveal (file picture) Experts fear the proportion of school . funds they are taking up will soar further as the Government encourages . more academies to open. These schools – which are centrally funded but . independent of local authorities, allowing them to set their own pay . levels – were responsible for 400 of the top-paid heads. The other 300 . worked at state secondaries. There were just 345 academies in November 2010, but this number has risen to more than 2,800. Academy heads receive an average of £61,900 – £1,000 more than colleagues at local authority-run schools. The bumper pay packets mean top . school leaders typically earn double the average headteacher’s salary, . which was £55,700 last year. The figures, released by the Department for . Education, show the Government has failed to crack down on runaway pay . increases at a time of austerity. Education Secretary Michael Gove said in 2010 that heads should not earn more than the Prime Minister. Days later it emerged an inner-city . primary school headteacher was earning £231,400 plus a £45,123 pension . contribution, a package worth almost double David Cameron’s £142,500 . salary. He was among 100 headteachers revealed to be earning more than . £150,000. Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured in Downing Street today, argued in 2010 that heads should not earn more than the Prime Minister . Professor John Howson, an expert on . public sector pay, said yesterday: ‘When the coalition came into power . they made it clear they didn’t want people in the public sector to earn . more than the PM except in exceptional circumstances. ‘The problem is, Michael Gove has given away the right to control that by allowing academies to pay what they want.’ He added the consequences would . continue for decades because heads typically received a taxpayer-funded . pension worth half their final salary. The situation also prompted fury . among unions representing rank-and-file teachers – particularly as . ordinary full-time teachers’ pay has slipped from an average £37,900 in . November 2011 to £37,600 at the end of last year. The two largest teachers’ unions – . the NUT and NASUWT, which represent 90 per cent of the work force – have . already announced strikes later this year over pay, pensions and . conditions. NUT general secretary Christine Blower warned the squeeze on pay would affect recruitment. Teacher numbers are up 4,000 on last year but 6,000 below a peak of 448,100 in 2010. ‘It is quite obvious that, despite . what the Secretary of State says about his plans for the deregulation of . pay, it is clearly not about paying a few teachers more but about . paying the majority of teachers less,’ she said. ‘We urge Michael Gove to reconsider his plans to deregulate pay and to think about a proper increase in teacher salaries.’ Secondary school pupils are being taught by thousands of teachers who do not hold a degree in their subject, according to Department for Education figures. About a quarter of maths teachers – 7,500 – do not have a qualification higher than an A-level. The situation is the same with a fifth of English teachers and a third of physics teachers. The figures are even higher in some subjects, with half of those teaching Spanish and information technology and 40 per cent of religious education teachers not qualified to degree level. A department spokesman said 96 per cent of teachers held qualifications at degree-level or above. A department spokesman said: ‘It’s essential we have the best people in place to lead our schools if we are to raise standards. ‘That’s why decisions on pay are down to schools.’ Russell Hobby, general secretary of . the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘Being a headteacher is . a hugely demanding and influential role, equal in challenge to most . private sector executive positions. ‘Some posts demand exceptional . salaries and in return deliver huge social benefits. Despite these . headlines, however, the average head-teacher’s salary is £55,700. ‘On this figure, they have to be a . teacher, possess business acumen, an HR expert, a mentor, an . administrator, a social worker and an inspirational leader, to name just . some of their responsibilities.’","Number of school leaders on six-figure salaries rises by 100 in a year .

Judge: Bestselling novelist Sebastian Faulks, who is a judge in this year's Chalke Valley History Prize, wants more pupils to study history . Novelist Sebastian Faulks berated the downgrading of history in schools yesterday as he urged youngsters to take up their pens  and 'discover the excitement of the living past’ through writing. The bestselling author, a judge in this year’s Chalke Valley History Prize, said: 'History needs to regain its central place in schools. 'It’s every bit as important as science, maths and English. Children should never have been allowed to drop it before GCSE.' The prize, run in partnership with the Daily Mail and Penguin Books, challenges youngsters to write vivid stories bringing the past to life. Faulks, whose best-known work Birdsong features a highly acclaimed retelling of the Battle of the Somme, hailed the competition as an important example of how to help repair the damage done to traditional lessons. He said: 'I'm very happy to be judging this prize. It encourages wide reading and research and will reward students who can coherently express their excitement in – and grasp of – what they have discovered. 'Until history regains a central place at school, we rely on initiatives like this to encourage children to think beyond the limited options offered in most classrooms. 'This prize has an excellent balance of fact and imagination, of hard work and good fun. I hope that hundreds of young people will take advantage of the challenge it offers and discover the excitement of the living past.’ The number of pupils studying history in state comprehensives in England fell by nearly a fifth after they were given the option to  drop the subject when they start their GCSEs. Bring the past to life: The Chalke Valley History Prize is run by the Daily Mail and Penguin Books . A group of MPs and peers last year urged that history lessons should be overhauled and a British history qualification brought in for 16-year-olds. The report, from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Archives and History, also said the average 13-year-old learns history for just one hour a week. The Coalition is attempting to reverse the trend by putting a stronger emphasis on creative  subjects including history. As well as Faulks, the Chalke Valley prize’s judging panel this year includes Joanna Lumley, author and Fast Show comedian Charlie Higson and historian and broadcaster James Holland. Importance: The author said history must regain its 'central place' in schools and is as important as science .

Pupils who pass are issued with a permit they are told can be withdrawn if they are spotted causing a nuisance on the pavements. The scheme was introduced at Thomas a Becket Middle School in Worthing, West Sussex, where headmaster John Gadd said police community support officers would explain the rules. In training: Pupils at a West Sussex school will have to pass a safety test if they want to use their scooter to get to school (file photo) A letter from headteacher John Gadd appeared to say PCSOs who attended the course would take licences away from trouble-makes. The plan infuriated parents who declared the plan was ‘ridiculous’ and ‘unworkable’ - but, after some confusion, Sussex Police yesterday insisted officers would ‘only offer safety advice’. Mr Gadd first wrote to parents in November saying concerns had been raised with the school. ‘We have had a number of calls from local residents, some complaining about pupils from our school scooting in and around cars in cul-de-sacs near to the school and others concerned over the safety of our pupils,’ he said. ‘These latter calls have commented both on some pupils [sic] lack of road sense and the busy-ness of the roads in the local area.’ Although he ordered parents to stop their children taking scooters to school, he revealed he had been in contact with West Sussex Road Safety Team about setting up a safe-riding programme. Elf and safety: Parents at Thomas A Becket Middle School, in Worthing, West Sussex branded the plan to introduce scooter permits ¿ridiculous¿ and ¿unworkable¿ . In a follow-up letter last month, he said the first session had gone ahead with ‘a large number of children from each year group’. A teacher and two PCSOs had been in charge and permits were being issued to pupils who passed. He added: ‘We have made it clear to the children that if they are seen to be scooting unsafely on the way to or from school their permit will be withdraw immediately (the PCSOs have agreed to support us in this too, as well as recognising those who continue to scoot responsibly and safely).’ One mother said yesterday: ‘You hear all this stuff about the nanny state but I never expected this. ‘We’re talking about children on scooters - not teenagers on motorbikes. They’ll be terrified if they’re pulled over [by an officer] for being too enthusiastic on their scooters.’ Another parent said: ‘This is totally unworkable. If I’m happy for my son to use a scooter to school then no one can stop me.’ But one father commented: ‘I think it is a great idea that kids are being taught road sense. There are courses for kids on bicycles and this is the same sort of thing.’ Sussex Police were unaware of the agreement between the school and PCSOs when contacted and were unable to contact the officers. The force later issued a statement which said: ‘Sussex Police welcome and support the idea of scooter permits as a way to keep children safe when travelling to and from school. ‘However, the introduction of scooter permits is a school initiative and officers are there to offer safety advice and not enforcement.’ The school has around 750 boys and girls aged eight to 12 and was rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2011. It failed to respond yesterday to a request for information about how many complaints had been received, whether any children - or pedestrians - had been injured and if the PCSOs had offered to enforce the rules.

It began with the Queen planting a single tree on her Sandringham estate. One year and 5,999,999 trees later, a project to create swathes of woodland to mark the  Diamond Jubilee reached its final milestone yesterday. The Princess Royal planted the six millionth tree at an inner city school in a ceremony attended by David Cameron. The scheme, run by the Woodland Trust, has seen more than 12,000 acres of woodland created across Britain. Before planting the cherry tree at Ashburnham Community Primary School in south-west London, Princess Anne, the project’s patron, said: ‘I have to own up that I didn’t believe that was possible when we started and I am hugely impressed by that success.’ An estimated three million people were involved in the project, which created more than 400 woods of at least an acre and provided 40,000 schools and 3,500 communities with free trees. The project has been backed by the Daily Mail and supported by our readers, who have planted many of the trees themselves. The crowning glory is the flagship ‘Diamond Woodland’ in the National Forest in Leicestershire. Some 300 acres were set aside there to commemorate the Jubilee by the Mail as a gift to our readers. Yesterday, Princess Anne said she hoped it was ‘very much the beginning’ of a new relationship with nature and the environment for everyone who has been involved. She said: ‘These milestones don’t happen very often and we celebrate the event, but we also celebrate very much the person who has instilled that continuity in that period. ‘These woodlands will do that for us in the future . . . so a big thank-you on behalf of Her Majesty for a wonderful way of celebrating her Diamond Jubilee.’ High five: Prime Minister David Cameron, meets children during a visit to Ashburnham Community school in West London .

And those feelings stay with them when they are adults.’ Clive Aslet, one of the trust’s leading supporters, added: ‘The campaign has proved to be  an outstanding success – thanks, not least, to the tremendous contribution of the Daily Mail and its readers.’ Greetings: The Princess Royal and the Prime minister meet a line of school children at the tree planting ceremony yesterday .

With only three months left to go, many mothers-to-be would have started to resign themselves to maternity wear, elasticated waistbands and comfortable flats. Not the Duchess of Cambridge. And while it’s hardly surprising that she remains as elegant as ever, she also appears to be almost as slim as ever, with the merest hint of a baby bump. Despite being six-months pregnant, the sporty royal looked slim as she played basketball and table tennis. And although there may have been little physical sign of her pregnancy as she visited a homeless shelter in Glasgow yesterday with Prince William, a beaming Kate was unusually happy to reveal details about her condition. Dressed in a chic tartan coat and her trademark black suede boots, Kate said she plans to go on maternity leave from her royal duties from ‘around June time’. The duchess, who is six months’ pregnant, also revealed that her due date is ‘around mid-July’ – a slightly more precise hint than the official announcement. St James’s Palace has previously only confirmed the royal couple’s baby will be born ‘in July’, with officials refusing to give the exact due date. Kate, 31, also said that she and William had drawn up a list of boys’ and girls’ names for their first child – and that she has taken up knitting. ‘I’ve been trying to knit and I’m really bad. I should be asking for tips,’ she said. When Rachel Sawyer, a project manager at the shelter, asked when her due date was and if she had any names, Kate replied: ‘It’s around mid-July but apparently babies have their own agenda … . ‘We have a shortlist for both [boy and girl] but it’s very difficult. My friends keep texting me names.’ And when asked if she had got her nursery ready, she smiled and said: ‘No... we have got a lot to do!’ During the visit, Kate also got an unusual insight into being a mother – from an eight-month-old baby with a taste for flowers. The duchess chatted to Heidi Addison and her mother Shirley, who had a bouquet of flowers to give to Kate, while they were in a crowd outside a sports centre. Mrs Addison, who represented Team GB at the hammer throwing in the 2004 Athens Olympics, said: ‘Kate came over after spotting Heidi and she asked her name and how old she is. ‘We said we had flowers for a special someone. I told her it was the most amazing experience ahead of her. ‘But she needed to be careful because Heidi was more interested in trying to eat the flowers.’ At the shelter, the Quarriers Project, William looked awkward when he was asked to do some DJ-ing.  He joked it was harder than flying a helicopter – and after his attempt at ‘scratching’, Kate said to him: ‘Step away from the music’.

Some 48 years, two months, 16 days and – if you look very closely at the clocks – just a few minutes separate these images of the two solemn events. But, apart from a few radical additions to the City of London’s skyline, it is almost as if time has stood still. You cannot help but be struck by the remarkable similarities between the two scenes. Scroll down for video . A tale of two leaders: Crowds line Fleet Street as Sir Winston Churchill's coffin is led to St Paul's Cathedral on January 30, 1965. Yesterday, soldiers and public lined the same historic street to pay their respects to Baroness Thatcher as she was laid to rest . One shows the funeral cortege of Sir Winston Churchill on January 30, 1965. The other shows Baroness Thatcher’s funeral cortege yesterday. Both events were photographed from the same position, looking down as the processions passed along Fleet Street on the way to St Paul’s. On both occasions, crowds lined the streets in their masses to pay their last respects as the Union Jack-draped coffins passed by on gun carriages and the military featured heavily with similar pomp. Sir Winston’s was a full state funeral, whereas Baroness Thatcher’s yesterday was a ceremonial occasion. But in practice there are few real differences between the two, except that a state funeral has to be approved by a vote in Parliament and with a state funeral the deceased would normally be expected to lie in state for three days in Westminster Hall to allow members of the public to pay their respects. A total of 321,360 people filed past the catafalque while Sir Winston was lying in state. Sombre: The Queen at Churchill's funeral, left, and striking a similar pose yesterday, right . It was in a piece about the lying-in-state of Sir Winston that the Daily Mail’s Vincent Mulchrone famously wrote: ‘Two rivers run silently through London tonight, and one is made of people. Dark and quiet as the night-time Thames itself, it flows through Westminster Hall, eddying about the foot of the rock called Churchill.’ Silent crowds watched as Churchill’s coffin left Westminster Hall as Big Ben struck 9.45am and started its journey through London, the skyline then dominated by the dome of St Paul’s and free from skyscrapers. It was only 38 years later, in 2003, that the 591ft Gherkin was completed on the former site of the Baltic Exchange. Towering between it and St Paul’s now is also the Leadenhall Building, which will be 737ft when completed. Another notable change in the scene today is the removal of the railway bridge over Ludgate Hill. Standing tall: Winston Churchill's gun carriage goes past the Houses of Parliament in 1965, left, and, right, Baroness Thatcher's hearse takes the same route yesterday . By decree of the Queen, Sir Winston Churchill's body lay in State in Westminster Hall for three days and a state funeral service was held at St Paul's Cathedral in 1965 . The echoes of Winston Churchill's funeral were felt throughout the day as Baroness Thatcher was laid to rest . At Sir Winston’s funeral the mourners were led by his wife, Lady Clementine Churchill, his son Randolph and daughters Mary Soames and Lady Sarah Audley. The Queen and the Duke Edinburgh attended, as did the Queen Mother and the then teenage Prince Charles. Together with the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and representatives of 112 countries they packed into the cathedral for the service. The Queen struck an almost identical pose to the one she adopted yesterday, with her handbag hooked over her left arm and her hands clutched in front of her, as she contemplated the loss of Sir Winston, the first of the 12 Prime Ministers to have served during her reign. Whereas Baroness Thatcher was cremated after her funeral service, Sir Winston was laid to rest in the Oxfordshire parish churchyard of Bladon, close to Blenheim Palace where he was born 90 years before, with only family members present.

The car was taken after the driver was pulled over by police for speeding on Sheen Road in Richmond-on-Thames in Surrey.

The Gallardo was the first Lamborghini developed under Audi ownership. In October last year an American teenager died after the Lamborghini Gallardo she was driving crashed and caught fire in Abu Dhabi. Despite firefighters arriving on the scene in Defence Road within four minutes and extinguishing the fire, she could not be freed in time. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced in September last year that all Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe and Spyder models built in 2004 - 06 would be recalled over a potential fire risk.","The supercar was seized after the driver was pulled over for speeding .

It was a bitter custody fight  that took nine agonising months and cost £1,000. At the heart of it? A black and white moggy called Brandy. The tug-of-love saga began seven years ago after the cat disappeared from Senka Besirevic’s home. The teaching assistant, who had received the week-old kitten as a present two years earlier, searched high and low for her pet and put up missing posters, but to no avail. Meanwhile, unbeknown to her heartbroken owner, Brandy had set up home in a greenhouse in the garden of a property a mile away. When Karen and Carl Green moved into the house in 2007, they discovered the sleeping cat and assumed she was a stray. So the couple fed and cared for her, fitted a cat-flap on the greenhouse and named her ‘Smelly’ in an affectionate reference to the sorry state they found her in. Fast forward to March last year, however, and a trip to the vet revealed that the cat had a microchip identifying Miss Besirevic as her owner. She was overjoyed to hear that her pet was safe and well. But things changed after she called the Greens to thank them for caring for the cat – and they refused to give her back. Miss Besirevic said: ‘I got a call from my local vet who said a cat had been brought in and scanned and it was my cat. ‘I was amazed, I had given up hope of finding her but I thought it was a miracle she had turned up safe and well. 'I was given the telephone number of the woman who had cared for her so I phoned her up and said I wanted my cat back and offered to pay her for her trouble. ‘She said she was sorry but her husband didn’t agree, they were going to look into their legal rights.’ Miss Besirevic made inquiries and was advised that a cat remains the property of its original owner unless it is intentionally abandoned. Back home: Senka can finally cuddle her cat Brandy at their home in Selly Oak, Birmingham, seven years after the cat ran away . Cat fight: Karen Green, pictured in the greenhouse where Brandy lived for three years, refused to give the cat back to Ms Besirevic after discovering she was the owner, but lost custody in court . Like catnip: Brandy the cat is seemingly unaware that she had two women fighting for her love for nine months . ‘Luckily, I found a solicitor who had . been through the same thing and took on my case,’ she said. ‘It was a . huge battle, I felt like I had lost her for a second time.’ She launched a civil action at . Birmingham County Court and the case was finally settled in January – . when, curiously, Mr and Mrs Green, both 52, claimed Brandy had gone . missing again. A week later, the cat was handed in . anonymously to an RSPCA rescue centre before being reunited with Miss . Besirevic, 42, at last. She said: ‘I'm just happy to have her back, it's incredible. She's still the same cat, she's very cute although she doesn't go out as much now. It's cost me money to get her back but it was worth every penny. Missing: The poster that went up when Brandy was lost seven years ago . ‘I have effectively been given custody of Brandy and I am determined not to lose her again. I love her. ‘It is just a shame I had to go to court to get her back.' The . couple who took Brandy in defended their decision to fight . her owner in the courts for custody over the cat, saying they did it . ‘out of love’. Karen and Carl Green, both 52, took the cat in after moving into their home in Bartley Green, Birmingham, in 2007. The couple, who have three short-haired cats of their own, fed Brandy who they believed was a stray. Medical secretary Karen, who has two grown-up children, said: ‘We moved into our house and we were made aware that a cat was living in our greenhouse. ‘The neighbours said it was feral and it was in a bad way so I fed her and looked after her and eventually bonded with her. I considered her my pet in many ways. ‘We paid for her flea powder and food and just accepted her as one of our own.' ‘When I took her to the vet last year when she had a sticky eye I was horrified when they scanned her and said she belonged to a woman living nearby. ‘I didn't want to give her up to be honest. ‘We'd given her a good home, good food and plenty of space to run around. I didn't feel it was fair on her to be moved again even if Senka was her rightful owner. ‘We took legal advice because we felt that strongly but in the end our solicitor told us we didn't have a leg to stand on. ‘One day the cat went and was handed into the RSPCA. ‘Senka has the cat back but I really wish the cat was back her. The greenhouse seems empty without her. ‘The fact it went all the way to the courts is ridiculous but I suppose Senka and I both loved her and wanted the best for her.’","Senka Besirevic from Birmingham lost her cat Brandy seven years ago .

But it is no longer a problem for these three dachshunds after their owners bought them a £1,500 stairlift. Sheila and Harry Lee installed the lift after one of the dogs, six-year-old Pippa, had to undergo a £5,000 operation on her spine. Off to bed: Pippa, bottom, Heidi, top left, and Millie, top right, glide gracefully to bed in their £1,500 stairlift . They had been concerned about Pippa and their other dachshunds – Millie, seven, and Heidi six – straining their low-slung bodies as they negotiated the stairs to their beds. ‘We saw an advertisement for the stairlift and thought “Why not?”,’ Mrs Lee, 57, of Ossett, West Yorkshire, said yesterday. Sheila Lee says she taught her pets to sit on the stairlift by giving them treats each time they did it properly . Hold on tight! The Lees' dachshunds are now a dab paw at sitting still on the lift as it carries them up and down . ‘When the company we bought it from . rang up a few weeks ago to see how we were getting on with it, they were . flabbergasted when I told them it was for the dogs.

"By . David Wilkes and Rosie Taylor . PUBLISHED: . 17:56 EST, 5 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:56 EST, 5 April 2013 . It was one of the most audacious bombing raids of the Second World War. And for 20-year-old RAF navigator Vivian Nicholson, the Dambusters raid also happened to be his first mission. So when the bouncing bomb dropped from his Lancaster burst the Mohne Dam after those from four other 617 Squadron aircraft had failed to do so, he was understandably jubilant. Comrades in arms: Vivian Nicholson, right, and an RAF pa during training in Alabama, USA, December 1941 . Deadly: A Lancaster drops a bouncing bomb in 1943 . Understated: The jubilant remarks in Flight Sergeant Sergeant Nicholson's blog . ‘Bomb dropped. Wizard,’ he jotted in his logbook in a pearl of understatement which could have come straight from the pages of a Biggles adventure. Flight Sergeant Nicholson meticulously made the unconventional note in the ‘general observations’ column of the book as his shuddering Lancaster bomber dodged Nazi anti-aircraft guns in the early . hours of May 17, 1943. The logs were generally used to record flight data, but in his excitement he could not resist the aside. ‘Chocks away’, he wrote when he took off from RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, in his aircraft Johnny, one of the 19 Lancasters bound for the moonlit drama and armed with the bombs developed for the raid by Barnes Wallis. The pages of the log have been made public for the first time as the 70th anniversary of the raid nears. It is one of five Dambusters logbooks offered for sale. Flight Sergeant Nicholson, from Sherburn village, Country Durham, worked as a joiner’s apprentice before volunteering for the RAF in February 1941. Success: The aftermath of the raid on Mohne Dam . A close up of a bouncing bomb in position beneath a specially-converted Lancaster Bomber 617 squadron . His Lancaster was flown on the Dambusters raid by Flight Lieutenant David Maltby, and the mission was led by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, both of whom were immortalised in the classic 1954 movie. Flight Sergeant Nicholson’s log shows his Lancaster took off for what was officially called Operation Chastise at 9.20pm on May 16 and details enemy flak concentrations, noting they had to take ‘evasive action’ four times. At one point, he remarked his aircraft’s navigation system ‘jammed something chronic’. Among the first wave of the attack, as they approached the Mohne Dam he recorded the sighting of the target, arming of the bouncing bomb and then dropping it at 00.49 on May 17. His logbook shows the crew flew 954 miles over 289 and a quarter minutes. The plane returned safely to base at 03.11. His was one of only 11 of the 19 Lancasters which had set off to make it home. Of the 133 total aircrew, 53 were dead and three had become prisoners. The newly unearthed logbooks, each charting the journeys of separate aircraft on the night, were estimated in the catalogue to reach between £1,500 and £2,500 in total for all five. But the auctioneers anticipated they could reach £10,000. Raids: The Dambusters breached the Mohne and Ederse Dams causing catastrophic flooding in the Ruhr valley . Their sale at JS Auctions in Banbury, Oxfordshire, has been postponed while the RAF investigates how they got into the public domain and whether they can be legitimately sold. Auctioneer Tony  Cribb said he believed that the owner’s father had bought them from someone raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund 35 years ago. ‘The sale has been postponed until the RAF work out what went wrong in the past,’ he said. ‘As far as we and the vendor are concerned, it is all legal and above-board. But the RAF believes someone made a mistake in the past in giving the logbooks out. ‘They are just working out how best to deal with that.’ One book details the flight of aircraft P-Peter, which also targeted the Mohne Dam in the first wave of the raid but its bomb missed the target. Another details the route of H-Harry which targeted the Sorpe Dam, but had to return to base after losing its bomb to a large wave as it flew low over water. As for Flight Sergeant Nicholson, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal for his valour. But three months after receiving his medal, and almost four months to the day since his Dambusters mission, he was killed in action attacking the Dortmund-Ems canal near Ladbergen in Germany. The Dambusters breached the Mohne and Edersee Dams, causing catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley, Germany’s industrial heartland, and of villages in the Eder valley, while the Sorpe Dam sustained only minor damage.","RAF Navigator Vivian Nicholson, 20, was on his first mission .

"Actress checked into centre on Monday for 30-day programme . Treatment described as 'maintenance' for bipolar II disorder . Catherine spent five days in a treatment centre in Connecticut in 2011 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:12 EST, 30 April 2013 . Michael Douglas fully supports Catherine Zeta-Jones' decision to seek treatment for her bipolar II disorder again. The 68-year-old Behind the Candelabra star is fully devoted to his Welsh actress wife of twelve years, who is expected to complete a 30-day programme as a 'proactive' measure to help with her condition, which can cause high and low mood swings as well as depression. A friend close to the couple told People.com: 'He couldn't be more supportive, just like she is of him. They're solid. They're really, really devoted to each other.' Catherine's spokesperson Cece Yorke earlier confirmed to People: 'Catherine has proactively checked into a health care facility. 'Previously Catherine has said that she is committed to periodic care in order to manage her health in an optimum manner.' Happy and healthy: Catherine Zeta Jones was last seen at the 40th Chaplin Awards Gala Honoring Barbara Streisand in New York on April 22 with her husband Michael Douglas - she checked into a treatment centre for bipolar on Monday . A source tells the publication that . Zeta-Jones was planning to return to treatment as a way for doctors to . monitor her medication. 'There . was no big problem,' insisted the insider. 'This was just a good time . to do it. She is in between projects. This has always been part of the . plan. She would manage her health. She is vigilant about it.' Another source also told TMZ she has not had a relapse, adding: 'It's maintenance.' Jones first sought help in 2011, at . the time her spokesperson said that Catherine had 'made the decision to . check in to a mental health facility for a brief stay to treat her . Bipolar II disorder.' Catherine looked fine on April 22nd . when she attended the 40th Anniversary Chaplin Award Gala at Lincoln . Center with her husband Michael Douglas, who attended the White House . Correspondents' Dinner in Washington without her - an unusual . occurrence. In 2011 she stayed for five days, . joining 10 to 15 others in the £770-a-day detox centre at the hospital . in New Canaan, Connecticut. Going strong: Catherine looked radiant at the premiere of her last film, Side Effects, in January . Her publicist confirmed that she had received mental health treatment to help her cope with her traumatic personal life. ‘After dealing with the stress of the past year, Catherine made the . decision to check into a mental health facility for a brief stay to . treat her bipolar II disorder,’ she said. ‘She’s feeling great and looking forward to starting work this week on two upcoming films.’ New York Mental Health Consultant Stefanie Weiss, who has not treated the actress, believes that the decision to return to a treatment centre would have been especially difficult, given her high-profile identity. 'Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness that is not easy for anyone to live with, especially when the Hollywood spotlight is constantly on you,' she told MailOnline. 'Catherine Zeta Jones going back into treatment for a disorder that she struggles with is an extremely difficult and private decision. It is unfortunate that she needs the added stress of reporting to the media and her many fans that she needs to take this time to improve her mental health. 'Hopefully, her courageous decision to seek help will inspire more people to do the same.' Facility: The actress spent five days at the Silver Hill Hospital near New Canaan, Connecticut . Douglas, with whom she has two young children, battled stage four throat cancer in 2010, enduring both chemotherapy and . radiation. Catherine showed signs that she was struggling to cope with her emotions when she broke down in public that September at the Ryder Cup Welcome To Wales concert at Cardiff Millennium Stadium. Catherine had been booked months before her husband fell ill to speak at the event and had to go to the event solo as he was treated back in New York. A traumatic event can sometimes cause symptoms of the mood-altering illness. Experts . say patients experience both elevated moods - which may lead to bouts . of increased activity - as well as episodes of depression. Unlike bipolar I, the 'up' moods do not  reach full-on levels of mania. Rather . than descending into deep depressions, patients can be very outgoing, . functional and often more productive than normal, one reason why it . often goes undiagnosed. People . in a hypomanic state also often have a decreased need for sleep. They . are also said to be at a higher risk of committing suicide. Celebrities who have reportedly battled various forms of bipolar . disorder have included Britney Spears, Stephen Fry and Charlie Sheen. It is treatable with medication. Dr Michael Roizen, America’s first Chief Wellness Officer, claims genetics can also be a factor. ‘If one or more of your parents has the mood disorder, you are more likely to develop bipolar disorder. ‘Other . contributing factors include stress, illness, death, or a job loss. Also, researchers believe that bipolar disorder may be caused in part by . an imbalance in any or all of the brain chemicals norepinephrine, . serotonin, and dopamine.’ ‘Sometimes . a traumatic event that causes a lot of stress can cause bipolar II . disorder to develop. Other possible causes include an abnormal amount of . hormones and drug use,’ added a spokeswoman for the US Honour Society . of Nursing. But the strain was too much for her and she broke down when talking about him in her native Wales in front of the 13,000 strong audience. The 68-year-old . announced in January 2011 that doctors had declared him free of cancer . following six months of gruelling treatment. The actor accompanied his ‘emotionally distraught’ wife as she . checked into the hospital under the name Terrie Kirny, the National . Enquirer magazine claimed. A witness at the hospital told the magazine that the Welsh-born . actress, who was made a CBE in February, appeared ‘happy’ during her . stay. She apparently joined fellow guests for meals, jogs around the grounds and even poker sessions before bed. Miss Zeta-Jones often appeared to be on edge in public during Douglas’s treatment for throat cancer. She was close to tears at New York’s John F Kennedy airport after . she reportedly cut short a visit to the UK when her husband’s . conditioned worsened. In February, she flew into a rage at a photographer in London, . claiming he hit her as she and Douglas returned to their hotel after . dinner. The Enquirer also quoted an observer who said she had ‘really put the . red wine away’ during two recent visits with Douglas to a Manhattan . restaurant. Miss Zeta-Jones claimed in 2004 that a stalker’s threats against her . left her so shaken that she feared she would have a nervous breakdown. The Enquirer quotes a family source as saying: ‘It’s been the most . difficult year of her life. She’s been through hell! The pressure has . been almost unbearable.’ Claiming that the actress had suffered ‘more sleepless nights than . you could possibly know’ worrying about her husband, the source added: . ‘Catherine had a lot of trouble coping. She was chain-smoking and . drinking. ‘It was tearing Catherine apart to see such a vital man as Michael in such a weakened state. I think she was crumbling.’ Zeta-Jones said as much in an interview last September in which . she spoke of the pain of watching her husband dealing with cancer and . her ‘fury’ that doctors did not spot it earlier.

They were supposed to be back in time for lunch, but six crew members of a gunship over Vietnam nearly 50 years ago were tragically killed in a crash - and their families are still looking for answers this Memorial Day. Col Joseph Christiano of Rochester, . N.Y.; Col Derrell B. Jeffords of Florence, South Carolina; Lt Col Dennis . L. Eilers of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Chief Master Sgt. William K. Colwell . of Glen Cove, New York; Chief Master Sgt Arden K. Hassenger of Lebanon, . Oregon; and Chief Master Sgt Larry C. Thornton of Idaho Falls, Idaho, were killed when their plane went down on Christmas Eve 1965. It would be decades before what was left of the crew aboard the plane known as Spooky 21 would be returned home. Widow: Sherrie Hassenger poses with a picture of her husband, Arden Hassenger, in her home in Lebanon, Oregon. She says she has never really gotten over the loss of her love . All that remains: Sherrie Hassenger displays her deceased husband's military identification tag, the only relic returned to her after his remains were discovered last year . Frozen memories: A Hassenger family photo and a photo of Arden Hassenger in his air-crew flight suit is seen in the home of Sherrie Hassenger in Lebanon, Oregon . Their charred remains . were found last year and identified through dental records, personal . items and other circumstantial evidence. All six were buried in a single casket . with full military honors, as is common in situations where remains . can't be conclusively linked to a specific individual. Love: A picture of Arden Hassenger in his Air Force service uniform contains the inscription: 'To my dearest darling Sherrie with all my love, Arden' The Air Force gave all six posthumous promotions, a military spokeswoman said. Their job was a search-and-destroy mission on the Ho Chi Minh trail. Their target was a way station believed to be housing ammunition depots and anti-aircraft batteries, according to McClatchy. But at one point, something went wrong. They were last heard from somewhere over the Vietnamese jungle when a distress call rang out: 'Mayday, Spooky 21. Mayday.' They were never seen again. It's unclear whether the plane had suffered a mechanical malfunction or was shot down by enemy forces. For nearly half a century, the airmen's families endured an emotional kaleidoscope that they say is difficult to describe to those who never had to face it. The men were listed for years as missing, and family members held out hope at first that their loved ones had survived. For most that hope faded over time, despite an occasional unconfirmed report that crew members were seen alive. The crash site has been excavated several times over the past decade, but it was not until 2010 and 2011 that human remains were recovered. Even though Sherrie Hassenger's husband perhaps had the most conclusive identification of all six crew members - a tooth of Hassenger's was recovered and matched through dental records - she and her son Keith Hassenger said they still have nagging doubts about what happened. Both said they appreciated Monday's service and were grateful so many people came to pay respects, but they said they have had a difficult time getting answers over the years. Combat: The servicemen were flying in an AC-47D when it was shot down . The tooth, in their mind, raises more questions than answers: If a single tooth was found, they wonder, wouldn't it make sense that other teeth or perhaps his skull could be found also? Keith Hassenger said that while they approached last year's burial service at Arlington National Cemetery with the feeling it might help provide closure, that comfort proved elusive. 'This may be the only thing we get,' he said. For Jeanne Jeffords, 86, of Temecula, California, the hardest part of the service was seeing how emotional it was for her children, who were teenagers when their father died. 'I've lived with it for so long, I'm all teared out,' said Jeffords, who appreciated the opportunity to meet the families of her husband's fellow airmen. 'For all these years we just had a list of names.' Final journey: An Air Force carry team carries the casket with the men's remains at their burial service . Final closure: Kim Tisdale, left, wife of Lt. Col. Roy Tisdale comforts her daughter Megan during the burial service . Wedded bliss: Lt. Col. Dennis Eilers and his wife Belva Eilers, now Schaumberger, on their wedding day . Touching: Members of the Air Force Honor Guard hold American flags that were then presented to family members . The service drew hundreds of people, including Air Force and Vietnam veterans unrelated to the families. The first joint U.S.-Laotian team didn't visit the crash site until 1995 in the southern province of Savannahket, which was heavily bombed during the war as it lay on the Ho Chi Minh supply route that supplied Vietcong communist guerrillas in southern Vietnam. A villager recalled seeing a two-propeller aircraft crash near the village. A second villager had found wreckage of it and took the team to the crash site. Follow-up teams revisited the site four times between 1999 and 2001 and recovered military equipment but no human remains, and excavation was suspended. MIA: Lt. Col. Dennis Eilers was among the servicemen shot down on Christmas Eve 1965 over Laos . Combat: Col. Joseph Christiano (left) and Larry C. Thornton (right) were part of the six-member crew on an AC-47D aircraft . Long-lasting pain: Barbara Annechino, daughter of Col. Joseph Christiano is comforted by her brother Jeffrey during the burial service . Excavations resumed in 2010 and 2011, when human remains and personal items from the crew were found. It is not uncommon in situations like these for joint sets of remains to buried at Arlington. The Pentagon's Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office lists more than 83,000 service members as missing in action, the vast majority from World War II. In 2011, the office identified the remains of 62 service members previously unaccounted for. In an interview with the Associated Press last year, Jeffrey Christiano of Rochester, New York, who was only 2 when his father's plane went down, said Monday's burial brings his father home and resolves 'this nagging, disjointed feeling that he's not where he belongs.' He said he has struggled to understand his own emotions in the months since learning that his father's remains had been found and would be buried at Arlington.

David Cameron has just 12 months to prove himself or risk losing the support of Tory MPs, a senior backbencher has claimed. In a coded warning that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge next spring, David Ruffley warned the European elections in May 2014 could be a ‘flashpoint’. Mr Ruffley, the former shadow police minister, warned that losing to UKIP in the Euro elections would cause up to 100 MPs in marginal seats to lose faith in Mr Cameron. And in a second challenge to Mr . Cameron, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage revealed that he is . in talks with up to 20 Tory MPs about joining forces at the next . election. Mr Farage also revealed that at least one Conservative MP has used a go-between to discuss defecting to UKIP. The . UKIP leader said he was ‘in talks all over the place’ with ‘about 20’ Tory MPs about standing on a joint ticket, and with Tory councillors who . want to defect. And Mr Ruffley warned that the Prime . Minister’s strategy to hold a referendum on Europe in 2017 may not be . tough enough to win over voters who are defecting from the Tories to . UKIP. He said: ‘I think .

Defecting: Nigel Farage revealed that at least one Conservative MP has used a go-between to discuss switching to UKIP . ‘I think next May’s euro elections . might put pressure on him to go harder because there is a lot of . speculation in and around Downing Street that UKIP might come first. 'If that happens there’ll be 12 months before the election and some of our colleagues in marginal seats might get a bit windy.’ Windy: David Ruffley has said that if UKIP come first in the Euro election next year then then some of the MPs in marginal seats may become worried . Mr Ruffley said that a strong showing by UKIP at the 2015 general election would cost Tories seats. He also archly described Mr Cameron as ‘the best prime minister we’ve got’ a backhanded compliment that echoes what former Tory statesman Rab Butler said of his bitter rival Harold Macmillan. Mr Ruffley has broken cover in public to voice thoughts shared by many Tory MPs in private. Up to 20 are said to be prepared to . demand a vote of confidence in Mr Cameron, with 46 required to write to . the 1922 Committee to force an election. Mr Cameron has also come under fire . from backbencher Douglas Carswell, who accused ministers of allowing . civil servants to take over the Government.

Courageous criminal: A Welsh beekeeper says the theft of hives is on the rise, despite the inherent dangers . Brave - or foolhardy - thieves are stealing colonies of honey bees that can sell for up to £200. Britain's dwindling bee population is already on the decline thanks to long bouts of cold weather, loss of habitat and possibly pesticides. Now both bees and the people who care for them have to contend with thieves taking colonies. Cardiff beekeeper Elaine Spence was distraught when one of her hives was stripped of its honey bee colony in March. She told BBC Wales said she knows of 10 other hives being stolen in the past year, although no officials figures are kept, and estimates a colony of bees could sell for more than £200. She said: 'I looked at my hive and there was no roof on it. I was lost for words. 'I lifted what remained of the hive to have a look and it was just empty inside. 'All bee-keepers strive to ensure that their bees last through the winter. You care for them, they're a bit like part of your family, really. 'And to come and find that they have just been taken from you - it was really distressing.' Ms Spence, who keeps her hives on industrial land at a secret location in Cardiff, was already reeling after losing one of her three colonies to the poor weather. She also believes the thieves would have needed specialist knowledge and storage equipment to commit the crime. The thieves would have needed specialist equipment to steal the bees. File picture . Bees in the UK are already under threat thanks to long bouts of cold weather, the dwindling countryside and potentially pesticides . However, the thieves may have some karmic retribution coming their way, as the bees taken are a particularly vicious batch. She said: 'The bees that were taken were a fairly angry lot - they even managed to put me in accident and emergency last year through stinging me, so maybe there might be some poetic justice.' The programme also looks at the effects of a recently-banned group of pesticides known as neonicitoinoids. James Byrne of the Wildlife Trust says he fears the pesticides could be eroding bees' navigation system. Wild honey bees are responsible for pollinating around one-third of the world's crop production, but there numbers are in sharp decline, with the finger firmly pointed at a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids. Members of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee are now calling for a moratorium on the use of sprays containing neonicotinoids.","Beleaguered British bees face new threat from thieves .

Thousands of patients are dying due to a lack of doctors in England's worst hospitals, according to a new study. Hospitals currently being investigated for having high death rates employ far fewer doctors per patient than others, academics have discovered. While many think hospitals provide similar standards of care, the Plymouth University team found wide variations in staffing levels. A&E departments are particularly stretched, warn doctors. Professor Sheena Asthana and Dr Alex Gibson made their conclusions after looking at staffing in 14 hospital trusts recently identified as having high death rates. Concerns: Thousands of patients are dying due to a lack of doctors in England's worst hospitals . These are now the subject of a review ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and being led by NHS Medical Director Sir Bruce Keogh. The researchers found that on average these troubled hospitals have 17 per cent fewer doctors per 100 beds than those not under investigation. They also have five per cent fewer nurses and 22 per cent fewer cleaners. Those being investigated have on average only 56 doctors per 100 beds, while those not being reviewed have 68. Four of the 14 trusts - which run hospitals in Tameside, Dudley, Cumbria and Blackpool - have fewer than 50 doctors per 100 beds. The 14 hospital trusts are now subject to a review ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . By comparison, Guy's and St Thomas' in London - the best-staffed hospital trust in the country - has 125. Its death rate is 22 per cent lower than the average. Prof Asthana said the shortage of doctors was costing lives. 'The health service needs large numbers of staff on the front line to deliver good quality care,' she said. Her views were backed up by Professor Brian Jarman, an expert on hospital death rates, and a member of Sir Bruce's review panel. He said lower death rates were 'very strongly associated with more doctors per bed'. Prof Jarman recently calculated almost 3,000 people may have died unnecessarily at the 14 trusts under investigation in one year. He said staffing levels were too often ignored, despite evidence a lack of doctors costs lives. Dr Patrick Cadigan, registrar of the Royal College of Physicians, said: 'The most shocking example of this is A&Es. They probably have only half the number of doctors they need for safe staffing.' Julie Bailey, who founded the group Cure the NHS, said: 'If you don't have enough staff, patients suffer.' She launched the group when her mother Bella died after being dropped on the floor by staff at Stafford Hospital. Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'Staffing levels are being investigated as part of my review into mortality levels.' Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents, said: 'Adequate staffing is an important factor in safe care and treatment of patients and it is concerning these trusts have less doctors and nurses.'","Research carried out by Plymouth University looked at staffing levels in 14 hospital trusts .

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said on Sunday that a purported video of him smoking crack cocaine does not exist and vowed to seek re-election next year, attacking the media again as a 'bunch of maggots'. The mayor of Canada's largest city, speaking on the weekly radio show he hosts with his brother Doug Ford, a city council member, reiterated that the allegations are ridiculous, but he still has not said whether he has ever used crack. The video has not been released publicly and its authenticity has not been verified. Reports on the gossip website Gawker and in the Toronto Star claimed it was taken by men who said they had sold the drug to Ford. Rumors: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (right) said on a talk show hosted by his brother City Councillor Doug Ford that a video of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine does not exist . The Star reported that two journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe. The Star said it did not obtain the video or pay to watch it. Gawker and the Star said the video was shown to them by a drug dealer who had been trying to sell it for a six-figure sum. When asked by a caller to the show if it was him in the video, Ford responded: 'Number one: There's no video, so that's all I can say. You can't comment on something that doesn't exist.' Ford called the allegations false and said good journalists are 'few and far between'. 'A bunch of maggots,"" Ford said, quickly adding that he shouldn't have said that. Ford has refused to take questions from the media for more than a week. On Friday, he read a statement to reporters in which he denied using or being addicted to crack cocaine, but declined to take any questions. Critics of Ford have not been appeased and have questioned whether the mayor has told the whole truth. Some have called on him to step down, but Ford vowed on Sunday to seek re-election next year. 'I'll be the first putting my name on that ballot,' he said. Standing tall: Ford, with his wife, second left, and two friends, said he will be the first to put his name on a ballot for re-election . Doug Ford is also facing drug allegations after another leading Canadian newspaper published Saturday the results of what it called a lengthy investigation into the Ford family's past that revealed 'a portrait of a family once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene'. The Globe and Mail, citing anonymous sources who were involved in the drug trade, alleged that the mayor's older brother sold hashish for several years in the 1980s in the Toronto suburb of Etobicoke, where the family grew up. Doug Ford, 48, is an influential adviser to the mayor. 'I was not a dealer of hashish in the 1980s,' Doug Ford said on Sunday's radio show. On Saturday, in an interview with the cable TV news network, CP24, Doug Ford also denied the allegations, accusing the Globe and Mail of engaging in 'irresponsible journalism' and trying 'to ruin our family'. The mayor has been embroiled in almost weekly controversies about his behavior since being elected in 2010, but these are the most serious allegations he has yet faced. The Toronto Star reported earlier this year that the mayor was asked to leave a gala fundraiser for wounded Canadian soldiers because he appeared intoxicated. During his campaign for mayor, Rob Ford vehemently denied a 1999 arrest for marijuana possession in Florida, but later acknowledged it was true after he was presented with evidence. He pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and failing to give a breath sample to police. While in office, he has been accused of flouting conflict of interest rules and making obscene gestures at residents from his car. The controversy has drawn comparisons to the 1990 arrest of then-Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room during an FBI sting operation. Barry served six months in federal prison on a misdemeanor drug possession conviction but later won a fourth term as mayor in 1994.","Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has denied ever using crack cocaine after scandal over an alleged video of him smoking the drug .

A man charged in the brazen abduction and brutal captivity of a New York City businessman says he 'made a mistake' but he is 'not a criminal'. Alleged kidnapper Eduardo Moncayo refused to discuss the allegations on Sunday but said he doesn't belong in jail. Businessman Pedro Portugal was found this . week after being held in a warehouse for more than a month. He was . bound and burned with acid as captors demanded a $3 million ransom from . his family in Quito, Ecuador, according to police. Terror: An alleged kidnapper tries to withdraw money from businessman Pedro Portugal's bank account in New York . Moncayo made the remarks in a jail interview on Sunday, according to the New York Daily News. He and two others are being held without bail at a jail in the Bronx, New York. Police released a picture of one of the suspects allegedly trying to withdraw money from Mr Portugal's account at a bank. Police say Moncayo flashed a fake police badge to get Portugal to stop on a street on April 18 in Queens, New York. The 52-year-old tax accountant was kidnapped as he left his office in Queens. Six members of a gang then transported him to an abandoned factory in Long Island City. ‘In many respects this thing was like a James Bond movie. He was tied to a chair, duct-taped... he was brutalized, sometimes at knife-point, threatened with death,’ Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown told the local CBS affiliate. Portugal, who is married with six children, was found by police last Monday, after spending 32 days in captivity. During that time he endured severe . torture at the hands of the men who burned him with acid, threatened to . cut off his fingers and knocked out several teeth. Torture scene: Pedro Portugal was held captive in this Long Island City warehouse for 32 days before being freed by police on Monday . Despite being constantly threatened with death, his captors strangely bought him a cake for his birthday, according to the New York Times. Tricked: His captors allegedly flashed a fake police badge and threw him into a van on April 18 as he left his Queens office . He is currently being treated for ‘serious’ injuries including acid burns. Three of his six captors have been arrested: Christian Acuna, 35, and Dennis Alves, 32, both of Queens, and Eduardo Moncayo, 38, of Lyndhurst, New Jersey. The other three individuals are on the run and police believe that they may have fled the country, possibly to Ecuador. Police say Portugal was approached on a Queens street on April 18 by Moncayo, who showed him what looked like a police badge, along with two other men. He was forced into a car, a mask was put over his face, and he was threatened with a knife, and they drove away even as his leg was still hanging out of the side door. Portugal was taken to a warehouse just four miles away from where he was kidnapped, and was beaten repeatedly, threatened with mutilation and kept masked with his hands bound behind his back. Several men repeatedly punched and kicked him and another held a knife to his stomach as they ordered him to call his mother and ask for the $3million ransom money. Horrific: Police found him with his hands bound behind a chair an wearing a mask. They have arrested three of his kidnappers- who all face up to 25 years behind bars- but three others remain at large . Portugal 'suffered physical injuries and has been deeply traumatized by the ordeal. The case warrants vigorous prosecution,' Brown said. His alleged kidnappers forced him to call his mother in Ecuador, asking for the $3million ransom, authorities said. Police, notified of his disappearance and the ransom call, though it still took weeks to find him. A team of New York police officers were even sent to Ecuador as part of the investigation. When they got to the abandoned warehouse on May 20, they found Portugal with his hands bound, and took one of the suspects into custody outside of the building. 'I didn't treat him bad,' one of the kidnappers told investigators, prosecutors said. 'I told him it was just business.' It is not immediately clear why Portugal was targeted. His family own property and several businesses in Ecuador but are not said to be exceedingly wealthy, according to the New York Times.","One suspect Eduardo Moncayo said he 'made a mistake' and doesn't belong in jail after grisly ordeal .

Kenda Mohamed was born 13 weeks early weighing just 1.4lbs and suffered a number of serious conditions and infections. Her parents, Saleh and Halima Eltbawi, couldn't hold her for three months and were told to expect the worst. Kenda Mohamed (pictured with mother, Halima Eltbawi) was born 13 weeks early weighing just 1.4lbs at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary . They were even given the option of switching off her life support seven times. However, they never gave up hope of her recovering and following four major operations their seven-month-old daughter is now on the road to recovery. Her father, Saleh, 31, of Aberdeen, said: ‘The doctors took us to a small room in the hospital seven times to ask us if we would consider turning her life support machine off because she wasn't going to make it. ‘They were just making sure we were aware of the situation and letting us know that they should probably just stop treatment now as they were only prolonging her life by a week or two. ‘But we told them we couldn't give up on her. That's why we think she is a miracle, because nobody told us that she was going to make it. ‘The probabilities of her recovery were very, very slim but we are so happy to see Kenda the way she is now - she keeps surprising us with her progress.’ She was so unwell that her parents, Saleh and Halima Eltbawi, couldn't hold her for three months and were told to expect the worst - doctors even suggested seven times that her life support was turned off . She had four major operations shortly after her birth because she developed a bleed on the brain, a serious eye condition and numerous infections . When the baby was born at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary at 24 weeks in October she was the size of her father’s hand. She went through four major operations in the first few weeks of her life as she suffered bleeding on the brain and a number of serious infections. She also had an eye disease which nearly blinded her, and swelling which caused her body to double in size. Her parents refused to give up hope and kept deciding to give her a chance of survival. She is now seven-months-old and her parents describe her as a 'miracle' Kenda's parents do not know whether she will ever be able to walk or talk but say that they continue to hope that she will be able to lead an independent life . Mr Mohamed, who is originally from Libya, said: ‘The progress she's made is quite remarkable. There's a photo when she's a few weeks old and she's smaller than my hand. ‘Kenda's chances of survival were rated at 30 per cent, then 10 per cent and then we were told she wasn't going to make it through the night. ‘I'm not blaming the doctors, as they were just being honest about what they believed at the time, but we live in hope that Kenda can continue to surprise them. ‘We don't know if she will ever be able to walk or talk, it's just too early, but we're still keeping our hope that she will be able to lead an independent life.’","Kenda Mohamed was born 13 weeks early weighing just 1.4lbs .

A girl born with one ear is being denied a hearing aid for her first day of school because of where she lives. Ellie Sanders, four, was born with a rare condition called hemifacial microsomia which affects the development of the lower half of the face. It left her with just one functioning ear, meaning she desperately needs a special device to allow her to hear her teachers clearly on her first day of school in September. Ellie Sanders, (pictured with mother, Kelly) 4, was born without a right ear and has hearing loss meaning she will struggle to hear her teachers when she starts school in September . Her mother Kelly, 31, applied for the bone anchored hearing aid implant (Baha) which transmits sound directly through the skull and reaches the inner ear. But she says Ellie is the victim of a ‘postcode lottery’ with two NHS trusts arguing about who should pay the £3,000 bill. While other children elsewhere in Britain get the aid Ellie, from Truro, Cornwall, faces starting school without one. Ms Sanders said: ‘Other families in the same situation elsewhere in the UK have been offered a Baha. They don't have to go crawling around to other trusts. Ms Saunders asked NHS Kernow to provide the £3,000 bone anchored hearing aid that Ellie needs but the Trust referred her to NHS England which has also failed to help . ‘I don't know how long this process is going to take. It's just so unclear where we stand, whereas other people seem to have great support. ‘Ellie struggles now in a nursery setting. We have become more concerned with her affected side and how she will cope with starting school in September, but they seem to be passing the buck.’ Ms Sanders first tried unsuccessfully to get a Baha from the former Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Primary Care Trust which later became NHS Kernow. When she asked NHS Kernow for the device she was told she couldn't have one and was instead directed to NHS England, which has also failed to deliver. After endless consultations and letters Ms Sanders now fears the vital aid will not reach her daughter before she starts school. A spokesman for NHS Kernow said: ‘This particular type of equipment is funded by NHS England. We have written to the consultant caring for Ellie to advise him of this.’ NHS England refused to comment on individual cases but a spokesman said: ‘From April 1, 2013 there was a new national commissioning policy in place providing guidance on bone anchored hearing aids for hearing loss. ‘This now ensures patients have the same access to treatment irrespective of where they live in the country.’ Hemifacial microsomia is a condition which causes the tissue on one side of the face to be underdeveloped. It is a congenital disorder and it affects one in 3,500 to 4,500 children and is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts. It is believed to result from a developmental problem in the early stages of pregnancy and the level of deformity varies significantly, as does the area of the face affected. It is most common for the ear, side of the skull, cheek tissue, jaw, teeth or facial nerves to be affected. The main form of treatment is reconstructive surgery.","Ellie Sanders was born with no right ear and she has hearing loss .

In March, Marilyn Loder, 35, was rushed into hospital in labour knowing her own mother was close to death after losing her battled against breast cancer. Mrs Loder gave birth to her son Elisha 14 weeks prematurely who weighed less than 2lb. New mother Marilyn Loder has suffered the double heartbreak of prematurely giving birth to a dangerously ill son and losing her own mother to breast cancer within 15 hours . Mrs Loder's mother Elizabeth Moyle, 58, was told the baby had been born and died just 15 hours later. Hairdresser Mrs Loder had to suffer the double heartbreak of losing her mum and the terrible fear that Elisha might not survive. He was born weighing just 1lb 15oz and had a large hole in the heart and other life-threatening conditions. Mrs Loder said: 'It was an emotional roller-coaster - I had the child I longed for but I lost my mum 15 hours later. When Marilyn's son Elisha was born three months early, he weighed just 1lb 15oz and had a large hole in the heart as well as other life-threatening conditions . Marilyn and her builder husband Rob (pictured) spend every available second at nine-week-old Elisha's bedside in the Royal Gwent Hospital at Newport in South Wales. The baby boy is making slow but steady progress . 'I went from incredible happiness to terrible grief all on the same day. 'But at least my mum knew she was a grandmother and I'm taking a lot of comfort from that.' Elisha was born nine weeks ago and is still fighting for his life in a hospital's neo-natal unit. He was not due until June 25th and even now he only weighs just over 3lbs. Mrs Loder, of Cwmbran, South Wales, said: 'Elisha was born at 8.20am and my mum died at 11pm . 'She wanted to be a grandma so much. Its so cruel she never got to meet him. She would have adored him. Marilyn said that her late mother Elizabeth Moyle (pictured, left) wanted to be a grandma very much. Husband Rob (pictured, right) is supporting the new mother through her ordeal . 'I wasn't allowed to hold him for the first three weeks because he was so very small. 'I could sort of sit him in the palm of a hand and support him with my fingers, but it was amazing. 'He stops breathing most days, sometimes several times and when he was born he had a hole in his heart 5.8 millimetres across. 'For his size that was massive but as the weeks have gone on, the hole has got smaller. 'It's two millimetres now, and they don't have to operate. 'We just enjoy every day as best we can. They tell you to prepare yourself for the baby being in hospital at least until the original due date, but it could be longer.' Baby Elisha stops breathing most days and when he was born he had a hole in his heart 5.8mm wide. However the hole is closing and just 1mm across and surgeons no longer need to operate . Mrs Loder and her builder husband Rob spend every available second at Elisha's bedsidein the Royal Gwent Hospital at Newport, South Wales. Mrs . Moyle was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 42 - the same age . as when her own mother was diagnosed with the disease. She died after a brave 16-year battle which included a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. Tests showed she carried the BRCA1 gene - the same as Angelina Jolie who underwent a double mastectomy after discovering she was at high risk of breast cancer. Daughter Mrs Loder said: 'I was offered a test, but I didn't have it because I didn't want my mum thinking she had passed it on. 'When she was first diagnosed, I was in my late teens and I didn't cope with it very well. Marilyn (pictured with husband Rob) is still deciding whether to have the BRCA-1 test to determine whether she carries the same gene that ultimately killed her mother. In the meantime she has started to have annual mammograms - 16 years earlier than usual . 'I was advised to check out the genetic side then, given the family history, but did nothing about it. 'The second time she got it, 12 years later, I went for genetic counselling.' Mrs Loder is still deciding whether to have the test but in the meantime she's having annual mammograms which she started last year, 16 years earlier than usual. She said: 'Now that my mum has died it is a decision I'm going to have to make. 'But at the moment my priority is my little boy - I just want him to get stronger every day so that we can bring him home.'","In March, Marilyn Loder, 35, was rushed to hospital in labour, knowing that her own mother Elizabeth Moyle was close to death from breast cancer .

Up to 100 patients a day are being forced to wait more than an hour in ambulances outside overstretched A&E units. More than 37,000 people needing urgent treatment were held in so-called ambulance ‘jams’ last year – with delays of up to four hours recorded at some hospitals. The latest number is more than double the 14,580 who waited to be admitted in 2010-11, despite official guidelines that say patients should be handed over to medical staff within 15 minutes of arrival. Waiting: In thousands of cases, ambulances are having to queue up outside hospitals with patients inside their vehicles because A&E units are too busy . Even the number of those stuck in ambulances for 30 minutes have increased – from 99,661 three years ago to 193,088 last year. The delays in treatment come as many A&E departments are struggling to cope with a surge in patient numbers. Chaos in out-of-hours care and the . botched launch of the Government’s 111 non-emergency number have also . been accused of pushing many hospitals to breaking point. Earlier this year, staff at Norfolk . and Norwich University Hospital’s emergency unit were so stretched they . erected a tent in a car park to act as a makeshift ward. And in a leaked letter last week, 20 senior A&E doctors warned they could no longer guarantee safe care for patients. Jamie Reed, Labour’s health spokesman, said hospitals had reached ‘crisis point’. Closures: The devastating impact of casualties shutting across the nation . Delays: The ambulance service faces millions of pounds in fines if patients cannot be delivered to A&E units . ‘The collapse of social care, which . means older people cannot be discharged back home, the failure of the . new 111 helpline service, more than 4,000 nurses cut since the General . Election and walk-in centre closures are all piling pressure onto . A&E departments,’ he said. ‘The result is patients waiting . longer for treatment, being left on trolleys and unable to be . transferred to wards because the beds are occupied. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt: He blames GPs for passing out of hours cases to unreliable private firms . ‘David Cameron is taking the NHS . backwards, with ambulances queuing outside A&E and one hospital even . having to erect a tent to receive patients.’ Last week, NHS Confederation boss . Mike Farrar also said emergency care was in a ‘state of crisis’ and . called for patients to be able to email their GP instead of going to see . them. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . has blamed the problem on GPs giving up responsibility for out-of-hours . care and allowing care to be provided by unreliable private firms. The number of patients who waited . longer than four hours in A&E has almost tripled in four years, from . 344,772 in 2009-10 to 888,289 last year, NHS figures reveal. Casualty units have been told to . treat 95 per cent of patients within four hours, but almost a third of . trusts failed to meet the target. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘While . more than 90 per cent of A&E patients are seen within this time, . waiting an average of 53 minutes, a high number of patients are still . waiting longer than we would want. ‘There is no single cause or factor . that can explain longer waits in A&E departments and issues vary . from hospital to hospital.’ A Department of Health spokesman said . the NHS is ‘coping well’ after the number of casualty patients rose by a . million in three years. ‘Patients shouldn’t face excessive . waits for treatment and we expect NHS England to take action to address . ambulance handover times, including fining trusts when there are delays . of 30 minutes or more,’ he said. Julie Bailey is fleeing the town where she was born . The campaigner who helped expose one of the country’s worst NHS disasters has been hounded out of her home town. Julie Bailey, pictured, set up Cure the NHS when her mother Bella died in 2007 after appalling standards of care. Miss Bailey, 51, called for an investigation into the Mid Staffordshire Hospitals NHS trust. Her campaign led to the inquiry which revealed that up to 1,200 patients had died needlessly. However, the cafe owner has now received a series of threats. Many have unfairly blamed her for the uncertainty surrounding the future of the local hospital – one of the area’s biggest employers. And residents have started to boycott her cafe. As a result, she has now decided she has no option but to leave the town where she  was born. She said: ‘People have been coming into the cafe shouting that nothing happened at Mid Staffordshire, that I am lying and that there were no unnecessary deaths. ‘My cafe is in ruins. It is taking in about £40 or £50 a day. They are boycotting me. I will be gone by the end of the summer. I can’t stay here any longer.’ Miss Bailey has previously told how the campaign saw her use up all her savings, endure abusive emails and receive telephone threats. Revealing the source of her determination, she said: ‘It was too late to save Mum – but I could save others by launching a David-versus-Goliath battle to change the NHS.’","Overrun nurses and doctors were too busy to see 37,000 emergencies quickly .

In the sitting room of Eileen and Warner Billington’s home, the black and white photograph on the right takes pride of place. It shows the couple as teenage sweethearts, cuddled up in a photobooth during a charabanc outing to the seaside at Rhyl, North Wales, in 1950. You would naturally assume that Eileen, now 78, and Warner, 79, had been together ever since. Devoted: Eileen and Warner first met as teenagers but her father refused to allow them to marry . First love: Eileen and Warner Billington met aged 16 and 17 but weren't able to marry until their 70s . n fact, they married only two years ago – after spending six decades apart. The first part of their love story . ended in heartbreak, after Eileen’s father ruled that, at 18 and 19, . they were too young to get married. Both went on to enjoy happy . marriages, have children, celebrate their golden weddings and become . grandparents. But they never forgot each other – . and Eileen always treasured that photobooth snap, even asking her sister . to look after it in case her husband asked her to destroy it. Six decades later, after both were widowed, Eileen and Warner met again through a mutual friend. They realised they still wanted to be together and, with nothing now to stop them, finally got married. Yesterday Eileen said: ‘It’s as . though we’ve never been apart. As well as loving each other, we are good . companions, just like when we first met. In fact, we are just like an . old married couple.’ The couple grew up in Smethwick, West . Midlands. They met in 1950 after Warner, 17, noticed Eileen Lockley, . then 16, walking down the street with her sister Margaret, whose . boyfriend was a friend of his. ‘I saw her and I was smitten,’ said . Warner. ‘I waited for them to come out of Margaret’s boyfriend’s house . and come back up the road. ‘I got a pair of garden shears and . pretended to cut the hedge outside my parents’ house. When they passed, I . said, “Hello Margs, who’s that with you?” and we got talking.’  Shortly . afterwards, Warner enlisted in the RAF and was stationed at  St Athan . in South Wales. Eileen,  an aspiring tap dancer, worked for the gas . board and performed in pantomimes. Eventually Warner wrote to Eileen and asked her out on their first date. After that they wrote to each other every day. Happy: The couple are enjoying a contented retirement together in the Cornish town of Newquay . Long lasting love: According to Warner, anyone who says they've forgotten their first love is fibbing . Two years later they decided to . become engaged, but Eileen’s  widowed father said they were too young. Warner said: ‘I thought Eileen’s father was wrong, but I didn’t propose. Somehow, we just parted after that. It was my fault, I just went my own . way.’ In 1956, Eileen married Jack Lenton. They had a son and a daughter and ran a hotel in Newquay, Cornwall. Jack died in 2006. Meanwhile Warner got married, to . Gillian, in 1957. The couple had three sons and were together for 53 . years until Gillian died in 2010. Eileen and Warner did not see or . speak to each other after they split, but a friend of Warner’s used to . stay at Eileen’s hotel and she would always ask how Warner was. After the friend told Eileen about . Warner’s bereavement they picked up the phone and spoke again for the . first time in six decades. A year later, Warner plucked up the courage to ask Eileen to visit him at his home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. Eventually, with the approval of both families, Warner moved in with Eileen in Newquay, and on December 6, 2011, they married. Warner said: ‘We both often wondered . about what might have happened if things had worked out differently. But . we don’t dwell on it now. We are both reasonably fit and healthy for . our ages and are looking forward not backward.’ At last!

I'm especially sad for her 10-year-old brother, who was her life, along with her loving and close sisters, mother and step-father. Earth lost the best one ever. Happy birthday baby.' At the time of her death, Miss Law was three days away from her 27th birthday. Philadelphia's Fox affiliate reports that authorities do not currently consider the death to be suspicious, although, the cause of death currently is unknown. The woman's body was discovered at about 10:30am by a maintenance worker who stopped by the home, located in Philadelphia's Center City neighborhood. Speaking to NBC Philadelphia in Spanish, the worker said: 'The first thing I did was call 9-1-1 and police showed up. I then went to homicide to give my accounts of what happened.'

The Queen’s racing manager is to be interviewed by police investigating a suspected suicide apparently sparked by a Twitter row. John Warren, a leading figure in the horse racing world who oversees all of the Queen’s racing and horse breeding interests, will be spoken to by officers following the death of a stud farm assistant manager. Derek Larkin, 32, was found hanged on Wednesday. The married father of a one-year-old daughter had been accused a week ago of being the creator of a spoof Twitter account called Lord John Warren. John Warren (left), a leading figure in the horse racing world who oversees all of the Queen's racing and horse breeding interests, will be spoken to by officers following the death of a stud farm assistant manager . For the past eight months, the parody account had posted regular jokes about the racing world, along with sometimes smutty quips about celebrities such as Jordan and jokes about the Royal Family. It poked fun at the supposed pomposity of Mr Warren, who entertains the Queen at his Highclere Stud in Berkshire, in the shadow of Highclere Castle where Downton Abbey is filmed. Last Saturday, several figures in the racing world received an anonymous email claiming that Mr Larkin, originally from Ireland but living in Wiltshire with his wife Laura, 39, and daughter Niamh, was the author of the Lord John Warren account. That was the last day on which tweets were sent out either in his own name or from the spoof  account. On Wednesday, Mr Larkin was found hanging in a farm outbuilding. Last night, Wiltshire police confirmed they were investigating the apparent suicide and preparing a report for the coroner. Derek Larkin (above), 32, was found hanged on Wednesday. The married father of one had been accused a week ago of being the creator of a spoof Twitter account called Lord John Warren . Mr Warren will be interviewed by officers helping to compile this report and not as part of any criminal inquiry. A police spokesman declined to discuss the Twitter allegations. A source in the racing world said there was widespread shock that such a trivial matter seemed to have contributed to Mr Larkin taking his own life. The source said: ‘People used to joke about the Lord John Warren account in the bar at races – and at first some thought that the real John Warren must be pretty annoyed about it. ‘But it was obviously a spoof – it even said “parody” on it – and we assumed his wealthy clients wouldn’t be reading it so he probably wasn’t bothered. ‘Last Saturday I, along with a lot of other people in the racing world, got this anonymous email from someone who obviously didn’t like the Twitter parody, saying they wanted it stopped, and naming Derek Larkin as the author. 'He wasn’t very well known, so no one even exposed him on Twitter. ‘The next thing we knew was that he had apparently killed himself. I can’t understand it. He might have been worried he would lose his job but for a young man with a little girl it should not have been something to kill yourself over.’ Mr Warren, 56, runs the Highclere Stud with his wife Carolyn, 51, daughter of Lord Carnarvon. They live in a manor house on the estate, which the Queen visits regularly to follow the breeding and training of her horses. Mr Warren, a greengrocer’s son from Essex, is the first man without a title or a military rank to become the Queen’s official racing adviser and bloodstock manager. His pride at his royal links is evident from his stud website – which features a photograph of him with the Queen at a race. Last night, the curtains remained drawn at Mr Larkin’s family home in Biddestone, Wiltshire. His mother-in-law said the family did not wish to comment on the tragedy. At the Biddestone Stud next to his home, where Mr Larkin worked, his employer Tim Bostwick and manager Ian Bradbury also refused to comment. Mr Warren did not respond to requests for comment. Police said Mr Larkin’s death was not being treated as suspicious. Asked whether the spoof Twitter account was a factor death, a spokesman said: ‘Wiltshire Police is still investigating this incident and so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.’ The account poked fun at the supposed pomposity of Mr Warren, who entertains the Queen at his Highclere Stud in Berkshire, in the shadow of Highclere Castle (above) where Downton Abbey is filmed .

Amazon plans to build a trio of 65,000-square foot glass domes in Seattle as parts of its new headquarters to take on Apple's plans for 'spaceship' headquarters in Silicon Valley, San Francisco. The domes will be filled with plants and have been dubbed 'biospheres'. All the plants will be chosen specifically to survive in the microclimate of the domes that has also been designed to be comfortable for Amazon employees to work in. Scroll down for more pictures and video . Amazon's plans for a biosphere office resembles a greenhouse or conservatory. The three intersecting domes replace an earlier plan for a six-story office building. It will be full of plants and will be built over five floors . Amazon's domes will be built in the shadow of a skyscraper that the online retailer is also planning to build. Both the skyscraper and the domes will sit between 6th and 7th Avenue in Seattle . The proposals were submitted earlier this week at Seattle City Hall's Design Review Board and explain that the domes will have botanical zones arranged around office areas, a canteen and lounge. The plans explain that the domes will be 'a plant-rich environment that has many positive qualities that are not often found in a typical office setting.' Architects NBBJ have designed the buildings and its ecosytem. To achieve this Amazon will be creating the zones based on findings from studies that look into how plants and organisms live in mountain ranges around the world. The domes and office space will be spread over five floors with shops and a kitchen on the ground floor, more shops on the first floor and office space on levels two to five. Models and a proposal of the plan have been submitted to Seattle City Hall's Design Review Board earlier this week for review. The domes will take up 65,000 square foot. The first two floors will be shops. The top three floors will have office space, canteen and lounges all surrounded by plants . The first floor of the dome structure will have a kitchen, lobby and shops. The first floor will have more shops and then Amazon employees will work on floors two, three, four and five. Amazon proposes to place plants throughout the domes that can survive in the microclimate while still being comfortable for the employees . Amazon has also previously submitted plans to build a skyscraper on the same location in Seattle between 6th and 7th Avenue. The proposals do not say when the buildings will be completed and the completion date is expected to be announced once the plans have been reviewed. Plans for Apple's 'spaceship' headquarters were first submitted to planning officers in August 2011. It was billed as 'the best office building in the world' but this title could now be under threat from Amazon's glass domes. These incredible images show exactly what the firm's new Apple Campus 2, in Cupertino, California, will look like when completed in 2016. Last month Apple submitted new plans with updated landscaping plans, a slightly revised floor plan, renderings, and a bicycle plan, however the main design hasn't changed. Appearing as a giant saucer, amidst a dense jungle of trees, the 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff. This incredible new image shows what Apple's new HQ in Cupertino, California, will look like when completed in 2016 . Dubbed 'The Spaceship' because of its 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard, it will also contain a 1,000 seat auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. The 2.8 million square foot HQ will have underground parking, so that 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees - and clean energy sources, primarily natural gas, will provide its power. The local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies. Workers strolling around its exterior may think they are in the middle of the countryside, and not in the middle of a bustling city . In 2011 Steve Jobs said his firm was 'growing like a weed' and that it had 'a shot at building the best office building in the world'.The company's current Cupertino office, called 1 Infinite Loop and which will still be used by the firm, can only fit around 2,600 people. Apple has had to rent buildings to house its other 10,000 employees. Concept images released in April, as well as images originally submitted in 2011 by Cupertino City Council show workers strolling outside the building. The design is meant to make them feel like they are in open countryside. But by looking at the overhead impression, below, it is clear they will, in fact, be in the middle of a bustling city. Apple CEO Steve Jobs presented the . plans for the spectacular circular-shaped HQ, on former Hewlett-Packard . property, to Cupertino City Council in June 2011. He . said his firm was 'growing like a weed' and added: 'We do have a shot . at building the best office building in the world. I really do think . architecture students will come here to see this.' Workers may think they are in a rural paradise, but from this aerial image it is clear they are in the middle of a city . These images were released by Cupertino City Council in 2011, which is in favour of the development. Apple submitted updated plans in April this year that included tweaked floor plans, renderings and a bicycle plan. More than 80 per cent of the office will be surrounded by trees - similar to Amazon's plans to fill its biospheres with plants . The new site has been dubbed 'The Spaceship'. Its internal layout is similar to the Pentagons with toilets and kitchens situated at set points throughout the circular design . The company’s current Cupertino office, called 1 Infinite Loop and which will still be used by the firm, can only fit around 2,600 people. This has seen Apple renting buildings to house its other 9,000 employees. During a 20-minute presentation on the new project in 2011, Steve Jobs said: 'It's a pretty amazing building. It's a little like a spaceship landed. There is not a straight piece of glass in this building.' Architects Foster and Partners are working with ARUP North America and Kier & Wright engineers on the scheme. Apple has already outgrown its headquarters in Cupertino (pictured) and needs to move, but will still keep this site when the 'spaceship' headquarters opens in 2016 .","The three biospheres will be full of plants that have been specifically designed to survive in the microclimate while still being comfortable for Amazon's employees .

Disgraced: Lance Armstrong, pictured after his seventh Tour de France win, is facing criminal charges in Spain . Disgraced former cycling champion Lance Armstrong is facing criminal charges in Spain over his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong, who was stripped of his Tour de France titles and banned from competing over doping, is now being investigated by Spanish authorities. They are looking into whether Armstrong committed doping offences in Spain while cycling for the U.S. Postal Service cycling team. It is not a crime in Spain for an athlete to use performance enhancing drugs for personal use but it is an offence if investigators can prove 'trafficking, distribution and commercialisation of doping drugs', which carries up to two years in prison and fines of up to 400,000 euros. Armstrong lived in Girona, Spain, for several years during the height of his career which saw him win the Tour de France a record-breaking seven times between 1999 and 2005. Armstrong's former cycling teammate Floyd Landis told ABC News that he babysat Armstrong's 'blood fridge' while he was living in Spain in 2004 with the singer Sheryl Crow 'to make sure the temperature remained constant' when the former couple went away. The investigation is ongoing in multiple regions of Spain, including Alicante, Valencia, Girona and Tenerife, sources told ABC News. They added that the investigation is at a 'very active and sensitive' phase. Spain has been seen as soft on sports . doping in the past but has been working to change that image as it bids . for the 2020 Olympics. Bad blood: Former cyclist Flyod Landis, who . admitted in 2006 to doping, pictured left, was among the first people to publicly . accuse Armstrong, right, of cheating during Tour de France races .

The director of Spain's anti-doping . authority, Ana Munoz, said in a German TV interview: 'What I can tell . you so far is that we are following up on the Armstrong case. 'Not only because we were involved in the investigation back then but also because we are really interested that every person, Spanish or not, who has committed a crime in our country be prosecuted.' This latest investigation comes after a U.S. Anti Doping Agency report on Armstrong's doping activities. For years, Armstrong denied using performance-enhancing drugs. Confession: But the cycling champion finally admitted he had doped prior to each of his Tour de France wins on the Oprah Winfrey show in January . But last year, USADA released a report . that detailed extensive doping on his seven Tour de France-winning teams . and stripped him of those titles. Armstrong then admitted last month in an interview with 'Queen of Talk' Oprah Winfrey that he doped and used performance-enhancing drugs to win those races. Armstrong is now facing several legal challenges from his former sponsors and team mates. The cyclist has also been sued by a Dallas-based SCA Promotions to recover more than $12million in bonuses. Armstrong's legal representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Players will be able to face off in teams of four and create their very own Spy or Merc according to their playstyles via a host of customisable elements. Spy hunters: Most multiplayer details are being kept under wraps, but Spies v Mercs is a wonderful addition . The original Classic Spies vs. Mercs experience also makes its long awaited comeback. Interestingly, whereas Splinter Cell Conviction’s co-operative felt slightly disjointed from the main narrative, Blacklist's new Strategic Mission Interface allows a much more connected experience. The SMI allows 4th Echelon to receive data about mission objectives while on the move. Players can take advantage of the universal game economy system to customise and upgrade Sam, his suit, goggles and weapons in single player. While In multiplayer, Sam and Briggs can earn in-game currency and unlock additional weapons or gadgets via specialized missions assigned by Grim, Briggs, Charlie and Kobin. Visually, the game is reportedly using the same LEAD engine that powered Conviction - essentially a modified version of Unreal 2.5. There's no word yet on whether LEAD is cross generational, although Blacklist has not been slated as a next-gen release. The game's length, too, has not been discussed - with criticisms of Conviction centering around the its short playtime. It takes two to tango: Co-operative has been tweaked and improved to make use of the new SMI mechanic . There are also reports that the game's dynamic 'torture' mechanic - used sparingly in Conviction - has been overhauled and features more prominently. It’s set for release on August 20.

Guéguen carried out a study on the beaches of Brittany during the summers of 2008 and 2009. Painted ladies: singer Cher Lloyd (left) and actress Kym Marsh (right) are both fans of body art . 11 university-aged women who had been rated as the most attractive out of a group of 58 visited the  beach 20 times during the summer, wearing a temporary tattoo on their lower back 50% of the time and with clean skin the rest of the time. When women were displaying the tattoos researchers found that the men were more likely to approach and then chat with them, as well as being quicker in making their approach. For the second part of the experiment a group of over 400 20something men who were on the beaches at the same time as the sunbathing women were quizzed. Model Cara Delevingne has had two tattoos on her hand in two weeks, but do they make her more attractive . They were asked to answer two questions about the women, once they had been identified as somebody to analyse with reference to a study in romantic relationships: what they thought the likelihood was of the girl agreeing to go out on a . date with them, and of the likelihood of having sex on the first date? They were also asked to rate the girl's attractiveness. The results showed that women with tattoos were considered both more likely to go on a date and also more likely to have sex on the first date. Critics of the findings claim that they are incomplete because no reasons were given as to why the men reacted this way, whether it is based on stereotypes or personal experiences, and also the survey only took in to account one particular type and placement of tattoo. Female celebrity tattoo fans include Rihanna, Victoria Beckham, Cher Lloyd, Kym Marsh and Cara Delevingne who had two tattoos within two weeks this month.","French University team surveyed men on the beaches of Brittany .

Researchers from the Natural History Museum in London studied fossils of the solitaire, officially known as Pezophaps solitaria, and in particular the unique ‘musket ball’ structure on the bird’s wing. They discovered that the birds used the circular nodes as a way of fighting with other birds and fending off prey. Researchers from London's Natural History Museum have discovered that the small 'musket ball' knobs found in the wings of the now extinct solitaire bird were used for fighting. This artist's impression shows what the pair of solitaires would have looked liked when fighting over territory in Anse Francois valley on the island of Rodrigues. The birds became extinct at the end of 1700s . The Rodrigues Solitaire, or pezophaps solitaria is an extinct, flightless bird that lived on the island of Rodrigues. It was genetically similar to pigeons and doves and is most closely related to the also extinct Dodo of Mauritius. The Rodrigues Solitaire was the size of a swan. Males were much larger than females and measured up to 35 inches in length. Females were around 28 inches tall. Both sexes were highly territorial, with large bony knobs on their wings that were used in combat. The Rodrigues Solitaire laid a single egg, that was incubated in turn by both sexes. Gizzard stones helped digest its food, which included fruit and seeds.Solitaires were first mentioned in the 17th Centuryl by François Leguat, leader of a group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693. It is the only extinct bird with a former star constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius. Writing in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, ornithologist Julian Hume from the Natural History Museum said: ‘We know from detailed historical notes from eighteenth-century sailors that the birds were aggressive. 'They also describe a musket-ball-like bony growth on the wings, which was originally thought to be the result of injury. When we compared the wings of solitaire fossils from the caves of Rodrigues, an outer island of Mauritius, to modern birds we found that these growths were largest in adult males. 'This means they were probably important in fighting, like a fighter’s fist.’ Ornithologists had previously thought that the musket ball growth in these birds was the result of disease or injury. Fractures found during previous studies of the extinct birds' bones confirm that they were aggressive animals. The solitaire was highly territorial and would fight regularly. It is thought the small knobs found on their wings may have been caused by fighting, but then evolved to make them better competitors . Researchers now believe that the structures grew as a result of combat or due to hormones when birds paired up to mate and defended their territory. Many solitaire fossils contain healed fractures which supports this idea. ‘There are no living giant flightless pigeons for us to refer to, but museum collections such as those at the Natural History Museum contain thousands of solitaire fossils,’ said Dr Lorna Steel, a curator at the Natural History Museum. 'It is unlikely that the birds used the spurs solely for fighting as they also communicated with each other using their wings. Historical records talk of people hearing the sound from almost 200 metres away.' The now extinct solitaire birds from the island of Rodrigues are now thought to have been aggressive and territorial. They were reminiscent of the birds that star in the Angry Birds game from developers Rovio. Each bird is designed to destroy the egg-stealing pigs in a specific way .","Researchers from London's Natural History Museum have discovered that the small 'musket ball' knobs found on the wings of the now extinct solitaire bird were used for fighting .
It is thought that the knobs were a result of fighting and the Mauritian birds then evolved so the knobs developed naturally .

A ten-day inquest into the mysterious death of an American software engineer in Singapore ended on Monday with police admitting that they deviated from official protocols by not dusting for fingerprints or collecting DNA samples at the scene, and by examining his laptop computer. Shane Truman Todd's body was found in his Singapore apartment by his girlfriend last June 24, and local authorities have claimed that he hanged himself. But Todd's parents, Rick and Mary . Todd, believe that he may have been murdered and left Singapore . before the inquiry as they say they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process. Tragic: Shane Todd, a high-tech researcher, was found hanged in his apartment in Singapore in June 2012. His parents believe he was murdered due to the sensitive research he was involved in . State counsel presented evidence of links to suicide websites on the 31-year-old's laptop and suicide letters written to family members and loved ones. But the Todds think he could have been killed over his research in the U.S. into material used to make heat-resistant semiconductors, a technology with both civilian and military applications. The Todds have received assistance in the case from U.S. senators and the FBI. Police Sgt. Muhammad Khaldun Bin Sarif was asked by government lawyers during the inquest as to why police had not ordered a further . investigation of the apartment. Bin Sarif  said that he and his partner had made 'a preliminary assessment' that pointed to suicide and determined there were 'no signs of foul play.' He said the officers decided as a result 'not to perform fingerprint dustings or DNA swabs.' Enough: Rick and Mary Todd believe their son was murdered last year in Singapore. They withdrew from the inquest on Wednesday, saying they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process . Dispute: Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said his government regrets the family's decision to leave the inquiry . Asked why he had deviated from police protocols by assessing a personal laptop at a crime scene, Khaldun said he had found two notes in Todd's apartment, one of which contained a password which he used to gain access to the laptop nearby. Suspicion: Shane Todd's parents think he could have been killed over his research into a technology with both civilian and military applications . Khaldun explained that the protocol was only 'a guideline which can be deviated from.' He said he and his partner made an 'operational decision' to assess Todd's laptop because the note containing the password 'was left there for a reason' and would help police in determining whether there was foul play involved. Todd's family has asked why police accessed his laptop and cellphone even though such items are supposed to be handed over to forensic technology specialists. The inquiry into Todd's death ended Monday, a day earlier than expected. Lawyers for the Todd family were not present in court because they had been dismissed by Todd's parents, who left Singapore last Thursday after withdrawing from the inquest. Friends of the Todds were also not present in court. The Todds have said that while they were in Singapore, they found a hard drive in their son's apartment that contained thousands of documents he had backed up from his work computer. After having it analyzed by a . computer forensics expert, they found a draft of a project outline . between Singapore's Institute of Microelectronics - Shane Todd's former . employer - and Chinese telecom giant Huawei on the development of a . device that utilized gallium nitride.

Close: Mary and Rick Todd, center, are mourning the death of their son Shane (back right, pictured with brothers John, back left, Dylan, front right, Chet and his wife Corynne , front left) The heat-resistant material has . civilian uses in products like LED screens and cellphone towers, and . military applications in things like radar and satellite systems. Todd had been trained in the U.S. on . proprietary equipment that produces the material but is restricted for . export because of the potential military applications. Huawei has said it had no cooperation . with the Institute of Microelectronics related to gallium nitride. IME . has said neither Todd nor the company was involved in any classified . research. The Todds have said that their next step will be to urge a U.S. congressional investigation into their son's death. 'If our government wants to talk about industrial espionage and murder, we're more than willing to help,' Rick Todd said. His son's body was found in . his Singapore apartment by his girlfriend Shirly Sarmiento, a Filipino nurse, on June 24, 2012. Family: Shane Todd's brothers John (left), Dylan (second from left), Chet (second from right) and his sister-in-law Corynne (right) had traveled to Singapore this May to attend the inquest . Police found no signs of forced entry into the apartment and he had no visible signs of injury on his body except redness on his forearms and legs. Shirly Sarmiento had earlier told the inquest that he suffered from depression and that . he had mounting unhappiness with the 'dishonest environment' in his . workplace. She also mentioned he feared 'heavy hands coming after him.' His parents have said they consider the evidence presented by police to be fake. Rick Todd said his son in early 2012 . had expressed concerns to his parents that he was being asked to . compromise U.S. security. But he said Shane wasn't specific. Mary Todd also said the alleged . suicide note was obviously fake because it thanked the Institute of . Microelectronics, the former employer he had grown to hate, and had . other false details. Witness: Shane's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento (center on May 14 with the Todd family) testified at the inquest into the 31-year-old death . Last Tuesday, a key witness in the ongoing inquest withdrew his initial claims that Todd was strangled. The state, meanwhile, introduced a witness who contradicts the parents' claim that their son was killed before June 23. The parents, who traveled to Singapore from their home in Montana, issued a statement last Wednesday saying they would no longer participate in the inquest and return to the U.S. 'We have been told that the coroner's inquiry is not adversarial, rather it is a fact-finding mission with the sole purpose of getting to the truth,' the statement said. 'This has not been our experience. We no longer have confidence in the transparency in the findings of the system. It appears to us that the outcome has already been predetermined.' The parents, who had been expected to testify at the inquest, also have said the crime scene at their son's apartment was compromised, with key computer evidence mishandled. The FBI, however, has supported Singapore police claims that a hard drive found at Todd's apartment was handled by Singapore authorities who were checking for evidence, and not by an unknown person. 'We were looking forward to an honest and transparent court proceeding,' the parents' statement said. 'Sadly, this has not been the case. Therefore, we have decided that our presence in Singapore will have no bearing on the outcome of this case.' Brothers: Shane Todd was one of four boys and his grieving family want to know the truth about his death . Warning: Shane Todd's father Rick said his son had become fearful for his safety due to the sensitive technological research he was engaged in . Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said the government regrets the family's decision to leave the inquiry. 'For . reasons best known to them, they walked out and it's unfortunate that . they decided to leave,' Shanmugam told a news conference. 'The . family had said previously that they had found the hard drive . themselves, and they asserted that this hard drive had been processed by . a third party,' he said. 'It would have been useful to hear the family's side as to how they had come to a different view of the facts.'","Shane Todd, an American working on an 18-month assignment in Singapore, was found hanged in his apartment in June 2012 .

It may come as a surprise to many hardworking Americans, but governments in much of the developed world require employers to give employees varying amounts of paid vacation time. That, of course, is not the case in the land of the free and the home of the desperately-in-need-of-some-time-off, which has U.S. labor advocates calling for reforms to federal labor laws. According to a recent study by the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, the U.S. is the only country out of 21 economically advanced nations to not mandate employers to provide paid vacation time to employees. While many U.S. business voluntarily offer paid vacation time to employees, the study found that roughly one in four U.S. workers have none. Additionally, the study finds that those workers who don't have any paid vacation time are disproportionately employed at low-wage jobs that don't provide other benefits like health care. Paradise: according to a recent study, only one in four American workers are given paid vacation time . The study included paid-vacation data from 16 European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S. Of the countries included in the study, Australia and Portugal offer employees the largest amount of paid days off, with a total of 35 - 22 for vacation days and 13 for holidays. Next on the list is France and Italy, each of which require employers to provide 31 paid days off. With the exception of the U.S. - which mandates no paid vacation days - Japan requires the fewest amount of paid vacation days with 10. ""It's time to bring them into the fold,"" economist John Schmitt, one of the authors of the study, told the Huffington Post. ""There are firms that are . profitable and do provide vacation. Frankly, it concerns me that . someone's business model or success relies on not giving employees . vacation."" Zero: the U.S. requires employers to provide precisely zero paid vacation days to employees . In an effort to get the U.S. on track with the rest of the developed world, Florida Congressman Alan Grayson introduced a bill into Congress this week aimed at mandating paid vacation time for workers by amending the Fair Labor Standards Act to include paid vacation time for workers. Under the bill, businesses with more than 100 employees would be required to provide a week's vacation to full-time employees, and part-time employees who've been employed for at least a year and are on the clock for at least 25 hours a week. After the proposed law has been on the books for three years, the amount of paid vacation time required would increase to two weeks. Down Under: Australia requires businesses to provide employees with a total of 35 paid days off . ""Overwhelmingly, it's the low-income workers who don't get the paid . vacation,"" Grayson told The Huffington Post. ""This is accentuated by the . fact that many people who don't get paid vacation only work 30 hours a . week, or have less than a full-time job. These are the same workers who . have no health care coverage and no benefits in general.""""We're . really hurting ourselves, and specifically we're hurting the most . vulnerable among us,"" he added.

Lawyer David Jaroslawicz wouldn't comment on the terms of the settlement, saying only that the case had been ""resolved and discontinued."" The two women who filed the lawsuit against Favre, Christina Scavo and Shannon O'Toole, claimed that in 2008 they lost their jobs with the team when Favre sent sexually suggestive text messages to another therapist. It's settled: a lawsuit alleging NFL star Brett Favre sent several women racy text messages has been settled for an undisclosed amount of money . According to the women, the three-time NFL MVP asked the woman if he could get . together with her and Scavo, followed by another text saying, ""I guess I . have bad intentions.""

During that investigation, media reports claimed Favre also had pursued massage therapists, but the NFL said it was unable to get enough information to decide whether the reports were substantiated.The Jets have said O'Toole and Scavo worked for the team for a combined total of five days over two years, making $2,300 in all, and were never guaranteed ongoing work. The team wasn't told about the women's concerns and simply turned to other massage therapists after its training facility moved in 2008, its officials and lawyers have said in court filings.Favre retired from the NFL in 2010, after playing for 20 seasons, mostly with the Green Bay Packers.

An $100m NFL star suing his ex-fiancee to get back a $785,000 10-carat diamond engagement ring actually sent her texts saying she could keep it, according to her lawyer. Mario Williams, defensive end for the Buffalo Bills worth over $30m with a $100m contract, is suing his ex-fiancee Erin Marzouki for the return of the ring after their relationship turned sour. Marzouki, who is counter suing to keep the ring levied accusations through her lawyer that Williams lied in his lawsuit and repeatedly told her to keep the gift. Happier times: Buffalo Bills' Mario Williams poses for a photo with his fiancee Erin Marzouki. They've since split and are suing and counter suing over the engagement ring . Her attorney, high profile Texas lawyer Anthony Buzbee, released a series of text messages this week that make it seem as if Williams has in fact urged Marzouki to keep the ring, contrary the allegations filed in his lawsuit, according a report from Ultimate Texans. In the messages Williams writes, 'Keep those material things. It means nothing to me anymore,' later adding 'KEEP IT! Remember me by it.' Buzbee described Williams actions as emotionally unstable and said the football player is confused as to whether he wants to be married or single. Blinged out: Williams claims he wants the 10-carat $785,000 diamond engagement ring he bought returned, but Marzouki released a series of text messages in which he instructed her to keep the ring . Buzbee also introduced into evidence an email written by Williams earlier this year that asks Marzouki to reconcile. 'I just want to verbally discuss and answer things . knowing you have closed the door,' Williams wrote, 'I still can’t say one thing bad about . you that sticks.' Despite the new evidence coming to light Williams vehemently denies the allegations, saying that the messages were taken out of context. 'Obviously it’s just a tactic to cover up the point of the whole . thing,' Williams told the website. 'It is what it is. I could really care less. All . it is (is) allegations and text messages and what not, whatever . information blown out of proportion. I mean, it’s completely out of . context.' Yet in another message released by Buzbee, Williams was allegedly more explicit in his desire to give Marzouki the ring. Bling: The ring is a GIA certified radiant cut diamond weighing 10.04 carats, E color grade and VS2 clarity grade worth $785,000 . 'She said she was going to . keep the ring n told her fine. I put down using material things as . leverage long ago. She is free to be n do as she wants,' Williams wrote. In his lawsuit Williams claims that Marzouki ended the couple's engagement after a year because she 'never intended to marry and used the relationship as a means . to get money and acquire gifts,' according to the court documents. Read Williams side of the lawsuit in full...

An elderly man broke down in tears on Monday as a jury heard how he was almost carved in half by a mentally-ill man with two power saws on a New York City subway platform. Michael Steinberg, 70, choked on his emotions at the first day of trial in his suit against an MTA contractor - whom he blames for leaving the power tools unattended - at Manhattan Supreme Court. He was attacked by  Tareyton Williams as he stood on the platform at 110th Street and Broadway in the early hours of July 6, 2006. He has said he does not blame Williams  for the attack. Instead, he holds Five Star Electric . Corp. responsible for failing to lock down the tools and for its staff . for not coming to help him during the bloody attack. Victim: Michael Steinberg, pictured recovering in hospital after he was attacked by a saw-wielding madman on a subway platform in 2006, has sobbed in court as the jury heard the details of the horror . 'I almost died,' Steinberg told the New York Post outside the court. 'I don't want to live through this . again. It's just because they don't . want to reach a settlement of any kind.' His lawyer, Ronald Landau, added: 'There was nobody and nothing to prevent anybody - crazy person, . sane person, thief, nonthief - from walking over to those power tools . and just lifting them off.' Landau added that Williams had been acting bizarrely before the attack, yelling and pacing. At court on Monday, the contractor's . attorney, Barbara Sheehan, said a worker was just two or three feet of . the tools, when Williams grabbed two saws and unleashed his attack. 'What we have is an unexpected, . unforeseeable action by somebody who did something that really none of . us could really conceive of,' Sheehan said. Locked up: Tareyton Williams, pictured, apologized to Steinberg before he was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The victim said he does not blame Williams - rather the MTA contractor for leaving the tools unguarded . Weapon: Police remove one of two sawzall saws from a garbage can after they were ditched Williams . Williams was sentenced to 18 years in . prison for the attack and, before he was locked up, he apologized to . his victim. Steinberg said he forgave him. Mr Steinberg said he must now take Valium pills before using the subway to calm him. On the night of the attack, Mr . Williams calmly walked towards the 4-foot-11 Mr Steinberg with the two . chainsaws and began cutting into his chest. The two power saws, called Sawzalls, sliced through his ribs and punctured his lung. The elderly New York native begged his attacker to stop carving, offering him cash and credit cards, but he ignored the pleas. Finally he stopped, said 'now I will take your credit cards and your money' and walked calmly away. At the time, Mr Steinberg told the media how construction workers had ignored his cries for help. Scene: The former postal worker was in the 110th and Broadway station on his way to work when he was attacked with the two saws, and he said contractors just stood back and failed to help him . 'I screamed for help. 'Please help! Please help me!' The ... people (construction workers) heard me. They just looked. They never stopped to help me, and that disturbed me more than anything else. I begged for somebody to call an ambulance and to get this guy off me,' he explained to the Post. Doctors said if the saws had cut just a millimetre deeper, the postal worker would have been dead. Williams was arrested after punching a man walking his dog later that day and pleaded guilty to senseless assault.

The remote volcanic islands of the Galapagos archipelago - home to the world's largest tortoises and the place that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution - is coming to Google's Street View later this year. Google, in partnership with Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) and the Galapagos National Parks Directorate (GNPD), sent hikers to the Galapagos Islands with Street View Trekker equipment to take panoramic images of its wildlife. The hikers captured thousands of images using the football-like cameras mounted on a tower on top of the 42lb (19kg) computer backpacks. A giant tortoise crawls along a path in Galapaguera, a tortoise breeding centre on the Galapagos Islands. Googler Karin Tuxen-Bettman is seen in the background taking photos using the Street View Trekker orb camera attached to a backpack. The volcanic islands of the Galapagos archipelago are closed to tourists but Google recently sent its Street View and underwater cameras to the region and is putting the images online later this year . As well as taking land images with its Trekker backpack cameras, Google also took underwater cameras to the Galapagos Islands to record life on the seabed. In this photo from the Catlin Seaview Survey, Christophe Bailhache uses an SVII camera to capture images of an Spotted Eagle Ray during a survey dive . The Galapagos Islands, also known as the Archipielago de Colon and Islas de Colón are an archipelago of volcanic islands found on either side of the Equator in the Pacific Ocean. Archipelago means group of islands or island chain. The Galapagos islands are 500 miles west of Ecuador. They are famous for their giant tortosies and blue-footed booby birds. The first chart of the islands was said to be made by the buccaneer . Ambrose Cowley in 1684. The first detailed studies of the islands were made by Charles Darwin while aboard HMS Beagle during the 1830s. He used the animals and landscapes he saw to help develop his theory of evolution. They also used underwater Street View cameras to capture sea life as part of the Catlin Seaview Survey. Google is now stitching these images together and all of the panoramic images will be . available on Google Maps later this year so people around the world can . experience this remote archipelago. Few have explored the remote volcanic . islands of the Galapagos archipelago because it is closed to tourists. Google was allowed on the islands with its backpack Trekker orb cameras to fully document the archipelago in pictures. Each Trekker orb has 15 cameras inside it that have captured panoramic views of some of the most inaccessible places on the Galapagos. Crews from The Catlin Seaview Survey worked with Google to capture 360-degree views of selected underwater areas too. In this photo from the Catlin Seaview Survey, Christophe Bailhache uses his SVII camera to swim through and photograph a large group of sea lions during a survey dive at Champion Island in Galapagos . Raleigh Seamster, the project's leader for Google Maps said: 'We spent 10 days there hiking over trails and even down the crater of an active volcano.' 'And these are islands, so half of the life there is under the water surface. We brought Street View underwater to swim with sea lions, sharks and other marine animals.' Google is processing the footage and is trying to stitch it together. It hopes to post it to Street View later this year. Daniel Orellana of the Charles Darwin Foundation collects seashore imagery with the Street View Trekker at the Los Humedales wetland area on Isabela Island in the Galapagos. The orbs attached to the Trekker backpacks have 15 cameras inside that can take panoramic photos. The backpack weighs 42lb (19kg) The Street View Trekker backpacks, took more than a year . to develop. The . 40lb backpack holds up a number of 15-megapixel cameras, an on-board . hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day. Cameras are positioned to give a 360 degree view so every possible angle is captured. The cameras captured the nesting sites of blue-footed boobies, the red-throated 'magnificent frigatebirds,' swimming hammerhead sharks and, of course, the island's giant tortoises. Scientists working with Google are . exploring the footage for other species and hope to update the pictures . regularly throughout the years as they study the effects of invasive . species, tourism and climate change on the island's ecosystems. 'We . hope that children in classrooms around the world will be trying to . discover what they can see in the images, even tiny creatures like . insects,' said Daniel Orellana, a scientist with the Charles Darwin . Foundation. 'We can use this as an education experience for children, and there is a huge opportunity for rare discoveries.' Daniel Orellana of the Charles Darwin Foundation climbs out of an Isabela island where he was collecting imagery on the Galapagos. The lava landscapes found on the island help tell the story of the formation of the Galapagos. Tourists are banned from the islands and the images taken by Google, due to go online later this year, will give people worldwide a unique view and unseen places . Orellana and others supervised the Google trekkers and helped guide them to remote areas either off-limits to tourists or rarely visited because they are hard to reach. They also captured images of the areas frequented by tourists so they can keep track of how this access is affecting the environment. Since launching Street View in 2007, Google has expanded from urban neighborhoods accessed easily by its mapping cars to more hard-to-access sites like the ocean floor, the Amazon rain forest and the Arctic. 'This whole project was part of Google's ongoing effort to build the most comprehensive and accurate map of the world,' Seamster said. Daniel Orellana is shown crossing a field of ferns to reach some naturally occurring sulfur mines on the top of Sierra Negra, an active volcano on Isabela Island in the Galapagos.

Four years ago the Royal College of Art students created the substance that allows you to paint working light switch directly onto your wall, without any need for sockets, cables or wiring. The paint acts as a form of liquid wiring and, unlike conventional wires, it can be applied to almost any surface, including paper, plastic, metal and even fabric. A group of Royal College of Art students created this Marmite-like substance that allows you to paint liquid wiring onto any surface . Bare Conductive's House Kit contains two paper houses, wired with conductive paint, which light up in the dark . The product has the appearance and consistency of runny Marmite, but dries quickly when exposed to the air. Its inventors, RCA graduates Isabel Lizardi, Matt Johnson, Bibi Nelson and Becky Pilditch, call their creation 'Bare Paint.' While they don't claim to be the first group to have invented a conductive ink, they are pioneering new ways it can be used, CNN reported. Matt Johnson said: 'We started this project in earnest in 2009. We were originally interested in trying to apply electronics to the skin... so we arrived at this idea of applying them as a coating and eventually we got this idea of a conductive paint. 'In 2008 -- and probably still today -- there was a lot of work around electronic textiles. And though we really liked the idea of having a jumper (a piece of clothing) that has some intelligence in it, we didn't like that it was so bulky and that once you took it off the functionality disappeared.' Around the same time there was a lot of 'extreme work' being done by people who were injecting electronics beneath the skin. For their final project, the RCA students began work on making something less intrusive, looking for a substance that could be painted onto the body. Bare Conductive's Matt Johnson travelled to Budapest Design Week and ran a workshop with University students at the Bloodmountain Foundation . DJ and producer Calvin Harris mounted a project with Bare Conductive, with painted dancers whose movements triggered loops from Harris's hit song Ready for the Weekend . Designer Patrick Stevenson-Keating developed a conductive paint-powered lamp for the 2012 Milan Furniture Fair. The lamp consists of a layer of liquid paint suspended in oil . Mr Johnson said: 'That idea transformed into the material we have now, which is very safe though it's not specifically intended for the body anymore.' After graduating from college, the team collaborated on a video for DJ and producer Calvin Harris. The resulting project was the 'Humanthesizer,' a performance which literally brought the paint to life, with dancers whose movements triggered audio loops from Harris's song 'Ready for the Weekend.' The company has created a collection of prototype posters that respond to touch. When activated, the posters play audio, which they hope might be used in poster campaigns promoting festivals, music, TV shows and film . Matt Johnson, co-inventor of Bare Conductive, said: 'Making a new material was a bit daunting for four designers.' So, the team went on Wikipedia. According to Johnson, the online encyclopedia provided them with almost everything they needed to know about crafting conductive materials. Once the paint's formula was finalised, co-creator Isabel Lizardi says the team began to consider how it might be applied to real-world products. The first thing they launched was the paint in its raw form, which they made available to other garden-shed inventors, CNN reported. Today, Bare Paint jars and pens are sold on the internet and stocked by electronics stores around the world. Projects being done by Bare Paint users include everything from interactive color wheels to homemade electric toys. Mr Johnson said that conductive paint opens up an enormous range of creative opportunities. As conductive paint becomes increasingly common, we can look forward to a future where billboards talk back, walls are interactive, and greeting cards come to life in our very hands. Mr Johnson added: 'Devices no longer have to look high tech to be high tech. Our goal is to put interactivity onto objects you don't expect.'","Royal College of Art students in London created the substance .

The incident, which occurred in Makhachkala, the capital of the semi-autonomous republic of Dagestan, also caused significant damage to the area. It is believed law enforcement officers may have been the target because the explosion happened outside a marshasls building.

Doing much of the work themselves, David and Elaine Rolfe spent £20,000 turning the two-acre plot into a lush paradise full of colour, with sweeping flower beds and rose-clad arbours. But last year Mr Rolfe, 51, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. It meant the couple had to leave their rented 17th-century water mill, on the Llanover Estate near Abergavenny, Wales, to move into a bungalow.

But it appears Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has found a new friend in actress Liz Hurley after the pair bonded over his pet kitten. The former rebel fighter and Miss Hurley met after she arrived in Chechnya to begin filming a thriller with French actor Gerard Depardieu. The pair can be seen chatting and apparently bonding over a cute fluffy white kitten in a series of images posted on the Chechen leader's Instagram account. New friends: Ramzan Kadyrov , the Chechen leader and former rebel fighter, posted this picture of himself with Liz Hurley who can be seen holding his white kitten . Famous friends: Ramzan Kadyrov greets his close friend, French actor Gerard Depardieu who introduced him to his co-star in a new thriller, Liz Hurley . Kadyrov and Hurley were introduced by her co-star Depardieu who became friends with the Muslim Chechen leader at his birthday celebrations two years ago. Hurley, who has previously starred in comedy films Austin Powers and Bedazzled, and Depardieu were both in town to start filming Turquoise, a new movie about a French art thief and his Russian former flame. Depardieu, who has become a Russian citizen,  took the opportunity  to catch up with his old friend while filming in the Chechen capital which has been rebuilt under Kadyrov after it was left in ruins less than a decade ago. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was split into the Republic of Ingushetia and the Chechen Republic. Following the First Chechen War with Russia, Chechnya gained de facto independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Russian federal control was restored during the Second Chechen War. Kadyrov is now Head of the Chechen Republic. The actor then introduced pro-Russian Kadyrove to his co-star. And judging from the photos posted online, Kadyrov and Hurley hit it off straight away. Ramzan Kadyrov appears to help the actress, who starred in Austin Powers and Bedazzled, with her mobile phone . Soft side: Ramzan Kadyrov, who has denied Chechnya has any links to the Boston marathon bombing suspects, poses next to the fluffy white kitten . The images were made public as Hurley and Depardieu held a press conference in the capital. During . the meeting, Depardieu claimed the ethnic Chechen brothers accused of . the Boston marathon bombing had been raised American and that residents . of the volatile Russian region of Chechnya were not to blame. The actor, who accepted Russian citizenship after quitting France to avoid a planned 75 per cent tax on millionaires, was echoing earlier comments from his friend Ramzan Kadyrov. 'I was in the United States when the terrorist act was carried out in Boston. I agree with Ramzan Kadyrov who said that the Tsarnaev brothers have a Chechen last name but their upbringing is American,' Depardieu said at a news conference. You (Chechens) don't carry any responsibility.' Kadyrov, who has been criticised for his strongarm rule, says tough policies are required in Chechnya to control Islamist violence in the North Caucasus where insurgents wage almost daily violence to create an Islamic state. He has denied that Chechnya had any links to the Tsarnaev brothers, accused of blasts that killed three people and injured 264 others at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. U.S. investigators are looking into links between Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a gun battle with police, and extremists who wage violence in the mountainous Russian region near Sochi, where Russia plans to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics.

North Korea today announced that it would kick-start its nuclear programme once again by re-opening a complex which was closed as part of disarmament talks six years ago. The secretive dictatorship said it would re-start the mothballed facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, which it insists is meant to generate electricity, but which is capable of making a bomb. If North Korea succeeds in making more nuclear weapons, its ongoing war of words with the South and the U.S. will take on worrying new dimensions. Moving: A F-16 fighter jet comes in for a landing as A-10 jets move to take off at a U.S. air force base in Osan, south of Seoul today .

A file handout satellite image shows the Yongbyon complex nuclear facility . Target practice: North Korea has released video footage of soldier firing at cartoon-lie targets of U.S. soldiers . A spokesman for the General Department of Atomic Energy said that the facilities to be restarted are a graphite-moderated five-megawatt reactor, which generates spent fuel rods laced with plutonium and is the core of the Yongbyon nuclear complex. The reactor is capable of churning out one atomic bomb worth of plutonium - the most common fuel in nuclear weapons - each year. The move will boost fears in Washington and among its allies about North Korea's push for nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach the United States, which it cannot currently do. Threat: Kim Jong Un, pictured centre at a meeting of North Korea's parliament today, has vowed to re-open the country's nuclear facilities . Performance: The State Merited Chorus of North Korea singing for delegates . December 2011: Kim Jong-il died and his son Kim Jong-un was named his successor. April 2012:To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, in April 2012, Pyongyang launched a long-range ballistic rocket which fell into the sea. August 2012, ahead of the annual US-South Korean drills, Kim Jong-un announced that the North Korean army was ready to deal 'deadly blows . December 12 : North Korea successfully launched a rocket on Wednesday, boosting the credentials of its new leader and stepping up the threat the isolated and impoverished state poses to opponents. The rocket, which North Korea says put a weather satellite into orbit, has been labeled by the United States, South Korea and Japan as a test of technology that could one day deliver a nuclear warhead. January 2013: North Korea announced it was planning a new nuclear test, raising the confrontation with the US to a whole new level. February 12: North Korea conducted its third nuclear test and warned that further measures would follow if the US continued its “hostility” against the North. The UN subsequently imposed more sanctions on the county. March 29:  Following a mock bombing of North Korea by a US B-2 stealth bomber during a joint military drills, Pyongyang ordered rocket units be put on standby to fire on US bases in the South Pacific. March 30, North Korea declared it was entering a 'state of war' against its Southern neighbour. Yesterday footage was released showing . soldiers in the secretive country practice shooting at mocked up . Americans and South Koreans in a video released by state media. The U.N. chief says he fears North Korea is on a collision course with other nations that could lead to war. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says the isolated Asian nation appears to be 'on a collision course with the international community' amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister, said today in Andorra 'the current crisis has already gone too far' because of escalating tensions raised by North Korea's threats of war almost daily against the United States and South Korea. He said international negotiations are urgently needed but he is 'convinced that no one intends to attack' North Korea. Pyongyang has sought disarmament-for-aid talks with Washington and more domestic loyalty by portraying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a powerful commander. Pyongyang conducted its third nuclear test in February, prompting UN sanctions that have infuriated its leaders and led to the current tensions. The government has since declared that making nuclear arms and strengthening the economy are the nation's top priorities. According to estimates from the . Institute for Science and International Security from late 2012, North . could have enough weapons grade uranium for 21-32 nuclear weapons by . 2016 if it used one centrifuge at its Yongbyon nuclear plant to enrich . uranium to weapons-grade. 'The General Department of Atomic . Energy...decided to adjust and alter the uses of the existing nuclear . facilities, to begin with,' KCNA reported. It said the nuclear facilities would be used for both electricity and military uses. It was not clear how long it would . take to restart the reactor, whose cooling tower was blown up in a . made-for-TV event in 2008 under an agreement to suspend the atomic . complex. There have been reports of . construction work near where the tower once stood but it was not clear . whether the North was rebuilding it. North Korea added the five-megawatt, . graphite-moderated reactor to its nuclear complex in 1986 after seven . years of construction. The . country began building a 50-megawatt and a 200-megawatt reactor in . 1984, but their construction was suspended under a 1994 nuclear deal . with Washington. North . Korea has long said that the reactor operation is aimed at generating . electricity. It takes about 8,000 fuel rods to run the reactor. Warning sign: North Korea's December 12 rocket launch shows the country has likely developed the technology to fire a missile that could reach the U.S. West Coast . Reprocessing the spent fuel rods after a year of reactor operation could yield about 7kg of plutonium - enough to make at least one nuclear bomb. South Korea's new president yesterday told her troops to strike the North if it appeared likely to attack. 'If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations,' Park Geun-hye told the defence minister and senior officials.

Stung by criticism that its response to the shelling of a South Korean island in 2010 was tardy and weak, Seoul has also threatened to target North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and to destroy statues of the ruling Kim dynasty in the event of any new attack, a plan that has outraged Pyongyang.

Dr Conrad Murray was $500,000 in a debt and willing to do anything to get paid while he was treating Michael Jackson, said the detective who investigated the King of Pop's 2005 death. Detective Orlando Martinez told jurors on Tuesday that Murray depended on the $150,000-a-month salary that he received from Jackson's concert promoter AEG Live. Lawyers for Jackson's mother Katherine argued that AEG should have vetted Murray. AEG is defending itself from a wrongful death lawsuit that alleges the company bears responsibility for Dr Murray allegedly giving Jackson a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol. Martinez testified that he looked into Murray's finances searching for a financial motive for his role in Jackson's death and relied mostly on public records. He turned up that Murray's Las Vegas home was in foreclosure proceedings, and Murray faced several liens for unpaid child support and other unpaid debts. Trial: A paramedic who discovered Michael Jackson dead in his bedroom told a jury on Tuesday that the King of Pop appeared to have been dead at least an hour when he arrived on the scene . The searches led Martinez to conclude that Murray's financial condition was 'severely distressed.' Martinez said that led him to believe Murray's actions were motivated by the $150,000 a month he expected to be paid by AEG. 'He may break the rules, bend the rules, do whatever he needed to do to get paid,' Martinez said. 'It might solve his money problems.' Murray's finances were not a factor in the criminal case that ended with his 2011 conviction for administering a fatal dose of propofol to Jackson. Martinez also showed jurors photographs the various medications officers uncovered in Jackson's bedroom, including several vials of propofol. The paramedic who discovered Jackson dead in his bedroom nearly four years ago told the jury earlier Tuesday that the King of Pop appeared to have been dead at least an hour when he arrived on the scene. Jackson's . blue hands, feet and lips, and the singer's dry eyes all signaled to paramedic Richard . Senneff that the singer was dead and hadn't been breathing for a long . time. 'To . me, he looked like someone who was at the end stage of a long disease . process,' Senneff said Tuesday during his testimony in the civil case between Michael Jackson's mother and concert giant AEG Live. Senneff also recalled how Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, was frantically trying to revive the singer. 'He was pale, he was sweaty,' the paramedic said of Murray. 'He was very busy.' Murray claimed he was treating Jackson for dehydration and he never mentioned propofol, the . hospital-grade anesthetic that killed the singer, Senneff said. He told the panel that he found an IV pole, oxygen tanks and a nightstand with several medicine bottles. In the nearly four years since his . death, nearly every aspect of Jackson's life has been explored in court . proceedings, documentaries, books and news stories. Still, . the negligence case filed by his mother against AEG promises to deliver . the most detailed account of the singer's addiction struggles, . including testimony from his ex-wife Debbie Rowe about treatments . involving the anesthetic propofol dating back to the 1990s. Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson leaves the sentencing hearing of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of pop star Michael Jackson . Jackson died from a propofol overdose in 2009 while preparing for a series of comeback concerts at AEG's O2 Arena in London. Katherine . Jackson contends AEG didn't properly investigate Murray, the doctor who later . administered the fatal dose. The company denies wrongdoing. During opening statements, attorneys framed Jackson's prescription drug addiction through the prism of his superstar status. Attorney . Brian Panish, who represents Katherine Jackson, said the drug problems . worsened when the pop star was under the stress of live performances. AEG . attorney Marvin S. Putnam countered that Jackson's stardom provided a . cover to receive multiple, secret medical treatments, many involving . propofol. At one point . in the proceedings, the harsh portrayal of Jackson's struggle with . addiction, led one juror to lean forward and stare at the floor for . several moments. Doctor in question: Paramedic Richard Senneff recalled how Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, (pictured) was frantically trying to revive the singer . Katherine . Jackson and two of the superstar's children, Prince and Paris, are . potential witnesses whose testimony will likely focus heavily on their . grieving and losses. On . Monday, Panish played a song Jackson wrote for his children as a . montage of photos played during opening statements. He also read a . handwritten note from Jackson that his mother framed and has hanging on . her wall. 'The only way . you can assess damages, is to know what they had,' Panish said before . reading the letter and playing 'You Are My Life.' Katherine . Jackson dabbed her eyes with a tissue. On Tuesday, she left the . courtroom while the paramedic described her son's condition on the day . he died. It may be several days before jurors get another look at Jackson's softer side. Family: The late Michael Jackson's brother Randy Jackson arrives at court on the second day of the trial pitting Katherine Jackson, mother of the late singer Michael, against concert promoters AEG Live . The . trial will also feature testimony on Jackson's troubled finances, with . debts that reached nearly $400 million by the time he died. AEG contends the debts made him desperate to have a successful concert series. 'The . private Michael Jackson was like a lot of American in the 2000s, . spending a lot more than he was making,' Putnam told the jury after . describing the singer's lavish Neverland Ranch, his art collection and . other spending. Many other private moments from the singer's life will be exposed as the case progresses over the next several months, with witnesses expected to testify about secret medical treatments, lavish spending and tender moments spent with his mother and children.","Detective Orlando Mertinez testified that concert promoter AEG Live paid Conrad Murray $150,00 a month to care for Jackson ."

Media mogul Alexander Lebedev faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of politically-motivated hooliganism . Russian president Vladimir Putin wants Alexander Lebedev 'punished' claimed a witness in the media magnate's trial today. The tycoon faces up to five years in a grim Russian prison if convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by political hatred' for hitting a property tycoon in a television talk show 20 months ago. The suggestion that Putin was seeking harsh treatment for Lebedev - whose family own the Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, and who controls a Russian investigative newspaper - came on a day of angry, heated exchanges in a Moscow court. 'I remember Putin said on air that it is hooliganism, it must be punished,' so-called expert witness Sergei Komskov, an academic, told the court. 'I can't agree more. If, yet again, such action is not punished, it means Russia is going to hell.' The reference to Putin is highly significant because critics claim that by labelling the fracas between Lebedev and Polonsky as 'hooliganism', the Russian president - speaking three days after the incident - was discreetly issuing an order that legal action should be taken against the media owner with whom he once served as a KGB spy. The Kremlin has denied interfering in court cases and his only known public comment on the incident does not directly demand punishment for Lebedev. Komkov also insisted Lebedev struck mogul Sergei Polonsky, 40, with 'three punches'. This is disputed by the defence which claims the media owner pushed Polonsky. If the court finds there were indeed . three strikes, and that they were based on Lebedev's 'political hatred' of Polonsky, it would open the way for the judge to impose a lengthy . jail term under Russian law. Charge: Alexander Lebedev is accused of politically-motivated 'hooliganism' after punching Sergei Polonsky on Russian television . 'There were three punches,' said Komkov, who claimed he was a 'culturalogist' and is Vice-President of the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Co-operation among the Peoples of the World. 'Some minutes before the physical attack I noticed Lebedev massaging his fingers. It is normally done when the fighter has already decided to attack,' he claimed. Lebedev's team disputed Komkov's status as an 'expert' or his right to give evidence, claiming he had no proof of a string of academic qualifications he claimed to hold. They accused him of 'lying to the court' and last night Lebedev alleged that Komkov last year sought to launch a police probe against him. If true, the judge said it could nullify Komkov's evidence. It was claimed in court today Vladimir Putin is seeking harsh treatment for Alexander Lebedev and wants him 'punished' He did not directly witness the alleged punches but saw the show on TV. At one point today Lebedev's lawyer Genri Reznik claimed 'the trial is turning into a farce' and the judge responded  'I have started thinking so too', though it was unclear to what he was referring. A succession of witnesses have failed to turn up at the trial to give evidence against Lebedev amid signs of bungling by the prosecutors. In a positive move for 53 year old Lebedev, the judge refused to accept written evidence from Polonsky because it was not certified by the Russian consul in Cambodia where he is on bail for allegedly assaulting and kidnapping a group of  sailors. Another Lebedev lawyer, Yuri Zak, said Polonsky must be made to appear in person at the trial, and raised doubts over whether he is, in fact, in Cambodia, as he informed the court. 'His testimony is needed in order to investigate the truth,' said Zak. 'Lebedev is accused of  hooliganism based on political hatred. It is still not clear at all what political disagreement we are talking about all the time. 'Only Polonsky can explain the gist of this political hatred, when it began and what it was about, this is why we demand to make him come to Russia and take part.' On trial: Alexander Lebedev, right, talks to his lawyer Genri Reznik, centre, alongside his wife Elena Perminova, left, during a break in proceedings . He warned Lebedev's rights to a fair trial would be jeopardised if he could not question is accuser. Putin's only known quote on the subject does not call for Lebedev to be punished but states:  'They are punching each other in the ears. Hooliganism. Imagine how they fight for money. They can gnaw each other's throats.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Alexander Lebedev on trial for politically-motivated hooliganism .

Insight: Sharon Langert says that some Jewish women tell their husbands not to touch them so their make-up stays fresh during Shabbat . Every Friday at sundown, Orthodox Jewish women can not apply make-up for 24 hours to comply with Sabbath laws, which state 'creative work' is forbidden. As a result, those who refuse to go 'au naturel' have come up with nifty tricks to keep their cosmetics in place, from penciling eyes with a permanent Sharpie . pen, to 'fixing' foundation with hairspray. Revealing other tried-and-tested methods, Sharon Langert, 44, from Lakewood, New Jersey, told the New York Post: 'I know some women who sip their . soup with a straw, so it won’t ruin their makeup . . . [others] tell their husbands not to touch them.' The mother-of-five who runs Fashion-isha, a style website for modest Jewish woman, said that over the years she has come to terms with the fact that on Saturday, she 'won’t look the same as during the week.' She said that the weekly ritual is particularly hard on people with bad skin who rely on foundation or concealer to cover-up blemishes. 'It . affects their self-esteem,' she explained. While there are long-lasting cosmetics on the market, the results don't always match the claims on the label. Earlier this month, an Orthodox Jewish woman from upstate New York sued make-up giant Lancome on the grounds that its Teint . Idole Ultra 24H foundation, which promises '24-hour wear for divine, . lasting perfection,' 'faded significantly' overnight. Rorie Weisberg had applied the $45 foundation on Friday evening in order to test its 24-hour performance in the run-up to her son's June bar mitzvah, set to take place on a Saturday during the Shabbat. But she was disappointed with the results. Meanwhile Amy Goodman Gross, 27, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, struggles to find lipsticks that stick. 'When I was single, I would literally . use like a whole pound of gel and mousse in my hair to make it last for . Shabbat' To ensure that her rouge stays on for as long as possible she layers it up and doesn't 'eat anything with . oil that can take it off.' Others go to more extreme measures to maintain their polished guise. Mimi Hecht, 27, a style . blogger and mother of two from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, admits that she once raided her stationary pot and used a black Sharpie pen as eyeliner to get her through a . two-day religious holiday. Mimi's 24-year-old sister, Maddy Borch, from . the nearby Flatbush area, said that she sprays hairspray over her eyes and cheeks to keep things 'set' and looking fresh. 'I’ve . been doing it for the past year - it really works. My make-up can stay . on for three days!' she exclaimed. Tradition: Every Friday at sundown Orthodox Jewish women must refrain from applying make-up for 24 hours to comply with Sabbath laws (Shabbat in Hebrew) which state 'creative work' is forbidden (stock picture) Ruti Horn, 20, from Midwood, Brooklyn, noted that her hair is the biggest concern and her mother taught her an unconventional trick to keep it frizz-free during the night. '[She] would tell me to sleep with my hair in a sock, so that it stays and I wouldn’t have to worry about touching it up with an iron the next day,' she revealed. Ms Hecht said that when she was younger she would use 'a whole pound of gel and mousse' in her hair to make it last for Shabbat. Elana Barkats, 27, from New York, who offers make-up advice to Jewish women, says that these DIY beautifying tips can also be useful people outside the faith. 'I think our knowledge would benefit a . lot of people; [who] want to [put make-up on] and be done with it, and . not have to reapply.' Some Orthodox Jewish rabbis permit the . use of specially formulated cosmetics that they believe do not violate . Jewish laws and some companies including ShainDee and Mary Kay specialize in such products. These goods are entirely powder-based and do not attach to the skin. Therefore they do not fall into the forbidden categories of 'dyeing' or 'smoothing'.","Every Friday at sundown, Orthodox Jewish women are forbidden from applying make-up for 24 hours to comply with religious laws ."

The criminal investigation into the alleged attempts to smear the former Tory chief whip has widened after the Independent Police Complaints Commission received fresh information. Ten officers from four forces are being investigated by the watchdog. At least 10 police officers are suspected of discrediting former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, left, who was accused of calling Downing Street guards 'plebs', pictured right an officer not implicated in the investigation .

Refusal: Stephanie Kercher, pictured in 2011, has said her family are not interested in what Amanda Knox has to say in her book . It is one of the most keenly anticipated books of the decade. But Amanda Knox’s million-dollar memoir isn’t to everyone’s taste - the Kercher family have made it clear that they at least will not be reading it. ‘We're not interested in this book, just like we weren't interested in the others about the case, and we won't read it,' Meredith’s sister Stephanie Kercher said, after its US release yesterday. She added: ‘Meredith is the victim in this tragic case.’ Knox served four years in an Italian jail for the 2007 murder of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Perugia. She and former boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito were freed on appeal in 2011, but last month Italy’s highest court dramatically ruled the pair must face retrial. Her memoir Waiting to be Heard, for which Knox was reportedly paid a 2 million pound advance, was published today in the US although plans to sell it in the UK were shelved after its publisher Harper Collins took legal advice. While a new trial is expected to take place by the summer in Florence, US authorities could invoke the principle of double-jeopardy, arguing that a person cannot be convicted of the same offence twice, and so refuse to extradite Knox back to Italy. Stephanie Kercher, the sister of the victim, released a statement in Italian through the family's lawyers Francesco Maresca and Serena Perna in Italy late on Tuesday after excerpts of Miss Knox's first US TV interview were released to publicise the release of her book, Waiting to Be Heard. She also emphasised that Miss Knox could be found guilty in the new trial. She said: ‘The Italian legal system still has an appeal procedure under way and so the case is returning to a new court hearing. The sentence can still be overturned. ‘I have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life. Her story: In pre-interviews ahead of the release of 'Waiting to be Heard', Amanda Knox has said she wants the Kercher family top read her memoirs . Killed: Knox spent four years in jail for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, in Perugia, Italy, November 2007 . ‘Something Meredith will never have and something we can never share with her. Meredith is the victim in this tragic case.’ Knox had earlier expressed the desire that Meredith’s parents would read the book, something she hoped would give her some ‘closure’. ‘The ideal situation in my mind is that they could show me Meredith's grave,' she told USA Today. ‘I wasn't allowed to grieve, either, and that would mean a lot to me’. ‘I really want to go see her grave,"" repeated Miss Knox, who spent four years in prison before being acquitted. 'And right now I don't feel I have the right to without her family's permission.’ Knox likened her ordeal to being forced to crawl through a 'field of barbed wire' to reach the 'same side' as the Kerchers. In another interview, she told ABC News that she wrote the book to respond in full to accusations that meant ‘for all intents and purposes I was a murderer’. ‘I want the truth to come out. I'd like to be reconsidered as a person,' she said. 'I was in the courtroom when they were calling me a devil. ‘It's one thing to be called certain things in the media, but it's another to be sitting in a courtroom, fighting for your life, while people are calling you a devil.’","Knox said she hopes the family of Meredith Kercher read her book .

Proposals: Police chiefs are looking to ban the naming of criminal suspects under recommendations made by Lord Justice Leveson . Fears were growing last night that a draconian crackdown on the public’s right to know who the police are arresting was close to being finalised. Police chiefs are looking to ban the Press and public from being told the identity of a crime suspect who has been arrested. The Association of Chief Police Officers is drawing up the plans as it considers implementing a recommendation by Lord Justice Leveson in which all police forces would be banned from confirming the names of suspects to journalists. Critics yesterday called the plan an assault on open justice and said it threatened to turn Britain into a ‘banana republic’. They suggested that such a move could, in theory, lead to people being arrested and locked up in secret as is the case in brutal totalitarian regimes. The plan for ‘secret arrests’ is being opposed by the Law Commission, the Government’s own adviser on law reform. It believes that it is in the interests of justice that the police release the names of everyone who is arrested, except in very exceptional circumstances. It argues that there are cases of clear public interest in which arrests should be reported, and it opposes a blanket ban on releasing names. Trevor Sterling, the lawyer representing Jimmy Savile’s victims, said the publication of a suspect’s name helps to encourage other potential victims to come forward. ‘It is difficult to strike a balance, but if someone like Savile’s name is not published, victims of sexual abuse would not have the confidence to come forward,’ he said. Padraig Reidy, of Index On Censorship, a civil liberties organisation, said: ‘You can very quickly find yourself in a situation where you have secret arrests. We have a concept of open justice. ‘What is being proposed is very scary . because if you do not know who has been arrested or why, people can be . taken off the streets without anyone knowing and the police would not be . accountable or properly scrutinised. ‘This sort of thing happens in other . countries. People are arrested, they disappear and no one ever knows . why.’ Under current arrangements, police release basic details of a . person arrested. In some cases police will confirm a name to . journalists, but this practice varies from force to force. Some forces have effectively introduced the new practice in the aftermath of Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations. It has led to a situation where a . well-known celebrity arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the . investigation into the Savile scandal, cannot be named by the media, . although he has been widely identified on the internet. The 83-year-old was arrested on March . 28 in Berkshire on suspicion of sexual offences, but the Metropolitan . Police refused to release his name to the Press. By . contrast, the names of other suspects accused of historical sexual . offences have been published in the Press after their names were . confirmed by other forces or by lawyers. Arrest secrecy: A lawyer representing Jimmy Savile's victims said naming criminal suspects encourages other victims to come forward . Members of the Law Commission and ACPO will meet in the coming weeks in an attempt to find common ground. Yesterday Law Commissioner David Ormerod, QC, said: ‘It is imperative that we have confidence that our legal process is transparent. ‘In drafting our provisional proposals, we considered freedom of expression under the Human Rights Act, which covers the Press’s right to report and the public’s right to know. ‘Clearly this has to be balanced with an individual’s right to privacy. But it is not hard to imagine cases of clear public interest in which arrests should be reported.’ Andy Trotter, chief constable of British Transport Police and the lead officer on media policy for ACPO, disagrees with the Law Commission’s position because it does not take account of the circumstances of a suspect whose reputation was damaged by identification but who was later found to be innocent. He said: ‘It is not correct to say police are looking to keep arrests secret, but rather protect the public in line with Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations. ‘A member of the public could be arrested and then have no further action taken against them. ‘An arrest does not mean someone is guilty and their release might not achieve the same publicity. ‘There will most likely be exceptions to this in the interests of justice and to prevent and detect crime. We are still in the process of drafting guidance and we are still talking to a range of parties and any decision will have to be approved with the College of Policing.’ Campaigner: Willy Moy, head of Full Fact, was accused of giving false evidence to the Leveson Inquiry . A staunch supporter of Press regulation gave false evidence on oath to the Leveson Inquiry, it was claimed yesterday. Will Moy, head of Full Fact, a group campaigning against ‘inaccuracy in the media’, told Lord Justice Leveson that his organisation was ‘constituted as a charity, and in the process of registering as a charity’. He went on to say it operated ‘under a statutory public benefit obligation’. Lord Justice Leveson drew extensively on Full Fact’s evidence in his report, calling its work ‘extremely important’. He wrote: ‘I am pleased to recognise that Full Fact can claim to be one of the organisations that does seek to “guard the guardians”.’ Its submissions went to the ‘very core of what I’ve had to consider’. However, seven months before Mr Moy testified, Full Fact had been refused registration as a charity, according to the Sunday Telegraph. In July 2011 a Charity Tribunal judge heard that Full Fact lacked the ‘requisite objectivity’ and was not ‘established for the public benefit’, it was said. The judge denied the organisation charitable status, saying it was too political. Mr Moy, 29, is also a director of Hacked Off, a pressure group leading the campaign for Press regulation. Full Fact claims to specialise in exposing journalists who it says are ‘playing tricks with the truth’. It says the media’s ‘inaccuracy’ proves that the Press must ‘be subject to additional constraints’. However Peter Lilley, the Tory MP and former Cabinet minister, who opposes state-backed Press regulation, said: ‘They do not seem to hold themselves to the standards they demand for others.’ Mr Moy said: ‘The position we gave is correct. I don’t think we misled Lord Justice Leveson and I don’t think he will have felt misled.’ He added that Full Fact had not given up trying to register as a charity.","Lawyer representing Jimmy Savile victims said publishing the name of suspects encourages other potential victims to come forward .

"By . Helen Pow and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 30 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:25 EST, 1 May 2013 . One of five boyhood friends severely injured while watching the Boston Marathon has spoken out about the crippling wounds he sustained in the April 15 bomb attack. Jarrod Clowery is expected to recover from his wounds after doctors pulled 27 nails, BBs and other pieces of shrapnel out of his body. The bomb blast shredded his hands, badly injured his legs and burned much of his body. After the blast, he said he looked down at his hands and quickly looked away. 'It was too much to look at,' he said today during a press conference at Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital. He then looked down at his legs, and quickly turned his gaze away from them, too. 'I didn’t want to look at those anymore, either,' he said. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Jarrod Clowery is recovering after doctors pulled 27 pieces of shrapnel, including nails and BBs from his body after the Boston Marathon bombings . Banding together: Mr Clowery vowed to leave the hospital before his three friends who lost legs and do everything he could to help them return to a normal life . Bombing: Jarrod Clowery, center, was pictured in the aftermath of the blasts . As badly injured as Mr Clowery was, some of his friends came away far worse. Childhood buddies Paul and JP Norden - both brothers - and Marc Fucarile all lost legs when the second device exploded. His friend James 'Bim' Costello was also badly injured. Three people were killed in the twin attacks near the finish line of the marathon and 264 others were badly injured. About ten victims lost limbs in the attack. Mr Clowery, a 35-year-old carpenter from Stoneham, Massachusetts, still cannot walk and will likely have to go back into surgery for doctors to remove some of the remaining 20 pieces of shrapnel in his body. He says he has one goal now - to get home before his friends who lost their legs and do whatever he can to help them return to normal life. 'Three of my friends lost limbs, so getting back home, I’m gonna be back there before them, so the first thing I’m gonna do is figure out how to be there for them. As far as something normal, or a vacation, I’d like to talk with my friends about that.… My new job is to be with them, or to be there for them,' he said. The five friends were caught in the second blast. When the first bomb went off near the Boston Marathon finish line, four of the friends huddled down for cover, not knowing the second bomb was right next to them. Grateful: Jarrod Clowery said the doctors and nurses at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston worked together more efficiently than 'any play drive Tom Brady every put together' for the New England Patriots . Mr Clowery said 'it all went silent' after he was caught in the bomb blast . Mr Clowery was jumping over a race barricade and was shouting at his girlfriend to do the same when the second bomb went off. '""Jackie, get your butt in the..."" - boom,' Mr Clowery remembers shouting. 'And I just remember feeling engulfed.... Just like the movies, all the sound went away.' The five friends have already made commitments to stick together as they recover from the horrific injuries. Two weeks and numerous surgeries later, the friends' health is improving but the tight bond, cemented through years of fishing trips and poker games - and just hanging out like they were that Monday - is what is helping them pull through. 'What's up, kid?' Clowery, 35, asked Paul Norden, 31, on a recent afternoon. Norden is in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recovering from having his right left amputated. Clowery is being treated for burns at Brigham and Women's Hospital, but another friend pushed him, still dressed in his hospital gown, the two blocks so he could visit his pal, The Boston Globe reported. Facing it together: J.P. Norden, right, and long-time pal Jarrod Clowery, left, are recovering from their injuries . Friends: Paul Norden, pictured center, is visited by pals including Mike Jefferson, far right, who was running in the marathon . Life-changing: J.P., 33, pictured left, is at Brigham and Women's recovering from his amputation while Paul, picture right with Jarrod Clowery, is at Beth Israel . 'Yeah, dude, I escaped,' he said. 'I had to see you. I had to come.' Paul's older brother, J.P., 33, is just two doors down from Clowery at Brigham and Women's recovering from his own amputation while Fucarile is at Massachusetts General hospital. Mike Jefferson, the school buddy they came to cheer on at the marathon, was the only one spared. Feeling guilty he dragged his pals along that fateful day, he now keeps watch over them, sleeping outside Paul Norden's hospital room in case he needs anything. 'He blames himself,' Norden told the Boston Globe. 'But I told him: It's not your fault. That bridge has passed. We have to get to a new place.' Lost legs: Both J.P. Norden and Marc Fucarile, pictured left and center, lost legs in the blasts while James 'Bim' Costello, right, suffered burns and shrapnel injuries . Fundraiser: The Nordens' mom Liz, pictured center, is trying to raise funds for her boys' treatment . The men, who met at elementary school or youth clubs in the small Massachusetts town of Stoneham, grew up at each others' houses, though the Norden brothers' mom, Liz, who they all called 'Ma,' tended to play host. They all found jobs in the construction industry, but the past winter had a been a brutal one with work slowing and paychecks stretching thin, according to the Globe. Now they face months of rehabilitation and the Norden brothers and Fucarile must learn to walk again using prosthetic legs. And it's likely the laborers will need to find new careers. Close: Clowery, left, and the brothers including Paul, right, are very close . Old time: J.P. Norden, left, Marc Fucarile, right, and the other men have been friends for years . Paul Norden is set to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital this week but his main concern is that his brother, who is not yet ready to leave the Brigham, ends up at the same one.

The number of thefts carried out by criminals on bicycles has tripled in the past two years, figures show. Statistics from Scotland Yard show there were 3,754 reported snatchings in the capital last year, up from 1,214 thefts in 2010. All these crimes specifically relate to snatches by thieves riding bicycles. Recent victims include the wife of Nick Mason, the Pink Floyd drummer, who was walking her two Labradors, Linka and Layla, on Hampstead Heath when a man prised her iPhone from her hand as he rode past on a bicycle. Scroll down for video . A man on the pavement stands casually texting someone as a bike can be seen approaching towards him . Speedy grab: In just a few seconds a man on a bike zooms past him snatching his phone out of his hands . Annette Mason, 52, said that she is afraid to use her mobile phone in public after being mugged last December. Although the figures are for London, the head of the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit said an increased use of smart phones by pedestrians across the country has made them targets. He said: ‘If somebody’s on a pushbike riding down the pavement or the road and they see someone with a mobile phone or a handbag, they can quickly catch it and then get away very, very quickly. ‘They can go down alleyways, they can go in between tower blocks, it’s a very quick way of getting away from the scene of the crime.’ The figures also revealed the number of thefts carried out on mopeds rose by more than 80per cent in the second half of 2012, compared to the year before. There were 394 reported crimes from July to the end of December, up from 213 thefts over the same period in 2011. Moving off: The criminal on the bike zooms into the distance while the victim is stunned by the event . Primary school teacher Emily Mottram, 28, had just stepped off a bus in Islington, north London, when her phone was snatched out of her hands by a cyclist riding on the pavement. She said: ‘It was dark, there was no-one around that I knew. I just thought what would have happened if it had been even later and I wasn’t stepping off a bus?’ She said the incident had made her more aware of the threat. ‘If someone’s coming close to me I’m instantly quite nervous and I never used to really have that awareness,’ she added. ‘Maybe it’s a good thing. I’m a lot more aware of what’s going on around me but it’s also made me feel concerned about having any possessions.’ Rachel Griffin, director of personal safety charity the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said the increased number of bike lanes alongside pavements had made people vulnerable to the threat of such attacks. She said: ‘Increasingly footpaths are being shared with bike lanes, so it’s important to be aware that when you’re walking along, you might be on the pavement, but there could be a bicycle either coming up towards you or behind you. ‘We advise people in a shared space with a bike lane to hold their valuables, or their bag in particular, on the opposite side to that which the bicycles are on.’ Phone taken: The victim opens his arms out wide in disgust as he realises what just happened .

A shark caught on a fishing line before being horrifically clubbed over the head and killed has been captured on video revealing the brutal reality of what is happening to global shark populations. As the shark is reeled out of the water its catcher picks up a large bat and repeatedly strikes it with blows across the head until it can be pulled on board and tossed onto a pile of other dead sharks. The shocking footage is mixed with clips from around the world showing health and beauty and food products made using parts of sharks being sold in markets and stores. Scroll down for video . Video released by Eli Martinez and Jason Perryman shows shocking scenes of sharks being clubbed to death . Sharks are caught on a fishing lines before being horrifically clubbed and thrown on a pile on board the boat . Eli Martinez, editor of Shark Diver Magazine, who shot the video with friend Jason Perryman, has released the footage in an attempt to rally support for the misunderstood creatures. He said: ‘Sharks are in trouble - global populations are getting devastated commercially. ‘The whole shark conservation focus has been on the shark finning industry which is horrible enough but the reality is there is a huge demand for shark products all over the world. ‘I made this video to . share the jaws and teeth being sold in tourist shops, their oil and . cartilage used for pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies, meat sold in . the local markets and as fertilizers and dog food, their skins sold for . fashion - the list goes on. ‘We . had all this footage from travels to places like the Baja coast in . Mexico and South Texas of our run ins with fishermen and after watching . it all a story started forming in my head. Footage of fishermen working on the Baja coast and in Mexico shows the brutal treatment of sharks . The future for sharks looks uncertain if the rate they are being harvested fails to slow according to Eli Martinez . ‘This . story had to be told - photos just don't really impact the way video . does. I had to share what was really happening to our shark populations. If the world doesn't know it's happening then there is nothing to get . up in arms about. ‘I hope . people are shocked that this is happening and feel empathy I really do. It's hard to care for sharks because they have such a bad reputation. ‘But . the reality is sharks are not the monsters people believe them to be . they are beautiful and amazing creatures who are highly misunderstood. ‘Most . people don't know we have over 400 species of sharks in our oceans, . they believe a shark is a shark, and can't really tell one species from . the other. Eli Martinez said he finds the footage extremely painful because sharks are not just animals, but friends to him . The sharks are killed for their meat and to make squaline from their oil which is used in cosmetic products . Sharks only give birth every other year so they are unable to breed as fast as they are being slaughtered for trade . ‘We need all our sharks as they help . keep the ocean clean and in balance and every shark has a job in our . ocean. For example, great whites help control the seal populations, . tiger sharks help control the turtle populations, hammerheads help . control the stingray populations and so on. ‘I spend a lot of time swimming with and interacting with sharks so they are more than just animals to me they are friends. ‘For . me it's extremely painful to see what's happening. It makes me feel . useless because it's happening every day, it's happening right now. Sharks are killed for their meat, which is often cooked and eaten with fries in Australia . Shark teeth are sold commercially as tourist items and demand for such products fuels the industry of shark killing . ‘And unless we change how we feel . about these animals and do something to help it will continue to happen . until there are none left to care about.’ American Mr Martinez admits the future for sharks looks uncertain if the rate they are . being harvested fails to slow - and claims to be certain some species . will collapse commercially in the near future. He . added: ‘Sharks just don't breed fast enough to keep up with our . commercial demands. By nature's design sharks are only giving birth . every other year and in some species sometimes only two pups. ‘Commercial . fishermen don't take that into consideration when harvesting sharks, . they have yearly quotas they have to meet, and they will fish for them . until there is nothing left to fish. ‘Sharks don't have a chance against our technology, our boats and the amount of people targeting them.’ Shark products are sold as souvenirs in tourist areas which increases the demand for shark fishing . Video footage shows the shark fins are laid out on the shore after they have been killed by fishermen at sea . However it is not a fight Mr Martinez has given up on yet and insists people can still help save sharks by being more careful in what they buy. He said: ‘The first thing is to stop buying shark products period. No shark tooth necklaces unless from a prehistoric shark, no shark steaks or imitation crab which is often made from shark. ‘Fish and chips in Australia is often made from shark and people should stay away from makeup that does not use synthetic squaline - real squaline is made from shark oil. ‘There are also bigger shark movements going on in the world that NGO's are out there working on who always need support from the public to make their efforts a reality.’","Footage shows how sharks are killed brutally with a bat .

A terror gang inspired by Al Qaeda was jailed for a total of 44 years yesterday for plotting to blow up a TA base with a bomb strapped to a toy car. The four-strong cell also discussed attacking MI5, the US Air Force, English Defence League and their local shopping centre. They took ideas from the Al Qaeda-produced magazine Inspire which is being investigated by police hunting the Boston Marathon bombers. Jailed: Zahid Iqbal, left, and Mohammed Sharfaraz Ahmed, right, have each been sentenced to at least 11 years and 3 months in prison . Ringleader Zahid Iqbal, 31, and his cohorts downloaded and read the instructions on using household items to make bombs only four days before concocting the model car plan. Iqbal, a married father of two, helped jihadists go to Pakistan for terror training through an Al Qaeda contact dubbed ‘Modern Sleeve’ by security forces. Agents bugged his car and overheard him suggest driving a remote-controlled car rigged with explosives under the gates of the Territorial Army base in Luton. The men’s homes in the town were raided days before the tenth anniversary of the Al Qaeda terror attacks of September 2001. After being arrested last April in a major operation by the police and security services, they admitted a joint charge of preparing for terrorism. Mr Justice Wilkie QC jailed Iqbal and Mohammed Sharfaraz Ahmed, 25, for 16 years and three months each. Umar Arshad, 24, was sentenced to six years and nine months, and Syed Hussain, 22, to five years and three months. The four men showed little emotion as they were led from the dock at Woolwich Crown Court in south-east London. The judge said Iqbal and Ahmed should serve at least 11 years and three months, more than half their sentences, before being considered for release because they posed a significant danger to the public. Accomplices: Umar Arshad, left, and Syed Farhan Hussain were also involved with the terror plot . Despite claims to have rejected violent extremism, both had downloaded and stored terrorist literature even when they knew they were being watched, he added. Mr Justice Wilkie said: ‘After their houses had been searched, and they were obviously under serious suspicion, they continued to access material consistent with the mindset which informed their previous preparatory activities. 'It persuades me that they continue to be dangerous to such a degree that I should exercise my discretion to pass an extended sentence. ‘There is a persistent commitment to terrorist activities in a number of different ways over a  significant period of time. ‘There was a willingness to take particular steps to obtain terrorist training abroad, which marks them as particularly dangerous. ‘Each of the defendants had access to and did access many documents espousing violent Jihad. 'Included in those documents was a publication known as Inspire, a periodical produced by Al Qaeda.’ Target: This Territorial Army base in Luton was the subject of their terror plans . In the raids on their homes, police seized a huge hoard of extremist literature, 14 laptops, other electronic storage devices and more than 150 mobile phones. Books they found included 39 Ways To Support Jihad, 21 Techniques Of Silent Killing and The Explosives Course 2. Iqbal originally planned to send extremists abroad but turned to UK targets after losing contact with his handler in Pakistan. Ahmed led several military-style training trips to Snowdonia and Brecon Beacons. He and fellow extremists were spotted marching and jogging in formation while using logs as mock weapons. Ahmed suggested bungee jumping, sky diving, horse riding, and paragliding as ‘good jihad training’ to overcome his fear of heights, the court heard. Trial: The jail sentences were announced at Woolwich Crown Court in South-East London . After the case, Stuart Osborne, head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism unit, said the sentences will ensure ‘the public are safer’. He added: ‘More than one travelled to Pakistan to carry out  terrorist training. 'They took advantage of practical information from Inspire and other terrorist publications which have the ultimate aim of encouraging attacks. ‘The actions and intentions of these men starkly demonstrate what we have repeatedly said – that terrorists live among us while they carry out their plans.’ Deborah Walsh, deputy head of counter terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, said the case ‘highlights the continued threat posed by UK-based terrorists and the complex web of international support that encourages their  dangerous and destructive plans’.","Four extremists from Luton plotted attack on military building with toy car .

Five people have been arrested in the robbery of more than $4million in jewelry, watches and diamonds from a Connecticut store in an elaborate heist that began with the kidnapping of store employees more than 40 miles away, federal authorities said on Thursday. The defendants are four men from Pennsylvania and another from New York City who conducted extensive planning, including surveillance of the victims and a practice run a week before the crime, according to an FBI affidavit. A group of men wearing masks and gloves broke into the apartment in Meriden on April 11, and bound and gagged four people, including the manager and another employee of a Lenox Jewelry store in Fairfield. Caught: Two of the alleged suspects are seen entering the Lenox Jewelers store in Fairfield, Connecticut in this surveillance video . Heist: More than $4million in jewelry was taken from the Lenox Jewelers store in the daring robbery . The two employees were then taken at gunpoint in the manager's BMW and driven about 40 miles to the store, where they were forced to open the door and to use their access codes to open the safe, authorities said. One of the masked men told the store manager they had been following them for months, the FBI affidavit said, and that he 'drove really fast.' Among the defendants is 31-year-old Timothy Forbes, who was arrested at his home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on May 8 on allegations he was involved in a July 2012 jewelry store robbery in York. Authorities were led to the suspects with the help of cell phone records, News 12 Connecticut reported. Prep: Authorities say that the suspects planned the robbery for months . He had $13,100 in $100 bills and a Connecticut lottery ticket purchased in March, the FBI said. He remained in custody Thursday. The other defendants are William Davis, 25, and Jeffrey Houston, both of Allentown; Kasam Hennix, 39, of Easton, Pennsylvania; and Christopher Gay, 27, of the Bronx. Houston and Gay made a federal court appearance in Bridgeport while Davis and Hennix appeared before a judge in Allentown. All four were ordered detained. Each of the defendants is charged with kidnapping, robbery and use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Gone: Each of the defendants is charged with kidnapping, robbery and use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence . Attorneys for Houston and Gay did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. It wasn't clear who was representing the other defendants. 'Fortunately these individuals were arrested before committing similar crimes that place the lives of innocent persons at risk,' U.S. Marshal Joseph Faughnan said. The victims reported they were restrained in the back of the store during the robbery. They were able to free themselves and call police after the thieves took off in their car. The BMW was found in Fairfield the next day. The victims told authorities the robbers appeared to communicate with cellphones or walkie-talkies. The two non-employees held in Meriden were released one minute after the two suspects left the Fairfield jewelry store, police said.","Five people from Pennsylvania and New York arrested in relation to the 'well-planned' crime .

She was airlifted to hospital, where doctors learned she had suffered a traumatic brain injury, a . broken femur, three broken ribs, a collapsed lung and damage to her foot . that cost her four toes. But amid losing their beloved mother . and wife, the Nevil family has pulled through to show amazing . determination, buoyed by communities in Texas and Tennessee. Throughout his daughter's inspiring recovery, Steve Nevil father has been documenting her progress on a Facebook group, Pray for the Nevils, which now has more than 300,000 followers. He has reported on her numerous surgeries and physical therapy sessions at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, uploading videos and photos of her struggles and her milestones. She . will now have outpatient therapy for more than six hours a day, four . days a week, and will probably need it for several months, The . Tennessean reported.

For now, she will be taught by her . father and tutors until she is tested in summer to see whether she can . return to school or if she will need to attend a special program. Over her recovery, Steve Nevil, 41, . has shared videos of her sitting up unassisted for the first time, . enjoying a few sips of a cherry-flavoured slushie and opening a .

In one upbeat post, he describes her drinking from the slushie and how everyone in the room at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth anxiously waited for her to react. 'It was kind of an . awkward 10-15 seconds,' he wrote on a video. 'The room was dead silent as we were hoping the . drink would go down fine without incident. 'Then in a very soft, subtle . & sweet voice we hear - ""man, that is really good."" We all cracked . up laughing and exhaled a sigh of relief! I say YouHooo.' Most recently, he has uploaded signs of her counting down the days until she can leave hospital. Fighter: Lauren suffered a brain injury, a broken femur, broken ribs, a collapsed lung and lost four toes . Best care: She was transported to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth in December . He has also written entries from . his daughter's point of view, painting an emotional picture of her . struggles and excitement at her progress. 'As . of last night, daddy was able to use a ""real"" toothbrush and ""training"" toothpaste (that is okay to swallow),' he wrote on January 26 in his . daughter's voice. 'It was so amazing how the smallest things makes the . biggest difference & makes me feel so much better at that particular . time.' In response to the entries, friends, relatives and strangers have posted their own comments of well-wishes and encouragement to the family. Earlier . this year, they held a fundraiser inspired by Lauren's nickname - Lolo . Palooza - and 550 people helped raise $24,000 at the Grease Monkey in . Arlington. Love: In total, she spent 161 days in hospital, where her younger brother and father visited daily . Upbeat: After losing her toes, she has been fitted with an orthopedic foot but also uses a wheelchair . Smiling: The Nevils had only just moved to the area but said the community has rallied around them . 'I hope to keep this going for years . to come because Lauren will need help for a long period of time to heal . with her injuries,' said organizer and family friend MK Davis. Friends have also helped organize fundraising walks in Dallas-Fort Worth and Franklin, where the family has become well known and well-liked. 'You instantly felt like you'd known them . your entire life,' Mark Moorman, a friend of the family, told . ABC. 'They were very welcoming, warm, . loving people.' Katy Nevil's brother, Jimmy Brimson, said the family is encouraged and supported by the community. 'It's mind-blowing to see all of the . cards and notes from people not just in the U.S. but from all over the . world,' he said. 'It's easy to be cynical in today's world, but this . outpouring of love, prayers and support makes you realise that there are . still a whole lot of good people in this world.' Looking forward: Steve said he is now focused on his daughter's recovery and making sure his son does not grow up too quickly following their family's tragedy . Tragic: An alleged drunk driver hit the family's car, forcing it into trees and Katy Nevil, 38, died instantly . Mr Nevil said he believes people have been so generous thanks to his wife's contagious positivity. 'Katy always, always, always, without . question, always helped whoever she could,' he said. 'I truly think that passion she had in her heart . is being reciprocated.' He added to the Star Telegram that he finds it ironic that he is doing so much writing on the Facebook group as his wife, a certified teacher, always handled business or correspondence. He said that he is unsure about his daughter's long-term prognosis, but he's staying positive - as his wife would wish. 'When I'm alone, it's easy to ask, ""Why me?""' he said.

Just one day after the judge declared a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on whether or not she should be executed, Bill Zervakos spoke of the difficulties they faced during the five-month-long trial. 'When I walked into that court room for the first time and looked at . the defendant - it is hard to put it into perspective, looking at that . young woman and thinking about the brutality of the crime. It doesn't wash,' he said. 'It is difficult to separate yourself from the emotions and personal side . of it.' Scroll down for video . Jury foreman: Bill Zervakos, left, has spoken of the shock he felt when seeing Jodi, right , when seeing her for the first time . WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW AT GOOD MORNING AMERICA . Speaking to Good Morning America, he admitted he did not think Jodi did herself any favors when she took the stand for 18 days because she had so many contradictory stories. The hardest part, he said, was having to sit six feet away from Travis Alexander's family while listening to all the horrific things that happened to him. 'Until you are face to face with someone who is going through that, you cannot put it into words,' he said. 'If you cannot feel that then you have no emotion, no soul. 'But we couldn't allow ourselves to be emotional and for that I am very proud of my jurors, they did a fantastic job of holding it together - though it was a different story when we got into the jury room. Speaking about Travis Alexander, he said: 'I am very sure in my own mind that Jodi was mentally and verbally abused by him. Is that an excuse? Of course not. Did it factor into the decision we made? It has to.' The next step in the lengthy trial will now come on July 18, when an entirely new jury panel is determined and tasked with delivering the final verdict in the case. In tears: Jodi Arias looked frightened before the jury's non-decision was handed down, but her composure did not change dramatically after she realized that she was not being sentenced to death . Heartbroken: Travis Alexander's relatives, including his sister Tanisha (right) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months . The scene in the Phoenix, Arizona, courtroom on Thursday afternoon - when the jury came back to the judge with their inability to agree - was not one of relief. Arias herself looked upset and began crying, though not necessarily tears of joy. Alexander's siblings, who have been a constant presence throughout and have all uprooted their lives in California to focus on the trial, were all crying as well. One female juror was at least sympathetic to them, and she was seen mouthing the word 'sorry' toward the Alexanders. Judge Sherry Stephens, who showed some tough love to the jury on Wednesday, was very complimentary to them yesterday. 'This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform some very difficult duties,' she said. Mistrial: Jody Arias reacts as the jury indicates it has not been able to reach a decision on the death penalty . The jury began deliberating Tuesday, and on Wednesday afternoon they told the Judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. She ordered the jurors . to go back and talk more until they came to a decision, but that was still not enough time as they came back later yesterday afternoon still at an impasse. The new jury will not have any power . to change her guilty conviction, and they will be solely tasked with . determining how she will 'pay' for the first degree murder. The . decision follows a trial that has staggered on for five months over the . 2008 slaying of Travis Alexander, Arias' on-again off-again boyfriend . who she killed in his home in 2008. She stabbed him nearly 30 times, . slit his throat, and shot him. Fearful: Arias was surrounded by her legal team, and her relatives were not in the room though they had been regularly fixtures at the trial through much of the five months . Even . for the most fastidious of court followers who have developed a sense . of who Arias is over the past five months of the trial, her behavior in . the past week has been confusing as she gave conflicting statements . about her desire thoughts on a possible death sentence. Immediately after her guilty verdict . was handed down two weeks ago, she granted a local news station an . interview where she said that she was 'in shock' and that she would . rather be given the death penalty as opposed to a life sentence in . prison. Speaking to the local Fox affiliate KSAZ, Arias said that she would 'prefer to die sooner than later.' ‘Longevity . runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural . life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably . live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward . to. 'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.' Waiting game: Now the next jury will be impaneled on July 18 and this second portion of the trial- where the jury needs to determine the punishment for Arias- will be done for a second time . Those . comments prompted courthouse officials to order that she be placed in a . psychological hold and on suicide watch, which inevitably delayed the . second portion of the sentencing- where jurors were forced to decide if . the murder was especially aggressive. During the ensuing testimony, called . the aggravation portion of the trial, jurors heard from both sides who . were able to call witnesses arguing that she should and shouldn't be . forced to die, respectively. When . she addressed the court in her own defense, she she pledged, if allowed . to live, to donate her hair to cancer patients and start a prison . recycling program. 'I have . made many public statements that I would prefer the death penalty to . life in prison,' Arias told jurors. In each of those cases, 'I lacked . perspective,' she said. 'Until . very recently I could not imagine standing before you all and asking . for you to give me life,' she said. 'But as I stand here now I cannot in . good conscience ask you to sentence me to death.'","The jury could not come to a unanimous decision about whether to execute Jodi Arias or to sentence her to life in prison .
They were the group that spent five months listening to graphic details about the 2008 murder of Travis Alexander .
Now a new jury must be called and they will be forced to decide what Jodi Arias' sentence should be for the premeditated murder .
The new jury will not be able to override the guilty verdict .

But Sweden is facing problems of its own after gangs of immigrants spent a fifth consecutive night rioting  in Stockholm. Officers are battling to keep the  capital under control after hundreds of cars were torched, a police station set alight and fire services kept from  a major blaze by a stone-throwing mob of youths. To make matters worse, rioting has now spread to Sweden’s two other major cities, Gothenburg and Malmo. Torched: Hundreds of cars like this Volvo have been set alight in Stockholm during the orgy of violence . The disturbances, which have lasted . longer than the riots in England in the summer of 2011, started last . week after police shot dead a foreign-born pensioner who threatened to . attack them with a machete. Left-wing activists came forward to accuse police of racism – a charge strongly denied by the Stockholm force. Growing unrest turned to violence . last  Sunday in a north-western suburb called Husby – where more than . 80  per cent of the residents are from overseas, mostly Turkey, Somalia . and the Middle East. Trouble then spread to some of the . city’s most deprived areas, shattering the country’s proud claim that it . is a template for a successful and ethnically diverse society. No end: Police force secure the area as firemen extinguish a blaze in a primary school in the Stockholm suburb of Kista as the riots continued for a fifth night . On fire: Firemen extinguish burning cars in the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby early on Thursday night as the fifth night's violence began . Documenting horror: Residents in Rinkeby photograph the burning cars, which were set on fire in a central part of the suburb north of Stockholm . On Thursday night there were 90 . separate blazes in the  capital. Thirty cars were torched and there were . eight arrests – mostly of people in their  early 20s. In earlier attacks, groups of up to . 100 rioters targeted schools, nurseries and shops – breaking windows and . setting buildings ablaze. In Skogas, south of Stockholm, . emergency services were kept from a fire in a restaurant when a gang of . youths pelted fire engines with rocks. And in nearby Ragsved a violent mob set fire to a police station – the second to come under attack in two days. Destruction: Friday morning's riots, which also saw a second primary school set on fire, resulted in several shops wrecked, multiple vehicle fires across the city fringes and stones thrown at police . Aftermath: The primary school was completely destroyed by the fire which is being treated by police as arson . Lars Bystrom, a Stockholm police . spokesman, said: ‘Such fires are mainly lit to lure  the police to the . scene, who are then attacked.’ He admitted officers have been forced . to change their tactics, saying: ‘Now if there is a small fire that is . not likely to spread, and there is no risk to life, we will send out a . patrol and keep an eye on it from a distance. ‘But we are not going to bring in the fire brigade unless it’s really dangerous.’ The attacks on emergency service . workers have led to private security companies telling employees to stay . at home, as mobs have started attacking anyone wearing a uniform. Several public transport routes have . also been cancelled after rioters started hurling petrol bombs at buses. Stockholm burning: A car is set ablaze in a suburb north of the Swedish capital last night . Chaos: Police have been under attack by large mobs, pelting them and fire services with bricks and heavy rocks, preventing them from putting out fires across the city's fringes . The Foreign Office and the US embassy have warned visitors to stay away . from certain suburbs. Government leaders have been stunned . by the ferocity of the violence in a country which has long been touted . as a paragon of social justice. For decades, supporters of . multiculturalism have pointed to  Sweden as a classic example of a . society which allows immigrants to continue practising their  own . culture while living peacefully alongside their host communities. Around 15 per cent of Sweden’s 9.5million inhabitants were born outside the country. The second largest group of . immigrants, after the Finns, are Iraqis – numbering more than 125,000. Former Yugoslavs total over 160,000 and Iranians almost 65,000. As well as setting cars ablaze, rioters also attacked a police station and a school and nursery . The unrest appears to have been sparked after police shot and killed a man wielding a machete on Sunday . While Sweden is still relatively . affluent, with living standards among the highest in Europe, tension has . grown in recent years as the country struggles to cope with rising . youth unemployment and an ever-growing influx of foreigners. Unemployment for people born in Sweden . is only 6 per cent, but unemployment among those born outside Sweden . currently stands at 16 per cent. The country’s long-standing ‘open . arms’ policy for asylum seekers has brought it to a  position where it . has one of  the world’s highest proportions of asylum seekers relative . to  its population. Among 44 industrialised countries, . Sweden ranked fourth in the total number of asylum seekers and second in . the number of asylum seekers relative to its population, according to . figures from the United Nations. The violence has sparked debate in the country on the effect of the government's social policies . Policemen secure an apartment building after youths rioted in Husby, northern Stockholm . Government leaders have struggled to . explain or control the outbreak of violence, but the anti-immigrant, . nationalist Sweden Democrats have soared to third place in the polls. The party’s rise reflects the  concerns of many native-born Swedes that their country is  rapidly changing for the worse. Sweden was ruled for decades by the . Left-wing Social Democratic Party which has been committed to the . creation of an  egalitarian society since it was founded in the late . 19th century. It was ousted from power by the . current ruling centre-Right coalition, which has failed to make major . changes in the  country once dubbed ‘the most successful society the . world has ever known’. Stockholm, one of Europe's richest capitals, has the fastest inequality rate of any advanced OECD economy . Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt . stressed that everybody needed to take responsibility for their actions . if calm was to be restored. He added: ‘It’s important to remember . that burning your neighbour’s car is not an example of freedom of . speech, it’s hooliganism. ‘We have groups of young men who . believe that you can and should use violence to change society. Let us . be clear. This is not okay. We cannot be governed by violence.’ Torched: Hundreds of cars like this Volvo have been set alight in Stockholm during the orgy of violence .","Fifth night of violent riots in Stockholm saw schools destroyed .

He is one of the world’s most acclaimed conductors, whose concerts in the UK and Russia are celebrated for being among the best orchestral performances of the modern age. So a concert with performances  from famous musicians and his close friends was a fitting way to celebrate Valery Gergiev’s 60th birthday. Mr Gergiev, the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), carefully planned the programme for the special Gala at London’s Barbican Hall, and described the evening as ‘full of joy’. Maestro: Conductor Valery Gergiev acknowledges the audience's applause after the concert at the Barbican Hall . The night was hosted by his close friends the Viscount and Viscountess Rothermere and the event supported by the Rothermere Foundation in memory of the Third Viscount, who was passionate about music and a good friend of Maestro Gergiev. Lord Rothermere, Chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, publisher of the Daily Mail, said: ‘It was a privilege and honour to be able to celebrate his birthday in my Dad’s honour.’ He went on to describe how his father respected Mr Gergiev as ‘a genius and friend... whose very essence is music’. The sold-out event featured two soloists in the first half of the concert who are particularly special to Mr Gergiev; his long-time friend and musical partner, the pianist Alexander Toradze, and the violinist with whom he has often shared the LSO platform in London and abroad, Leonidas Kavakos. The second half was devoted to opera with a performance of the fifth act from Hector Berlioz’s The Trojans – a personal favourite of Mr Gergiev. Ekaterina Semenchuk, who sang the . part of Dido (mezzo soprano), said: ‘It was such a great honour to . perform on stage with Gergiev, one of the few moments of my life I will . honour forever.’ An evening of full joy: Valery Gergiev with Viscount and Vicountess Rothermere after the concert . Mr Gergiev, who received a standing ovation at the end of the  concert, said: ‘Tonight has been full of joy.’ The Rothermere Foundation has supported the LSO for ten years and the Gala was also attended  by Lord Rothermere’s sisters, the Hon Mrs Camilla Cameron, the Hon Geraldine Harmsworth and Mrs Sarah Holcroft. All proceeds from the evening supported the LSO’s Moving Music Campaign which will mean five performances each year will be filmed and seen by more than one million people worldwide, allowing new audiences to see LSO concerts and particularly those who might not be able to afford tickets or be able to travel to London. Mr Gergiev has a notoriously busy schedule. He is also the artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg, and his birthday was also marked by the opening of  the new $700million state-of-the-art Mariinsky II opera house. Mr Gergiev made his debut with the LSO in 1988 and has performed regularly with the orchestra since their highly-acclaimed Prokofiev symphony cycle in 2004. He was appointed Principal  Conductor in 2007, performing a Debussy, Stravinsky and Prokofiev series with the LSO.

A man born without a left hand has had his new Terminator-style bionic arm redesigned so he can proudly wear his wedding ring. Luke Medland, 31, was fitted with the latest carbon-fibre mechanical hand, which moves like a real human hand, seven months ago. The Bebionic3 Myoelectric hand responds through electrodes to muscle twitches on his upper arm and allows him to do everyday tasks like holding on to tube trains like any ordinary commuter. Luke Medland is thrilled that he can now wear his wedding ring on his specially-adapted bionic limb. The limb is so advanced he can even grip objects by twitching his muscles . But Luke, married for six years to wife Nancy, 28, found his wedding ring kept slipping off the £10,000 space-age prosthetic. He asked the manufacturers to redesign the prosthetic lower arm and they dismantled it and fitted the ring. They removed a portion of the gold and then moulded it to the same shape as the prosthetic finger and tested it before strapping it back on to Luke on Thursday. The delighted father-of-two, from Wokingham, in Berkshire, now has the ring permanently on his false finger - even when he takes off the attachment. Engineers removed a portion of the gold and then moulded it to the same shape as the prosthetic finger and tested it before strapping it back on . He said: 'It feels great to be wearing my wedding ring again - it's really special. 'It is nice for both my wife and I that I am able to wear it again and show the commitment we made to each other. 'It also takes away the slightly menacing look of the bionic hand. 'I used to wear a prosthetic that I could fit my ring over, but the new hand is smooth so my ring would just fall off.

The hand, with aluminium and alloy . knuckles, is so sensitive Luke can now hold a piece of paper and double . click a mouse with it. He . is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of . a trial, which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made widely . available on the NHS. He added: 'My hand is pretty cool - it is . like something from Terminator. 'I'd tried a series of prosthethics . before, but they were all quite cumbersome.

This included using it on the crowded tube during rush hour, typing on a computer, making a sandwich and using a Kindle. By and large, everything went to plan.

A feuding university student embarked on a Facebook campaign to frame a disabled man for cyber bullying after she was caught vandalising his front garden. Melissa Thomas, 20, first accused innocent David Parnell of beating her up then created a social media page in his name so she could post spiteful and abusive messages to her own account - and pretend they came from him. As a result of the lies, Mr Parnell, 30, who has special needs and walks with the aid of a crutch was arrested four times, charged with common assault and wrongly spent a total of 30 hours in a police cell. He was left feeling suicidal for fear . of being falsely sent to prison suffered panic attacks and also became . fearful of leaving the house amid fears he might be evicted. All . allegations made against him by Thomas were later dropped. Mr . Parnell’s ordeal emerged as Thomas, from Eccles, Greater Manchester, . was spared jail after she pleaded guilty to four counts of perverting . the course of justice. Manchester .

Thomas alleged he . had threatened her and police went to Mr Parnell’s home and despite him . protesting his innocent officers arrested him on suspicion of breaching . bail. Miss Boocock added: 'He was refused bail. He has moderate learning difficulties and suffers from depression and anxiety and had to spend time in a police cell after bail was initially refused. He did not think he would be able to cope if he was remanded in custody.' A court bailed Mr Parnell the following day and he refused to leave his home alone and was forced to get taxis to avoid Thomas in the street. Yet on July 10 Mr Parnell was arrested again after Thomas falsely claimed he was shouting abuse at her at Eccles bus station. He spent a further four hours in police custody before being bailed again. The following week Thomas claimed Mr Parnell left her abusive Facebook messages and he was arrested for a fourth time after she falsely alleged he had shouted abuse at her in the street. Police became suspicious when CCTV backed up Mr Parnell’s account that he had been in Manchester all day at the time of Thomas’ last allegation. He also had a cash machine receipt making it impossible that he could have breached his bail. Officers found that there were two Facebook accounts in the name of David Parnell. Miss Boocock added: 'One was genuine and the other had been set up by Thomas in order to engineer abusive messages from that account to hers. Manchester Crown Court heard Thomas and Mr Parnell had been friends but fell out after a disagreement . 'David Parnell had to spend two nights in police custody. She provided two false statements to the police and he spent almost 30 hours in police stations which he describes as the most traumatic time of his life and knew that if he was put in prison it would have killed him. 'He lost his self-esteem and has issues from spending time in custody. He said he was being made ill by the allegations against him and almost lost his tenancy. 'He is worried about leaving his flat and meeting the defendant and has panic attacks when he thinks what may have happened.' 'You are a young woman who has suffered in your life with considerable disadvantages.' Judge Michael Henshell . In mitigation defence counsel Mr Martin Callery said that Thomas had endured a 'troubled history'. He added: 'She was a very troubled soul indeed, a very troubled upbringing. 'She is in full-time education in Chester, a university course in hospitality and management. She is presently in university halls of residence and living there during the course of term and out of term. 'She would not deal well with a custodial sentence, she’s small in stature and small in demeanour. Custody would crush her.' Thomas was sentenced to four months in prison suspended for two years and was ordered to pay Mr Parnell £200 compensation and was banned from contacting him under the terms of a restraining order. Judge Michael Henshell told her: 'You are a young woman who has suffered in your life with considerable disadvantages. 'But the effect of your offences has been considerable on him. He did suffer terrific trauma when he was detained in the police station, 30 hours was spent in custody. 'The effect of that on somebody who the affect would be magnified was very considerable. I do not believe the offences were motivated by hostility towards him or because of his disability. Your immaturity led you to take advantage of him. 'But each offence caused him distress and he could as a result have been sent to prison.'

Britons are losing their taste for white sliced bread, with sales of pre-wrapped loaves falling by 31million last year. This is partly because more of us are eating croissants and pastries for breakfast and replacing lunchbox sandwiches with bagels, wraps and pittas. Also, more shoppers are buying specialist loaves – while the popularity of breadmaking machines and TV shows such as The Great British Bake Off has led to renewed interest in home baking. British shoppers are shunning traditional loaves in favour of so-called healthier bread such as pitta (pictured) and wraps . Retail analysts Kantar said sales of . sliced wrapped bread dropped by 1.8 per cent – or 31million loaves – in . the past year despite an overall increase in bakery sales of 3.5 per . cent. Sales of wraps, pittas and bagels soared by a sixth. The white sliced loaf – a UK staple . since the 1930s – has been criticised for its texture, high salt content . and low nutritional value. The Grocer magazine said: 'Not only has the mainstay of the category lost share to a new wave of bread alternatives including thins, wraps and bagels, it has also suffered from persisting negative --and not entirely justified -- perceptions in terms of health, say commentators. 'Adding to bread’s woes, input costs soared last year, putting pressure on margins, while one of the worst wheat harvests in history has resulted in quality so low that, in January, Hovis was forced to renege on its commitment to use only UK wheat.' Michael Murphy, commercial director at Irwin’s Bakery said that health has become an increasingly important consideration especially over the salt content of bread. Demonised: Industry experts say that white bread has an unfairly negative reputation because it is in fact low in fat and calories . He believes unfair representations of its health credentials in the media are contributing to the shaky performance of wrapped bread. 'White bread, in particular, has been demonised, but in fact it is low in calories and low in fat, and is fortified with vitamins and minerals,' he told the magazine. Indeed nutritionist Ian Marber says that . there is no real health benefit to switching from white bread to pittas: . 'Despite what people may think, there is little nutritional difference . between a white sliced loaf and a pitta bread or bagel. 'It might taste different and add variety to your day, but it is a . mistake to think making changes to the bread you buy will provide added . health benefits unless you are switching from white bread to wholemeal, . which is richer in fibre.'","Report has shown that Britain is eating 30million less loaves than a year ago .

Eight out of ten families are being pestered with nuisance phone calls from PPI and claims management firms, according to industry watchdogs. The shocking figures have prompted demands for a ban on any cold calling by PPI firms or others offering financial services. Figures published by the telecom watchdog, Ofcom, found 82 per cent of people are getting an average of 2.4 nuisance calls every week. More than one in five of these - 22 per cent - were related to claims management firms trying to drum up a list of clients who could make a claim for mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance. Frustration: 80 per cent of households claim to be plagued by nuisance calls from financial firms . Another one in 10 related to companies promoting the idea that cash-strapped Britons may be able to release money early from their pensions. Ofcom signalled that it, along with the Ministry of Justice and the Information Commissioner’s Office, is investigating a number of the firms involved with a view to handing down six-figure fines. However, Citizens Advice said the nuisance and distress has now reached the point that the authorities must take action to ban any cold calling of this type. Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘People are being hounded in their homes by unscrupulous financial firms. ‘Without a ban on cold calling for financial services, people are at risk of losing some of their pension to scams or paying upfront fees for services that don’t deliver. ‘A ban on cold calling will make it clear that if you are still contacted out of the blue then it is a scam or a service not to be trusted.’ Richard Lloyd of Which? said: ‘Ofcom's shocking findings reflect our own research and show just how many of us are being bombarded by the menace of unwanted calls and texts.’ Banks: Financial services companies have been urged to avoid cold-calling potential customers . He said the various bodies responsible for policing the phone and financial services system need to ‘get tough’ and hit the people responsible with heavy fines. Ofcom said the majority of unwanted calls were considered ‘annoying’ by 86 per cent of people it surveyed. Seven per cent of nuisance calls were considered ‘worrying’, while three per cent were ‘distressing’. Ofcom’s Consumer Group Director, Claudio Pollack, said: ‘Two nuisance calls a week is too many and this detailed research will help us understand the root cause of the problem. ‘We will use the full range of our powers to tackle abandoned and silent calls, but this is a complex area that requires joint action from a number of different agencies and Government. ‘We are therefore working with the Government and other regulators to help drive a co-ordinated and more effective response to nuisance calls.’ In theory, people can have their telephone numbers removed from the lists used by marketing companies as the basis of their cold calls. This involves contacting the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) via its website. John Mitchison, the head of the service, said: ‘The TPS has seen a significant increase in the number of complaints received over the past six months. Although Ofcom’s latest findings on nuisance calls are not at all unexpected, 82 per cent is slightly higher than previously reported figures. ‘Unsolicited phone calls can be annoying and cause distress to people. Most of these calls are not made by reputable companies, which is why the TPS has been urging the regulators for more enforcement action against companies operating outside of the law for the past 18 months. ‘It’s the responsibility of the regulators to use enforcement action to protect the consumer, as well as the interests of the vast majority of companies that comply with the law.’","One in five cold calls is an attempt to drum up business for PPI claims .

Internet giants were last night slammed for refusing to remove extremist websites. Search engines such as Google and Yahoo must do more to shut down hate-filled sites in the wake of the Woolwich attack, MPs said. Thousands of videos which help to radicalise impressionable young men are easily available on YouTube. And within hours of the execution of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, vile messages praising the attack and encouraging further outrages appeared on Twitter. Police have seized computers since Wednesday’s atrocity and are still investigating if the two fanatics who beheaded the soldier were indoctrinated by online terror videos. Michael Adebolajo, 28, was radicalised by a banned extremist group whose members use the internet to recruit impressionable young men. Search engines and social media websites say they rely on members of the public to ‘flag up’ incendiary material. But critics last night called for more investment to be used to stop the spread of radical videos. In other developments yesterday: . Yesterday a search for Al-Shabaab videos on YouTube –  owned by Google – produced 65,500 results. Al Shabaab is the Islamist terror group in Somalia which Adebolajo was attemtping to join last year. Meanwhile a search on YouTube for videos by Anwar al-Awlaki, the dead ideological leader of Al Qaeda, produced 82,000 results, up from 2,000 three years ago. Adebolajo's accomplice was seen talking to 48-year-old Ingrid Loyau-Kennett as she calmed the men down to keep the peace . Somalia terror group Al-Shabaab has previously had an account on Twitter suspended after it used it to announce it would kill a French hostage and then said it had done so. However, the group has opened a new Twitter account and has used it to glorify the Woolwich attack, along with references to the recent bombing of the Boston marathon and gun attacks in Toulouse, France, last year. It wrote: ‘Toulouse, Boston, Woolwich. Where next? You just have to grin and bear it, it’s inevitable. A case of the chickens coming home to roost!’ The Black flags of Khurasan, a video about the Taliban in Afghanistan which was viewed by the Boston marathon bombers, can be found in 6,200 searches and even the suicide video of Mohammed Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 bombers produces 132 results. Last night YouTube said material that is ‘purely of a religious nature’ would remain online. But Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘Some of the hate messages are particularly dangerous, especially after recent events. We need to find a better way of policing the web.’ Tory MP Patrick Mercer said: ‘This proves more than anything that whenever possible search engines and servers have got to be made to act responsibly. Whenever this sort of thing can be detected we’ve got to close it down.’ Terror suspect: Anjem Choudary (right) claimed that this is him pictured with Michael Adebolajo, 28, (circled) at an Islamist demonstration in London in 2007 . Videos of Adebolajo at extremist  rallies have emerged since he and Michael Adebowale, 22, executed Drummer Rigby. One shows Adebolajo alongside hate preacher Anjem Choudary, whose hate-filled rants are all over the internet and who has admitted that both he and the Woolwich killer are on the ‘same ideological wavelength’. Yesterday Baroness Neville-Jones, a former security minister and chairman of the British Joint Intelligence Committee, said internet hate preaching could have inspired the two terrorists. ‘What we shouldn’t forget is that even if there is nobody else behind it, one of the things which runs through the scene at the moment is the inspiration that comes from internet hate preaching and jihadist rhetoric and this is a very, very serious problem now.’ Fallen . hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, from Manchester, was described as 'cheeky . and humorous' in tributes.

Colonel Richard Kemp, a former Army commander and terrorism expert, said that ‘one of the biggest priorities’ for the security services should now be looking at the role the internet plays in ‘motivating people’ to commit attacks. A YouTube spokesman said: ‘YouTube has community guidelines that prohibit dangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we have removed a significant number of videos under these policies.’ A spokesman for Microsoft, which runs Yahoo and Bing, said: ‘When we are made aware of any illegal content, we remove it from our services, including our search engine and report it to the police.’ Twitter and Google declined to comment.","Thousands of videos which help radicalise young men are easily available .

It was the easiest shopping bill to add up, with everything from a Toblerone chocolate bar to a pack of batteries costing only £1. But a price war against an even cheaper rival has forced the aptly named Poundland to break its own rules and start charging 97p in some of its shops. The cuts are designed to compete with the growing 99p Stores chain, which makes much of the fact that its products ‘cost less than a pound’. Items have been reduced to 97p in some Poundland shops to try to compete with cheaper 99p store . Poundland boss Jim McCarthy said they were trying to 'pop the balloon' of their rival . Poundland has introduced the 97p standard price at three of its shops so far – East Ham in London and two in the West Midlands, Dudley and Chelmsley Wood. The price drop strategy also includes offering shoppers vouchers promoting ‘two for £1’ or £1 off when they buy six items. Chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘It is those early weeks when a rival opens that are very important and if you can pop the balloon early we find that doing that rather than nothing at all is helpful. And it sends the message that we’re not a soft touch.’ He said the 400-store retailer chose to slash prices to 97p because it was ‘attractive’  to customers. The promotion has been running at the Chelmsley Wood Poundland for more than a year, but it is not clear whether the move is permanent. Mr McCarthy told Retail Week: ‘It’s a bit like when a . supermarket has a competitor opening nearby. They have hosts of tactics . to dampen the impact.’ The 99p Stores group, founded in 2001, has grown rapidly amid the squeeze on cost of living and now has more than 200 stores. Poundland is preparing to launch overseas on the continent for the first time. McCarthy said the retailer, which has over 22 stores in Ireland under its Dealz fascia, has chosen which country it will launch in but would not name the location. The 99p Stores group, which was founded in London in 2001 by Nadir Lalani and his sons, has been growing rapidly against the background of the cost of living squeeze.

Energy bosses were attacked over their ‘Premiership football’-style pay yesterday as they announced they were on course to make huge profits on the back of soaring energy bills for millions of families. British Gas – which hiked its prices by six per cent in December – is on course to make profits of £602million after gas use soared almost 20 per cent over the cold winter. Its parent company Centrica is poised to make profits of £1.4billion for 2013. Shareholders attacked the 'Premiership football'-style pay of energy bosses at British Gas's parent company Centrica, which is poised to make £1.4billion in profit for 2013 . Chief executive Sam Laidlaw is paid £36,000 a week after tax and also has another lucrative role at HSBC . Bosses insisted the enormous takings would help them now ‘keep prices low’ for customers. But furious shareholders turned on chiefs at the company’s annual general meeting yesterday – saying Centrica was seen ‘as one of the evil big six’ energy firms and its ‘smooth assurances’ meant nothing to families who had seen energy bills double in just seven years. Consumers, pensioner groups and private investors hit out during furious exchanges after infiltrating the meeting in London yesterday. They also claimed the price rises, which came at the start of what turned out to be one of the longest and coldest winters in living memory, had contributed to scores of deaths from the cold. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw – who is paid an astonishing £36,000 per week after tax – was savaged over his ‘premier league’ salary package. Shareholders also demanded to know how he had time to take on other lucrative roles with HSBC and the Department for Transport, which earned him an additional £125,000 a year. One shareholder demanded: ‘How can you tell us one man is worth £36,000 after tax and does not play in the Premier League?’ Chairman Sir Roger Carr was asked how many of the claimed 7,200 deaths related to fuel poverty last year could be laid at the company’s door. He replied: ‘We’re not a welfare operation, we have to make money.’ He denied allegations of rip-offs and insisted Mr Laidlaw’s pay was justified, saying: ‘everybody operates in a market of talent’. British Gas’s 16million customers have seen their tariffs double in the past seven years. The average British Gas dual fuel bill last year was £1,188. The six per cent rise last December hit at the same time as average gas use rose by 18per cent year-on-year, taking the average winter energy bill up by around £70 to £400. Small investor John Farmer said Centrica was viewed ‘as one of the evil big six’ whose customers who felt ‘exploited’ by rising bills. London pensioner Beatrice Coker said she faced a winter energy bill of £600. She said: ‘How can I manage to pay for my other bills?’ British Gas's 16million customers have seen their tariffs double in the past seven years . The company insisted it will use the extra income made during the winter to delay future price rises. Finance director Nick Luff said: ‘We make a margin selling gas. We will have made a higher margin because of the extra volume and we will use that to keep prices down during the rest of the year.’ Official customer body Consumer Futures said the pledge to hold prices steady was the absolute minimum consumers would expect given the firm’s profits. Some 8 per cent of shareholders refused to back the group’s pay arrangements last year, which saw Centrica’s top five executives share a £16.4million pay bonanza. As well as his job at Centrica, Mr Laidlaw is a non-executive director at the Department for Transport, which entitles him to a £20,000 annual public salary, which he waived. It is understood he  does not claim expenses for the role. He is also a director at HSBC with a salary of £125,000. A Centrica spokesman stressed Mr Laidlaw’s focus remained in the firm.","British Gas is on course to make profits of £602million after raising prices .

The naming of Little Chef will be a blow to a company that has made efforts to move upmarket in recent years by employing Michelin star chef Heston Blumenthal to redesign its menus . Around half of takeaways and restaurants are putting people at risk by failing to offer satisfactory hygiene levels, it has been revealed. Big brand chains like Chicken Cottage, Dixy Chicken and even La Tasca and Little Chef are failing to maintain the highest levels of cleanliness in their kitchens. The details have been compiled by consumer champion Which? based on hygiene inspections by local councils across some 2,000 postcodes. It says urgent action is needed to . tackle a food poisoning epidemic that has afflicted as many as 17million . people over the last two years. A . national system in England and Wales, overseen by the Food Standards . Agency, ranks food outlets on a basis of zero to five stars in terms of . hygiene. A score of zero is classed as ‘urgent improvement necessary’, while five equates to ‘very good’. Which? is calling for a change in the law to require all food outlets, . including supermarkets, to display they hygiene star rating in their . windows. Research by the . group found that three in four people would not eat at a food outlet . that received a food hygiene rating below a score of three, which means . ‘generally satisfactory’. However, Which? found that almost half – 48per cent - of outlets in some parts of Bexley on the London Kent borders fall below this level. Bexley had six of the worst areas studied, while the highest proportion of suspect food outlets was in the DA17 postcode area of the borough. Parts of Powys, Sutton, Croydon and Kingston-Upon-Thames also had poor results. Looking at take-aways chains some three in ten – 29per cent - Chicken Cottage outlets scored less than ‘generally satisfactory’ on hygiene. Big brand chains including La Tasca and Little Chef are failing to maintain the highest levels of cleanliness in their kitchens . The figure was around one in four for Dixy Chicken, Perfect Pizza and Favorite. In the restaurant category, one in five – 18per cent - La Tasca outlets scored poorly along with one in seven – 13per cent – for Little Chef. The naming of Little Chef will be a . blow to a company that has made efforts to move upmarket in recent years . by, for example, employing Michelin star chef Heston Blumenthal to . redesign its menus.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Our investigation shows that food hygiene is an unacceptable postcode lottery. ‘Diners shouldn’t be taking a risk with their health simply by choosing the wrong area in which to eat out. ‘We want everywhere that serves food to the public to display their hygiene score prominently so people can make an informed choice.’ The companies named by Which? said they had training and controls in place to ensure high standards. Some said their stores were either independently run or franchised. La Tasca said it had improved under new management, while Little Chef said it is taking action with lower-rated restaurants.

Tens of thousands of elderly patients could be sent to hotels to recover from illnesses under plans being considered by the Government to free up hospital beds. New mothers and stroke patients could also use such services, which would be run by private hotel chains and allow more flexible visiting hours. The model, based on a system widely used in Scandinavia, will be reviewed formally by NHS England, the body responsible for recommending how local doctors' groups should provide for their patients, at the request of health minister Earl Howe. Elderly patients could be sent to hotels to recover from illnesses under plans being considered by the Government . The 'patient hotels' would be built in the grounds of hospitals and would be staffed by nurses. Relatives would be able to stay in a nearby room, and patients would benefit from en-suite facilities, televisions and room service. Patients who would use such a service would be those who no longer require the specialist medical attention that a hospital provides but who need more support than can be given at home. This applies to many elderly people who may have suffered a fall, have dementia or are waiting for a place in a nursing home. An estimated 30,000 patients each year are kept in hospital despite being well enough to be discharged . An estimated 30,000 patients each year are kept in hospital despite being well enough to be discharged. The problem – known as bed-blocking – happens when support from social care or district nursing is not available in the community for vulnerable patients. According to government estimates, such a patient costs the NHS about £260 a day. Advocates of the plan say the cost of accommodating a patient in a hotel, even one staffed by trained carers and fitted with medical equipment, would be significantly lower. Lord Howe said he was studying the proposals because the care of older people in the community was an 'issue of vital importance to our society'. In a letter to Baroness Greengross, a crossbench peer who has investigated the issue, he said he was examining whether 'the Scandinavian model of hospital hotels' could provide care to the elderly in England. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Proposals for health hotels were submitted to the Department by Baroness Greengross. Ministers have forwarded the proposals to NHS England so they can review them.'","The model is based on a system widely used in Scandinavia .

The company . said the 'worst possible scenario... would be a 10-minute release of . ammonia gas that would or injure no one', an EPA report reveals. With their claim now proved tragically . wrong, questions are emerging over exactly what caused the deadly blast - . and what the owner, Donald Adair, and his employees could have done to . avoid it. Scroll down for video . Owner: Donald Adair, pictured left with his wife Wanda, said he was stunned to learn of the explosion . In further potential failures, the Dallas Morning News . reported that only six fertilizer plants in Texas have been inspected . by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the last five . years. And yet more reports suggest OSHA is so understaffed that they can only carry out such checks every 129 years, the Morning News reported. Speaking to CBS11, Mr Adair, a church-goer who also owns a grain distribution center in West, said he had no idea what had sparked the fire on Wednesday. He said he was sitting at home when he learned of the blaze and then 'things just blew up'. When he went to the scene, he was pushed back by emergency responders, he said. Tragic: Firefighters battle the flames at West Fertilizer Co. on Wednesday night after a deadly explosion . Aftermath: An image shows rescue crews checking homes in West on Thursday after the explosion . The plant, which Adair has owned for . around seven years, had been closed for around three hours at the time . of the explosion, and none of the 12 employees were there at the time, . he said. Speaking to the Star-Telegram, his son, . 53-year-old Gary Adair, said he heard the massive explosion as he was . working on the family farm. 'It felt like an extra loud sonic boom . out in the country,' the younger Adair said. 'I hadn't heard a sonic . boom since I was a kid. About 30 seconds later, it dawned on me what it . was.' He said his father is too distraught to . talk and that neither of them understand what caused the initial fire as . machinery is never left on. 'Everybody in town basically knows . everybody,' Adair said, his words soon dissolving into sobs. 'It's . really rough. It's a tragedy.' Proximity: Inspectors noted how close the plant was to schools and homes but said it did not pose a danger. But in February the school was evacuated after staff noticed a fire at the plant . A letter sent to parents of children . at West Intermediate School, which is across the road from the West Fertilizer Co. plant, . reveals that the school was temporarily evacuated because of a . 'concerning fire' in February. 'The evacuation was executed in calm, but serious fashion,' it said. The letter noted that the school had . not been notified ahead of time that the plant had been carrying out a . controlled burn, so the principal had called 911. The school asked for better communication with such notifications. West Fertilizer Co. was cited for failing to obtain or to qualify for a permit in 2006. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality investigated West Fertilizer on June 20, 2006, after receiving a complaint of a strong ammonia smell. Agency records show the person who lodged the complaint said the ammonia smell was 'very bad last night' and lingered until they went to bed. Later that summer, the plant was fined by the Environmental Protection agency for failing to have a risk management plan that satisfied federal standards, WFAA reported. It was issued with a $2,300 penalty on August 14, 2006, records show. Further documents from November 2006 show that the West Fertilizer Co. agreed to meet all standards expected for anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. Among the changes, it promised to hold an internal inspection once every day to make sure there were no ammonia leaks, and that it would build a wall between tanks and the road to avoid collisions. It noted the gas would be stored in two 12,000 gallon permanent storage tanks, and that staff would only fill the tanks to 85 per cent capacity . Denial: Mr Adair's company had told federal safety agencies that there was 'no' risk of a fire at the plant . Devastating: The family will be facing tough questions over what caused the fire - and as many as 15 deaths . In subsequent reports, inspectors noted the proximity of the plant to schools and homes - without passing any judgment on the safety of this. 'There are two schools located within 3000 ft of this facility, however, the impact potential is described by the region [regional Texas Commission on Environmental Quality office] as low,' a 2007 report noted. 'The nearest off property receptor, a residence, is 350 ft from the plant.' The cause of Wednesday night's explosion remains under investigation, but officials said they had not ruled out criminal activity. The explosion occurred at 7.50pm as volunteer firefighters responded to a fire at the plant. Three to four firefighters are unaccounted for, and officials believe between five and 15 could have died.","Company fined in 2006 for failing to have proper risk management plan .

She is the Oscar-nominated British actress who is taking the film industry by storm following her starring role in The Great Gatsby. But Carey Mulligan yesterday proved she has more pressing things on her mind than the glitz and glamour of Hollywood as she spoke candidly about her grandmother’s battle with Alzheimer’s. The 27-year-old described how upsetting it was watching her grandmother’s condition deteriorate over the past ten years until she could no longer recognise her. ‘She hasn’t recognised me for about five or six years,’ she said. ‘That’s really hard. It’s really sad. But especially for my mum and my aunt and uncle.’ The actress approached the Alzheimer’s Society, the leading UK care and research charity for people with this disease, offering to use her growing  status as a household name to draw attention to issues surrounding Alzheimer’s. Now an ambassador for the charity, the actress said they had used music to help keep her grandmother – an accomplished piano player – happy. ‘We make mixed tapes and CDs and we’ve discovered that she really likes folk music, which we never discovered before,’ Mrs Mulligan said. The actress, who is married to Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the band Mumford & Sons, described the process of her grandmother’s deterioration at an Alzheimer’s Society lunch yesterday. She told Channel 4 News her grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about ten years ago. Miss Mulligan, who starred in Never Let Me Go, Drive, and Shame, before she played Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, continued: ‘She was a geography teacher and she was very passionate about our education and would always ask us about what GCSEs we were doing, what A-levels we were doing. Miss Mulligan, who plays Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, described the process of her grandmother's deterioration at an Alzheimer's Society lunch . ‘And I remember her one day not being able to remember the different subjects I was taking for A-level and I remember thinking that was something she cared so much about, that wouldn’t be something she easily forgot. ‘And then it progressed from there, she would struggle to find her way home when she went out walking.’ Miss Mulligan said she was working with the Alzheimer’s Society in order to make people ‘more aware in their daily lives of those who could be suffering with the disease’.","Actress has watched her grandmother's condition deteriorate over ten years .

Five terrorists have been caught apparently plotting an attack on British tourists in an Egyptian resort in the lead-up to Christmas. The suspected jihadists were arrested by Egyptian counter terror police as they collected rocket-propelled grenades, rifles and pistols in an attempt believed to be similar to the Mumbai attacks in India which killed 166 people in November 2008.# . Authorities claimed that the gang . planned to attack the ‘softer target of British tourists’ holidaying at . the idyllic beachside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on the Red Sea. Terrorist target: Beachside resort Sharm el-Sheikh (pictured) is thought to have been the target of five Muslim terrorists who were arrested by Egyptian counter terror police . The arrests come after al-Qaeda . leader Ayman Zawahiri called for a new wave of violence, appealing to . jihadists around the world to attack and kidnap westerners. The Daily Mirror quoted a security source saying: ‘There are increasing fears that Zawahiri is demanding more attacks on civilian areas with a focus on Americans and Brits. ‘British security is pretty good these days so al-Qaeda is turning its attention to the softer target of British tourists who are holidaying abroad.’ The suspects were held near the border with Gaza as the weapons were taken to a safe house in Egypt. In . a separate incident, security forces arrested two men allegedly linked . to 83 bombs found by security forces in a car on a highway outside . Cairo, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. Appeal for violence: al-Qaeda leader Ayman Zawahiri has appealed to jihadists around the world to attack and kidnap westerners . Police also raided an apartment in Cairo and seized 1.1lbs of ball bearings, which are often used in bombs to cause greater damage and injury, and a bomb-making manual. Two other men were detained by police recently with electrical circuit boards that could have been used in bomb-making. The attack in Mumbai in 2008 occurred at 10 sites across the city with most of the 166 victims killed at the Indian city’s main train station. Attacks in Egypt have been on the rise since Salafi Islam fundamentalist groups linked to al-Qaeda have grown in Egypt’s Sinai region. Attacks have been made on UN peacekeepers, Egyptian forces, Israel and a gas pipe to Israel and Jordan.

Most victims: A gunman walks through Mumbai's main train station where most of the victims were killed during the 2008 attack . Tourists have been targeted before by extremists in Egypt during a wave of violence in the 1990s. Some 62 tourists were massacred by six men disguised as security force staff with knives and automatic guns at an archaeological site across the Nile from Luxor in 1997. At the time, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak blamed the British government partly for the attack after the Egyptian terror chiefs responsible were given asylum in the UK. The Sharm el-Sheikh resort has been targeted before in 2005 when two car bombs went off at the centre of the resort and another in the city’s Old Market while restaurants, cafes and bars were packed, killing 88 people and wounded 150. Just last year an estimated 30,000 Britons were trapped in Egypt, the Middle East’s most populous country, split between Cairo, Luxor, Aswan and Sharm el-Sheikh as violence broke out around the country while Egyptians protested.","Five al-Qaeda terrorists were arrested by Egyptian counter terror police .

Melanie Milner was captured on CCTV helping herself to 27 tins while working in Blackpool as a mental health nurse for the Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust. Milner kept 16 of them and gave the rest to her colleagues but her employers reported her to police for theft and she was dismissed for gross misconduct in January last year. Nurse Melanie Milner was captured on CCTV helping herself to 27 tins while working in Blackpool as a mental health nurse (file picture) She got her job back after appealing her sacking and was handed a written warning to appear on her file for two years. Milner, from Ingol, Preston, has now been given a 12-month caution order by the Nursing and Midwifery Council after referring herself to the tribunal. Panel chair, Lesley White, said: 'Ms Milner has shown deep remorse and shame for her actions and a determination to ensure that they do not recur. 'The panel is of the view that she has demonstrated insight into her actions and how they impact on the profession and her colleagues. 'The panel considers that this caution order is necessary to mark the importance of maintaining public confidence in the profession, and to send to the public and the profession a clear message about the standard of behaviour expected of a registered nurse.' She had accepted a police caution for the August 2011 theft and was then sacked for gross misconduct. Milner did not attend a London hearing of the NMC but apologised in a letter. The Nursing and Midwifery Council, which has its headquarters in Portland Place, London, gave Milner a 12-month caution order . She wrote: 'I would like to express my deep regrets and remorse for my actions and apologise for my actions. 'It was disrespectful, wrong and lacked the professionalism that you and my colleagues expect from a qualified nurse. 'While I cannot alter what has transpired, I have taken steps that this will not occur again, and made the right decision by informing the NMC. 'It was an inexcusable lapse in judgment and moral behaviour on my part. While it was an embarrassing experience it is an experience I intend to learn and grow from.' MPs said her dismissal was excessive and an 'overreaction'. Mark Hendrick, Labour MP for Preston, said: 'She shouldn't have taken what didn't belong to her and should have made whoever was responsible aware. 'However, the investigation has dragged on and it seems they have over-reacted.' Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Preston North and Wyre said the incident could have been sorted out between Milner and her line manager. He added: 'I think it is a bit heavy-handed.' Milner is now free to continue in the profession without restrictions. A Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'This is an extremely regrettable situation as the Trust sets very high standards for its staff in terms of their conduct while at work.

Afraid: Olympic swimmer Ayouba-Ali Sihame is to claim asylum amid fears that she will be killed if deported back to African island nation Comoros after fleeing the Olympic village at the London Games . An Olympian fears she will be killed if deported from Britain after living on the streets to escape an arranged marriage. Swimmer Ayouba-Ali Sihame, 18, represented the tiny African island nation of Comoros during the London Games. But she ended up in a prison cell after fleeing the athlete’s village in a desperate bid to avoid being wed to a twice-married 60-year-old man. Her mother told her she was being sold and must give up her sporting career just days before she flew to London. She said the sportswoman’s ‘celebrity’ status had pushed up her value in the poverty-stricken strict Islamic community. Sihame, who has also represented her country at volleyball, walked out of the Olympic Park after failing to qualify for the 100 metre freestyle semi-finals and coming 48th overall. She spent weeks living rough in the capital before travelling to Dover and attempting to hitch a lift and cross the Channel with a fake French passport. But she was caught by French border control officers who spotted that she was not a woman named Mouniate Mhoussini. Sihame faces being transferred to an immigration centre pending deportation within a fortnight after completing half an eight month prison sentence. She fears for her life after her brother told her in a telephone conversation that she has brought ‘shame’ on the family. Her solicitor Andrew Gurney said Sihame did not realise she was entitled to apply for asylum as soon as she entered Britain. He said: ‘Comoros is a strict Muslim country. Ayouba-Ali was beaten from time to time. ‘Ayouba-Ali was allowed to practice swimming, but she had to wear a full swimming costume and always be supervised by her brother. ‘She had gained celebrity status in Comoros – she was one of just seven athletes to come over for London 2012. ‘Her high profile meant her parents could get a higher price for her in marriage. She was told if she did not take part in the marriage there would be violence or death. ‘And she was told that she would have to give up her swimming career when she was married. Escape: Ayouba-Ali Sihame fled from the athlete's village at the Olympic Park after failing to qualify for the 100m freestyle event . Home: Miss Sihame fears deportation back to the tiny African island nation of Comoros, pictured, where she became a celebrity after being sent to the Olympics and her parents subsequently sold her off to be married to a 60-year-old man . ‘She could not confide in anyone about what was happening, but she managed to speak to a friend and get false French documents. ‘Since the Olympics she has spoken to her brother. He has told Ayouba-Ali that if she returns to Comoros she will be killed because of the shame she has brought on the family. ‘We deal with this sort of offence all the time, but I have never dealt with a case like Ayouba-Ali 's.’ Sihame was jailed at Canterbury Crown Court earlier this week after admitting using a false immigration document. She has applied for asylum from her cell at HMP Bronzefield, in Ashford, Surrey, but was warned she could be deported within weeks. The court was told that had the athlete applied for asylum in the first place she would have probably been granted leave to stay because of the persecution she faces at home. Prosecutor Ian Foinette said she was stopped by French border control officers at Dover on October 5, more than two months after she competed at the Aquatics Centre. He told the court: ‘When her passport was examined it was realised it was what is colloquially called a lookalike – a document with a photograph which resembles the person with the document. Seeking refuge: Miss Sihame is claiming asylum from her cell at HMP Bronzefield, pictured, in Ashford Kent . ‘She was arrested for trying to leave the UK, cautioned but gave no reply. Later on, during the course of her interview, she revealed she had been in the UK from Comoros, representing the country in the Olympics. ‘She had then absconded from the Olympic village because she feared that if she were to return to her country she would be required to take part in an arranged marriage.’ Athlete: Ayouba-Ali Sihame pictured competing at the FINA World Championships in Shanghai, China, back in 2011 . Mr Gurney added: ‘She had been told she had been in effect sold into an arranged marriage to a man 42 years her senior. ‘She says she was told that if she didn't take part in the marriage she would suffer serious harm. ‘She comes from a very strict religious background and suffered regular beatings and she had every reason to believe that if she didn't take part in that marriage she would suffer serious harm.’ Foreign nationals can be granted asylum in Britain under if they can prove that they have a ‘well-founded fear of persecution’. Asylum can also be granted under the European Convention on Human Rights if a foreign national can prove there is a ‘real risk’ they face torture or other inhumane treatment. The UK Border Agency website states: ‘If you do not qualify for asylum but we think there are humanitarian or other reasons why we should allow you to stay in the UK, we may give you temporary permission to stay here.’ Comoros, which is situated between Mozambique and Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, has a hard-line Muslim population of around 754,000. The country, which is among the poorest in Africa, is heavily dependent on foreign aid and allows multiple marriages. Official records reveal Sihame came last in the 100m freestyle heats on August 1 with a time of 1.14.40, more than 20 seconds behind the fastest competitor.","Ayouba-Ali Sihame represented African island nation Comoros at the Games .

Ken Livingstone did not 'directly blame' the U.S. for the Boston bombings, Labour insisted after Tory demands for him to be axed over controversial comments about terrorism. Mr Livingstone sparked controversy by suggesting the brothers who launched the attack on the city’s marathon acted 'out of anger and demand for revenge' over American foreign policy. US-born Conservative MP Brooks Newmark wrote to opposition leader Ed Miliband calling on him to condemn the remarks, made by the former London mayor on a phone-in on Iranian channel Press TV. He called for the Labour veteran to be removed from the party’s National Executive Council (NEC) over the 'disgusting' remarks that suggested the attacks were 'justified and excusable'. But a Labour spokesman said: 'The Labour Party does not believe that US policy is responsible for the Boston bombings and it would be inaccurate to suggest that Ken Livingstone was directly blaming the US for the bombings.' Mr Livingstone said on Friday in comments on the Tehran-funded channel that were criticised in the US media: 'Very often, people get incredibly angry about injustices that they see.' Referring to 'torture at Guantanamo Bay, at Bagram airbase', rendition, and 'ignorance in the Bush White House about Islam' as well as Middle East issues, he said: 'People get angry - they lash out. 'It’s the whole squalid intervention that has disfigured the record of the Western democracies. 'I think this fuels the anger of the young men, who - as we saw in Boston - went out, and, out of anger and demand for revenge, claimed lives in the West.'

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is accused of carrying out the attack - which killed three and injured more than 260 last month - with his brother Tamerlan, who died in a shoot-out with police. In his letter Mr Newmark said it was 'wholly reprehensible for Mr Livingstone to link the Boston bombings to Western intervention in the Middle East. 'In doing so, he suggests that the actions of the two Boston bombers were justified and excusable,' he told Mr Miliband. 'I am sure that you will also agree with me that the only two people responsible for the bombings were the terrorists themselves.' Removing Mr Livingstone from the NEC would 'make clear that neither you nor the Labour Party condone such beliefs,' he added.","Mr Livingstone sparked controversy by suggesting the brothers who carried out the attack did so out of anger over American foreign policy .
