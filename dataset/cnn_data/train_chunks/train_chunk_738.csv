Online addiction: Tallulah Wilson, 15, was found dead on the tracks at St Pancras station, a day after her mother discovered her alter ego . The mother of a talented teenager who plunged to her death in front of a train told yesterday how she had become addicted to self-harming websites before her death. Tallulah Wilson, 15, was found dead at St Pancras station in London. Her mother Sarah yesterday wept as she told how her daughter had become hooked on websites where internet users encouraged her to harm herself. She said she had been horrified to find pictures of her daughter self-harming online on the photo-sharing website Tumblr. ‘It was pictures of her cutting herself,’ she said. ‘It’s like the worst horror movie you have ever seen in your house. I realised there were young girls on there cutting themselves to see who is worse. ‘It’s unbelievable. I saw one girl post a picture with a noose, and the picture said “here’s your new necklace, try it on”. It’s shocking what these young people are up to. All these girls are basically trying to outdo each other.’ Mrs Wilson said she had desperately tried to keep her daughter off the extreme websites but the teenager refused to listen. Tallulah, a talented rider and dancer who lived with her family in a £1million house in West Hampstead, North London, had a bright future and had apparently been headhunted by the Royal Ballet school. But she had been  bullied at St Marylebone school in St Pancras which she attended until the summer term of 2012. Mrs Wilson told the court: ‘Some of the girls in that school were horrible. She didn’t handle my mum’s death very well either, they were very close and she died in 2011.’ Tragedy: Her body was found on the tracks at St Pancras station in London in October 2012 . Hearing: Her mother Sarah told St Pancras Coroner's Court how her daughter's lies had 'spiralled out of control' She started at the £11,000-a-year St . Margaret’s School in Hampstead in September 2012, weeks before her death . on October 14. By this time she had become addicted to extreme . websites, her mother said. The teenager had regularly posted troubling . messages on Twitter, including ‘I will never be beautiful and skinny’ and ‘I have absolutely no plan for my future’. In . other messages posted in the months before her death, she claimed: ‘I . struggle with anorexia’, and said she had been sent to an institution . which, she implied, treated the illness. She tweeted: ‘Haven’t been to . #school in over 6months. #Recovery failed but – still have to go back . #kmn [kill me now] #anorexic.’ She . also wrote: ‘never ever OD again, my head is so so bad’ and ‘I still . cant get the frikin marks off from the heart monitors at hospital’. One . of her final messages was: ‘why the **** should I stay if no one around . me stay for me? I’m done. I’m ****ing done #suicide #goodbye.’ The . night before her death on October 14, 2012, her mother found she had . created a fantasy online persona for herself, the inquest at St Pancras . Coroners Court heard. She . had gained 18,000 followers on sites such as Twitter and Tumblr after . posting about drinking and taking cocaine, and uploading pictures of . herself with cuts she had made in order to impress her fans. She had reportedly been bullied at St Marylebone School (pictured) before moving to the £11,000-a-year St Maragaret's School in Hampstead, London . Mrs . Wilson wept as she told the court: ‘She didn’t think she could have . friends in the real world. I told her it wasn’t real. It was sucking the . life out of her. It was scary.’ She . said her daughter had gone ‘berserk’ when she contacted the website and . had her profile shut down. ‘She started banging her head against the . wall. It was horrible.’ One . night Mrs Wilson believed her daughter had gone upstairs to do . homework, when in fact she had attempted to take her own life. Her . mother was warned of the suicide attempt by a stranger making a phone . call to the house, with whom the schoolgirl had discussed her plans to . take an overdose. After that, her mother said, she was ‘on suicide watch . virtually 24/7.’ Loved: The head of St Margaret's School in Hampstead said Tallulah 'was already a very popular member of our community', despite only having been at the school for a few weeks . The inquest also heard how Tallulah had been . ‘obsessed’ with the death of another girl at her dance school. Tallulah . was on her way to dance class when mother last saw her. ‘I said to her . she didn’t have her dance clothes with her and I asked why? She said “I . don’t need my things today.” And I never saw her again.’ A . friend of Tallulah, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the . court: ‘We got to know each other on Tumblr. She was definitely on a . downward spiral. ‘It seemed like there was a competition with some people, who had the best scar. It was quite sick.’ The . friend, now 17, urged computer companies to take action to avoid other . teens experiencing the same problems as Tallulah. She added: ‘There are . so many people on Tumblr saying they are going to commit suicide, it’s . hard to say who is telling the truth.’ In . a statement at the time of her death, Tallulah’s family said: ‘She was a . clever, cheerful and creative girl with a talent for dance and huge . potential.’ The inquest continues.","Tallulah Wilson was hit by a train at St Pancras station in October last year .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:37 EST, 14 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:48 EST, 15 January 2014 . A federal judge on Tuesday struck down Oklahoma's gay marriage ban, saying it violates the U.S. Constitution, but immediately stayed the effects of the ruling while the courts sort out the matter. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Terrence Kern criticized a law that was approved by voters in 2004 in this conservative state known as the buckle of the Bible Belt. He described the gay marriage ban as 'an arbitrary, irrational exclusion of just one class of Oklahoma citizens from a governmental benefit.' The Oklahoma ruling comes about a month after a federal judge in Utah overturned that state's ban on same-sex marriage. Hundreds of couples got married there before the U.S. Supreme Court intervened, putting a halt to the weddings until the courts sort out the matter. Kern cited that case in issuing the stay of his own ruling. Victory: Mary Bishop and Sharon Baldwin had filed the Oklahoma lawsuit along with another same-sex couple in November 2004 . The constitutional amendment approved by Oklahoma voters says marriage in the state consists only of the union of one man and one woman. Kerns said the measure violates the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause by precluding same-sex couples from receiving an Oklahoma marriage license. 'Equal protection is at the very heart of our legal system and central to our consent to be governed. It is not a scarce commodity to be meted out begrudgingly or in short portions. Therefore, the majority view in Oklahoma must give way to individual constitutional rights,' Kern wrote. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office, which has supported the law, did not immediately have a comment on the ruling. Not including Utah and Oklahoma, 27 states still have constitutional prohibitions on same-sex marriage. Four more states — Indiana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming — do not permit it through state laws. Unconstitutional: Judge Terence Kern struck down Oklahoma's gay marriage ban, saying it violates the U.S. Constitution . For 17 days, Utah was the 18th state to allow gay couples to wed. But the Supreme Court put a halt to them earlier this month by granting the state a stay on a federal judge's ruling that two other courts previously denied. The fate of gay marriage in Utah now rests in the hands of a federal appeals court in Denver. Tulsa couple Mary Bishop and Sharon Baldwin had filed the Oklahoma lawsuit along with another same-sex couple in November 2004, shortly after Oklahoma voters overwhelmingly passed the constitutional amendment. The couples were seeking the right to marry and to have a marriage from another jurisdiction recognized in Oklahoma. The judge waited nine years before issuing his ruling, a striking contrast to the spate of lawsuits filed across the country following last summer's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that required the federal government to recognize legal same-sex marriages. Supporters: Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt supports the 2004 law, which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman . 'The Bishop couple has been in a loving, committed relationships for many years,' Kern wrote. 'They own property together, wish to retire together, wish to make medical decisions for one another, and wish to be recognized as a married couple with all its attendant rights and responsibilities.' In 2006, the Tulsa couples' case made its way to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the district court denied the governor of Oklahoma and the state attorney general's motion to dismiss the case. The appeals court ruled in 2009 that the couple lacked standing, so the two couples filed an amended complaint removing the governor and attorney general and adding the Tulsa County Court Clerk, since that is the person who issues marriage licenses.","Oklahoma voters passed a law banning gay marriage in 2004 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:38 EST, 13 January 2014 . Politicians have lavished a quarter of a million pounds of taxpayers’ money on vanity portraits of themselves. The spree included £11,750 for an apparently topless painting of Labour’s Diane Abbott – the same amount as was spent on a full-sized statue of Baroness Thatcher. Other works include an £11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, a £10,000 portrait of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, an £8,000 painting of Kenneth Clarke and a £4,000 oil painting of Foreign Secretary William Hague. Former Tory PM Sir John Major and Labour's Tony Blair have both been captured on canvas by Parliament - paid for by the taxpayer . Labour left-wingers Tony Benn and Dennis Skinner had portraits commissioned which cost £2,000 and £2,180 respectively. The . bill for the artworks of two dozen politicians has been racked up since . 1995 and approved by the Speakers’ Advisory Committee on Works of Art. By far the bulk of the spending came in the second term of the New . Labour government. The huge sums were signed-off by a . little-known committee off MPs which each year asks some of the . country’s best portrait paintings to produce work of their colleagues. Far . from recording only those who reach high office, it has also ordered . works featuring left-wing firebrand Dennis Skinner, photographs of SNP . MP Pete Wishart and a series of pictures have been taken of the . committee themselves. The . House of Commons insisted it has moved to cut spending on portraits in . recent years, but the details reveal the scale of the spending from . records dating back to 1995. And some MPs have recognised the sensitivity of spending money on art at a time of austerity: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman agreed to sit for a portrait but withdrew in 2012 are questions were asked about the cost. This striking portrait of Diane Abbott was produced by artist tuart Pearson Wright in 2004 . A life-size statue of Margaret Thatcher, which stands in the Member's Lobby of Parliament, cost the same as the Diane Abbott portrait . Trio: In 2001 the three main party leaders were painted to mark the general election by Jonathan Yeo, including (left to right) Labour's Tony Blair, Lib Dem Charles Kennedy and Tory William Hague . Grandee: Tory former chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who is now a minister without portfolio, was painted by James Lloyd in 2007 . Jonathan . Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘While the . public might expect former prime ministers or speakers to be afforded . the honour of a painting or bust in Parliament, it would certainly seem . that the net is being cast increasingly wide when it comes to . identifying subjects. ‘Regularly . splashing out four or five-figure sums for these portraits has the . whiff of an expensive vanity project, for which unwitting taxpayers are . footing the bill. ‘When . photographs are so much cheaper than paintings, politicians need to . think twice about spending our money immortalising themselves or their . friends on canvas, or even in bronze.’ A . portrait of Commons Speaker John Bercow cost £22,000 to commission, . with an extra £15,000 spent on a frame and coat of arms in keeping with . other paintings in the Speaker's House. Former Speaker Betty Boothroyd has been feature three times, in a £1,500 portrait in 1997, an £8,000 portrait in 1999 and a £9,000 bronze bust in 2000. Former Commons Speaker Baroness in front of her portrait at the Mall galleries (left) and with a less formal painting by by artist Jane Bond .

Commons Speaker John Bercow spent £22,000 on the painting (left) and another £15,000 on a frame including the creation of a coat of arms (right) The costs were revealed by a Freedom of Information request by the Evening Standard. Decisions on commissioning and buying art are made by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art, a cross-party group that is currently chaired by Labour's Frank Doran. From 1995 to 2000 just three MPs were chosen to be featured in a portrait, at an average cost of £3,375. But from 2000-05, 11 parliamentarians were honoured at an average of £7,180. Between 2005 and 2010 there 10 commissions at an average of £9,300 each. A House of Commons spokesman said: ‘The Parliamentary Art Collection at the House of Commons records those who have made a significant contribution to UK political life over the centuries and in each parliament the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art endeavours to update this record by adding to the contemporary portrait collection. ‘In recent years the annual budget for acquiring works of art for the collection has been reduced to reflect the need for savings in the current economic downturn. This is part of the House's drive to reduce its overall cost by 17 per cent by 2014-15.’","Since 1995, two dozen politicians have been captured on canvas .

The mother of teen pop sensation Justin Bieber has opened up about the sexual abuse she endured as a child - and how it caused her life to spiral out of control. Speaking to the Today Show, Pattie Mallette, 36, revealed she carried shame for years after the abuse, which began when she was just four, by a male babysitter and a friend's grandfather. The horrific attacks later led to drug and alcohol addiction and a suicide attempt, she revealed. 'I was full of shame,' she said. 'I've learned it's normal for anybody who's been through sexual abuse to carry that shame and blame and feel like there's something wrong with you. I definitely . carried that.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: The mother of Justin Bieber, Pattie Mallette, has revealed the years of sexual abuse she suffered from the age of four and how she struggled to deal with the shame . Family: Mallette gave birth to Justin when she was just 18 - but said abortion was never an option . Mallette reveals further details of her troubled childhood in her new book, Nowhere But Up. By the time she was 14, she was taking drugs and alcohol to deal with the abuse, and by 15, she had lost her virginity. Two years later, she threw herself into the path of an oncoming truck to end her life. 'It was a culmination built up over the years of the abuse and the pain,' she said on Today. 'At the time I was messed up with drugs and alcohol and in a depression.' As she was recovering in hospital, she was visited by a Christian counselor and had a spiritual awakening, she said - but after six months, she had slipped back into her bad lifestyle. Innocence: She revealed the abuse started from the age of four - but did not say who was to blame . Troubled: She was taking drugs and alcohol by the age of 14 and tried to kill herself when she was 17 . Aged 17, after reuniting with her on-again off-again boyfriend Jeremy Bieber, Mallette found out she was pregnant and, despite people telling her to abort the baby, she said it never crossed her mind. 'I just knew I couldn't,' she said. 'I just know I had to keep him. I didn't know how I was going to do . it. But I just knew that I couldn't abort. I had to do my . best, and I was determined to do whatever . it took.' When she was 18, Pattie gave birth to a healthy baby boy near her home in London, Ontario and, even though she had called him 'Jessie' all the way through her pregnancy, she named him Justin. When Gifford asked Pattie about her newborn son's cries, she laughed: 'I know this . sounds crazy, but it sounded like he was singing. He did!' 'Precious': She gave birth to Justin when she was 18 and said that his first cries sounded like he was singing . Baby, baby, baby: She said friends and family advised her to abort her son but she knew it was never an option . Doting: She brought up Justin with the help of her parents and worked a string of low-paying jobs . As soon as she heard him cry, 'I was like, ""Oh my gosh, it is so precious and amazing. I just want to squeeze him"",' she said. Her relationship with Jeremy Bieber eventually broke down and, while her son maintained contact with his father, she largely raised him with the help of her parents, Bruce and Diane. She worked a string of low-paying office jobs and lived in low-income housing. Justin's father went on to marry another woman and have two children . As Justin grew up, Pattie noticed her son had a rare singing talent and entered him in a local talent contest called 'Stratford Star' when he was 12. Young dad: Mallette said her on-again off-again boyfriend couldn't stop looking at his new son . Support: Justin has a good relationship with his father, Jeremy Bieber, who went on to have two more children . Starting young: Pattie uploaded videos of Justin to YouTube - which caught the eye of a manager . Star: Justin has three platinum albums and a legion of admiring fans - but remains close with his mother . 'Healing': Mallette released her memoir last week . She began filming his performances and . uploading them to YouTube so that his grandmother, who lived in a . different part of Canada, could keep up-to-date with his progress. But the clips also caught the eye of an Atlanta manager, Scooter Braun, who barraged Pattie with requests to work with her son - but she was hesitant. 'You just hear all these stories in the industry, the teenagers and how . crazy they can go,' she said. 'I just had to come to terms with the fact . that whether he’s in high school, at home or in the industry, there's . those same fears.' Justin Bieber, who has recorded three platinum-selling albums, garnered a legion of adoring fans and is worth a reported $108 million, told Gifford just how much respect he has for his mother. 'She’s been a friend - someone I can . talk to you and a good role model,' Justin, 18, said. 'I want to grow up . and have just the heart that my mom has, because she has such a big . heart.' Writing in the foreword to his mother's book, he added: 'My mom is the strongest woman I've ever met. I've always known it, but this book has helped to remind me just how strong she is.' Of the book, Mallette added: 'I always wanted to write a book about my story. I wanted to be as vulnerable as I could, so that young girls who have been through similar things could relate.

"By . Eleanor Harding . UPDATED: . 17:57 EST, 3 January 2012 . A Roman coin that was probably used by a lustful legionary has washed up on the banks of the Thames. Made from bronze and smaller than a ten pence piece, the coin depicts a man and a woman engaged in an intimate act. Historians believe it is the first example of a Roman brothel token to be found in this country. Amateur archeologist: Regis Cursan, 37, discovered the brothel token near Putney Bridge, West London, at low tide . It lay hidden in mud for almost 2,000 years until it was unearthed by an amateur archaeologist with a metal detector. On the reverse of the token is the numeral XIIII, which experts say could indicate the holder handed over 14 small Roman coins called asses to buy it. This would have been the equivalent of seven loaves of bread or one day’s pay for a labourer in the first century AD. The holder would then have taken the token to one of the many Londinium brothels and handed it to a sex slave in exchange for the act depicted on the coin. The token was found by pastry chef Regis . Cursan, 37, who used a metal detector to scan the banks of the Thames . near Putney Bridge in West London. Find: The brothel token, right, which is slightly smaller than a pound coin. It goes on display at the Museum of London . He said: ‘The day I made the find it was a very low, early tide and raining heavily. At first I thought it was a Roman coin, because of the thickness and diameter. ‘When I rubbed the sand off the . artefact the first thing I saw was the number on one side and what I . thought was a goddess on the other. Little did I know at the time it was . actually a rare Roman brothel token. To find something like that is a . truly exciting find.’ The token has been donated to the Museum of London, where it will be on display for the next three months. Curator Caroline McDonald said: ‘This is the only one of its kind ever to be found in Great Britain. ‘When it came in, it had to be cleaned up before we could make out what it was. ‘When we realised it was a saucy . picture, we had a bit of a giggle but there’s also a sad story behind it . because these prostitutes were slaves. ‘It . has resonance with modern-day London because people are still being . sold into the sex trade.’ The object, dated to around the first century . AD, was protected from corrosion by the mud. Conservationists have spent . weeks cleaning it since it was found in September. Find: The coin was discovered near Putney Bridge at low tide by pastry chef Regis Cursan, 37, who is an amateur archeologist . Similar tokens have been found elsewhere in the Roman Empire, but this is the first time one has been unearthed in this country. Experts say there is a possibility it could also be a gaming token – although it would be the only one in Britain to display such an explicit illustration. Historians believe that the use of a specific image was necessary because many of the brothel slaves would not have been fluent in Latin so needed a picture to know what service their client required. It is also thought that tokens were a way of ensuring none of the customers’ money went directly to the prostitutes. Experts say it was also illegal to take Roman coins into a brothel during the reign of first century emperor Tiberius as they carried his image. Mr Cursan, who is executive pastry chef at London restaurant Nobu, made his discovery while volunteering with a group of mudlarks. Such groups are licensed by the Port of London Authority to search for historical objects which have been lost in the river. Little is known about brothels in Roman Britain, but it is thought that there were both male and female prostitutes available. Archaeologists have found it hard to pinpoint brothel buildings as they have no distinctive features, although it is thought they existed near Roman baths. Some historians believe the Romans invented prostitution in the modern sense. It played a significant part in the empire’s economy – with sex workers required to register with the local authorities and even pay tax.","Amateur archaeologist unearthed coin with a metal detector by river at low tide .

His mother Leeanne, who is terrified of heights, even managed a 300ft bungee jump as part of their mission. Standing tall: AJ Tighe's mother Leeanne said his progress has been remarkable. He recently managed 15 unaided steps . Doctors have said AJ’s progress since the operation has been ‘remarkable’ and proud mother Leeanne said watching her son take his first unaided steps had made all the hard work worthwhile. She said: 'It was an unbelievable . moment, it was everything we have dreamed of for so long and something . we thought we might never see. Cerebral is another word for the brain. Palsy means a complete or partial loss of the ability to move a body . part. So cerebral palsy means loss of ability to move a body part . because of a problem with the brain. Cerebral palsy is not a single . condition. It is an umbrella term used to describe a group of conditions . that cause movement problems. Although the main problem is with the . muscles in one or more parts of the body, the condition is caused by . damage or faulty development in a part of the brain. The part of the . brain affected is that which sends messages to muscles. The damage or faulty development usually occurs when a baby is in the womb. Sometimes it occurs during, or shortly after, birth. Depending on the type of cerebral palsy . and the area of brain affected, a child may not be able to walk, move, . talk, eat or play in the same ways as other children. 'He’s a stubborn thing who doesn’t like to be told he can’t do something and that’s how it started. He began to get up and his cousin was telling him not to because he couldn’t walk without his sticks and he just said ‘yes I can, I’ll show you’.' 'He took two steps, then got back up and did four and in the end managed to walk about 15 steps over to his grandma. It was amazing. 'He was so proud of himself afterwards and it was great to be able to see his face because he knew he’d done something really important.' Andrew, known as AJ, has a form of Cerebral Palsy known as Spastic Diplegia, which accounts for 80 per cent of cases.  It is caused when brain damage occurs in the outer layer of the brain and affects the legs more than the arms. AJ underwent a series of operations in May to straighten and strengthen his legs at the St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri last month. The procedure, known as Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy, involves cutting the nerves in the spine to release the spasticity (tension) in AJs muscles, allowing him to move far more freely. Although the operation has just become available at a hospital in Bristol, funding it not widely available. Doctors expect AJ to be regularly walking unaided within six months and physiotherapy to help develop his leg muscles could take up to two years. However, following NHS cuts the family now have to raise up to an additional £8,000 for two years of private treatment with a specialist nurse. The family have pledged to hand any money left over from the rehabilitation costs to another child with cerebral palsy looking to fly to the States.

But when the blunder takes a multi-billionaire’s mega-yacht out of action, the result can be explosive – and rather expensive. Russian chemical tycoon Andrey Melnichenko, who is worth nearly £9 billion and owns a sprawling estate in Berkshire, is suing Dulux owner Akzo Nobel for $100million – or £62million. Scroll down for video . Mega-yacht: Called simply 'A' the paint job on the floating palace has left its billionaire owner unimpressed . Luxury: The yacht has a dance floor with glass ceiling and a bed that rotates at the touch of a button . Super-rich: Andrey Melnichenko, pictured here with wife Aleksandra, is believed to be worth £9 billion . His claim, filed in a New Jersey court, argues the paint company’s incompetence forced him to redecorate his £200 million, 391-foot luxury yacht. The total includes £15 million to cover the cost of touching up the paint job as well as a monthly payment of £2.5 million to pay for hiring a replacement vessel in the 18 months when the yacht will be out of action. Documents filed at the court state: ‘In addition to attorney’s fees and costs, these damages represent over $100 million in ascertainable losses on the part of the plaintiff.’ The vessel, named ‘A’ after Mr Melnichenko’s model wife Aleksandra, made waves in the luxury yachting world when it first took to the seas in 2008. Big spenders: Melnichenko with wife, Aleksandra, made his billions from chemicals . The ship was longer than Roman Abramovich’s Pelorus, which at the time was the largest vessel in the Chelsea owner’s fleet. Designed by French interiors guru Philippe Starck, it boasts a dance floor with a glass ceiling – which also forms the bottom of a swimming pool on the deck above. The master bedroom is only accessible via a fingerprint recognition system and is protected with bomb-proof glass. One of the king-size beds rotates at the touch of a button, the walls are decorated with white stingray skin and the taps in the baths are believed to be worth £25,000 apiece. The ‘A’ costs more than £12 million a year to maintain, with each refuelling racking up a bill of more than £300,000. Given the huge expense of his floating palace, it might come as no surprise that Mr Melnichenko, 41, was upset when it didn’t get the paint job he felt it deserved. The row began when Akzo Nobel, the company that owns Dulux, was commissioned to provide a high-quality finish for the mega-yacht. As the work neared completion, ‘problems appeared in the finish,’ the court documents claim. The paint appeared to be ‘running’ and the coats began separating from each other causing ‘lines and sags’. The finish was also not as reflective as Mr Melnichenko expected, resulting in what he claims is a ‘cloudy’ overall appearance. Incompetent: Melnichenko has blamed Akzo Nobel for forcing him to redecorate his £200-million liner . The vessel was repainted at Akzo . Nobel’s own cost, but the second coat was ‘unsatisfactory’ and lawyers . say a new coat will now take 18 months. The couple are no strangers to shelling out large amounts of money. In 2007 they spent £1 million hiring Jennifer Lopez to sing. They own the £24-million Harewood Estate in Ascot, Berkshire, and previously owned a £3 million flat in Berkeley Square.

Police yesterday released a photograph of a rusting claw hammer which they believe was used to batter a grandmother to death in a £1.6 million waterside mansion. Detectives investigating the murder of Valerie Graves took the unusual step of appealing for help in identifying the distinctive tool. Miss Graves’s DNA was found on it and police said it could have been bought at a local hardware store. Police in Sussex today released photos of this claw hammer they believe was used to bludgeon artist Valerie Graves to death in her waterside mansion . Artist Valerie Graves, 55, was found dead in a ground-floor bedroom at a waterside property in West Sussex . Police found the filthy claw  hammer at an undisclosed location near the murder scene in Bosham, near Chichester, West Sussex, a  village where Midsomer Murders has been filmed. Officers appealed to police, prison staff, probation officers and mental health professionals who may have heard someone speak of an assault using a hammer, sparking speculation that the weapon may have been used in another attack. Police are also probing the theory that the hammer could have been stolen or lost by an innocent  resident in the village and retrieved by the killer. The development came hours after Sussex Police released a  22-year-old suspect on bail. Detectives spent four days quizzing Daniel Pereira, who lives in a three-bedroom cottage 400 yards from the murder scene with his father Simon Miles, 44. The cottage was also searched. Family say Mr Pereira, who works for a local electrical supplies firm, is a ‘nice guy’ who would never harm anyone and his arrest is a ‘joke’. The house in Bosham which Ms Graves had been housesitting when she was murdered . A 22-year-old man was detained and later released on bail, Sussex Police said . Valerie Graves, 55, had been housesitting for the owners of the six-bedroom mansion while they were away over Christmas. She was attacked on the ground floor while three of her family members slept upstairs on December 30. The talented artist had recently moved back to Sussex from  Scotland to be closer to her family. Yesterday Detective Superintendent Nick May from Surrey and  Sussex Major Crime Team revealed that the hammer could have been bought at a Screwfix store nearby. He said: ‘We need to know the origins of this hammer. Do you  recognise it?... The hammer is about 30cm in length. It has a distinctive red and black handle and is embossed with the words Forge Steel with a picture of an outline of an anvil.’ Police refused to say if any traces of a potential killer were found on the weapon, and whether it had been used to force entrance to the property. Yesterday Miss Graves’s family were said to be hopeful that the appeal would lead to a breakthrough.","Artist Valerie Graves was found dead in Bosham, West Sussex .

Quizzed: Constance Briscoe said she was asked about whether Vicky Pryce broke off her engagement to the disgraced cabinet minister when he allegedly confessed to same-sex relationships . A judge accused of lying to police was quizzed by a reporter over claims that Chris Huhne had ‘liaisons with men’, a court heard yesterday. Constance Briscoe said she was asked about whether Vicky Pryce broke off her engagement to the disgraced Cabinet minister when he allegedly confessed to same-sex relationships. The barrister is on trial accused of trying to pervert the course of justice in connection with the investigation into Huhne’s speeding points scandal. She told police after she was arrested that the Mail on Sunday’s David Dillon had also asked her about claims that Huhne had infected Pryce with lice. But Briscoe denied ever speaking to the journalist about Huhne passing speeding points to his now ex-wife, the court heard. Briscoe, 56, denies three counts of intending to pervert the course of justice. Southwark Crown Court in London has been told she allegedly lied in two witness statements and then later altered a statement to hide her dishonesty. She is also accused of deliberately showing an expert the wrong copy of the altered statement so that his report would say the alteration was a printing error. Jurors have heard that Briscoe denied speaking to journalists about the speeding points in her statement, but emails later emerged showing she had been communicating with the Mail on Sunday. Following her arrest in October 2012, she told officers she had spoken to Mr Dillon, but not about the motoring offence. In a video-recorded interview under caution, she said: ‘Dillon had contacted me, and he had certainly contacted Vicky, there was an occasion where they were looking at various stories about Chris Huhne. ‘They were looking at the speeding story and that I couldn’t assist them on but there were other stories as well that the papers, in particular Mr Dillon, were interested in. ‘He had discovered somehow that Vicky Pryce had called off her  engagement, or whatever it was, to Chris and it had been called off ... because Chris had said to Vicky he had had liaisons, whatever you want to call it, with men. I knew nothing about this. ‘The other contact he was pursuing – and I’m not quite sure whether I should say this but I am going to, I am going to say it because I’m not having any of this bloody nonsense about me perjuring myself. ‘When Chris was a European MEP he had come home and he had infected Vicky with crabs. And the explanation he had given when Vicky had crabs was that he had contracted the crabs from the clean sheets in whatever hotel he was in.’ Allegations: Briscoe denied ever speaking to a journalist about Huhne (pictured with his wife on election night in 2010) about passing speeding points to his wife . Briscoe told officers that, again, she knew nothing about the story. The judge, who has been suspended since her arrest, was originally due to be a prosecution witness in the case against Pryce and Huhne. But jurors have heard that once it was discovered she had apparently lied about her contact with journalists, it was decided she was not a reliable witness. The court was also told she helped Pryce, who was her London neighbour, to reveal information about the points-swapping to newspapers after she and Huhne separated in 2010. The scandal led to the Lib Dem politician’s resignation and subsequent prosecution. He pleaded guilty in February last year, while Pryce, an economist, was convicted after a trial. Both were released early from eight-month prison sentences. Briscoe told police Pryce confided in her in 2003 about the speeding points. But she was arrested after emails showed she had been in contact with journalists – something she had denied. The trial continues.

A banker who hated the kitchen cabinets fitted in his £12million apartment at Britain's most expensive address has received a £4milion payout from the wealthy developers. Geoffrey Logue became embroiled in a bitter four-year legal battle with brothers Christian and Nicholas Candy which started over the quality of the finish at One Hyde Park. The dispute, which descended into claim and counter-claim, ended with New York-based banker Mr Logue lodging a £28milion claim for damages in the High Court. Legal dispute: Nick Candy (centre, left), with his wife Holy Valance, and Christian Candy (centre, right) with his wife Emily Candy, were involved in a multi-million legal battle over an apartment at One Hyde Park . Exclusive development: The legal dispute is a rare bit of bad PR for One Hyde Park where the 87 apartments have changed hands for up to £140million . Mr Logue ultimately filed a case for breach of confidence, abuse of process and unlawful interference. The final claim was made after he had a worldwide freezing order placed on his assets during the dispute. Nicholas, who married Holly Valance in a fairytale wedding in Beverly Hills, and his brother eventually agreed to settle the case last year as the court hearing loomed. They paid close to £4million plus Mr Logue's legal expenses which sources said are likely to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The pair are Britain's best known luxury property developers and built the £1.15billion One Hyde Park in conjunction with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassam bin Jabr al-Thani. The brothers purchased the site - a former . 1950s office block - for £150million in 2004 before spending a borrowed . £1billion plus on the redevelopment. Their dispute with Mr Logue over his £11.5million apartment bought off plan in 2007 is a rare bit of bad PR for the luxury development in Knightsbridge. Properties in the building - which is just yards from Harrods - have changed hands for as much as £140million.

Tycoons: Brothers Nick and Christian Candy on the construction site at One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge during the redevelopment . The problems started for Mr Logue, who owns property in New York, London and Italy, in 2008 when he realised the kitchen would be fitted with cream lacquer cabinets - while he wanted dark wood with bronze. Later he was told that the washing machine and tumble dryer would have to go in the kitchen because a planned laundry room was instead going to house an air conditioning unit. He told The Times: 'I didn’t want cream lacquer cabinets in my kitchen, no way, it looks like Ikea. I wanted a dark wood kitchen frame with bronze. That’s how this entire drama started.' He added that the brothers later travelled to Milan to see him in an attempt to smooth relations over. 'Christian Candy came to Milan to meet me. He took out this floor plan and said, ""I can’t give you back the laundry room but I can place the washing machine and tumble dryer so that if you are in the flat and the cleaner is doing the laundry, you won’t hear them"".' When the dispute broke out at the height of the financial crisis, many of the properties in the building remained unsold. During the ensuing legal battle, Mr Logue had a worldwide freezing order placed on his assets whilst he was caught up in bankruptcy proceedings in US launched against his company. Lawyers alleged that Mr Logue had attempted to evade service of legal papers in the US and claimed there was a serious risk he would try and dissipate his assets. Legal battle: Holly Valance is seen with Nick Candy at Queen's tennis club. The couple are married and had their first child together last year . Wealthy: The brothers who were engaged in a four-year legal battle with Geoffrey Logue . However, the freezing order was later lifted by Mr Justice Roth in the High Court after the lawyers who obtained the injunction in the first place accepted they had made a mistake. CPC, Christian Candy's company, Project Grande, the company behind the One Hyde Park development and the brothers have all made clear they were not responsible for the argument their lawyers put before the court. Andrew Shaw, a partner at Stewarts Law who were advising CPC, was later struck off after Mr Logue brought a private complaint before the Solicitor's Disciplinary Tribunal. Mr Shaw has since had the ruling overturned by Mr Justice Jay in the High Court. His case will now be re-heard by the original tribunal. Following the case, Mr Logue lodged his £28million High Court claim which was resolved last month with a £3,950,000 settlement in his favour. The banker sold his flat at One Hyde Park for £16.8million in 2012, making a tidy profit on his original £11.5million investment. In a statement released through his law firm, Mr Logue confirmed that he had received a payout. 'Shortly before Christmas, Christian Candy's CPC Group paid nearly £4,000,000 to settle the claim,' he said. 'In addition, it paid all the costs I incurred in the UK proceedings involving the Liquidating Trust. 'I am pleased with this result, although deeply disappointed at having been put to the trouble of this litigation. I do not intend to engage with the Candys any further.' A spokesman for the Candy Brothers confirmed the case has been settled and added that they think it is 'out of date and a non story'.

A divorced couple who stole almost £500,000 from their severely brain-damaged daughter's £2.6million compensation fund have been jailed. A judge said Cathy Watson, 44, betrayed the trust between a mother and a daughter 'in the most appalling and distressing way' as she sentenced her to five-and-a-half years in prison. Watson's ex-husband, Robert Hills, 50, was jailed for three years and four months after Judge Jacqueline Davies outlined how the pair spent huge amounts of cash on top-of-the-range cars, jewellery and even cosmetic surgery. Cathy Watson (left) and Robert Hills (right) have been jailed after they stole almost £500,000 from their severely brain-damaged daughter's £2.6million compensation fund . Doncaster Crown Court heard how the couple bought more than a dozen cars, including luxury BMWs and Mercedes. Watson bought a Mini Cooper which she had completely resprayed and reupholstered in pink and finished with a personalised number plate. Judge Davies recalled how the pair spent thousands of pounds on jewellery and 250 Royal Doulton ornaments. 'We just spent and spent and spent,' Hills told police. Hills, 50, admitted four counts of theft from the fund which was supposed to provide for Samantha Svendsen, now 29, whom he adopted when he married Watson. Watson, 44, was found guilty of three counts of theft and one of converting criminal property following a trial last year. Doncaster Crown Court (pictured) heard how the couple bought more than a dozen cars, including luxury BMWs and Mercedes . The compensation was awarded to their daughter Miss Svendsen, who suffers from cerebral palsy and needs round-the-clock care after suffering brain damage due to medical negligence at her birth. Jailing the pair, Judge Davies said: 'The way the money was spent was nothing short of greed and indulgence.' Turning to Watson, the judge said: 'One can only begin to understand the difficult time you had giving birth to a severely disabled child at the age of 14. 'But you, as her mother, were the person closest to her - the person she looked to trust. You have betrayed that trust in the most appalling and distressing way.' Watson, 44, was found guilty of three counts of theft and one of converting criminal property following a trial last year . Hills, of Grimsby, and Watson, of Scunthorpe, stood in the glass-fronted dock as they were sentenced, separated by a security officer. Neither showed any emotion as they were led away. Judge Davies said: 'There are many parents who have to look after disabled children. 'The majority do so without the sums of money that were awarded to your daughter to help with her care. They do so out of love.' The judge explained how Miss Svendsen has limited speech and has little body movement. She can move one of her hands, which she uses to operate her wheelchair. Judge Davies said the initial medical negligence pay-out included a direct payment to Watson of £270,000 for expenses she had already incurred. It also provided for a £4,000-a-month income for the family on top of benefits they were entitled to. The rest of the money, the judge said, was supposed to be invested to provide a secure income for Miss Svendsen for the rest of her life. The judge said all these payments, plus rental income from a property portfolio, meant the family had a large legitimate income 'but it was not enough to fund the extravagant lifestyle that you both clearly enjoyed for a substantial period of time'. She said that for about five years the couple, who divorced in 2004 after a 14 year long marriage, were spending about £117,000 a year. Among the spending highlighted by the judge was £12,000 on Watson's cosmetic surgery and how she bought a business called Cathy's Wedding Bliss which 'failed miserably'. She said they had also bought 15 or 16 luxury cars. The judge said that partly as a result of her parents' actions, Miss Svendsen's fund was now extremely depleted and only £150,000 remained. Judge Davies explained that because Miss Svendsen was no longer being looked after by her parents, professionals were now caring for her at a cost of almost £100,000 a year. 'There are many parents who have to look after disabled children. The majority do so without the sums of money that were awarded to your daughter to help with her care. They do so out of love' - Judge Jacqueline Davies . She said the fund will probably be exhausted in two years and the State will then have to pick up the bill. 'I do not know what the consequence will be to her (Miss Svendsen),' the judge said. 'She is well aware of what you have done and the emotional impact on her cannot be ignored.' Judge Davies said that after the compensation award the couple legitimately bought a huge house in the Cleethorpes area for £117,000 and spent up to £600,000 renovating it and adapting it for their daughter. But, the judge said, it was now only worth £425,000 because most potential buyers have no need for the adaptations. The judge explained how much of the money stolen by grandmother Watson and Hills was secured from the Court of Protection - the body that administers the compensation payment - in order to invest in property for their daughter. But, she said, the pair sold the houses and pocketed the cash. They even made a down-payment on a property in Florida and then spent the £90,000 when the deal was cancelled. Judge Davies said the total amount of money stolen by the pair from their daughter was just over £450,000. She was particularly scathing of £31,000 in cash Watson took out of a bank account when she realised the police were on to her and 'you knew the game was up'. Judge Davies ordered the six month sentence she imposed for this be served in addition to the five years for all the thefts.","Cathy Watson jailed for five and a half years at Doncaster Crown Court .

Mohammed Arshad, who obtained one of the stolen passports, was able to stay in Britain illegally for five years . An illegal immigrant stayed in Britain for five years after he bought a blank passport on the black market which was among 3,600 stolen in a raid on a delivery van. Mohammed Arshad, 49, is thought to have paid up to £1,000 for the bogus document after it was stolen in July 2008 during an 'insider job' robbery on a the van travelling to an RAF base. The delivery driver had made an unscheduled stop at a newsagents in Chadderton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester to buy a newspaper and a Mars Bar. The driver had left a colleague in the passenger seat only to return to see the van being driven away. The passenger Alan Burke claimed the hijackers had forced his head onto the dashboard before driving the vehicle 100 yards down the road and raiding its contents. But Burke was later arrested after inquiries revealed he was in cahoots with an Asian crime gang plotting to sell blank passports and visas on the black market in an immigration scam. In all 24 boxes containing 3,650 blank . passports and 8,100 visas were snatched. They were due to be fielded by . staff at RAF Northolt near London for distribution to British Embassies . worldwide.

Prince Harry has said it is 'easy to forget' who he is in the Army in a candid interview ahead of his return to the UK . There is only one rule as far as the soldier prince is concerned: Work hard, play hard. But in one of the most candid admissions of his interview, Harry remarks that a concerned Prince Charles frequently attempts to remind him of what is required of the third in line to the throne. Harry confesses he ‘let himself and his family down’ after being photographed cavorting naked in Las Vegas last year, but, unsurprisingly given his comments, is largely unrepentant. The 28-year-old royal concedes he should have acted in a more ‘princely’ manner but says the media should never have published ‘private’ photos of him playing strip billiards with a group of women he had met in his hotel bar. Like many headstrong young men, Harry says he shrugs off his father’s wise words of caution, even if he is heir to the throne. ‘My father’s always trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that. But it’s very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the Army. Everyone’s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing,’ he says. ‘I have always said work hard, play hard. I will always be enjoying the job … however long it may carry on for, and then I have the other job to fall back on.’ He adds: ‘Certain people remind me, “Remember who you are, so don’t always drop your guard”. At the end of the day I probably let myself down [in Vegas], I let my family down, I let other people down. ‘But I was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect.

They show a naked Harry cupping his . genitals as he hugs an unnamed blonde, who is also nude. The pair had . apparently been playing a game of strip billiards. It is believed the . photos, sold to a US entertainment website, were taken by one of the . guests invited back to his £5,000-a-night suite in the Wynn Hotel. Their publication provoked a debate . over whether Harry violated his own privacy in showing such a lapse of . judgment, and raised questions over the role of his taxpayer-funded . Scotland Yard protection officers. A rare glimpse of his day job: Prince Harry inspects his Apache helicopter before take-off from Camp Bastion .

Although the pictures were seen around . the world, his solicitors threatened action against any UK newspaper . that published them. Only one, the Sun, chose to do so but St James’s . Palace took no further action. Harry, however, says it is ‘unacceptable’ that anything was published, knowing that he was about to be deployed. ‘Yes people might look at it going, . “Yes it was letting off steam, it’s all understandable now, he was going . off to Afghanistan”. 'Well, the papers knew that I was going out to .

A 79-year-old family-run underwear firm backed by retail guru Mary Portas has gone into administration with the loss of 33 jobs. Headen & Quarmby was chosen by Miss Portas to make underwear for her Kinky Knickers brand, sold in high street shops such as M&S. In a 2012 TV series she documented the launch of the venture, which aimed to revive the ailing UK textile industry which has been decimated by the availability of cheap imports. Empty drawers: Headen & Quarmby in Middleton, Greater Manchester was chosen by Mary Portas for her three-part Channel Four series Mary's Bottom Line . Business was booming at the Headen and . Quarmby factory in Middleton, Greater Manchester, after it was featured . in a three-part Channel Four series Mary’s Bottom Line. She . was charged with reviving British manufacturing - and to prove that . homegrown enterprise and workers could create high quality clothing. Millions . watched as eight raw apprentices were taken on board, overseen by Lynn . Birbeck, whose family founded the factory in 1935. The . resulting ‘kinky knickers’ range was a resounding success and helped . prove Portas’ ethos that quality, homegrown products could compete on . the high street against cheap foreign imports. But now, less than two years later, the factory has closed and the firm has gone into administration, with the loss of 33 jobs. Bosses pointed to a lack of pre-Christmas orders from ‘key customers’ for the closure. Revived: Despite an early success which saw the factory double its workforce, the 'knicker factory' has now been forced to close and fire 33 employees . Until recently the experiment was said to be a success for the Middleton company. The . colourful lace lingerie was said to be in such demand since going on . sale in early 2012 at stores including Boots, House of Fraser and online . fashion retailers, an initial production run for 5,000 led to orders . for 45,000. Eight . apprentices were taken on originally, paid for by TV production company . Endemol for the first nine months. And more were taken on as the factory . doubled their workforce to meet demand. One employee, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘It has come as such a shock, we had no idea the business was in trouble.’ BDO . LLP business restructuring partners, Kerry Bailey and Patrick Lannagan, . were appointed Joint Administrators over Headen & Quarmby on 15 . January 2014, a spokesman said. Kerry . Bailey, BDO business restructuring partner said: ‘The Company employs . 33 staff and regrettably, it has been necessary to make all employees . redundant. ‘The Joint . Administrators are currently investigating options to recommence trading . and fulfil customer orders, with a view to affecting a sale of the . business as a going concern. ‘A . drop in post-Christmas orders from key customers and a decline in sales . volumes has significantly affected the business and resulted in a . deterioration of its working capital position. However, we are doing . everything we can to try to secure a future for the business, and we are . hopeful of securing a sale. ‘To . that end, the administration team would welcome approaches from . commercial parties interested in acquiring the business or assets.’ Kinky knickers: Portas with a pair of the popular pants made using lace from a Nottingham supplier . Bad sales: Management blamed 'poor Christmas sales' for the closure . Middleton knicker factory Headen and Quarmby’s manufacturing had been mothballed ahead of Portas’s TV show. Speaking . at the time of the show Portas said: ‘The reaction has been amazing. Now the plan is to export and I’m hoping we’ll have another two . factories making the knickers. ‘I’ve . already had to take on an additional two apprentices to cope with . demand. There is a real appetite for British-made clothing in this . country. ‘I sincerely believe that people want to buy British, but that choice was taken away from them.’ Speaking in 2012 MD David Moore said the knickers were so popular his staff were struggling to cope with demand. In . December 2012 a fourth instalment of the show was broadcast to show the . progress on the project. It included how the team had to scale up . production to cope with the huge demand for the frilly knickers, which . were being sold for a pricey but affordable £10. Ahead . of the Channel Four show Headen & Quarmby were a family firm . established 70 years ago who had to send production overseas to make . ends meet.

But while Mrs Driscoll was stood with a priest next to her son's coffin, Hill helped herself to the family's gold jewellery. Susan Driscoll, 51, with her son Paul Driscoll (left), who died suddenly and Pamela Hill, who stole jewellery worth more than £2,000 from the family home . She was today jailed for 140 days having admitting theft. Mrs Driscoll said: 'She is scum - she stole from me when my son was lying in a coffin in the other room'. Hill, who had been friends with Mrs Driscoll for more than 30 years, called on her at home to offer condolences following the shock death of her son, better known as Jakey. Once Mrs Driscoll was distracted with the priest, making arrangements for Jakey's funeral, Hill bundled six gold rings and a bracelet worth £2,000 into a pillowcase and left with them. She later sold the jewellery to a market trader for under £1,000. Mrs Driscoll said: 'After losing contact for a year, Hill got in touch when she heard about Jakey. She did everything for me - she took me to register his death, and took me to the chapel of rest, and even offered to pay for the order of service. Speaking of Hill, Mrs Driscoll said: 'She is scum - she stole from me when my son was lying in a coffin in the other room' Paul Driscoll, who was better known as Jakey, died suddenly at the age of 39 . 'We realised on the morning of Jakey's . funeral the jewellery that things were missing. My son was lying in his . coffin in the other room. 'She excused herself when the priest came to the house, and then left holding a pillow case with bedding from the spare room. 'What sort of person would do that?' The . family, who discovered the theft on the day of Jakey's funeral, said . the experience, and the wait for the court appearance, meant that they . had yet to be able to properly grieve for Jakey. Left distraught: Susan Driscoll, pictured with her partner Paul Melville, was abused in court . Swansea Magistrates' Court heard how Hill admitted taking the jewellery and selling it, but had maintained she found the gold in a clear plastic bag, in a neighbour's garden when she had left the house. Rachel Anthony, prosecuting, said the claim: 'Stretches the imagination somewhat.' The court was also read a statement from a member of staff at the gold buyers, who said that when Hill had visited them, she 'seemed very nervous, and was looking around and wiping her face and her forehead'. As District Judge Richard Williams began to sentence Hill, to 140 days imprisonment, a family member of Hill shouted expletives directed at Mrs Driscoll. In a statement, Mrs Driscoll and partner Paul Melville, said: 'We are pleased with the verdict. If she had not stolen our jewellery she would not be in this position. 'She took advantage of us at our lowest ebb, and tainted the memory of our son, and caused us distress and pain. It is unforgivable. 'To be screamed at and threatened by a member of her family in court was unbelievable. 'We have done nothing - we are the victims, but we have the full support of police if there are further reprisals, and have had a lot of support from the community.' Mrs Driscoll said: 'It had a terrible impact, I lost my son, and found out on the day of the funeral that someone had gone through my bedroom and stolen from us. 'I feel I have not been able to grieve for my son properly, and it was by a friend whom I thought was a very good friend.'

'Lawfully killed': An inquest into the death of Mark Duggan, 29, said he had been 'lawfully killed' by police but they were criticised over the way they dealt with intelligence. The IPCC said it is pursuing 'a number of significant lines of inquiry' Police firearms officers are to be banned from conferring after fatal shootings in the wake of the death of Mark Duggan. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is drawing up guidance to stop the practice of allowing marksmen to discuss what happened before they produce statements. The police watchdog announced the move yesterday as it apologised to the Duggan family for releasing wrong details about his death. Conferring over notes is currently allowed in guidelines set out by the Association of Chief Police Officers. But there have been a number of attempts to stop firearms officers comparing notes following a series of high-profile police shootings, including that of barrister Mark Saunders who was killed during a siege in London in 2008. His family tried to have an IPCC investigation into his killing ruled unlawful because officers talked among themselves before providing statements. They failed, although Mr Justice Underhill agreed that conferring opened the gates for institutionalised collusion. Mark Duggan’s family sought a judicial review of police protocol on the issue, but were unsuccessful. Now the IPCC – which has itself called three times for conferring to end – wants the Home Secretary to sign off statutory guidance forcing officers to separate before they give statements on fatal incidents, including deaths in custody. IPCC deputy chairman Rachel Cerfontyne said: ‘We will expect police officers to comply with it.’ The IPCC is still pursuing lines of inquiry following the conclusion of Duggan’s inquest last week. Investigators want to talk to officers involved in the case who have refused to be interviewed in person. The gangster was shot by a Scotland Yard marksman in August 2011. The inquest jury found he was lawfully shot, despite not having a gun in his hand. The IPCC was criticised for failing to contact his family in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and for initially wrongly telling journalists he had fired a shot. Rachel Cerfontyne, deputy chairwoman of the police watchdog, revealed the body is trying to speak to officers who have either so far refused to be interviewed or who have given conflicting accounts of what happened. Seeking justice: Mr Duggan's aunt Carole (pictured) claimed he had been 'executed' and his family have vowed to fight for justice. The IPCC was heavily criticised for failing to contact his family in the immediate aftermath of his death . Although the inquest concluded that . Mr Duggan had been 'lawfully killed' it criticised the Metropolitan . Police and Serious Organised Crime Agency over its intelligence . regarding the 29-year-old collecting the gun. The . inquest finished last week but the IPCC is still trying to clarify . inconsistencies over how the police acted by speaking to people who have . given information that contradicts 'other evidence'. It . is set to issue new guidance that will ban officers from conferring . before giving statements in the aftermath of fatal shootings. The . police watchdog has apologised to the family of Mark Duggan, whose . death sparked the London riots of 2011. Ms Cerfontyne said she . 'sincerely apologised' for the media being 'wrongly' told he had fired . at police before he was shot. She . stressed the watchdog is determined to speak to witnesses who have so . far refused or have given potentially misleading information. 'We . expect police officers to cooperate fully with us if required, . including answering questions at interview, something they have so far . refused to do.” Mr . Duggan’s family and their lawyers met with chairwoman of the IPCC Anne . Owers and Ms Cerfontyne on Tuesday to discuss the watchdog’s . investigation. Relatives of . the father-of-six were left furious at the inquest finding that he was . lawfully shot by police, despite not having a gun in his hand at the . time. The . IPCC was also heavily criticised for failing to contact his family in . the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and for initially wrongly . telling journalists that he had fired a shot. Ms . Cerfontyne added: 'We know that the family’s confidence in us and our . investigation was damaged by mistakes made in the early stages - both in . relation to inaccurate information we provided to the media, and the . initial management of the incident. 'I . would like again to record my sincere apology to them that on the . evening that Mark was fatally shot by a police officer a member of our . staff wrongly led the media to believe that he had fired at police . officers. I fully understand the damaging impact of this.” 'This inquest and our own review of the way we investigate deaths show the problems that can arise when officers confer when writing up their notes following fatal incidents,' she said. 'We have therefore decided to issue our own statutory guidance on post-incident management following death or serious injury. The guidance will cover conferring and the separation of officers. Legally, we have to consult on the content of this guidance. 'Once agreed by the Home Secretary, we will expect police officers to comply with it, and call them to account if they do not.' Police believed he planned to collect a gun from another man, Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, and then go on to Broadwater Farm, also in Tottenham. Officers involved in the case have refused to be interviewed in person by the IPCC, only agreeing to answer questions in writing. Dame Anne Owers said their failure to co-operate had delayed the inquiry by nearly a year. Deb Coles, from the charity Inquest that has backed Mr Duggan’s family since his death, said: 'I think the failure of police officers to agree to be interviewed is one of the most contentious issues following deaths in police custody. 'It’s one that has caused serious concern and frustration among bereaved families. 'If you are a citizen you have the right to silence but an inference can be drawn from it, and you would be pursued.

New parents Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall may choose a name for their daughter in honour of a past Queen. Zara gave birth to a baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital this morning, with her husband Mike Tindall present at the birth. The weight of the baby was 7lbs 12oz, Buckingham Palace announced today. The Princess Royal broke with tradition and gave her daughter Zara - a name not associated with the British Royal Family. Princess Anne (seen today at her estate where her new granddaughter is believed to be) broke with tradition and gave her daughter Zara a name not readily associated with the British Royal Family . But Zara and Mike could pick a moniker for their baby that harks back to monarchs of the past. Among the favourites with bookmakers are Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria and Anne. Queen Charlotte, who was born in 1744, was married to George III. Charlotte was actually her second name - her first being Sophie. A keen botanist, she founded Kew Gardens, had 15 children - 13 of whom survived - and was a patron of the arts. Some historians have argued that she was of African descent. Her daughter, born in 1766, was also called Charlotte and later known as the Princess Royal. Zara and Mike could pick a moniker for their baby that harks back to monarchs of the past . George IV also named his only child Charlotte, but she died in childbirth at the age of 21, leading to a mass outpouring of grief across the nation. Elizabeth is a highly respected name amongst the monarchy. The Queen is held in great respect by her family. Zara's great-grandmother the Queen Mother was also Elizabeth. Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch who ruled from 1558 until 1603. Victoria would pay tribute to the longest reigning British monarch so far. Victoria ruled for more than 63 years, acceding to the throne in 1837. Britain had evolved into a constitutional monarchy. Anne, seen, with Zara on her Christening day, has a close relationship with her daughter, who has praised her parenting skills and hopes to follow in her footsteps . She became the figurehead of a vast empire and her reign spanned the rest of the century. She married Prince Albert and had nine children, but mourned his early death for the rest of her life. Anne could refer to either Zara's mother, the Princess Royal, or Queen Anne, who was the last of the Stuart monarchs. She became Queen aged 37 in 1702 and reigned until her death in 1714. Married to Prince George of Denmark she gave birth to more than a dozen children but none survived her. Anne suffered from poor health and her weight ballooned towards the end of her life. As speculation grew around what the baby's name would be, one person said that Zara had expressed a liking for the name 'Poppy'. Adele Horton, 30, said her brother Tom spoke to Zara at a rugby match in November. Miss Horton, a support worker from Gloucester, said: 'My brother was down at the rugby and he quite often sees Zara because she is sometimes down in the stands. 'He saw her at the Japan game on November 12 and told her that his girlfriend was due the same time and that they were thinking about the name Teddy, so she better not steal it. 'She was having a joke back and saying that they were thinking of Poppy - so maybe that will be the name.' Bookies have placed odds on a variety of names, including:  3/1 Charlotte, 5/1 Victoria, 6/1 Anne, 7/1 Elizabeth, 9/1 Catherine, 10/1 Emma, 10/1 Isobella, 14/1 Grace,14/1 Sarah, 14/1 Zara, 16/1 Emily, 16/1 Sophie, 20/1 Phillipa, 20/1 Zoe, 25/1 Polly, 50/1 Linda.","Among bookmakers' favourites are Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria and Anne .

Epidemic: The report warns half of Britons will be obese by 2050 (file picture) Dire warnings that half of Britons will be obese by 2050 are an ‘underestimate’, a shock report warns today. The obesity epidemic could be far worse than predicted because experts did not factor in how much fatter we are getting as we age, it says. The report blames junk food firms for confusing the public about healthy eating, and says ministers and GPs are failing to get a grip of the problem, with NHS systems ‘not fit for purpose’. More than a quarter of adults (26 per cent) are obese, up from just 8 per cent in 1980. In 2007, an alarming government review warned that by 2050, obesity would affect half of all adults and cost the economy £50billion a year. Yet a report by the National Obesity Forum says the predictions were ‘optimistic’ and underestimated the ‘true scale of the problem’. The forum – which comprises doctors and other experts – says the Government is focusing too much on prevention rather than helping those who are obese lose weight. It also describes a reward system for GPs, which pays them to record whether patients are too fat without having to offer any dietary advice, as being ‘unfit for purpose’. Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist at Croydon University Hospitals, South London, said obesity was ‘the greatest threat to health worldwide’. He said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical inactivity, smoking and alcohol combined, and accused junk food firms of adopting strategies of ‘denial’ and trying to confuse the public to ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products. Dr Malhotra said the companies were using the same tactics as those used by the tobacco industry 50 years ago when evidence first emerged that smoking caused lung cancer. ‘Junk food companies sponsor sporting events and athletes endorse sugary drinks, with advertising that targets the most vulnerable members of society, including children,’ he said. Professor David Haslam, chairman of the forum, said that if anything, levels of obesity had worsened since the 2007 report which influenced several government policies. Scroll down for video . Increasing problem: A quarter of adults in Britain are obese, up from just 8 per cent in 1980 . He said: ‘Not only is the situation not improving, but the doomsday scenario set out in that report might underestimate the true scale of the problem. There needs to be concerted action. We’ve seen hard-hitting campaigns against smoking and it’s time to back up the work that’s already being done with a similar approach for obesity.’ The Government has come under fire for failing to tackle obesity and campaigners including TV chef Jamie Oliver have condemned its plans as ‘inadequate’ and ‘a cop-out’. There is also widespread scepticism about its flagship ‘responsibility deal’ policy whereby food and drinks firms promise to make products healthier without facing any penalties if they don’t. Campaigners have accused ministers of ‘cosying up’ to the manufacturers and putting ‘Dracula in charge of the blood bank’ by allowing them to set their own rules. Criticised: The National Obesity Forum have claimed the NHS system in place to deal with the problem is not fit for service . Today’s report also criticises the Government’s Change 4 Life drive – which uses adverts to encourage the public to eat healthily and take exercise for not having enough of an impact. The initiative has cost the taxpayer £75million since it was launched in January 2009 but the report says a harder-hitting campaign is needed. It also urges GPs to regularly offer dieting and exercise advice for obese patients whenever they come in for appointments. Doctors shouldn’t worry about insulting patients by implying they are ‘fat’, the report states. One reason the scale of obesity may have previously been underestimated is that experts had not accounted for the fact that most of us get gradually fatter with age. Research by Glasgow University in November showed that 85 per cent of men and 77 per cent of women are either obese or overweight when they reach 65. Scepticism: TV Chef Jamie Oliver has condemned the Government's efforts to deal with obesity as 'inadequate' and 'a cop-out' A damning report by the World Health Organisation in October warned that the UK had the worst obesity rates in Europe and said the problem was a ‘ticking time bomb waiting to explode’. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘England has one of the highest rates of obesity in the Western world and it causes dangerous and life-limiting health conditions such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. ‘But this is not just a matter for government – we look to industry, health professionals and voluntary groups to work jointly to help individuals improve their diet and lifestyles.’ Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England – the government body tasked with tackling obesity – said: ‘Obesity is an international problem. It is a complex issue that requires action at national, local, family and individual level.’","Damning publication suggests half of Britons could be overweight by 2050 .

"By . Fiona Macrae . PUBLISHED: . 09:40 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:49 EST, 13 January 2014 . Nine women in Sweden have received womb transplants and will soon try to conceive. Derya Sert (pictured), from Turkey, had a transplant in August 2011 and subsequently conceived but she miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy . The first baby from a donor womb could be born next year after nine childless women received transplants. The women, who were born without a womb or had it removed due to cancer, received organs donated by close relatives. They will soon try to become pregnant through IVF in a pioneering trial in Sweden that gives hope to thousands of childless women in the UK. The new wombs, taken from a mother or other living relative who has completed her family, will not only allow the women to experience the joys of pregnancy but will mean they have babies that are genetically their own. Those whose mother was the donor will be using the womb that carried them for nine months to carry their baby. The groundbreaking transplants bring hope to at least 15,000 British women of childbearing age. However, the method is controversial because it involves taking wombs from living donors. The Swedish team favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a better immunological match. Other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not  life-saving. They say the best option is to use an organ from a dead donor. This allows them to transplant extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. Dr Mats Brannstrom, of the University . of Gothenburg, who spent more than a decade perfecting the complex . surgical techniques needed, said: ‘This is a new kind of surgery.’ He . added that the women who received new wombs are doing well and will . soon try to become pregnant using IVF – but there are no guarantees of . success. The Swedish women all received wombs donated by living female relatives. Image shows the University of Gothenburg team practising how to carry out the operations . Richard Smith, head . of Womb Transplant UK, says the charity is ready to give five British . women wombs from dead donors, subject to receiving ethical clearance . and raising the £500,000 required to cover the cost of surgery. ‘We are . good to go, save for the fact we haven’t got any money,’ he said. Mr . Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon, described the Swedish . breakthrough as ‘amazing’ and said a successful birth would bolster . similar projects around the world. Any babies the Swedish women bear are . likely to be delivered by caesarean section and the new wombs will be . removed after only one or two pregnancies. The . women are on powerful immunosuppressant drugs but the biggest worry is . how well a transplanted womb will cope with the strains of pregnancy, . during which the womb swells from the size of a pear to that of a melon. Critics question the process, with fertility expert Lord Winston saying . the risks are too great and some women should accept that they will . never bear children. The women will not be able to conceive naturally as their wombs are not connected to their fallopian tubes. They will have IVF treatment to allow them to become pregnant with embryos they previously had frozen . Those in favour say it is the only way for some women to fulfil their deep-seated yearning to have a baby. Experts say the operations will only be considered a success on the birth of a healthy baby. Dr . Yacoub Khalaf, medical director of the Assisted Conception unit at . Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London, said: ‘What remains to be seen . is whether this is a viable option or if this is going to be confined to . research and limited experimentation.’ The . world’s first womb transplant took place in Saudi Arabia in 2000. However, the woman’s body rejected the donated organ after four months. Turkish doctors performed a successful transplant in 2011, but patient Derya Sert lost her baby during pregnancy last year. The womb recipients all had their transplants after either being born without a womb or having it removed because of cervical cancer.

Two British backpackers had an amazing escape when a 50ft tree came crashing down on an Australian campsite - landing where their tent had just been. Robert Costley and Peter Ashford, both, 25, pitched their tent under giant eucalyptus tree for nine days, but moved to a shadier spot to escape the searing 40C (104F) heat. Just two hours later the pair said they heard a 'boom' at their campsite in the isolated town of Shepparton, in rural Victoria, as they slept on Wednesday morning. Robert Costley (left) and his friend Peter Ashford (right), 25, had a lucky escape when a tree fell on to a spot where they had been camping just minutes before . The pair had been camping underneath this 50ft eucalyptus tree for nine days, but moved to a shadier spot because of 40C (104F) heat . However the pair said their brush with danger hadn't dampened their spirits. Mr Ashford said: 'If it had hit the van it would have ruined our plans but we would have worked something out. As long as you have your health that's all that matters.' Since the incident, the campers have become a local media sensation. Their story dominated the front page of the Shepparton News and they have since had visits from curious locals. Mr Ashford said: 'We were really surprised to be honest; we didn't think it was a big deal but I guess it is for such a small town.' Their story could have ended very differently had it not been for the heat. Peter said: 'We had been walking round the town and were in agony because of the heat. Kind of like Kevin and Perry. Luckily their van (pictured) also escaped unharmed so they will be able to continue their travels . The story made the front page of the local newspaper and they have since had residents come and speak to them about their lucky escape . 'We had spent nine days in that one spot but due to the heatwave we moved to find shade. It's been 40C plus for a good few days.' They were later told by a local woman that either the relentless heat or an infestation of white ants could have caused the tree to topple. Mr Ashford said: 'A local lady said they call them widow makers. They hadn't seen anything as big as this tree fall on the site before.' They now plan to spend nine days in the town picking fruit before heading for New South Wales.

Found sleeping: Charles Franklin (pictured) denies raping a lesbian on a pub floor in Clifton, Bristol. He says he offered to charge her phone and 'one thing led to another' A lesbian wedding guest has recalled her horror at waking up after leaving the reception in the early hours of the morning to find she was being raped, a court heard. The 30-year-old was described as being 'a couple of drinks away from paralytic' when she left the function. Her next memory is waking up naked on the floor of Somerset House pub in the upmarket area of Clifton, Bristol, being raped by Charles Franklin, a jury was told. She alleges he threatened to break her neck if she struggled and only managed to escape by climbing out of a window after he fell asleep. Franklin, also 30, denies rape and claims that 'one thing led to another' after he offered to charge her mobile phone at the pub. In a police interview the day after the alleged assault, the woman told officers she left the function at 1am after 'a lot of drinking'. She could not remember leaving but analysis of the alcohol in her system showed she had three times the drive-drive limit at 3.45am. 'The next thing I remember was being on the floor of this pub with a guy,' she said. 'He stripped me. He was trying to force himself on me. I was struggling quite a lot. 'He told me if I kept struggling he would break my neck, so I let him do what he wanted.' After the attack the man sat at the bar and watched TV while she lay naked on the floor, she claimed. 'I managed to find my coat and I pretended to be asleep so he wouldn't come back,' she said. 'I looked around to see where the doors were. I decided to get up to see if there was a toilet or a window.' She said she could not find a way out and the pair went upstairs to a bedroom where the man tried, but failed, to have sex with her again before falling asleep. The alleged victim then put on Franklin's jeans and T-shirt before climbing out of a window. Charles Franklin is pictured leaving Bristol Crown Court where he is charged with raping a lesbian. He was found by police the morning after the alleged assault asleep in the Somerset House pub (above right) in Clifton . Once out of the pub she went to a kebab van and borrowed a mobile phone to call her mother, who came to pick her up. 'She got straight in the car and said, ""I've been raped"",' her mother told Bristol Crown Court. Police later found Franklin's wallet in the jeans pocket and tracked him down to the pub, where he was still asleep at 9am. Nurse Michelle McTigue, of The Bridge sexual assault referral centre in Bristol, said she examined the woman and found she had cuts and scrapes to intimate areas. Franklin, of Withywood, Bristol, denies rape and attempted rape. The case continues.","Woman left wedding reception in early hours of the morning after 'a lot of drinking'

Anita Trewick, 42, was in agony with excruciating headaches and regular black-outs but 999 crews dismissed the serious bleeds on the brain as sinusitis. But two sets of paramedics who were called to the teaching assistant’s home on December 16 and 18 both failed to spot the tell-tale signs of the deadly condition. Anita Trewick and her husband, Dean, were twice told by paramedics that she was suffering from a virus when, in fact, she had had two brain haemorrhages . And despite her first-aid trained husband Dean, 50, telling medics he feared it might be a stroke or blood clot, she was left at home and prescribed painkillers. When she was finally diagnosed on December 19 with the life-threatening haemorrhages, doctors had to battle to save her life in an emergency six-hour operation. Miraculously, she survived and is recovering at home in Welton le Marsh, Lincolnshire. The furious couple are now demanding an apology from East Midlands Ambulance Service who confirmed they are investigating the matter. Mrs Trewick has criticised the paramedics who left her a ‘ticking time-bomb’ and accused them of ‘leaving her to die’. She said: ‘It was an awful time in my life, I was in agony - I thought my head was going to explode, it was that painful. Mrs Trewick (pictured with her husband before her illness) called paramedics on December 16 and December 18 when she suffered excruciating headaches. Both times she was left at home with painkillers . ‘I knew something was wrong, but you have to listen to the paramedics when they give you the answers. ‘It . has been horrific not just for me but for my family and friends, I was . scared and didn’t know what was going to happen to me. A brain haemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain. It can be caused by a head injury but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a ruptured aneurysm. Symptoms include a sudden, very severe headache, vomiting, fits, loss of consciousness and sudden death. A brain haemorrhage is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment. The two treatment options are using medication to prevent further bleeding, and surgery to repair the source of the bleeding. Haemorrhages most often occur as the result of a brain aneurysm bursting - a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel's wall. People who smoke, drink heavily, have poorly controlled high blood pressure or who have a family history of aneurysms are most at risk. About 65 per cent of brain haemorrhage patients survive but many find their recovery slow and frustrating. About 9,000 people in the UK have a brain haemorrhage every year. Four out of five patients are aged between 40 and 65. They are more common in women than men. Source: NHS Choices . ‘Day to day life is hard, although I am trying to get back to full health and hopefully be who I used to be, but it will be a long road. ‘I am very disappointed with the East Midlands Ambulance Service and definitely feel they could have done more. I was just hours from dying. ‘They gave me a death sentence and I want changes to be made and I don’t want this happening to anyone else. ‘No family should have to go through what my family have had to endure in these past few weeks. ‘I am just glad to be here and feel so lucky that I am alive and with my children and husband again.’ Mrs . Trewick suffered the first haemorrhage on December 16 and the second on . December 18 - but on both occasions paramedics failed to spot the . deadly bleed on the brain. Her GP finally sent her to Boston Pilgrim Hospital on December 19 where she was diagnosed. She was then taken to Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre where she underwent a gruelling operation to save her life. From her hospital bed she even sent text messages telling her husband that she feared she was going to die. One read: ‘I am frightened and scared and don’t know the outcome.’ Mr . Trewick, an operations manager, added: ‘It was horrific - I thought, . how can I tell our five boys what has happened to their mum and that she . might die. ‘Lots of different things were flooding through my mind, she is the engine of the family, I don’t know what we’d do without her. On December 19 Mrs Trewick went to her GP who was so concerned about her health that she was sent straight to hospital where she was diagnosed and had a six-hour emergency operation to save her life . ‘It was pure fight how she pulled through, no-one knows medically how she managed it, it truly is a miracle. ‘The . nurses in the hospital nicknamed her Wonder Woman and a few people have . been putting that in her get well soon cards, it has stuck and it is a . fitting nickname. Mrs Trewick has now been released from hospital but she is still struggling to walk and talk normally . ‘However, I am absolutely furious with the East Midlands Ambulance Service. I am no professional, far from it, but you can Google the symptoms she was suffering from and it comes back with meningitis or a haemorrhage. ‘Out of five medical professionals none of them managed to work out what was wrong with her and I think that is wrong. ‘The thing that makes matters worse is they were telling me to just give her strong painkillers, which I already was. ‘They just said she had sinusitis, you have to trust the medical professionals, you think they know best. ‘She was in floods of tears and she is not the sort of person to cry, she had an extremely high pain threshold. ‘Essentially, I was just feeding her a time bomb, I was, without knowing, trying to clear a brain haemorrhage with painkillers. ‘It was only when I decided to take her to our doctors’ surgery they said get her to a hospital right away, so I did, I drove her there myself. ‘They were very worried and took her in for tests straight away and that was when I got really worried - I thought she was going to die. ‘Since all this has happened, I have heard nothing from the ambulance service, I want this to be stopped. ‘I don’t want this happening to another family because it may be worse than what we had to go through.’ Mrs Trewick was finally discharged from hospital to go home with her family on January 6. Mr Trewick has now made a formal complaint to the ambulance service about the treatment his wife received . She still needs help walking and struggles to talk but the family are hopeful she can make a full recovery. Mr Trewick added: ‘She is getting better day by day now, I assist her to walk, her brain still doesn’t give messages to her body correctly sometimes and simple words can be a struggle but we are just happy she is alive.’ A spokesperson for the East Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘Mr Trewick has submitted a formal complaint about our response to his wife’s illness and we have launched an investigation to establish the facts. ‘As soon as this is complete, we will pass on details of our findings to him direct.’","Anita Trewick, 42, had brain haemorrhages on December 16 and 18 .

A women who ate as many as three takeaways a day has shed five stone - after she got so fat her throat closed. Melissa Dowell, 26, was a healthy size 12 when she started university in 2006 but piled on the pounds when she began gorging on takeaway food. She piled on five stone in four years - a mammoth three stone in her final year - and graduated university weighing 15 stone. Melissa Dowsell, pictured at her graduation in July 2010, piled on the weight while at university by eating up to three takeaways a day . Melissa's wake up call came when her throat closed up when she was relaxing on the sofa one day, crushed by the excess fat round her neck . Crippled with embarrassment, Melissa felt she was too fat to leave her home and did not want to see old friends who knew her before she piled on the pounds. But a turning point came when she was reclining at home on the sofa. As she lay back she felt her throat close up and was unable to breathe as the weight of the additional fat on her neck was suffocating her. Although Melissa was able to pull herself upright again, relieving the pressure on her throat, the incident terrified her, motivating her to address her weight issues. She joined a slimming class the next day and, spurred on by an invitation to be a bridesmaid at her sister’s wedding, slimmed down to a svelte size 10. Paralegal Melissa, from Monmouthshire, South Wales, said: 'The turning point came when I was sitting on the sofa and I just couldn’t breathe because my neck was so fat. I had to sit up straight to breathe again, it was frightening. Melissa was spurred on in her weight loss by an invitation to be a bridesmaid at her sister Rhiannon's wedding, pictured . 'I was literally suffocating under my own weight. I didn’t want to be fat anymore - it just wasn’t me. 'I realised then that I had to step up and do something.' Melissa, who was studying criminal psychology, would sometimes eat three takeaways a day while at university in Glamorgan. Her favourite breakfast was a double egg McMuffin, followed by pasties for lunch and a carry out for dinner. She smoked 20 cigarettes a day, did absolutely no exercise and snacked on family sized bags of sweets. Melissa said: 'Before I went to university weight was never really an issue. Melissa, pictured right in her third year of university in 2009, used to live off unhealthy processed takeaways as well as snacking on biscuits and crisps . 'I lived in a small town and when I went to uni suddenly I was surrounded by takeaways - I had never even heard of Dominoes before I went to uni. 'But here I was for the first time fending for myself and I just put on weight right from the beginning. 'But my final year I put on about three stone in a year. Breakfast: McDonalds double sausage and egg McMuffin . Lunch: Greggs pasties or huge sandwich and a packet of crisps. Tea: Chocolate biscuits and crisps. Supper: Takeaway mostly or lasagne with lots of garlic bread. Snacks: A whole packet of chocolate digestives and share-size bags of chocolates. Breakfast: Yoghurt or fruit . Lunch: Ham salad or vegetable sushi . Dinner: Chicken or fish with rice and vegetables . Snacks: Freddo chocolate or fruit . 'I didn’t want to go out because I just felt so uncomfortable with myself, but then I wanted to have a treat so I would eat takeaways - it was a vicious circle.' But once she joined Weight Watchers the pounds fell away and she was spurred on by sister Rhiannon, 32, who asked her to be a bridesmaid when she married partner James. Melissa added: 'My absolute nightmare was walking down the aisle as a fat bridesmaid - I couldn’t have done it. 'She got married in March last year and by that time I had lost four and a half stone. 'My dress was a size 12 and I had to have it taken in - it was an amazing feeling. 'When I looked back at all the pictures of the amazing day it was so worth it. Melissa says she is now healthier and slimmer than she has ever been, having totally overhauled her diet and lifestyle to shed over 5 stone . 'There were people there that hadn’t seen me for a couple of years and they said I looked great and I felt like I did too.' Melissa - who now weighs around ten stone - ran the Cardiff half marathon in 2012 and is just a few pounds away from her ultimate goal of losing a total of 75 pounds. She runs her own Weight Watchers class and is training to be a legal executive while saving up to by a house with new boyfriend Daniel, 27.

A tiny baby, wrapped in a blanket is freed from the remains of its home after a horrific air strike carried out by forces loyal to the Syrian leader. Children, their faces covered in thick dust mixed with their own tears, were hauled from the wreckage following the latest bomb attack on Damascus, in which a number of civilians were killed. Witnesses said they had seen military helicopters dropping devastating 'barrel bombs' on residential areas in the Douma district of the city. Men formed a human chain to remove the children from the rubble, as the terrified youngsters cried out in fear, many of them barefoot, their clothes blackened and torn in the blast. Rescue: A man carries a tiny baby, wrapped in a blanket, from the wreckage of its home after what activists say was an airstrike by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad . Innocent: The tiny infant, dressed in a blue baby-grow appeared to have survived the air strike unharmed . Saved: The baby is lifted high above the heads of rescuers as other children are also carried to safety . Other rescue workers carried the youngsters high above their heads as they desperately tried to carry them to safety. The strike, which activists say was carried out by forces loyal to Presiden Bashar Assad, came as the first batch of the most dangerous chemicals in Syria's arsenal were removed from the country after the leader bowed to pressure to hand them over. The chemicals were loaded onto a Danish ship and taken out of the country yesterday under tight security, an important milestone in the international operation to rid President Assad of the weapons by the middle of the year. The operation at Syria's port of Latakia took place against the backdrop of a widening civil war and escalating infighting between a chaotic mix of Syrian rebel brigades and an al-Qaida linked militant group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Terror: Men held an injured boy, whose dust-coated face is streaked with his own tears . Horror: A man desperately tries to take the child to safety . With the rebel-on-rebel fighting now in its fifth day, the shadowy leader of another faction affiliated with al-Qaida pleaded with his comrades to stop the spreading clashes, warning it threatened to upend gains made against Syrian government forces. The chemicals were supposed to have been removed from Syria by December 31, but poor security, bad weather and other factors meant the deadline was missed by a week. The raw materials - precursor chemicals for poison gas - were moved to the government-held port of Latakia from two sites in Syria and loaded onto the Danish cargo ship, which then set sail, said Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch diplomat coordinating the joint mission by the UN and Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 'The vessel has now left the port of Latakia for international waters,' Kaag said in a statement. 'It will remain at sea awaiting the arrival of additional priority chemical materials at the port.' Security for the highly toxic cargo is being provided by warships from Russia, China, Denmark and Norway. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the progress. The chemicals will eventually be transferred to a US ship, the Cape Ray, which has been fitted with special machinery. Once aboard the American vessel, the materials will be placed in a titanium reactor that uses heated water and other chemicals to render the weapons inert. Fear: The little boy cries as he is carried by his determined rescuers . Heroic: Men formed a human chain to remove the children from the rubble, as the terrified youngsters cried out in fear . Pressure: The strike came as the first batch of the most dangerous chemicals in Syria's arsenal were removed from the country after the leader bowed to pressure to hand them over . The confirmed use of chemical weapons in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta on August 21, killed hundreds of people, according to the US government. The US and Russia - a staunch ally of Syria - later reached agreement to eliminate the Assad regime's chemical weapons by mid-2014 in a deal that averted US military strikes against Syria. The infighting between rebel groups is concentrated in parts of northern Syria, spreading Monday to the northeastern city of Raqqa, a bastion of the al-Qaida-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group has alienated its opposition rivals, including the extremist Jabhat al-Nusra, for its extremely brutal tactics, including the kidnapping and killing of opponents, journalists and anti-government activists who criticize its practices. Moderate forces among the opposition accuse the group of tarnishing the Syrian revolution and serving Assad's interests. Devastation: The war, now in its third year, has killed more than 130,000 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Right, which keeps track of the fighting . 'The (Assad) regime will revive itself after it was close to disappearing,' said Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of Jabhat al-Nusra. His comments in a rare audio recording posted on a militant website underscored the seriousness of the clashes. The rising influence of al-Qaida extremists among rebel ranks has dampened U.S. support for the rebellion, and rebel infighting is further undermining the fight against Assad. The war, now in its third year, has killed more than 130,000 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Right, which keeps track of the fighting. The UN's human rights office said it has stopped updating the death toll from the civil war, confirming it can no longer verify the sources of information that led to its last count of at least 100,000 in July 2013. Destruction: Another strike in the Haydariyeh quarter of Aleppo killed at least six civilians . The rebel infighting adds another hardship to an already-suffering population. The .

Ever since Marijuana became legal in Colorado on January 1, pot-infused goodies have been flying high off the shelves. Many shops selling edibles have been unable to keep their cookies, sodas, and candies in stock after Colorado became the only US state to legalize sale of marijuana for recreational use as oppose to medicinal use only. The Denver Channel reports that there is such a demand for edibles that stores like LoDo Wellness in Denver have had to limit customers to only two edible products a day. Drug infused candies, chocolates, and drinks disappear from store shelves after Colorado becomes the first state to legalize weed for recreational use . Garrett Sellars, 21, shows an edible to Ashly Carius, 21, at LoDo Wellness . LoDo Wellness said that if they don't ration their products they will run out of stock. The new supply of edibles that LoDo got last week was sold in only one hour hour. 'Edibles have been really huge with the recreational market,' Linda Andrews, owner of LoDo Wellness Center in Denver, told ABC News. 'They're great if you're not a [marijuana] connoisseur and you want something more palatable,' she said. The most popular treats are marijuana infused chocolate bars for $15 and chocolate Dixie rolls that cost $17 per pack. Andrews also pointed out that edibles are more discrete than smoking marijuana. Andrews told ABC News that sales went up 300 per cent after selling marijuana for recreational use became legal. She previously only sold items to patients prescribed marijuana for medicinal use. One Marijuana manufacturer called Dixie Elixirs and Edibles is building a new 30,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in order to keep up with demand.

'Demand's been huge,' Chief Marketing officer of Dixie Elixirs Joe Hodas told ABC News. 'And our employees have been just killing it working 'round the clock.' Dixie creates marijuana infused chocolates, lotion, and soda drinks that come in different flavors. Hodas told The Denver Channel that the recreational marijuana market creates entirely new jobs. 'We're looking at upwards of 10,000 new jobs being created over the next few years,' said Hodas. Since marijuana stores can't use traditional messengers to deliver their services, there is a new collection of delivery services made for the sole purpose of delivering weed. 'We can't use traditional couriers to deliver our products,' said Hodas. 'Obviously we can't use mail.' Experts predict they will sell $2.3 billion in marijuana sales this year and $10 billion by the year 2019. Brook Gherig, owner of a weed company called Patients Choice told Time.com that predicting how much weed to order based on supply and demand has been difficult to calculate since the legal market is so new. 'We’re making businesses decisions,” she says, “based on a total unknown.' Twenty states and Washington D.C. allow medical marijuana sales. So far Colorado is the only state to sell the drug recreationally but Washington will alow the sale later this year.

News of the avid runner's tragic death has left the close-knit community heartbroken. Menzies was about a mile away from home when she was mowed down. The religious woman doted on her three young children, sons Gabriel and Whitfield and daughter Skye, and described herself as a 'full-time mom'. Doug Fernandez, who ran with Menzies in the Richmond Road Runners club several times a week, said the town was in 'shock'. He said Menzies was training for the Boston Marathon in April. 'We all like a big family. Total disbelief about it; it's just like it's not real,' he told WRIC.com. 'It's a total shock. Difficult [to] accept … don't know how we gonna get over this. She was a very happy, outgoing runner, the nicest person you could ever meet.' The Ashland Police Department - where Menzies' husband, Sergeant Scott Menzies, is stationed - is also mourning the young mom's death. 'Meg has equally been a part of our law enforcement family for nearly a decade and her presence in our midst, and especially that of her family, will be sorely missed,' Chief Doug Goodman said in a statement.

Former First Lady Barbara Bush has made another statement against her son Jeb's possible 2016 presidential run saying that there have to be more politically-involved families in America hoping for time in the White House. 'I think this is a great American country, a great country, and if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office that's silly because there are great governors and great eligible people to run,' she said in a new interview. 'I think the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes- there are just more families than that.' Twice is enough: Barbara Bush said that should her younger son Jeb decide to run for president in 2016, that would be pushing the amount of time that one family had been in the White House . The 88-year-old matriarch has made the same statement previously, and she stuck to her beliefs in the latest interview with C-SPAN but added a big compliment to her younger son. 'I would hope that someone else would run although there's no question in my mind that Jeb is the best qualified person to run for president,' she said. 'But I hope he won't because I think he'll get all of my enemies, all his brother's, all... and there are other families. I refuse to accept that this great country isn't raising other wonderful people.' She said that she wasn't 'arrogant enough' to think that she was part of the only family in America to raise children ready for the White House. Waiting in the wings: Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, is seen as a leading Republican candidate for 2016 and could make him the next Republican leader after his brother left office (seen at a 2004 rally for former President George W Bush's re-election) Political families: Though they are both potential front runners for their respective parties, Hillary Clinton and Bush appeared at the same event at the National Constitution Center in September . The interview appeared to be filmed in her home as there were framed family pictures on the table beside her, including one of her granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager at her wedding and two other pictures of subsets of the Bush family posed in front of Christmas trees. She also gave several of her grandchildren shout outs in the interview, praising their different ways of helping the world without going into politics. 'We're raising public servants, whether they're feeding the poor like Lauren is- who's fed 68 million children around the world- or Barbara who's bringing global health to the world or Pierce who's working for Big Brothers Big Sisters,' she said. 'There are a lot of ways to serve and being president is not the only one.' Skilled: Mrs Bush, seen here with her husband and Jeb in 2002 when he was running for re-election as the Governor of Florida, said that she has no doubt that he is the best qualified person for the job . In spite of his motherâ€™s vocal disapproval, Jeb Bush is still considered one of the leading candidates in the Republican field for the 2016 race. A Public Policy poll released today that examined potential candidateâ€™s standings in the primary battleground state of New Hampshire had the former Florida governor tied with Rand Paul for 12 per cent each and trailing Chris Christie who held on to 24 per cent of the votes in spite of the George Washington Bridge scandal. Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Bobby Jindal and Scott Walker all followed. The field is quite a bit more narrow for the Democrats, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the first pick for 57 per cent, followed by Vice President Biden with 10 per cent and Elizabeth Warren with 8 per cent.","The Former First Lady has repeatedly said that she thinks that there are too few families who have been in the White House .

It is known as the City of Sin, so it is perhaps no surprise to find that the porn industry is moving to Las Vegas after LA passed a law requiring performers to use condoms. As the industry struggles to survive in an age of free websites and amateur videos uploaded to the internet, producers looking to cut costs are also attracted by the cheap hotels, mansions and warehouses to use for their films. In a worrying development, many adult film makers are also using the move as a way to get around stringent health checks imposed in LA, including a law requiring all male performers to wear condoms, brought in after several actors tested positive for HIV. Cheeky: Since a law requiring all male performers to wear condoms in LA requests for permits have dropped 95 per cent, from 480 in 2012 to just 24 in the first nine months of 2013 . Several big name producers have already moved to Las Vegas, while experts predict it could house 20 per cent of the industry by the end of this year . The number of permits requested to make porn films in Los Angeles County has declined by an estimated 95 percent since the law took effect, according to Film LA, a private nonprofit that issues the licenses. The number of applications fell from about 480 in 2012 to just 24 through the first nine months of 2013. At the Adult entertainment Expo, taking place in Las Vegas this week, porn purveyor Jules Jordan warned reporters not to ask him about condoms, but said: 'It's not really an option to change the way we make our movies, and moving production isn't that hard.' In Clark County, in the state of Nevada where Vegas is located, there is no law requiring the use of prophylactics and performers are not even required to undergo health checks. The fees required to get a permit are also much smaller. Fellow producer Lee Roy Myers added: 'Las Vegas is a fresh town, and it's where people need the business.' Lee Roy Meyers, a studio owner and film producer, works on a film set featuring a hospital bed in his new studio in Las Vegas . The Adult Entertainment Expo, which is taking place this week, showcases just how big the industry has now become in the city. Here a photographer stashes his collection of images and signatures while apparently carrying a magazine copy of Superman . Myers says that Las Vegas, in town in which prostitution is legal and women can be ordered to hotel rooms for a minimal fee, was also less squeamish about his line of work than California. Sitting among child -sized desks in his classroom set, he said: 'They're used to it here because they already kind of have it. Figuring out how to make these things more cheaply won't include shooting in Los Angeles.' The studio sits in what was once another empty building on blighted Industrial Road behind the town's tourist corridor. Local officials appear content with the arrangement and have no plans to pass additional rules. 'It's a legalized industry and properly regulated, so I don't see it as a problem,' said Clark County commissioner Chris Giunchigliani. 'I think the city and the county will benefit from any expansion of the film industry. It's economic diversification.' Las Vegas is home to some major porn players, including Brazzers, Bait & Tackle, Corbin Fisher, VCX Ltd. and newcomer Bluebird Film. As film makers look to cut costs Vegas provides cheap hotel rooms, mansions and warehouses to use for shoots, charges less for permits, and worryingly doesn't require performers to have health checks . Vegas has also been less squeamish about the arrival of adult stars as prostitution is already legal and women can be ordered to rooms for minimal fees . Several producers with top porn purveyor Evil Angel are talking about moving to Las Vegas, according to owner John Stagliano, and enough porn stars have settled down in the area to supply all the extras a film could need, if not all the stars. Derek Hay, owner of adult talent agency LA Direct Models, opened an office here last autumn. He estimates that 20 per cent of the industry will have moved to Las Vegas by the end of the year. Some contrarians believe the boom will eventually lead Clark County to adopt the same regulations that are scaring the industry in Los Angeles. This September, the same group that championed the 2012 condom law started a similar campaign in Florida. For now, concerns about an eventual condom showdown in the desert are not stopping producers from making investments. Myers has several producers coming through his studio this week. After that, he will turn his attention to repurposing the cave set featured in the high fantasy spoof 'Game of Bones' for another pornographic parody, based on The Hobbit. Last year porn actors Rod Daily and his girlfriend Cameron Bay revealed they both had HIV and condemned the industry for putting profit before the health of performers . Campaigners have also launched a condom campaign against the adult industry in Florida and industry insiders believe it will only be a matter of time before Vegas is forced to follow suit . The star of both films, James Deen, a millennial porn icon who acted alongside Lindsay Lohan in 'The Canyons,' said moving the industry to Las Vegas is just a band aid. 'The issue with running to Vegas is it doesn't actually fix anything,' he said, taking refuge near a stairwell at the convention hall to avoid interruption by a constant stream of fans. 'We should explain to the people who put that law in place why it's unnecessary, and appeal it the same way any community would appeal any asinine law.' The controversial regulation was passed in 2012 after being championed by Derrick Burts, a former performer and HIV-sufferer, and following an industry shutdown in 2011 after another star contracted the virus - which causes AIDS. In 2013 there were three shutdowns in LA after several more performers tested positive for the virus. Performers Rod Daily and his girlfriend Cameron Bay also went public with their joint diagnosis of HIV in order to condemn the adult industry as putting profit before the health of their performers. And in another damaging blow to the industry's credibility a male performer was caught trying to book a webcam sex session with a female partner, only days after discovering he was infect with HIV.","Since law was passed requests for LA permits have dropped 95 per cent .

A young child with special needs was allegedly left on a council-run bus and driven to the depot after the driver failed to drop him off at school. The 10-year-old was travelling on a Wolverhampton City Council-run bus for pupils with learning difficulties. However, for reasons which are now the subject of an investigation the youngster was never dropped off at their stop on Wednesday morning. A 10-year-old child was left alone at the Wolverhampton bus depot, pictured, when the driver of the council-run bus failed to drop him off at school . Instead, the bus returned to the council depot in the town where the oversight was discovered, according to the local authority's transport boss. City councillor Phil Page said the council had suspended a driver and a bus escort following the incident while an investigation is carried out. Mr Page, council cabinet member for Schools, Skills and Learning, said the youngster had not come to any harm as a result of what had happened. However, he was unable to say exactly how long the pupil was on the bus before being discovered, adding it was one of the key questions the investigation will be expected to answer. 'When the bus arrived at the depot, it was then that the child was discovered,' said Mr Page. 'As far as I am aware, the child was never left in the depot by themselves. He was not locked inside. 'That is my understanding, but the matter is being investigated and we need to get the bottom of what exactly happened.' The pupil was travelling to Tettenhall Wood School, which caters for young people with severe or complex educational needs. The child was a pupil at Tettenhall Wood School, pictured, which caters for young people with special needs . Mr Page said he had not been told what the child's special educational needs were.

'There may have been some communication issues with the youngster but that's speculation at the moment and one of the things which the investigation will be trying to find out. 'If a child goes to a particular school, then they will know which one they have to get off for, but if there are communication difficulties it may not have been that straightforward.

Sixty years after Humphrey Bogart steered her through crocodile infested waters, the African Queen is back plying the Nile. Lovingly restored, the boat is operated by Cam McLeay, a New Zealand adventurer and Nile enthusiast, and took passengers for a ride in December. 'The African Queen belongs on the Nile. So it is so important to have the boat back home over 60 years after the film was made,' McLeay said. Classic: Lovingly restored the boat is operated by Cam McLeay (pictured) a New Zealand adventurer and Nile enthusiast who passengers for their first ride in December . In 1950 Bogart and Katherine Hepburn flew into Uganda together with a huge team from Hollywood to shoot the movie of the same name. The film told the story of a prim missionary and a gruff adventurer, the captain of the African Queen - two totally different characters - who in true silver screen fashion end up falling in love despite the odds. Hepburn wrote a frothy account of the making of the African Queen, which was shot between Uganda and neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, subtitled 'How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Houston and almost lost my mind'. Based on a 1934 novel by C.S. Forester, the movie was set during First World War in German-occupied east Africa. Fan: Cam McLeay (left), owner of the African Queen, stands on his boat with his colleagues on the River Nile in Jinja, Uganda . 'There were actually two of these boats, one of them was in Congo and this is the Nile's African Queen,' explained McLeay, who recounts his love affair with the Nile. 'I'm very attached to the Nile. I've travelled the full length of the river, from the Mediterranean to the source in Nyungwe,' the father of three recounted. 'I've been up and down the river for 16 years.' Back in the 1990s he set up a rafting company in Uganda's Jinja area, and then had an eco-lodge built on an island in the river. McLeay says he wants his projects to be sustainable - from both an economic and an environmental point of view. He then started thinking about a river boat to do trips and sundowner cruises for tourists, showcasing the scenery and the very varied birdlife. Picturesque: Gavin Fahey, skipper and the mechanic who repaired the African Queen, stands on the boat on the River Nile in Jinja, Uganda . Timeless: The African Queen boat sails on the Nile in Jinja, Uganda sixty years after Humphrey Bogart steered her through crocodile infested waters . 'Just on this section here, we have over 100 species of birds. It's just beautiful to be on the river here at the sunset on the Equator.' McLeay learned of the existence of the African Queen when on holiday on Kenya's island of Lamu, where traditional Arabic-style sailing dhows with lateen sails are common. 'I was looking for an authentic African boat to run on the Nile and I was thinking of buying a Swahili dhow,' he recounted. 'Then this hotel owner said: 'Why don't you buy the African Queen? She's from Uganda!' A week later McLeay had gone to Nairobi and tracked down Yank Evans, a septuagenarian who explained how he had found the hull of the boat abandoned in northern Uganda's Murchison Falls national park 20 years earlier and had done it up. When he left Uganda for Kenya he brought the boat with him. Authentic: McLeay learned of the existence of the African Queen when on holiday on Kenya's island of Lamu . Another five years went by between the boat's return to the banks of the Nile and the start of services on the river. One of the challenges was to rebuild the steam engine, which was more than 100 years old. In the movie, directed by John Huston and released in 1951, the boat was powered by a diesel engine that was made to look like a steam engine. But when Evans restored it he decided to fit a real steam engine and had one airfreighted from Britain. 'When we got this boat, the boiler had been sitting around for a very long time,' explained Gavin Fahey, the African Queen's captain and mechanic, adding that he had to strip down the engine and re-machine it. Adventure: Cam McLeay (right), owner of the African Queen, stands on his boat with his colleagues on the shores of the River Nile in Jinja, Uganda . McLeay explains that he has tried to recreate an atmosphere of times gone by on board his African Queen, the time when huge tracts of Africa were - for Western adventurers at least - still virgin territory waiting to be explored. 'Gavin wears the same kind of clothes as Humphrey Bogart. We have adopted the fez for the waiters, which is associated with the Sudan, where the Nile makes most of his journey', McLeay said. 'And we are serving gin and tonics, like Humphrey Bogart drank in the movie.' Keeping the engine fed with wood has virtually no environmental impact, McLeay says, since he is using wood left over from a construction project, and he has planted trees to ensure supply when that stock runs out. 'It's probably more environmental friendly then a modern boat,' he says.

Mothers-to-be who use nicotine patches or chewing gum could be making their children more prone to obesity. Children face an increased risk of obesity if their mother uses nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) such as nasal spray or lozenges, as well as the more common forms like nicotine gum. The dangers of smoking while pregnant are well established with years of advertisements reporting ‘smoking while pregnant harms your baby’. Past studies have shown the chances of a baby being obese doubles if their mother smoked during pregnancy, but the effect of nicotine supplements was not known. The new research suggests that not only do pregnant women who use NRT have smaller babies, but that within six months the nicotine has affected their liver so it produces more triglyceride - a sign of obesity. Dr Daniel Hardy of the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry at the Western University in London, Canada, said: ‘We knew smoking was bad during pregnancy. ‘But the problem is one fifth of pregnant women in Canada continue to smoke, and 30 prospective studies have shown us that that babies born to smoking mothers have a 47 per cent increase in the odds of becoming overweight. ‘And here's the interesting thing, that's even after adjusting for mum's diet and socio-economic status. ‘Our studies were designed to find if there is a biological basis between nicotine exposure from either NRT or smoking, and obesity and metabolic syndrome later in the offspring's life.’ Scientists found that lab rats which were given the same amount of nicotine, adjusted for weight, that an average smoker takes in a day had smaller babies, but that wasn't the most startling finding. Six months after they were given the dose, when they reached adulthood, the rats had developed an increase in liver and circulating triglycerides, a sign of obesity. Although NRT is still less harmful to the child than smoking, Dr Hardy said doctors may need to look more closely at the long-term safety and efficacy of nicotine in pregnancy on postnatal health and well-being. Despite the increased risk of obesity, using NRT remains safer for an unborn baby than smoking is . The scientists are now looking at whether folic acid could prevent or reverse the nicotine damage to the developing liver. Previously acid has been shown to reduce circulating triglycerides, and smoking mothers have been found to have low levels of folate, so scientists believe acid could be the key. Children and adults both require folic acid to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anaemia. The research is published online in the journal Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology.","Children face an increased risk of obesity in later life if their mother used nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during their pregnancy .

The FIS Ski World Cup is being held on the course this weekend, attracting skiers from across the globe to compete in downhill, slalom and combined events. Krenen can also be seen leaning through the twists and turns of the course by rotating the camera so it is facing backwards . The run was filmed at Lauberhorn in the Swiss Alps during the FSI Ski World Cup which is taking place there this weekend . Kernen is a professional skier who won gold in the 1997 Sestrières downhill event, along with a silver medal at the same event in the combined category, and a bronze medal at a different event in 2007. In 2003 Kernen won a bronze medal on this course in the downhill event, and has a corner of the track named after him after crashing there in 2006. This year marks the 84th annual Ski World Cup at Lauberhorn. The event is watched live by tens of thousands of spectators on the mountainside, and on television by over a million people each year.

Dog handler Corporal Adrian Dickson, who serves with the RAF Police, is on his first tour of Afghanistan. The final soldiers to leave Afghanistan as part of a planned reduction in troops will be back in the UK tomorrow. Around 75 soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Mercian Regiment (1 Mercian), are due to fly out of Camp Bastion. They are the last of 500 troops to leave the military base in time for Christmas, taking the number serving from 9,500 to 9,000. The Mercians will arrive back at RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, tomorrow, before returning to their base at Marne Barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, the following day. Yesterday, about 60 troops from the Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (1 Scots), also left Afghanistan. They will be reunited with their families tomorrow at their base, Dreghorn Barracks in Edinburgh. Since embarking on a six-month tour of Afghanistan in September, 1 Scots have been working with members of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in Camp Shorabak, which is the Afghan base attached to Bastion, in an advisory and training role. Speaking about the visit by the Princess Royal, he said: 'It's a big boost in morale. It means we're not forgotten about. 'A lot of the guys that are based in the unit are out in forward locations a lot of the time. We come back in every four to six weeks for two to three days at a time, so to get something as high profile as this is brilliant.' Cpl Dickson, 34, from Leigh in Lancashire, added: 'I'm going home this weekend for my R&R (rest and relaxation) fortnight and I'm most looking forward to seeing my family. It's a long time that we're out here, as we go for months of training away from home before the tour actually starts.' Broudreaux, a black Labrador, is said to have made two significant finds on his last tour. Princess Anne is the Colonel in Chief of 1 Scots, the Military Working Dogs Squadron and the Royal Logistics Corps. She also visited the Royal Corps of Signals and the Royal Free Hospital. Lieutenant Joe Littledale, 24, from south London, is a transport troop commander with the 7th Regiment, Royal Logistics Corps, which is responsible for receiving and organising all of the supplies and equipment coming into Camp Bastion. 'It's a great honour (to meet the Princess), it's great to know that people from back home are coming out here, especially our colonel in chief, who has been chatting and getting down with the troops,' he said. 'It gives us a chance to get all the kit out and have a play as well. She's seen a lot of changes in the processes and the kit that we use as she's been out to Afghanistan several times before, so she was able to talk to us about that and take a real interest in it.'

Quarterback for the New York Jets Geno Smith was on a Virgin America plane from Los Angeles bound for Fort Lauderdale Friday but never left the ground after a dispute with a flight attendant. According to multiple sources, the quarterback had an argument with a flight attendant over his headphones that culminated in his leaving the flight and being questioned by police at the gate. One Twitter user tweeted that Smith was spotted yelling at Virgin America staff members and being escorted off the flight by police. Airport altercation: Reports differ but Geno Smith did speak to police at the airport then leave without leaving the ground yesterday in LA . The Associated Press reports that another witness says Smith got up from his seat and asked to speak to a supervisor before leaving the plane of his own accord and speaking with police at the gate before leaving. According to ESPN the incident began when a flight attendant asked Smith to remove his headphones and switch off all electronic devices. Smith didn't immediately respond because he didn't hear the request. Police involvement: Smith was pictured speaking to police at the airport but no arrest was made . The flight attendant unplugged Smith's headphones and 'threw them down,' telling the quarterback he was a 'threat' and asking him to leave the plane, according to the source. Smith asked to speak with police, the person added. The New York Daily News reports that Smith was kicked off the flight after he refused to get off his cell phone after being asked by airline staff three times. Yet another report, recounted to Deadspin by yet another witness, tells a different story of Smith's police encounter that could be an entirely separate incident to the one that happened after boarding. 'We were waiting for our flight at LAX to Vegas and were put on standby on Virgin American just like Geno. We were told to get seat assignment at 2:40. Apparently Geno was not on board with that. My friend walked over to discuss seat assignment and Geno was saying to airline ticket agents, ""F***that, this is bulls***."" ""Why the f*** do I have to wait until 2:40."" He would not let it go. He continued to curse and be loud for about 5 minutes. Police were called. They talked for a few minutes and then 3 officers escorted him out of the terminal.' Scandals: Nursing student Jackie Presley says she and Smith had a liaison in early January and posted an intimate picture of him online . TMZ accosted the quarterback, who just finished his rookie season with the Jets, at the airport, where he denied the reports that he had been kicked off the flight. 'Don’t believe that,' he said. The TMZ reporter mentioned that he seemed calm, to which Smith responded, 'Always.' The New York Daily News spoke to Sergeant Belinda Nettles with Los Angeles World Airports who said, 'I can’t confirm any names or anything because there were no arrests made. But we did respond to a call, and the subject involved was questioned and released. 'We responded to an incident.

Haribo has pulled a line of liquorice sweets shaped like faces after a social media outcry from customers who consider them racist. The sweet manufacturer has stopped selling some parts of its bagged Skipper Mix in Denmark and Sweden. The product features black gummy sweets shaped like distorted faces or traditional African masks. Outcry: Users such as Saam Kapadia had tweeted about the black sweets . A spokesman said the sweets were themed around artefacts which 'a sailor who travelled the world' might have brought home. The imagery 'wasn't something we saw as having negative connotations', according to the head of Hairbo Sweden, Ola Dagliden. But the company had been faced with growing pressure on social media to act over the product, which had been on sale for years, and said that it decided to alter its product in response. One Danish user, Saam Kapadia, said that the sweets reminded him of a 'colonial legacy'. Translated into English, his tweet said: 'Multiculturalism, colonial legacy or the slave trade? #haribo skipper mix makes me think about Denmark and my Danish heritage.' 'Negative connotations': Haribo said it hadn't realised the potential for offence, and had removed the sweets in question from packets . Mr Dagliden said: 'We decided that we could keep the product while removing the parts that certain consumers found offensive.' 'It wasn't something we saw as having negative connotations.' A picture of the sweets was removed from Haribo Sweden's website on Friday. Other allegedly racist depictions of African and Asian people have sparked a heated debate in Sweden in the last few years. In November, the Swedish department store Aahlens said it had recalled a brochure featuring two blackfaced minstrels with big pink lips.

Australia admitted yesterday that its naval ships had illegally entered Indonesian waters apparently to turn back asylum seeker boats - thrusting the already-fractured relations between the two countries to a crisis point. Learning about the incursion into Indonesian waters, Jakarta immediately demanded that the right-wing government of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott suspend its tough policy of turning away boats carrying desperate asylum-seekers. Relations between the two countries are now at their lowest point in a decade, following revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden last year that in 2009 Australian government agents had tried to listen in to phone calls made by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The Australian navy ship HMAS Adelaide escorts asylum seeker boats off the coast of Christmas Island . Asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran cry as Indonesian officers force them to leave an Australian vessel. Asylum seekers from Middle Eastern countries often travel thousands of miles in rickety boats to seek refuge . In a statement issued last night, Indonesia said it deplored the Indian Ocean breaches and would ramp up its own patrols in areas where the Australian navy had intruded. Observers feared last night that this could result in physical clashes between Australian and Indonesian vessels. The crisis erupted after Immigration Minister Scott Morrison admitted yesterday (Fri) that Australian navy vessels had entered Indonesian waters while conducting border protection operations - believed to mean stopping people seeking asylum by 'gatecrashing' Australian territory. Jakarta responded immediately, declaring that 'the government of Indonesia deplores and rejects the violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Australian vessels. An Australian army quick moving rubber boat, preparing for an operation at sea to stop a Norwegian tanker (background) with asylum seekers aboard from docking on their shores . Asylum seekers bound for Australia are evacuated by Indonesian authorities from a tanker in Merak Port. Many of the asylum seekers come from countries like Afghanistan and Iran . 'The government of Indonesia underlines that any of such violation of whatever basis constitutes a serious matter in bilateral relations of the two countries.' In what was conceived as a threat that physical action might be taken should Australian vessels continue to violate Indonesian waters, Jakarta said that it had the 'right to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with international laws and the charter of the United nations.' Jakarta said it rejected Tony Abbott's recently-introduced polity to turn away Australian-bound boats carrying asylum-seekers who have made their way from countries such as Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, stopping off in Indonesia before boarding fishing boats to sail to Australian islands. The latest crisis comes in the wake of claims by a group of asylum seekers who were turned back to Indonesia that Australian naval ships had fired guns across the bows of their boat - a claim that Canberra has denied. Australian Prime MinisterTony Abbott has had a strict and long standing policy on asylum-seekers and immigration, but has only recently instituted a policy to turn boats away . The influx of refugees has been a source of tragedy in recent years, when in 2010, a boat full of asylum seekers bound for Australia crashed onto the rocks on Christmas Island. The survivors were rescued by a tanker, only to be turned away when they reached Indonesia . Almost as soon as those allegations had died down came the admission by Australia that its navy vessels had encroached into Indonesian waters to stop asylum-seeker boats from sailing on to Australian territory. Immigration Minister Mr Morrison admitted that there had been a 'number of incursions' by Australian vessels into Indonesian waters during what is known as Operationa Sovereign Borders. But it is not known whether the navy ships were at the time turning back asylum seeker boats or were there for other reasons. 'This was done unintentionally and without knowledge or sanction by the Australian government,' said Mr Morrison. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has now apologised to Jakarta - and Mr Morrison said a more formal apology would be passed to the Indonesian government.","Australian navy ships have been deployed in Indonesian waters .

A San Diego traffic court threw out a citation Thursday against a woman believed to be the first otorist in the country ticketed for driving while wearing a Google Glass computer-in-eyeglass device. Commissioner John Blair ruled that Cecilia Abadie was not guilty because she had been cited under a code that requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the device was in operation, which the officer did not provide. However, Blair did find that the language of the code specifically bars the operation of a video or TV screen or similar device on the front of a vehicle while it is moving - a provision that Blair said could be broad enough to apply to Google Glass. Scroll down for video . Defendant Cecilia Abadie smiles as she arrives at a traffic court in San Diego January 16, 2014. Abadie, ticketed for driving while wearing Google Glass, a tiny computer mounted on an eyeglass frame, appeared in the Southern California traffic court . The device in a kind of glass-wear frame features a thumbnail-size transparent display above the right eye. Abadie said she was happy she won her case but hoped the court would have ruled that Google Glass is legal to wear while driving whether activated or not. 'I believe it's an initial success but we have a long way to go,' said Abadie, wearing the device outside the courthouse after the ruling. Legal experts say the lower court ruling does not set a legal precedent but marks the beginning of a number of cases they expect courts to confront as lawmakers struggle to keep pace with fast-evolving technology. 'The fun is just starting,' said Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at Standford Law School. California Highway Patrol office Keith Odle, left, attorney William M. Concidine, center along with Cecilia Abadie, right, speak during a news conference, Thursday, Jan. 16, 2014 in San Diego . San Diego Court Commissioner John Blair shows printed materials used by a California Highway Patrol (CHP) witness during defendant Cecilia Abadie's Google Glass case in San Diego January 16, 2014 . From driverless cars to wearable devices that can enhance human functions, Wadhwa said, there are a host of legal questions to be answered. For example, when a Google-operated car is on the road and hits someone, who is responsible - the passenger, car manufacturer or software developer? Abadie, a software developer, is among thousands of 'explorers' who have been selected to try out Google Glass before the technology becomes widely available to the public later this year. Abadie was cited after being pulled over for speeding on a San Diego freeway in October and the California Highway Patrol officer noticed she was wearing Google Glass. Officer Keith Odle, a 10-year veteran of the CHP, testified Thursday that the 'hardware for this device was blocking her peripheral vision on her right side,' and that's why she sped by his patrol car at 85 mph in her Toyota Prius. Blair rejected that as speculation, noting that Odle had never worn the device. He also threw out Odle's documentation of her speed and found Abadie not guilty of that count. Defendant Cecilia Abadie (L) and her lawyer William Concidine speak to the media after appearing in traffic court to win her Google Glass case in San Diego January 16, 2014 . The commissioner also asked Odle to turn off his cellphone after it rang twice interrupting the proceedings. Abadie's attorney William Concidine said the device was not activated when she was driving and the code was irrelevant because it does not specifically state that drivers are barred from using Google Glass. He said Thursday he hopes the case will spur lawmakers to review legislation on the issue, otherwise the code will be open to interpretation by individual courts. The lightweight frames are equipped with a hidden camera and tiny display that responds to voice commands. The technology can be used to do things such as check email, learn background about something the wearer is looking at, or to get driving directions. Cecilia Abadie, left, wears a Google Glass computer-in-eyeglass device while her attorney, William Concidine, speaks to the media . Legislators in at least three states - Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia - have introduced bills that would ban driving with Google Glass. After the ruling, Google said it has warned early Glass adopters to exercise caution. 'Glass is built to connect you more with the world around you, not distract you from it,' Google said in a statement. 'Explorers should always use Glass responsibly and put their safety and the safety of others first.'","Cecilia Abadie, a software engineer, was wearing Google Glass when she was pulled over for speeding in San Diego in October .

At first glance these images may appear commonplace, but in actual fact they are highly realistic sculptures made from a single piece of pine. Artist Randall Rosenthal uses only Vermont white pine and acrylic paint to create these stunning designs, which look just like real-life objects. From flimsy newsprint, toworn trading cards, translucent pieces of tape and even deteriorating cardboard boxes, Randall creates them all in his workshop. What's even more impressive is that he doesn't work from a photograph or model, but instead creates each object as he goes, using only an image in his mind as a guide. After graduating from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in the late 1960s Rosenthal opened his first exhibition of surrealist paintings, a direction he pursued until the late 80s. His focus then shifted to architectural design and next into the realist sculptures he creates today.

In her role as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised possibility of giving Israel a green light to attack, it has been claimed . Hillary Clinton raised the possibility of giving Israel a green light to attack Iran when she was secretary of state, it has been claimed. She made the suggestion in 2010 when the U.S. were concerned that Israel might launch a unilateral air strike against Iran’s nuclear program, according to US sources. As officials discussed ways to dissuade the Israeli Prime Minister from taking unilateral action, it is claimed that Mrs Clinton then floated the idea that giving the green light for such a move could 'take care of the problem for' the US, one senior administration official quoted her saying reported Time. The report says that Mrs Clinton did not actually endorse the idea. It states she only raised the notion 'as one option to consider' according to one former official, who added that it was not considered inside the administration. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates writes in his new memoir, Duty that at a January 2010 Oval Office meeting, he told Mr Obama 'he needed to consider the ramifications of a no-warning Israeli attack,” including whether the U.S. would assist Israel and how it would respond to Iranian retaliation.' Earlier this week Iranian President Hassan Rouhani boasted to a cheering crowd that the United States and other world powers 'surrendered' to Tehran with the new nuclear agreement struck in Geneva. 'Do you know what the Geneva agreement means? It means the surrender of great international powers before the great nation of Iran,' the moderate leader told a home crowd. Yesterday the White House released a summary of the deal reached between six major world powers and Iran to curb its nuclear program, responding to calls from the U.S. Congress and other groups for more transparency about what the agreement entails. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said at a January 2010 Oval Office meeting, he told Obama 'he needed to consider the ramifications of a no-warning Israeli attack' Revelations: Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates signs copies of his new book during a book signing at the Pentagon in Washington . Iran has denied it wants to use the program to eventually build nuclear weapons but agreed to scale it back after the international community applied strict financial and oil sanctions. The six-month preliminary deal includes some relief from the sanctions as talks continue toward a broader, long-term deal. The White House gave Congress access to the full text of technical instructions for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) but released a detailed four-page summary of the deal to the public. Tension remains between Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani . 'It is the preference of the IAEA . that certain technical aspects of the technical understandings remain . confidential,' White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Wendy Sherman, the State Department's lead Iran negotiator, briefed lawmakers on the agreement on Thursday. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has been forced to wear a neck brace while on his book launch after breaking his first vertebrae after a fall. Mr Gates, former Central Intelligence Agency director for President George H.W. Bush and President Obama, fractured his neck after slipping on ice outside his home in Seattle at the beginning of the year. In 2008, Mr Gates broke his shoulder after slipping on ice, causing him to miss a congressional hearing. Some . walked out of the meeting saying it had heightened, rather than eased, . their concerns about negotiations between Iran and the United States and . five other world powers. 'I'm more disturbed more than ever after the briefing,' Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said. Mr Graham, a frequent critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy initiatives, is a co-sponsor of a bill opposed by the White House to slap new sanctions on Iran if it walks away from the negotiations. Iran agreed to stop production of 20 percent enriched uranium on or by Monday, Jan. 20, and to begin diluting half of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium. Over the next six months, the IAEA will verify a series of other curbs on enrichment and use of centrifuges. Iran's Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant: Under the new agreement, Iran must limit uranium enrichment and open its nuclear program to daily inspection by international experts starting January 20 . Iran is not allowed to commission or fuel the Arak reactor, and must stop producing and testing fuel for the reactor, the summary said. At the end of the six-month period, Iran will agree to 'a cap on the permitted size of Iran's up to 5 percent enriched uranium stockpile,' the summary said. IAEA inspectors will visit the Natanz and Fordow uranium enrichment sites daily, including both scheduled and unannounced inspections. Inspectors will visit the Arak reactor at least monthly, up from the current pace of one every three months, or longer. Iran agreed to provide design information for the Arak reactor and other access to related facilities, the summary said. The added inspections will 'enable the international community to more quickly detect breakout or the diversion of materials to a secret program,' the summary said. The European Union, Iran, and the six major powers (P5+1) that are part of the agreement will name a joint commission of experts to work with the IAEA to implement the deal and discuss any issues that arise.

A French restaurant group has been accused of aesthetic snobbery after allegedly seating guests according to attractiveness. Good-looking diners at two of the most famous Paris establishments run by the well-known Costes group are said to be automatically upgraded to the best tables in the house. The claims have been made by two former employees who also revealed that the same rules apply for staff with female hostesses needing ‘a model’s physique’ to be considered for the job. Benefit of beauty: Good-looking guests at famous Paris eatery Les Georges atop Centre Pompidou are said to be automatically upgraded to the best tables in the house . Guests at Le Georges, a restaurant at the top of Paris’ Centre Pompidou with stunning panoramic views of the French capital, and Café Marly, near the Louvre, are given tables following a strict appearance policy – the better looking they are, the better the table. ‘The good-looking ones are led to the good places, where they can be easily seen,’ they two former staff members told French weekly Le Canard Enchaîné. ‘As for the non-good-looking ones, it is imperative that they be dispatched to the corners of the room.’ If the staff seats a less aesthetically pleasing guest at a good table, they are told off along the lines of: ‘What are these ugly mugs doing at this table? Everyone can see them when they come in. It’s very bad for our image,’ The Telegraph reports. Face of the place: The rules applying to Cafe Marly by the Louvre ensures that 'beautiful guests' as well as 'model physique' front-of-house staff are seen by passers-by, while 'ugly' diners are placed in the back . The Costes group are run by brothers Thierry and Gilbert Costes and include several other restaurants and cafes in Paris, as well as hotels and cinemas. The latter has allegedly made a habit of lecturing his staff on the ‘beauty principle’ of the Costes group which is ‘There are good looking people, you put them here; there are bad looking people, you put them there!’ Those attempting to get around the problem by booking over the telephone are told that no promises on tables are made, so as to give hostesses a ‘get out of jail free-card’ should the guests have an undesirable visage. According to the sources, two ex-hostesses themselves, anyone over 30 – or under 170cm (approximately 5ft7in) - need not apply to work at the restaurant group. A spokesperson for the Costes group told The Telegraph they would not comment on the allegations.","Guests at Paris restaurants are seated following a strict appearance policy .

Shamed 'crystal methodist' Paul Flowers has reportedly installed gates around his vicarage to discourage couples from parking up to have sex there . Shamed 'crystal methodist' Paul Flowers has reportedly installed gates around his vicarage to discourage couples from parking up to have sex there. The disgraced former Co-Op bank chief lives for free in a church owned four-bedroom house near Bradford’s Brackenhill Park. Visitors to the area will often park at the end of his drive. But Flowers has now reportedly installed metal gates outside his home after it has become a popular dogging spot for couples, with up to three cars regularly pulling up outside his home. Flowers, 63, is currently suspended from his post as a vicar after it emerged that he allegedly took drugs and paid for sex with male escorts. Neighbours told the Daily Star Sunday that the cleric had repeatedly asked the couples to move, but that they kept coming back. They said: 'He got fed-up of asking them to move. So in the end he got the gates and that solved the problem. 'Paul only closes them at night and he’s happy for the drive to be used during the day by people visiting the park.' It comes after the Methodist - who is currently suspended while he is being investigated - publicly admitted he was appointed to the chair of the Co-op Bank only because he had ‘friends in high places’. The shamed banker’s admission was just one of a number of astonishing remarks he has made in a Twitter account opened last week. The statement came only days after Clive Adamson, the director of supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), shocked MPs by defending his appointment of  Rev Flowers – who nearly destroyed the Co-op Bank. Under a profile, believed to have been set up by Flowers, the Methodist minister apparently tweeted: ‘How do the FCA not concede that they were wrong to approve my appointment? I only got the position because I had friend’s [sic] in high places.’ Before Flowers’s spectacular fall from grace last November – when he was caught on camera paying for cocaine and crystal meth – he had been an important figure in the Co-op movement and the Labour Party. Labour leader Ed Miliband had been drawn into the affair as he had held a private meeting with Flowers in March 2013, a month before his bank lent Labour £1.2 million. Flowers and Mr Miliband had two other informal dinners and three other meetings. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls’s office was also given a £50,000 donation from the Co-op Group, but Mr Balls insisted he had had no direct contact with Flowers. The banker's bail for alleged drugs supply offences was extended last Tuesday until April . A spokeswoman for the Methodist Church, still providing Flowers with a salary and a home despite suspending him from his pastoral duties, said: ‘We cannot comment because we cannot be sure whether the account is genuine. ‘The position remains that he is suspended and we will hold our disciplinary process once the criminal process is complete.’ On Friday morning, Flowers claimed to have been taken to hospital overnight with, ‘a suspected heart attack & high blood pressure’ although by 8.36am he was, apparently, back at his Bradford home tweeting about it. When not planning his future or house-hunting, the subject of his first tweet last Sunday evening, his tweets have taken the form of ‘inspirational quotes’. On Wednesday it was Dolly Parton with: ‘If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain’. And on Friday it was US Second World War general George Patton: ‘I don’t measure a man’s success by how high he climbs, but how high he bounces when he hits bottom.’","Lives  in church owned 4-bedroom house near Bradford’s Brackenhill Park .

Stefanie Grant, 25, from London, was teased throughout her teenage years because she could not smile. Her severe underbite - which even stopped her eating properly - was so bad she had to have seven teeth removed when she was 13 and had to wear a brace until she was 23. Stephanie Grant, 25, is now able to smile for the first time (right) after having surgery to correct her severe underbite (left). Before the operation, she was in constant pain, couldn't eat normally and couldn't smile . But now, Ms Grant has finally had her condition corrected after more than a decade of pain and misery. When she was 11, a dentist first noticed a problem with the shape of her face. Ms Grant believes the development of the bones in her face was affected by the fact she was delivered using forceps. She underwent her first jaw and face surgery in August 2011 - the eight-hour op involved rotating her bottom jaw 9mm and moving it back towards her face. The top jaw was pushed 2mm forward and 2mm to the side and finally her jaw was then held in place with titanium plates and screws. After a further operation in December 2012 to remove the screws, Ms Grant is now almost completely recovered from her ordeal. Ms Grant (pictured before her operation) was bullied throughout her teenage years because she always looked sad. She says people called her 'long face' and 'freak' and told her she looked miserable . Ms Grant (pictured after her surgery) said: 'Being able to smile now, and show people that I'm happy, has been life changing. I still suffer from some numbness and pain, but it's a big improvement' The full-time blogger said: ‘Before the first surgery, my natural face just looked a bit sad. People used to tell me to cheer up and that I was miserable - but I wasn’t. ‘It was really hard to deal with, especially as a teenager, I felt like people didn’t see the real me, they just saw my face. ‘I was called a freak and long face, it was awful. The surgery was difficult and it’s been painful, but the difference is incredible. ‘Being able to smile now, and show people that I’m happy, has been life changing. ‘I still suffer from some numbness and pain, but it’s a big improvement, and the fact that I’ll now be able to eat correctly, is a huge relief.’ Ms Grant (pictured in hospital after her second operation) underwent her first jaw and face surgery in August 2011 - the eight-hour op involved rotating her bottom jaw 9mm and moving it back towards her face . Ms Grant (pictured in hospital after her second operation) had further surgery in December 2012 to remove the screws from her face and she is now almost completely recovered . Ms Grant said her face was not noticeably different until she reached the age of 11 when concerns were raised by a dentist about the shape of her face. She said: ‘I was referred to a hospital where I was eventually diagnosed with the condition and told that I’d need major facial surgery when I was older. About 4,000 such procedures are performed in the UK every year, Mr Luke Cascarini, Consultant Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon, told MailOnline. A severe underbite can be caused by either the upper jaw growing too much, the lower jaw not growing enough, or a combination of the two. It is most commonly caused by the lower jaw not growing enough, added Mr Cascarni, who works at North West London Hospitals and The Wellington Hospital. This can be surgically corrected by bringing the lower jaw forward. Surgeons achieve this by cutting through the jaw bone obliquely from inside the mouth and then sliding the jaw forward. Sometimes the upper jaw has grown too much and needs to be brought back. This procedure involves cutting out a segment from the middle of the upper jaw and then removing it and rejoining the bone. The surgery is funded by the NHS and takes about two hours. After the operation, most patients remain in hospital for one night and then need about two weeks off school or work to recover. They have to eat soft food for up to a month. ‘Suddenly I started looking at myself differently, and noticed all these flaws. ‘The older I got, and as my face grew, it became more asymmetrical with one side longer than the other. ‘It was just awful - sometimes I couldn’t speak or eat properly - I was very self-conscious.’ Her journey to correct her underbite was tough, seven of her teeth had to be removed when she was just 13 and she had to wear a brace until she was 23 - when her jaw had stopped growing. She said: ‘At 22 I started to develop severe facial pain - even a strong gust of wind across my face left me in agony. ‘I couldn’t eat, sleep or function on a day to day basis, and couldn’t concentrate on my studies at university. ‘It wasn’t until my jaw had stopped growing, and my teeth were in the right position, that I could finally have the operation. ‘When I was finally told I could have it I was thrilled, but it was scary at the same time. I knew I would end up looking totally different, and I didn’t really know how to prepare myself for that. ‘There are also major risks involved . that might have left me with facial numbness and possibly would have . made my debilitating pain worse - it was terrifying.’ Three days after her surgery, Ms Grant looked in a mirror for the very first time. She said: ‘When I first saw my face I hated it - I was swollen and I just looked like a blown up bowling ball. ‘It wasn’t until six months later when I . looked at myself, when the swelling had gone down, that I suddenly . realised how different I looked. Ms Grant (pictured after surgery) said: 'When I first saw my face I hated it - I was swollen and I just looked like a blown up bowling ball. It wasn't until six months later that I suddenly realised how different I looked' Ms Grant (pictured after her surgery) says having the operation was terrifying as she knew she could be left with numbness in her face or with even more pain than she already had . Ms Grant (pictured applying an ice pack to her jaw after surgery) says that after years of seeing flaws in her face she can finally see it as she thinks it should always have been . ‘After years of picking out flaws, it was hard at first to see that my face was how it always should have been. ‘I also had to learn how to talk and chew again which was difficult. ‘But . my face was so symmetrical - it was a big confidence boost. Being able . to smile, and show when I’m happy, is something I’ll never take for . granted.’ She added: ‘I’m working on my confidence, and I’m slowly starting to feel like I have a new lease of life. Ms Grant (pictured before her surgery) had to learn to eat and talk again after her surgery . Ms Grant (pictured before her operation) says she is now working on her confidence and that she feels like she has been given a new lease of life . ‘The biggest thing I notice is how differently people treat me now - which is awful when you think about it. ‘People are much nicer to me, and they listen to me when I speak, rather than just stare at my face. I’m seen as more approachable.’ Ms Grant has now started a blog which details her journey, in the hope of helping other people and outlining the possible risks of this type of surgery. She said: ‘I started my blog just after my final surgery, as I wanted to reach out to other patients. ‘There’s not enough information out there about this kind of surgery, especially for young people, and I wanted to help. Ms Grant (pictured before her surgery) says that since her operation people talk to her more kindly and think she is more approachable. She says they also stare at her face less than they used to . Ms Grant (pictured in hospital after her second operation) is now writing a blog about her experiences . ‘A lot of people think that this kind of surgery is simply for cosmetic reasons but it really isn’t - it has allowed me to be able to live normally. ‘I can eat properly and my risk of arthritis has been reduced - my blog allows me to give people this information. ‘It’s been a real privilege to talk to other people about what they’ve gone through, and it’s been a big help in my recovery too.’ For more information visit her blog at steffies-orthognathic-surgery.blogspot.co.uk .","Stefanie Grant was first told she had an underbite when she was 11 .

A former prisoner who had a sex-change operation on the NHS is demanding another £15,000 of cosmetic surgery at the taxpayers' expense. Jasmine Goode, formerly Darren, started her £18,000 sex-change operation in 2010 while serving an 11-year sentence for burglary. The treatment sparked outrage as Ms Goode, 37, claimed it was a better use of money than drugs for cancer. Demands: Jasmine Goode, 37, took sex-change tablets while serving an 11-year jail sentence for burglary. She now claims it is her 'right' to be granted £15,000-worth of surgery, including another breast enlargement . Two years after leaving Leyhill Open Prison in Bristol, the self-professed surgery addict, who has three children, is now applying to enlarge her breasts from a size 36E to 36G. Ms Goode told the Daily Star Sunday: 'They are OK now but I'm quite a big person so it would look better if they were larger.' She also claims it is her 'right' to have . her jaw realigned, hairline lowered, and a nose straightened in a . series of treatments amounting to £15,000. 'I don't see why not, otherwise it's half a job. They did it last time so I don't see why it's different. 'The NHS needs to finish the job.' Ms Goode, from Rhyl, north Wales, was born with both male and female genitals and was raised as a girl called Sarah-Jane until she was eight. She claims she was encouraged by her parents to live as a boy called Darren and says she felt pressured to be 'macho' by her father. It was as a result of this gender confusion that she took her first steps into a life of crime in an attempt to appear more macho. Crime: She was born with both male and female genitals, and forced to live as a boy called Darren, Ms Goode claims. She says it was this confusion that led her to a life of crime . In 1994, aged 18, she was jailed for burglary for the first time. She spent the next few years in and out of prison until May 2006 when, while serving an 11-year stretch for a string of burglaries, she told a prison nurse she was transex and wanted to live a new life as a woman. When the details of the operation emerged, Ms Goode, then Darren, argued her condition was as 'life-threatening as cancer' because of high suicide rates among the transgender community. Darren added that giving him the treatment was cost-effective as, too depressed to work, he would be forced to claim benefits. Ms Goode, who works for a charity that helped her with the sex change, has a 16-year-old son from one relationship and two children from a marriage to a different woman, who are now nine and 10. When she - then he - was alone with his eldest son, she would pretend to be the child's mother and wore her girlfriend's clothes. She no longer sees her children. After the breakdown of the marriage and she was moved to an open prison, Ms Goode applied to the NHS for cash for gender reassignment. Hormone tablets made her grow breasts, a charity donated women's clothes and make up and £18,000 from the NHS paid for electrolysis and laser treatment to remove body hair, followed by surgery to transform her genitals. Although the NHS refused to pay for breast enhancement, she has since had surgery to gain a 36E chest - and claims her sex life has 'gone wild' since the op. NHS guidelines only permit taxpayer-funded plastic surgery in extreme cases, such as to protect a patient's mental health. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: 'Prisoners have the right to receive the same range and quality of NHS treatments and services as anyone else, including services for gender reassignment.'","Jasmine Goode claims her 'right' to have breasts enlarged from 36E-36G .

Texts: Jayessh Shah, 42, is due to appear before a court charged with breaching the Data Protection Act . A computer boss exposed by The Mail on Sunday for allegedly bombarding Britons with half a million spam text messages every day has been charged under the Data Protection Act. Jayessh Shah boasted to an undercover reporter that his IT firm had sent huge numbers of messages telling people they were entitled to free refunds on the payment protection insurance policies they had taken out. Anyone who responded to the texts, including those who indicated that they did not want to receive any more, was regarded as a ‘lead’ by Shah, and their mobile number was sold to a claims management company for £7.50. Shah told our reporter he had made millions of pounds out of his business, and claimed he was immune from prosecution as it operated from outside the UK. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has now told The Mail on Sunday it has charged Shah with lying to them about what he did with people’s personal data – an offence under the Data Protection Act. All companies that operate in Britain and handle details such as personal names, addresses and phone numbers are required to tell the ICO what they do with the information. Shah registered his IT company, called Vintels, with the ICO, but allegedly failed to declare it sold personal data to other companies. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty at a magistrates’ court of a £5,000 fine. Shah, 42, is due to appear at Willesden Magistrates’ Court in North London on Tuesday. The ICO began investigating Shah after our story about him in December 2012. A spokesman said: ‘We would like to thank The Mail on Sunday for providing us with information that helped us further our investigation.’ Story: The headline on an undercover investigation on Shah by The Mail on Sunday in December 2012 . This newspaper began investigating Vintels after receiving tipoffs that it was one of the biggest senders of unsolicited PPI-related texts in the UK. At the time, there was an epidemic of such messages, with a study by the Citizens Advice Bureau finding that nine out of ten Britons had received one. Sending unsolicited marketing text messages is illegal and offenders can be fined up to £500,000 by the ICO. During our investigation, an undercover reporter met Shah for a ‘business meeting’ near Euston railway station. He claimed he had been sending spam PPI texts to British mobiles for four years, potentially bombarding the country with hundreds of millions of messages.

Doctors have reacted with anger after leaked documents revealed plans by union militants to intimidate GPs over health reforms. Unite's 'leverage team' – the dirty tricks unit which bullied managers and their families during last year’s Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Scotland – intends to deploy the same tactics against doctors involved in 'privatising' the NHS. At a recent Unite executive meeting attended by controversial general secretary ‘red’ Len McCluskey, there was a proposal that ‘the next comprehensive leverage campaign will be focused on [the] defence of the National Health Service’. According to leaked minutes, the leverage team suggested taking action at a ‘local level’ by using ‘direct intervention to... target private health care companies and commissioning bodies’. Under the Government’s health reforms, the bodies, partly staffed by GPs, are responsible for putting local medical contracts out to tender – and are therefore seen by Left-wing opponents as being in the vanguard of privatisation. During the Grangemouth dispute last autumn, the sinister leverage unit – staffed by campaigners who describe themselves as ‘industrial terrorists’ – personally targeted executives of the Ineos chemical company which owns the plant by sending mobs of protesters to their homes. One director embroiled in the row over pay and conditions said he had feared for the safety of his wife and two young children after 30 Unite activists descended on his drive during the school holidays and told his neighbours that he was 'evil'. And the daughter of another company boss had 'Wanted' posters denouncing her father posted through her front door in Hampshire. During the Grangemouth dispute (pictured) the sinister leverage unit personally targeted executives of the Ineos chemical company which owns the plant by sending mobs of protesters to their homes . Last night, Tory Health Minister Dan Poulter condemned Unite’s plan, saying: 'We take threats to doctors and nurses very seriously.' 'Unite may have walked all over Ed Miliband and taken over the Labour Party, but we will not let them do that to our NHS.' Leading GP Michael Dixon, the president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, said: 'This plan is deeply worrying. It will be the patients who suffer from attempts to intimidate hard-working doctors.' 'Nobody deserves to be threatened just for trying to improve patient care.' Last night, a Unite spokeswoman said that while the executive had discussed the plan, it was 'just a proposal. She added that defending the NHS from the 'savagery' of the Government was 'one of the most serious issues facing the country'.","Unite 'leverage team' intends to deploy same tactics used at Grangemouth .

Here he can be seen hugging members of Circle of Love, a group which meets twice a month to practise spiritual healing, meditate and discuss the mysteries of the universe. The Coronation Street star, 81, spent two hours with the group at a community centre near Altrincham, Greater Manchester, following the first day of his trail for child sex offences last week. Scroll down for video . William Roache (right) is pictured hugging a member of the Circle Of Love sect as he attends a meeting of the spiritualist group in a community centre . Roache (left), who is standing trail accused of child sex offences, has been a member of the group for years . According to the Sunday Mirror, Roache arrived at the meeting with his daughter, Verity, and after parking ran through the rain to the main entrance where other members were waiting for him. Early last year Roache split from his girlfriend, 44-year-old weathergirl Emma Jesson, so that he could be free to 'explore a mystic message of love' after revealing he had joined the group. The motto of the Circle of Love is to share 'wisdom, knowledge, but above all, love' and meetings involve meditation, reiki - a form of healing using mystic vibrations - and discussions where members share messages from the spirit realm. The main message of the group is that love conquers all. They seek to 'empower each person to recognise their own knowing, their own truth' and welcome people from any religion. Roache (centre) denies two charges of rape and five counts of indecent assault against girls aged under 16 which date back to the 1960s . Roache - pictured here arriving at court with his family - has played Ken Barlow in ITV's Coronation Street since the soap launched . Roache is currently standing trial at Preston Crown Court accused of indecently assaulting five girls more than 40 years ago, exploiting his fame in the knowledge they wouldn’t dare to speak out. On the most recent day of the trail, a woman who claims she was groped by Bill Roache as a schoolgirl said that she was warned away from him by another Coronation Street star. In a video interview played to the court the woman - who was around 14 at the time - recalled how Roache allegedly behaved ‘like an octopus’ with ‘hands everywhere’ as he indecently assaulted her in a dressing room. She then explained a chance encounter while sitting on the steps outside Granada Studios in Manchester, in which she was warned to 'watch that one' by Johnny Briggs, who played Mike Baldwin in the series.

Three weeks ago Romanian migrant Victor Spirescu arrived in the UK with the promise that he wanted to work and then go home. But after just one day washing cars with a friend in Biggleswade, he suddenly quit and disappeared. Now it seems he has landed a new job earning £60-a-day working on a building site somewhere in east London, and is planning on moving his 19-year-old fiancee Catalina Curcean to the UK as well. Victor Spirescu, the first Romanian to arrive in the UK on New Years Day, has got a new job on a building site in east London . He quit his firs job washing cars after just two days but blames media attention following claims he assaulted his ex-girlfriend and tried to drown her in a lake . Spirescu says Catalina is hoping to move from their pig and sheep farm in Transylvania and get a job as a cleaner. He says her money will be spent paying for all their bills and food, while his money will be saved to buy a Mercedes when they move back to Romania in a year's time. Spirescu has refused to talk about the crime, though insists he is now a changed man . For the time being Catalina is fending for herself by chopping enough wood to burn so she can stay warm in temperatures as low as minus 25c. She then has to clean out a sty where a pig is being reared. It will be killed to eat next Christmas. There is no running water in the crumbling one-bedroom house she bought with Mr Spirescu for £2,000 two years ago in the  village of Pelisor, which is 200 miles north of the capital Bucharest. Miss Curcean has to repeatedly lower a bucket on a winch down a well on the mud lane outside her home for cooking, cleaning and drinking. There is an outside toilet which consists of a hole in the ground covered by a wooden hut. After quitting his first job Spirescu says he has just £5 left until payday, and is on the lookout for a better paying job such as working in the North Sea crab fishing, or on an oil platform. Speaking to the Guardian, the 30-year-old says he quit his first job after media pressure surrounding his private life forced him out. It was revealed shortly after he arrived in the UK that Siprescu had a past conviction for assault against his ex-girlfriend, which he has refused to talk about in detail, insisting that he is a changed man. It was claimed last week the Spirescu beat ex-girlfriend Ana, 26, to the ground in a park before threatening to drown her in a lake. After that Spirescu says he received more than 50 calls a day from journalists and had photographers pretending to need a car wash in order to take pictures of him. People even stopped him in the street to ask for an autograph. Little more is known about Spirescu's past, except that he was born in Bucharest before moving to the small village of Pelisor. He says he left school at 18, learned English from the television, and then got on a plane to London. Victor is now planning to move his girlfriend Catalina over to London so she can get a job as a cleaner and the couple can save money for a Mercedes . Speaking about his time in England he says he expected the capital to be cleaner, and criticised British food for being 'tasteless' compared to the chicken which he kills and eats himself at home. Speaking about his welcome party waiting at the airport for his arrival, he said: 'There were television cameras, journalists and this guy Keith Vas - what was that about? I had no idea.'","Victor Spirescu quit his first job washing cars after just one day .

Touch choice: A rule of the Armed Forces pension scheme states that if a widow marries or cohabits with a new love she will forfeit her retirement fund . Military widows are having to choose between love and their pensions because ministers refuse to axe ‘Dickensian’ rules governing their income. Campaigners are furious the Government has rejected proposals to relax the system which forces a bereaved wife to give up her pension if she enters a new relationship. Up to 400 widows have had their pensions seized in the past year because of the ‘obscene’ rule and another 1,000 face losing their retirement pot next year. The Forces Pension Society accused the . Coalition of breaking the military covenant – which sets out the . nation’s duty of care to the Armed Forces. Air . Marshal Sir Christopher Coville, chairman of the FPS, said the decision . had ‘given our widows a slap in the face for Christmas’. He . added: ‘Any government that thinks it is right to leave a service widow . with the cruel dilemma of having to give up her income or give up a new . love should be deeply ashamed of itself. ‘It’s . an obscenity in modern society. Decent women with a natural human need . for love and partnership are being turned into criminals.’ The . rule applies to the old Armed Forces pension scheme and states that if a . widow finds new love, marries or cohabits she will forfeit her . retirement fund. It excludes widows of soldiers killed in action. Despite . a new system introduced in 2005, allowing widows to keep their income . if they remarry, around 150,000 ex-servicemen are still part of the . older scheme. Sir Christopher said many women had . sacrificed their careers because of their husband’s work in the Armed . Forces and had been unable to build their own pension pots. He added: ‘This is intolerable – the cost of ceasing this practice is negligible, the hardship in continuing it unbearable.’ Chrissie Fraser, 64, had her late husband Clive’s £900-a-month pension seized after she married a new partner. She . said: ‘My faith in the Army, which my husband revered, has gone … It . now seems that 20 years as an Army wife stands for nothing. ‘I could not pursue a career, and it was difficult bringing up children whilst constantly on the move. I am a dependant … I may as well be living in Victorian England.’ Chris Simpkins, of the Royal British Legion, described the rule as ‘Dickensian’ but the Ministry of Defence said it was a ‘fundamental principle … that pensions should not be improved retrospectively for those who are no longer contributing members’.","Up to 400 widows have had their pensions seized the past year alone .

Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered an investigation into official papers which suggest the Thatcher government helped India plan an attack against Sikh separatists in the Golden Temple. The 1984 raid on Sikhism's holiest shrine at  Amritsar angered Sikhs around the world who accused the Indian army of desecration. The death toll remains disputed, with the Indian authorities putting it in the hundreds and Sikh groups in the thousands. The assault triggered the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who ordered the attack, when two Sikh bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later. Attack: The Golden Temple at Amritsar, India, was attacked in 1984 . Newly-released British government papers suggest then-PM Margaret Thatcher responded positively to an Indian government request for advice on planning the attack and sent an officer from the elite SAS special air service to help draw up a plan. Today, Downing Street said Mr Cameron has now ordered an investigation by top civil servant Jeremy Heywood. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'These events led to a tragic loss of life and we understand the very legitimate concerns that these papers will raise. 'The Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Secretary to look into this case urgently and establish the facts.' Mr Cameron and Foreign Secretary . William Hague had been unaware of the papers prior to their . publication, the spokesman added. Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's foreign ministry, said his government was only aware of the story from the media. 'We will take it up with our UK counterparts and seek more information,' he said. The assault triggered the assassination . of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (pictured right with Thatcher on a visit to India), who ordered the attack, when two . Sikh bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later . Hundreds died in the raid by the Indian army on the temple in June 1984, and in October that year the country's prime minister, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in an apparent act of revenge. The papers, released under the 30-year rule and published on the Stop Deportations blog, indicate that Mrs Thatcher was aware of the involvement of an SAS officer in drawing up a plan - although it is not clear whether the Indian army operation followed this advice. The request for British advice is disclosed in a letter, dated February 23 1984, from Brian Fall, private secretary to then foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, to Hugh Taylor, his counterpart under home secretary Leon Brittan. The letter said: 'The Indian authorities recently sought British advice over a plan to remove Sikh extremists from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. 'The Foreign Secretary decided to respond favourably to the Indian request and, with the Prime Minister's agreement, an SAD (sic) officer has visited India and drawn up a plan which has been approved by Mrs Gandhi. The Foreign Secretary believes that the Indian Government may put the plan into operation shortly.' David Cameron visited the Sikh Shrine Golden temple in Amritsar on last year . Last year Mr Cameron visited the site of what he called the British Empire's most ‘monstrous’ atrocity. The . Prime Minister echoed the words of Winston Churchill as he paid tribute . to the 379 innocent Indians slaughtered in the Amritsar massacre. Mr . Cameron concluded his visit to India with a trip to the . Golden Temple, the holiest site for Sikhs, and the Jallianwala Bagh . gardens – where soldiers under Brigadier Reginald Dyer fired 1,650 shots . into a crowd of 20,000 unarmed protesters in 1919. Mr Cameron called the killings ‘deeply shameful’ but stopped short of giving an explicit apology for the massacre.","The attack on Sikhism's holiest shrine angered Sikhs around the world .

The former editor's personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, 49, told the Old Bailey her boss had taken a  week-off in July 2011 to work with her 'personal trainer', as the phone hacking scandal engulfed News International. On one of the days Brooks was away, seven boxes, allegedly containing the former Sun editor's notebooks, were said to have been removed from the company’s archives. Bootcamp: The Old Bailey heard Rebekah Brooks (left) had taken a prearranged week off as the phone hacking scandal engulfed News Internationl. Cheryl Carter (right) said she was at home with a personal trainer . The long-serving assistant said: ‘It is Rebekah at home having a personal trainer to train her. ‘That is what bootcamp is, that is what she was doing.’ She said she could recall that Brooks was not in the office because she would not have had time to deal with the boxes otherwise. ‘Our job was so intense that I could not leave my phone’, she said. ‘So I knew that I would then have time to go downstairs.’ However, jurors have been told Brooks and Carter’s mobile phones were both used near the News International offices throughout that day. The court also heard that detectives believed Carter been . promised a new job at a Murdoch newspaper in Australia, if she agreed to . hide Rebekah Brooks’ notebooks. She was arrested just 18 days before her family were due to emigrate from the UK, and the subsequent decision to charge her forced her husband, son and daughter to abandon their new life in Australia . Carter told police just three . notepads and two diaries belonged to Rebekah Brooks in the seven boxes . she took home, with the majority being old cuttings from her . time as a beauty columnist at The Sun. She said a framed West Ham United or Man . City shirt were also among the possessions, as well as a handful of speeches . Brooks had made. Claims: Brooks is said to have been away on the day seven boxes of notebooks were taken from the News International archives . She then explained to officers that up to ten crates of Brooks’ personal possessions were couriered from News International headquarters to a garage owned by her in-laws, and then on to Brooks' home in Oxfordshire a few days later. ‘At no point did anyone ever say, don’t do this, don’t remove files, don’t do anything' Cheryl Carter . Carter said: ‘At no point did anyone ever say, don’t do this, don’t remove files, don’t do anything. ‘I . knew when Rebekah obviously left the company, they then said you . must not shred anything, you must not remove anything when I sat there . with the police, I would have been fully cooperative. ‘For my part I don’t think I have done anything wrong, and I don’t see why I am here today.’ Her son Nick, 24, who worked as an administrative assistant at News International at the time, told the Old Bailey how his mother called him up at work and asked him to come to her office on the afternoon of July 8 2011. He said he went with her and a driver to the archive office to pick up the boxes. Mr Carter said he and the driver then . loaded the boxes onto a trolley and into his car. After work, he drove . back to the home he shared with his parents and left the boxes on the . landing. He said he had no . idea what was in them or what happened to them after he took them home.

She described her boss as ‘driven’ and ‘tough but fair’, and admitted she had done Brooks’ Christmas shopping for nearly 20 years as part of her job. Brooks and Carter deny the charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, by removing potential evidence which could have been inspected by police.

Princess Michael of Kent reveals in a radio interview how she once crooned with jazz singer Peggy Lee, best known for her rendition of Fever, and even joined the King of Malaysia to sing karaoke . She likes to sing jazz in the bath of her 17th century apartment in Kensington Palace, while he, apparently, prefers to stick Abba on the stereo. In a sometimes unintentionally hilarious interview about her musical tastes, Princess Michael of Kent has lifted the lid on how her husband, Prince Michael, who is the Queen’s first cousin, has a penchant for a certain 70s Swedish supergroup. She also boasts how she once crooned with legendary American jazz singer Peggy Lee, best known for her rendition of Fever, and even joined the King of Malaysia to sing karaoke. Dubbed Princess Pushy for her imperious ways (the Queen once joked that she was ‘far too grand for us’), Princess Michael has told Radio 4’s Saturday Live programme that she comes from a ‘very musical family’. 'We’ve always sung. As I have become a grandmother and become older, of course you have less voice and you notice this in the bath,’ she says. Asked what sort of tunes she would sing in the bath, she replies: ‘Well, you know, I go back to my sort of youth and I don’t know if you’re old enough to remember somebody like Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell’s early songs, that sort of romantic, slow... you know? The Princess is a big fan of Peggy Lee (left). And asked what she would sing in the bath, Pushy replies: 'Well, you know, I go back to my sort of youth and I don't know if you're old enough to remember somebody like Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell's (above, right) early songs, that sort of romantic, slow... you know?' 'In these old houses, I mean, we’re here in the 17th century part of the palace and I can really belt out a tune if I want, nobody’s going to hear me at all.’ The Princess claims she once even got the chance to sing with Peggy Lee on a trip to New York - ‘can you imagine?’. ‘I said, ""You know, I’ve always loved singing your song Fever"", and she said ""let’s do it"", and there was a piano and there was a pianist and so we sang together - it was such fun, I can tell you,’ she recalls. Prince Michael, she reveals, much prefers the music of the 70s, however. Prince Michael, she reveals, much prefers the music of the 70s . 'My husband happens to love Abba, for example. And I used to scorn him when he’d say ""I’m going to play Abba"", and I’d say, ""Uh, oh my goodness"",’ she said. She revealed she had once visited a jazz club in New Orleans - but always retained her decorum. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever let myself go in public - I don’t even know what it would mean. I mean, I let myself go on horseback by really galloping until, you know, I think I’m going to die,’ she said. Princess Michael even admits she has sung karaoke on several occasions, belting out the odd version of Moon River among others. She said: ‘Well I found it [karaoke] for the first time in my life in, of all places, Malaysia - where we went for the wedding of the then king’s daughter. 'They said, ""Oh, we’re having a karaoke evening tonight"", so I didn’t know what that was, so fine, yes, I thought it was some sort of marvellous food really and everybody was singing away and they sounded good, so that was quite fun.’ Asked whether she took part, she replies: ‘Oh, I did. I did in Malaysia, yes. Then, last summer, we were in Sicily with friends, where we often go, and they had karaoke, so yes, I found myself singing along with them.’ ... and it turns out that the Prince, a first cousin of the Queen, loves Abba . Most members of the royal family, she said, were into classical music. ‘We meet each other at the opera or at concerts and things.’ Although claiming to be a good singer herself - ‘I’m pitch perfect, I’ll have you know!’ - she says she has never been tempted to pursue it as a profession. ‘You know, I love to sing and I don’t find it difficult to read music, but no, I would never have been talented enough to be a singer and also it’s a very, very demanding thing to be,’ she says. ‘I’m not allowed to sing on this programme. I would love to burst into song for you, but I’m not allowed.’ Asked why, she said: ‘Because I’ve been told categorically that the press reaction will be that my next stop is The X Factor, and I’ve been forbidden, forbidden. So there we are.’ Princess Michael appears on Saturday Live, BBC Radio 4, on January 18 at 9am.

Boys and girls from families who live on James Turner Street, Birmingham, have now been victimised at school, as well as being exposed to national scrutiny, according to a community activist. Desmond Jaddoo, part of the Birmingham Empowerment Forum, said that even adults have been pulling up outside the playground to shout abuse at children as they play outside. Scroll down for video . Stigma: According to community activists, children from James Turner Street are being targeted at school . Write caption here . The realities of life on the notorious Birmingham road - where ninety per cent of residents receive state hand-outs and petty crime and drugs use are rife - caused a national outcry after the first episode was aired this month. Viewers were shocked at scenes in which residents confessed to fiddling their benefits, a serial theif was followed around on a shoplifting spree and an alcoholic tried to make some easy cash by gathering up free magazines and trying to sell them as copies of the Big Issue. Mr Jaddoo said that the problem was worst at the Oasis Foundry Academy, which is on James Turner Street, but that it applied to schools around the area. He told MailOnline: 'People are driving down the street hurling abuse. 'There is . stigmatisation of the children at the local school.

Some children, as young as 12, were saying the impression they got from . the programme was not to talk to people from that street.' 'A team of us has been on the ground assisting the families - we seem to be the only ones that give a damn about them. We can clearly see they are people that have been taken advantage of.

Critics of the programme have also complained that it misrepresents the realities of living on benefits. In response to the record number of complaints made to Channel 4 and broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, the channel has organised a live TV debate in which residents can participate. But Mr Jaddoo said that the stigma, including playground bullying, of appearing on Benefits Street has scared them off.

But daily suffering is still a fact of life for tens of thousands of wounded men and women in Cambodia, struck down by the countless land mines which lay dormant under its soil. These images, taken this week in a rehabilitation centre in Kampong Cham, one of the largest cities in the country, show some of the nation's 25,000 amputees being helped through their injuries. Injury: A woman poses with her prosthetic leg at a rehabilitation centre in Kampong Cham, Cambodia . Rehabilitation: Thanks to prosthetics and treatment, victims of land mines at the centre can work their way towards recovery . Crafting: A Handicap International worker helps to build a prosthetic limb at the rehabilitation centre . Exercise: A staff member supervises a training session in which these amputees can learn to move confidently using their prosthetics . Staff at the centre, run by Handicap International, help provide the injured with the right prosthetic limbs, and teach them to move again after life-changing injuries caused by decades-old explosives. In stirring scenes the severely-injured patients are shown learning to walk again using their new prosthetic limbs, which are crafted for them on-site by members of staff. Estimates vary as to exactly how many mines devices pepper the landscape of the South East Asian nation, first laid in serious numbers when the country was gripped by civil war in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hundreds of thousands more were set in later years as Vietnamese forces occupied the country in the 1980s, then by the country's own army as the communist government fell in the 1990s. In 2010 it was estimated that as many as 6million mines are still unexploded in the Cambodian soil, covering 276 square miles of land. In a country with a population of around 15million, it means there is more than one mine for every three people. Dressing: A patient's limb is covered with plaster to make a mould for a prosthetic limb . Getting started: A female patient is helped in to her replacement leg by a staff member . Support: Patients are helped to leave wheelchairs and take their own steps at the centre . Since 1979 a total of 64,308 land mine casualties have been recorded by the official government monitoring body. Almost . a third of the victims, some 20,000, were killed by the explosions, . while 8,918 of those affected required amputations. According to some . estimates, Cambodia has the most amputees per capita in the world. Overwhelmingly it is men who are struck down by the mines - accounting for more than 80 per cent of incidents. Some 6,000 boys were wounded or killed, along with 4,750 women, 1,367 girls  - and 63 were ravaged so badly by the explosion that it was impossible to tell. Finishing off: A craftsman is shown partway through building a prosthetic leg . Weigh in: A patient takes to the scales in his recovery from a life-changing injury . Meeting: A member of staff assesses a new patients. Hundreds a year are still wounded by explosives . Although casualties have no dropped to fewer than 200 a year, experts still expect it to take a decade or more before the country is made safe. Workers at  Handicap International help dispose of mines as well as providing rehabilitation and treatment to those who have been wounded. Their work also targets attitudes towards the disabled. physical rehabilitation services and produce and fit prosthetic limbs and orthoses. Our projects also focus on tackling barriers to inclusion and activities to prevent the development of disabling impairments. At the Kampong Chan centre, a fifth of all patients are recovering from land mine-related injuries, while unsafe roads also contribute to a large amount of disabilities.","Countless mines were laid in Cambodia successive conflicts since 1970s .

The stress begins as soon as we arrive and have to decide on seating arrangements - if Minnie and Monty sit side-by-side in the trolley he pulls her hair and she screams, if he sits in the trolly on his own Minnie runs riot in the store practising her skipping and hopping up and down the aisles and generally causing chaos - and always ends with a tantrum by the tills when they see all the tempting treats that their mean mummy says they can't have. There is literally a wall of sweets - seemingly to ensure that whether children are on foot or sitting up high in trolleys or prams, they can clearly spy the packs of sugary stuff and commence pester power. As Lidl lead the way by banning sweets and crisps at its check-out, our blogger calls for other supermarkets to follow suit . And because you are stood stationary for a good five minutes, and the tears and the shouting are rather embarrassing, it's actually very hard not to give in. On Saturday, Monty had a meltdown over a packet of crisps. 'Pom Bears! Pom Bears!' he shouted again and again between ear-splitting shrieks, getting alarmingly red as he sobbed away. I could tell that the lady manning the till was thinking, 'Just give him a pack of Pom Bears and he'll be quiet love - what's the big deal?'. The big deal was that I wanted to get him to home so he could eat the healthy pasta, fresh veggies and chicken I was buying for lunch, rather than filling up on junk. The good news is that the till gauntlet may soon get easier because supermarket chain Lidl is the first to announce that it is removing all sweets, chocolates and crisps from checkouts in its 600 stores across the country in favour of healthier alternatives. 'We know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways,' said the managing director of Lidl UK . 'We're committed not only to raising awareness of the importance of balanced diets and healthy lifestyles, but also making it easier for our customers to follow them,' said managing director Ronny Gottschlich. 'We know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways.'

Michelle Obama was crying with laughter, punching the air and flexing her muscles today as she and Sesame Street characters Elmo and Rosita announced a cunning plan to get children 'begging' for fruits and vegetables in the grocery store. At a press conference at the White House, the First Lady revealed the nonprofit behind the beloved children's educational TV program will let the fresh produce industry use Elmo, Big Bird and Sesame Street's other furry characters free of charge to market fruits and veggies to kids. 'Just imagine what will happen when we take our kids to the grocery store, and they see Elmo and Rosita and the other Sesame Street Muppets they love up and down the produce aisle,' Mrs Obama said. 'Imagine what it will be like to have our kids begging us to buy them fruits and vegetables instead of cookies, candy and chips. It can be done!' Scroll down for video . Elmo love: Michelle Obama embraces Elmo, left, and Rosita, right, as they announce free licensing of Sesame Street characters to promote fresh fruit and vegetables . Yes! First lady Michelle Obama, center, with PBS Sesame Street's characters Elmo, left, and Rosita, right, in an event to help promote fresh fruit and vegetable consumption to kids in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, October 30, 2013 . Under the arrangement, Sesame Workshop is waiving the licensing fee for its Muppet characters for two years. The goal is to get children who often turn up their noses at the sight of produce to eat more of it. As soon as next spring, shoppers and children accompanying them can expect to see their favorite Sesame Street characters on stand-alone signs and on stickers and labels on all types of produce regardless of whether it comes in a bag, a carton or just its skin. An 'unprecedented step,' Mrs Obama said of the agreement. 'And they're doing this free of charge. Yes!' she said as she pumped her fists in the air before an audience seated in the State Dining Room of the White House. The first lady cited a study published last fall in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine in which Cornell University researchers gave more than 200 boys and girls ages 8 to 11 the choice of eating an apple, a cookie or both. Most kids went for the cookie. Asked to choose again after researchers put Elmo stickers on the apples, nearly double the number of kids chose the fruit, she said.

Rainbow: The first lady and her furry friends talk about their favorite fruits and vegetables . The agreement between Sesame Workshop and the Produce Marketing Association is the latest step by the private sector to support 'Let's Move,' the first lady's nearly 4-year-old campaign to reduce childhood obesity rates in the U.S. It also is the first announcement since a summit on food marketing to children that Mrs Obama convened at the White House last month, where she urged a broad range of companies to do more, faster, to promote foods with less salt, fat and sugar to youngsters. Sesame Street characters Elmo and Rosita, who also speaks Spanish, joined her for the announcement. Afterward, Mrs Obama joined the Muppets at her garden on the South Lawn for the annual fall harvest. White House staff helped students from elementary schools in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia with the harvest. The group, including the first lady, also prepared — and ate — turkey veggie wraps made using some of the freshly picked cucumbers and tomatoes.

Sam Kass, the 'Let's Move' executive director, said it was a big step for Sesame Workshop to waive its licensing fee, which is a major source of income for the nonprofit. 'For them to step in and do this is a really big thing,' said Kass, who also is an assistant White House chef. Sherrie Westin, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of Sesame Workshop, said waiving the fee is not normal practice and that it's too early to say how much revenue would be lost. But she said the deal gives the company another way to use the characters to pitch to children and families the healthier-eating messages that are part of its TV show. 'It would be a shame not to use them to that end,' she said of the Muppets. Larry Soler, president and chief executive of the Partnership for a Healthier America, said kids younger than 5 don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables, and that it gets worse as children grow up. He said the agreement hopefully will 'drive excitement' and interest in eating fruits and vegetables that might not otherwise exist. The partnership is a nonprofit organization that supports the first lady's campaign.

A woman cleared of causing her own sister's death in a road crash has revealed her agony at being involved in the accident that robbed her of her 'best friend' - and that it will always haunt her. Rosie-Ann Stone, 21, was cleared by a jury on Friday of causing the death of her elder sister Jennie, 28, by careless driving. But, speaking after the case, she revealed that the nightmarish incident will 'follow me for the rest of my life'. 'Best friend': Rosie-Ann Stone, left, has spoken of the anguish of losing her sister Jennie, right . Acquitted: After a five-day trial, a jury cleared Rosie-Ann (right) of cause the death of her sister (left) by careless driving . In a heartbreaking twist, Rosie-Ann also told how her sister's ten-year-old son had wished a prison sentence on the other driver - but immediately forgave her when he realised she had been behind the wheel. Ms Stone and her sister had both been trying to overtake a lorry on the A165 near Hull, Yorkshire. Rosie-Ann pulled out first on the single-carriageway road to overtake the vehicle, but her sister, who was three cars behind, pulled out as well and tried to pass both of them at once. After colliding with Rosie-Ann's car, Jennie's Peugeot crashed into a tree, and she was killed by the impact. New loss: The family were already grieving for Gregg Stone, who was killed in Afghanistan, when Jennie's car crashed . Reflecting on the loss of her sister, Rosie-Ann told the Sunday Mirror: 'We were closer than sisters. Jennie was my best friend, my therapist, my agony aunt, my personal stylist, my advisor. She was my wing man, my drinking buddy and my go-to for -everything and anything.' 'Regardless of the verdict, I’ll always feel terrible to have been involved in an accident in which my sister died. It will follow me for the rest of my life.' At the time of the incident, 18 February 2013, the Stone family was still reeling from the death of Rosie and Jennie's brother Gregg, a soldier who was killed in Afghanistan aged 20. Gregg was shot on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman who had been captured by the Taliban. He had died just eight months before the family was struck with another tragedy. It took a jury at Hull Crown Court just three hours to clear Rosie-Ann of the charge, at the end of a five-day trial. Speaking immediately after the trial, Rosie-Ann said that she was prepared for a nine-month prison sentence - but that what she most feared was being told that she was responsible for the death. She said: ‘If I was found guilty, that would have meant Jennie’s death had been my fault. I would not have been able to live with myself. ‘I was visualising her as she was when we were growing up together. I was thinking how she looked. How she smelt. Everything about her. ‘During the trial, I looked at the jury – every one of them. I felt sorry for them. Some of them looked at me sympathetically. Some looked at me sternly. ‘I had no idea what they were thinking.’ But she said that as she left court a juror told her: ‘We all believed you. Live your life. Be happy.’ The controversial case also saw the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) criticised for bringing the case to court in the first place. Following the verdict, Judge Judge Simon Jack told the jury: 'Before the start of the case I expressed concern with the Crown Prosecution Service that it was not in the public interest to have a trial. ‘The CPS was consistently saying that it was. It was their decision not mine.' Happier times: Gregg, Rosie-Ann and Jennie pictured together . The family had begged the Service not to bring the charges, saying it would be completely against the wishes of Jennie. The case is estimated to have cost £100,000 of public money. But, in a remarkable show of forgiveness, Rosie-Ann also revealed how she was comforted by her nephew, Jennie's ten-year-old son, as soon as he found out that she had been driving one of the cars in the accident. Rosie-Ann recalled a conversation with the grieving boy just days after his mother had died, when he said that he hoped whoever was driving the other car would be sent to jail. He did not know at that point that she was the other driver, and Rosie-Ann was forced to hide to conceal her tears. But the boy had a striking change of heart when he found out his aunt was involved. She said: 'Mum sat him down and said ""you know auntie Rosie was the other driver?"" He said he didn’t want me to go to jail and came and hugged me. He’s such a lovely little boy.' Support: Rosie-Anne and Liam arrive at Hull Crown Court . In another bizarre twist in the story of the Stone family, the stalwart boyfriend who helped Rosie-Ann through her court ordeal is a soldier who served with her dead brother. Liam Fisher, 21, served with Gregg Stone in Afghanistan, and was deployed on alongside him on a mission to rescue a kidnapped Afghan policeman. Gregg was fatally shot during the mission - but, heroically, after the first bullet hit, Liam put himself between his comrade and the line of fire to stop him being hit twice. Rosie-Ann revealed how the two met after Gregg died, and the experience meant that he was able to help her cope with Jennie's death as well. Liam was pictured accompanying Rosie-Ann to court in the past week.","Rosie-Ann Stone told how her sister Jennie was her 'best friend'

Alec Baldwin: '(MSNBC) dodged a bullet. They put him in there, and they would've had to fire him for no ratings. He gave them a reason to get fired.' Rachel Maddow: 'On a personal level, I like her. I don't want to hurt her career, so I won't say we get along, but I've had dialogue with her, and she's very smart.' 'Attacking me and Fox News is nothing new – it’s a cottage industry. What’s new is that Random House refused to fact check the content with me or Fox News- that tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda.' Ailes, 73, is proud of the conservative network and said that he sees it expanding to appeal to their audience. He cited the fact that they bumped anchor Megyn Kelly to the primetime line up from her afternoon spot in an effort to appeal to younger viewers. The work that O'Reilly does outside of his show- namely writing books and promoting specials with a historical edge- as a possible new venue for growth, but pointedly saying that there were no plans for O'Reilly to leave the Fox line-up anytime soon. 'He likes money, but he's not doing it for the money. He probably likes power, but he's not doing it for the power. He's driven by things that he sees that are not right from his point of view,' Ailes said of O'Reilly in The Hollywood Reporter interview.  'I would like News Corp to form a history channel and let Bill work with me. I'd run it for him because I'd like history done correctly for a change. They're not teaching the kids the real stuff.' One of his most controversial recent hires- or more accurately, . re-hires- was former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin. He said that while he . doesn't necessarily agree with everything she says- let alone does he . always hear all of her statements- he decided to re-up. That . was reason enough for Mrs Palin, as she posted a recent photo of herself . during a visit to the Fox and Friends set just hours after Ailes' interview went live. 'Fox’s Roger Ailes says he hired me “to piss . off the people that wanted her dead.” Hmmm. Funny. I accepted for the . same reason!' she wrote as the caption. He- expectantly- painted a very rosy picture of life inside NewsCorp, saying how he has a very comfortable relationship with owner Rupert Murdoch. 'He wanders in and ruins my schedule and just wants to talk. He calls once every day or two usually just to gossip and catch up on the news.... I think that's the way it is with Rupert. If you deliver money, you do fine,' Ailes said. When the conversation turned to other . channels, he said that Fox's longstanding hold on the highest ratings in . cable news was not threatened because even though CNN won viewers with a . recent film about SeaWorld's killer whales, that is not a sustainable . method for a news channel. Close: Ailes says that Rupert Murdoch (seen together in 1996) regularly calls in for a chat but leaves him to run Fox News largely on his own since the channel is doing so well . Taking the compliment: Sarah Palin posted this photo to her Facebook account from a recent trip to Fox and Friends and she said that she accepted the job for the same reason that he offered it- to spite her critics . 'That means Fox has won the cable news wars. (CNN head Jeff Zucker) had a big hit with a whale one night (the documentary Blackfish). I guess he's going to do whales a lot. If I were Discovery, I'd be worried,' Ailes said. He didn't mention any CNN hosts by name in his critique, but had nothing but kind words for MSNBC's Rachel Maddow who he likes 'on a personal level'. The channel's decision to fire Alec Baldwin- who regularly makes barbs about Fox’s conservative broadcasting- after he was taped- once again- making homophobic comments, Ailes said that his competitors made the right move. 'They put him in there, and they would've had to fire him for no ratings. He gave them a reason to get fired,' he said. Ailes' defensive interview comes ahead of the release of a scathing unauthorized biography stacked with outrageous stories about his time at Fox News. Claims have been made in the tell-all called The Loudest Voice In The Room by Gabriel Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine who has charted the 73-year-old's life from his childhood in Ohio to one of the most powerful positions in television. Sherman alleges that Ailes once offered to pay a female TV producer $100 extra a week for sex, a damning new book alleges. While negotiating her salary at NBC in the 1980s, Randi Harrison claims Mr Ailes offered her the raise 'if you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.' Fox News has denied the allegations. In another anecdote, it was claimed that Mr Ailes was so dismissive of even his best talent that he referred to star host Bill O'Reilly as 'a book salesman with a TV show'. Despite Ailes' denials about the veracity of the book, Sherman retorted in a statement to Politico: . 'During two and a half years of reporting, I made a dozen requests both in writing and in person to speak with Roger Ailes about every aspect of my book,' he said. Sherman also claimed that 'a team of two fact-checkers spent more than 2,000 hours vetting the manuscript before publication.' 'Roger Ailes declined every request to discuss the reporting with me.' But the Fox News channel's flat denials on Ailes' behalf, and a lack of communication between Sherman's publisher and Fox News, may indicate that his sources led him astray. 'Random House refused to fact check the content with me or Fox News,' Ailes told The Hollywood Reporter. 'That tells you everything you need to know about this book and its agenda.' Fox News confirmed to MailOnline that Sherman made interview requests but that neither he nor his publisher sent a list of questions for fact-checking prior to the book's publication.                                                                                                                                                 -- by Simon Tomlinson .","Fox News chief is under fire as a new book will be published shortly claiming that he bad-mouthed O'Reilly and propositioned a female hire .

On May 17, Hofstra University student Andrea Rebello, 21, was shot and killed by a Nassau County police officer during a hostage standoff with an intruder at her shared rental house in Uniondale, New York. According to court papers submitted by the county on Thursday, the investigation into Rebello's death is 'only in it's infancy.' Andrea Rebello's family, including her twin sister Jessica Rebello, asked for records related to the police investigation of her death and were troubled by the police department's response. Sisters: Jessica(left) and Andrea Rebello(right), pictured, remained in the home while another girl was allowed out to collect money from an ATM. The girl called police immediately and they arrived minutes later . 'I was shocked and surprised to hear that they consider this investigation is in its infancy,' said Rebello family lawyer David Roth. Police are refusing both records and crime scene photos. Public officials blame numerous record requests for causing, 'confusion with the county agencies that got them.' Newsday reports that The Rebello family already announced that they plan to sue the county for killing their daughter in the shooting that also killed the home-intruder, Dalton Smith. Police say that Smith held Rebello in . a headlock and pointed a gun to her head. Officer Nikolas Budimlic . approached Smith who then allegedly pointed a gun at the officer. Budimlic fired killing Smith with seven bullets and killing Rebello with one. Dalton Smith, 30, who had a history of criminal behavior, also died in the shooting . Carnell Foskey, a Nassau County Attorney, said that officials did their best to comply with the Robello family's record requests but that some records were exempt. The Robello family's attorney David Roth said that Jessica, who was inside the house at the time of the shooting, spoke with police on the day of the incident but hasn't since, 'essentially because of the way they treated her.' Rebello . was in the two-story home with her twin sister Jessica, another woman . and another man when Smith, wearing a ski mask, walked into the . house through an open front door,  Lt. John Azzata said. The intruder allowed the . third unidentified woman to leave and collect money from an ATM, and . she called 911. Police announced that Dalton Smith, 30, was wanted on a parole . violation related to a first-degree robbery conviction and had an arrest . history dating back nearly 15 years. Two police officers arriving at the home encountered Smith holding onto Rebello. Smith, 30, of Hempstead, had a warrant put out for his arrest on April 25. He had been found guilty of robbery . in the 1st degree and had an extensive criminal background going back to . 1999 with multiple convictions for theft and assault.He also spent time in prison and was convicted again for handling contraband goods while behind bars. Andrea (right) shown partying with a friend, was popular and is thoroughly missed by members of her community . The sisters were describes as a 'set' and Jessica 'cannot eat' following her sister's death . He . was shot by police on May 17 after what appears to be an attempted . robbery on Rebello, her twin and their friends. Earlier reports said . that the man shot Andrea Rebello as she pleaded for her life. The 30-year-old followed the sisters, Jessica and Andrea, Jessica's boyfriend John Kourtessiss and another student called Shannon Thomas back to the girls' California Avenue sorority house from the popular student bar, McHebes, according to The New York Post. The gunman reportedly targeted the students after seeing them spending large amounts of money in the drinking spot to celebrate the end of the school term. Around . 2:20am he allegedly peered through the window in his ski mask and . knocked on the door before forcing himself in and taking the group . hostage. Raiding the . home he shouted: 'I saw you at the bar drinking. I know you have more . money than this!', according to police sources quoted in the Post . report. Victim: Andrea Rebello (right), was shot dead by a masked intruder during an invasion of the home she shared with her twin sister Jessica (left). The suspect was also shot dead at the scene . He made the twins remain but told . Thomas to leave and withdraw money from an ATM machine - warning her he . would shoot her friends if she tried anything. While away from the home she called 911. As police arrived neighbors said they heard blood-curdling screams and what sounded like a woman pleading for her life. Victoria Dehel, who lives four doors down told the New York Times that she heard shouting. At first is sounded like 'a bunch of drunk college students,' she told the Times. 'And then the screaming just got worse and worse and worse. And then we heard thuds, like five bangs,' she said. Dehel . said she and her boyfriend stepped onto their porch and they could hear . what sounded like a woman pleading for her life, just as police cars . raced down the street. 'I turned to my boyfriend and I said, 'I think someone just got murdered'. It was awful,' she said. '[Police] drew their weapons and went inside,' neighbor Frank Pugliese, 19 told the Post. 'She was pleading for her life. You could tell she was scared. It . was a surreal moment . . . She was pleading — her voice was trembling . and she yelled, ‘No, no!’ ' Smith is believed to have held them on the second floor. Thomas told the 911 dispatcher that he had a silver handgun pointed . at her friend's head in a bedroom, NBC reported. Break in: Police said that the masked, armed intruder knocked on the front door before forcing his way inside the home and holding the friends, including Andrea (left), hostage . The dispatcher passed the information to police and less than a minute later, Nassau . County police officers reached the home. When they arrived, shots went off. A law enforcement source told the New York Post it appeared the suspect killed Rebello and the police then killed him but this timetable of events was still being verified. 'We . don't know [the suspect's] motive at this time but it appears to be a . robbery,' Chief Rick Capece said in a press conference shortly after the incident. Anthony Kourtessiss said his son was being questioned by police after the shooting and Jessica was 'inconsolable'. 'It’s a terrible situation,' he told the newspaper. '[Jessica] was very upset, inconsolable right now.' Rebello was a member of the Beta Sigma Phi . sorority and lived with six of her sorority sisters at the home, including her sister. Students . flocked to Twitter to express their grief at the killing, with many . writing 'R.I.P' messages to Andrea and sending her twin sister their . best wishes and prayers . A private vigil was held at the . Hofstra Student Center and her funeral took place the next Wednesday. Rebello's . father, Fernando, was too distraught to discuss the incident outside . the family's home in Tarrytown, New York, yesterday. 'It's my daughter, my baby daughter,' the landscaping company chief told the Journal News outside the home he shares with wife Nella. 'She was so beautiful. I'm so confused. 'I don't know what to do,' he added. Her godmother told the newspaper: 'It's just too tragic'. Andrea was . a junior at Hofstra studying Public Relations and Sociology and had attended Sleepy Hollow High School alongside her sister. 'I'm 100% Portuguese and have an identical twin sister so I guess that makes me kind of unique?' she wrote on her blog. Principal Carol Conklin-Spillane . said the girls were 'a set' and Andrea was devoted to her family who . are close to other members of the Portuguese community in the area. 'She had a devotion to family and sense of purpose and of opportunity,' she said. Friends and family attended her funeral on May 22 and deeply mourned her loss . Photographs . on her Facebook page show the girl as a popular student who enjoyed . hanging out with friends and her twin sister, while her blog documents . her cooking hobby. Neighbors said their house had a vegetable garden and the twins would sometimes drop off the produce. 'They brought me some vegetables from their garden. They’re very nice people. They’d do anything for you,' Harris Bank told the New York Post. Family members of slain Hofstra coed gave their final goodbyes at an . emotional funeral service at New York's St. Teresa of Avila Church church on May 22 . The victim’s distraught twin . sister who is unable to eat and keeps keeps asking how she could have prevented . the tragedy. 'During this . tragedy a question comes to mind - why?' Reverand Osvaldo Franklin said. 'Why Andrea, in the flower of her youth, she left us?' As the crowd sobbed, lohud.com reports, Franklin tried to offer comfort, if not an answer. 'She has left us to join our father in heaven,' Franklin said. 'We are here to pray for the family that she left behind.' The New York police union has defended Budimlic by  saying the only person responsible for the woman's death was the gunman who held her hostage. 'There . is some second guessing by people who think we should have stayed . outside the house, but our job is to get inside and make sure we can . protect as many people as we can,' said James Carver. But Andrea's grandfather questioned the protocol the officer was following. 'I think the police is not very professional,' Santos said. 'If he's professional, he should have tried negotiation.' The Nassau County Police Department refused to comment when the Mail Online asked whether or not Nikolas Budimlic was on leave or still currently employed.","According to court papers submitted by the county on Thursday, the investigation into Andrea Rebello's death is 'only in it's infancy'

But the father-of-one lost control of his parachute's steering toggle and crash-landed - colliding with a parked van at a speed of about 40mph.

Mr Cornick, a father-of-one, was attempting a 12,000ft jump when he lost control of his parachute .

A killer with a 'hair fetish' convicted of murdering a British mother-of-two and a schoolgirl could now be linked to the murder of a student. The Criminal Case Review Commission is . looking into whether deranged Danilo Restivo killed foreign language . student Jong-Ok Shin 10 years ago. Miss Shin, 26, was knifed to death in Bournemouth, Dorset, in July 2002, as she walked home to her lodgings from a night out. Local drug addict Omar Benguit was . jailed for life for her murder in 2005. He has always maintained his . innocence and doubts have been cast over how safe his conviction is. The Criminal Case Review Commission is . looking into whether deranged Danilo Restivo, left, killed foreign language . student Jong-Ok Shin, right, 10 years ago . It appeared even more unsafe after . Restivo, 39, was found guilty last June of murdering 48-year-old Heather . Barnett in Bournemouth and jailed for life. Dental technician Restivo moved to . Bournemouth in March 2002 and he beat and stabbed Miss Barnett to death . in her own home in November that year. The murder came nine years after the . Italian national killed 16-year-old Elisa Claps in another knife attack . in the loft space of a church in his home town of Potenza, Italy. Murdered: Heather Barnett who was discovered dead at her house in Bournemouth in November 2002 . Her body was only found in 2010 and Restivo was convicted and jailed for 30 years for the murder last November. In both cases, Restivo snipped locks of hair from both victims' bodies. The scene of Miss Barnett's brutal and ritualistic killing was just three streets away from the scene of Miss Shin's murder. According to some law experts, the . chances of different killers striking four months apart and such a close . proximity to one another are very remote. Benguit's legal team has been lobbying the CCRC to look into the possibility that Restivo killed Miss Shin. It is thought the commission has been . in contact with Interpol with a number of questions in relation to the . Miss Clap's Italian investigation involving of Restivo. Once it has concluded its . investigations, the commission will make a decision as to whether . Benguit's case should be referred to the Court of Appeal for a full . appeal hearing. Jailed: Danilo Restivo, left, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the death of 16-year-old Elisa Claps, right . Des Jensen, who is part of Benguit's legal team, said: 'We are confident it will be sent to the Court of Appeal.' Benguit's sister Amy Benguit said: . 'Everything is in the CCRC's hands and we have got to be patient . because they have got to carry out their own investigation. 'Omar is feeling very positive. He . will never ever say he did something if he didn't. He said he would . rather come out in a coffin than admit to something he didn't do. 'I know he will be handed leave to . appeal. A lot of mistakes were made along the way. I don't really want . to blame anyone - all we want is justice for Omar and Oki.' Barry Loveday, a reader of criminal justice studies at Portsmouth University, has spent months investigating Miss Shin's murder. He said: 'There are similarities in . Oki Shin's killing and Danilo Restivo's modus operandi, like the use of a . very long bladed knife. Discovery: The decomposed body of Elisa was found on the roof of the Santa Trinita Church in Potenza, Italy, pictured, last year . 'The likelihood of two killers . wandering around with similar knives three streets apart in Charminster . at about the same time is very, very small. 'The likelihood of two murders by two individuals three streets and four months apart is frankly unbelievable. 'One must conclude that one can probably link up the murder of Oki Shin to Danilo Restivo as well.' Restivo arrived in Britain in . March 2002 and was placed under intense surveillance since he became a . suspect in Miss Barnett's murder soon after her death. The house in Bournemouth, Dorset, where Heather Barnett was found murdered in 2002 . When previously asked whether . Restivo was responsible for any other killings, Detective Superintendent . Stuart Cooper said: 'As far as we're aware there are no other victims - . we're not actively looking for or concerned about anyone else. 'Restivo arrived in Britain in March . 2002, Heather was killed in November and we've been watching him . carefully since then - it's a relatively short window of time. 'I don't think you can ever be totally . sure but without any credible evidence to say there are further . suspicions it's difficult to say.' Asked whether Dorset police would . be re-opening the Oki Shin murder, a spokesman said: 'Omar Benguit was . convicted of Oki Shin's murder. He lodged and appeal and that was . dismissed.

Women are happier and less stressed than overworked men, according to a survey of lifestyles in 34 countries. Men living in the world's most advanced nations work longer hours and earn higher wages, but are more likely to be exposed to danger and have a lower life expectancy. But while women might score higher on measures of happiness, they still spend twice as much time as men doing housework - an average extra of two-and-a-half hour each day. Happier: Women are also better educated and less stressed than overworked men, according to a survey of lifestyles in 34 countries . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's online Better Life Index measures well-being based on factors including health, jobs, community, education, safety and 'work-life balance'. Researchers have now, for the first time, broken down the results into age and gender as well as by country. Their findings show that Britain is the world's twelfth happiest nation, ahead of France and Germany but way behind Australia and the U.S. at numbers one and three respectively. Perhaps unsurprisingly given its current economic, social and political woes, Turkey came last. There are also sharp divisions along gender lines. Australia . Norway . U.S. Sweden . Denmark . Canada . Switzerland . Netherlands . New Zealand . Luxembourg . Finland . Britain . Iceland . Belgium . Ireland . Austria . Germany . France . Spain . Slovenia . Women across the 34 nations surveyed spend an average of 279 minutes per day carrying out housework or caring for children or the elderly, compared with 131 minutes each day for meen. British men are almost three times more likely to be working 'very long hours' when compared to women. Also in the UK, 75 per cent of men are in paid work, compared with 65 per cent of women. Across the 34 countries, 72 per cent of men and 59 per cent of women have jobs, including part-time employment. Men were found to be slightly healthier than women but still have a life expectancy some six years less than women. In Britain, life expectancy at birth is 80 and women outlive men by an average of three years. However, men are three times as likely to be murdered than women - with three killings per 100,000 compared to one per 100,000 among women. Men are also 15 per cent more likely to be mugged or assaulted. The OECD researchers said: 'Much has been said and written about the need for greater gender equality, but it is a rather complex picture. 'True, men earn more and work more than women, but they are also more likely to be victims of assault or murder, while women live longer and have stronger social networks but are more likely to end their lives in poverty.'","Men are three times more likely to be murdered and 15% more likely to be assaulted or mugged .

Rebekah Brooks asked for her office to be 'discreetly' swept for bugs, the hacking trial heard today. In January 2011, months before the closure of the News of the World and her resignation as chief executive of News International, Brooks emailed a request copying in former head of security and co-defendant Mark Hanna. It read: 'Can you have my office swept... thanks. Discreetly.' The court heard that the News International offices were swept regularly for listening devices, especially during their bid for the takeover of BSkyB in 2011, to ensure that rival journalists or companies could listen in on private discussions. (Left) Rebekah Brooks had been sent threatening . mail after the hacking allegations came to light in 2011, (right) Rebekah Brooks' former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, who was . arrested in 2012 and questioned regarding the hacking trial . Co-defendant Mark Hanna was News Corp head of security during 2011, and was in charge of sweeping the building for covert listening devices. William Clegg QC, defending Hanna, claimed that these sorts of sweeps were a regular occurrence. Clegg said: ‘Offices were swept on various occasions to ensure no listening devices were in the executive offices or suites, which was perfectly normal and routine. ‘There were a number of reasons for that, one obviously was newspapers are very competitive with each other, and some journalists may be anxious to try to steal a scoop from a rival. ‘One of the reasons for the sweeps was to avoid that possibility. ‘In 2011, News Corp was trying to increase its shareholding in BSkyB, I think with the objective of becoming the majority shareholder. ‘It was a sensitive topic at News Corp, and another reason why you would want to be sure discussions about such a matter were not broadcast to people who were potential competitors.’ The sweeps were carried out by a contractor called White Rock, under the direction of Hanna. Jane Viner, News International group director for property and facilities said that request was ‘a perfectly routine request from an executive.’ 'It was normal and routine, as in other news organisations I have worked in. Hanna, who served in the first Gulf war, was also in charge of preparing journalists to work in a war zone, and dealing with hate mail that was sent to the News International offices when the hacking scandal broke in 2011. Brooks had been sent 'threatening mail' during 2011 as hacking allegations emerged, she also told the Old Bailey trial. Abusive mail was usually intercepted in the post room and, if it got through the first check, it would be picked up by personal assistants, she said. The court heard that, at the time, security around key executives had been stepped up. Clegg said: 'The security risk had never been higher' than in July 2011, when protection detail was set up for Rebekah Brooks and two other people who worked at the company. Brooks was codenamed 'Blackhawk' by security, while the other two were named 'Kestrel' and 'Sparrowhawk'. The court also heard today that Brooks' PA Cheryl Carter was arrested as she was planning to . Brooks was heard in court today to have said to her head of security to 'discreetly' sweep her office of bugs . emigrate to Australia. She was arrested at 6.50am on 6 January 2012, a fortnight before she was due to move to Perth, where she had a job with the Murdoch-owned Perth Times. When questioned about the timing of the arrest, considering Carter had been co-operating as a witness to the investigation, DS John Massey said: 'It was identified in a decision taken with the senior investigating officer that she was likely to leave for Australia very soon. When asked why she had been arrested at 6.50am he said: 'it was to give her a full day's interview, which would not be possible if arrested late in the afternoon or evening. 'At ten to seven, there was no chance of her leaving for work, and it was not an ungodly time of day. 'It seemed a sensible time for the arrest.' The court heard Carter told police about boxes of material belonging to brooks being held by the solicitors Kingsley Napley. The jury were told that upon investigation, the boxes were found by DS Massey to contain Brooks' personal items, such as photo albums, letters to The Sun and The News of the World and letters of congratulation on her promotion. In addition, one box was labeled 'Mr. Murdoch 2000 - 2008, and another was labeled 'media intrusion'. DS Massey also said that he found diaries dated 1995 to 2010, four A5 notebooks, a small reporters pad and two filofaxes, but the officer told the court that none of the boxes were from the News International archive. Later, the jury was shown CCTV footage from the Brooks' London home in Chelsea Harbour. Shortly after Rebekah Brooks was arrested by police, her husband is seen entering the building and then exiting an underground car park holding a jiffy bag and a laptop. Within a minute, he returns to the building empty handed. Former NotW and Sun editor Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, and Hanna deny a charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. All seven defendants in the case, including Brooks’ husband Charles Brooks, Cheryl Carter, Stuart Kuttner, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson, deny all the charges. The trial was adjourned into 10am tomorrow when a police officer in the case will give evidence.","The News International offices were routinely swept for listening devices .

The World Association Of Newspapers And News Publishers is meeting Culture Secretary Maria Miller . A world body on Press freedom has warned that the British Government’s plans for a Royal Charter on Press regulation could threaten the independence of newspapers and be used by ‘repressive regimes’ to justify censorship. The World Association Of Newspapers And News Publishers is visiting Britain and is meeting Culture Secretary Maria Miller and John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Commons culture select committee. The Royal Charter was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen last month, in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists. It underpins with statute a new body . to oversee the regulation of the Press, with publications that refuse to . comply facing ‘exemplary’ damages in libel cases. Newspapers . and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it . would bring to an end 300 years of Press freedom. Instead, . the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its . activities, known as the Independent Press Standards Organisation . (Ipso). It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious . and systemic wrongdoing. Vincent . Peyrègne, chief executive of the World Association, said that the . Government’s plans for Press regulation could have ‘far-reaching . consequences across the globe’. The organisation’s missions are normally reserved for regimes where there are severe concerns about censorship, which have included Ethiopia, Libya, Yemen and Burma. Mr Peyrègne said: ‘Any threats to the independence of journalism in Britain could be used by repressive regimes worldwide to justify their own controls over the Press. ‘We will endeavour to investigate  all elements that threaten the United Kingdom’s position as a bastion for free and independent media with  the same rigour as we have approached other international Press freedom hot spots in nearly 70 years of defending freedom of expression worldwide.’ The delegation is also speaking to freedom of expression and civil society groups, professional bodies, various industry representatives and academics. The mission includes representatives of newspapers in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Canada, the  United States and Pakistan.

Failed asylum seekers have been given an £80,000 astroturf football pitch paid for by taxpayers as schools are forced to sell their own grounds. Asylum seekers got their own sports facility at Campsfield House, Kidlington, Oxfordshire, to use while they are waiting to be deported. While struggling schools are selling their own facilities to pay for improvements, the 216 men at the centre also have a fitness suite, IT centre, library and are given money for winning sports competitions. Campsfield House Detention Centre in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, now has a new astroturf pitch . Banbury Academy, which is near to the centre, is selling its playing fields to developers for £750,000 so it can afford to build a new sports hall and an all-weather pitch for students. The school says selling the playing fields is the only way to fund 'desperately-needed' improvements. According to the Sun, North Kidlington primary is holding jumble sales to fund a new play area and children at Bletchingdon primary have to walk 800 yards to a village hall for PE lessons. UKIP campaigner Paul Nuttal told the Sun he thought the money spent at the detention centre was wrong. He said: 'While services are stretched to breaking point, taxpayers are forking out so illegal immigrants can have a good kickabout.' Last summer, it emerged that 50 playing fields had been sold off over the last three years in what was labelled a 'threat to our Olympic legacy'. On average, 17 are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities. The figures make a mockery of a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement. Banbury Academy, which is near to the centre, is selling its playing fields to developers for £750,000 . This followed the huge outcry over Labour disposing of playing fields at the slightly higher rate of 28 each year. The deals included the sale of a football pitch to a developer by Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, whose former pupils include gold medal-winning cyclist Dani King. Elliott School in Putney, south London, was allowed to sell five acres of fields with six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground to make way for luxury housing. Several sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel. Only five have been rejected by the Department for Education. The DfE claims the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly.","Illegal immigrants got sports facility at Campsfield House, Kidlington .

A woman cleared of causing her elder sister’s death in a car crash has tearfully described how she believed her sibling ‘would not have blamed me’. Jennie Stone, 28, died after her Peugeot 206 collided with her sister Rosie-Ann’s Vauxhall Astra in February last year. Both had pulled out of a queue to overtake a slow-moving lorry on a road near Bridlington, East Yorkshire. Jennie’s car was sent careering across the road into a tree. The mother of one, who was studying at the University of Lincoln to become a social worker, died at the scene. Tragic accident: Jennie Stone (right) died after her Peugeot 206 collided with a car being driven by her sister Rosie-Ann (left). They had overtaken a slow-moving lorry at the same time, leading to the crash . Now Rosie-Ann, 21, has spoken of her relief at being found not guilty of causing her sister’s death by careless driving – amid criticism of the Crown Prosecution Service for having brought the case at all. She said that, during her five-day trial at Hull Crown Court last week, she was prepared for a nine-month sentence, but that serving time in jail would not have been as bad as the guilty verdict itself. ‘If I was found guilty, that would have meant Jennie’s death had been my fault. I would not have been able to live with myself,’ she said. ‘I was visualising her as she was when we were growing up together. I was thinking how she looked. How she smelt. Everything about her.’ She added: ‘During the trial, I looked at the jury – every one of them. I felt sorry for them. Some of them looked at me sympathetically. Some looked at me sternly. ‘I had no idea what they were thinking.’ Rosie-Ann said she had prepared for a nine-month sentence during her trial at Hull Crown Court . But the jury ruled that Rosie-Ann was not to blame for the accident. She said that, as she left court after the verdict, a juror told her: ‘We all believed you. Live your life. Be happy.’ In the days following the accident, she had constantly apologised to her parents, Angie and Bob, while replaying the tragic events of that day. ‘I was thinking, “What if I had got up earlier that morning?” These are the type of things that were going through my mind.’ Ms Stone said her sister had been her emotional crutch after their brother, 20-year-old soldier Gregg, pictured below, was shot dead in June 2012 while serving in Afghanistan. She helped her elder sister move to a new house in Bridlington the day before the accident, and  says the family was beginning to recover from Gregg’s death. ‘Life was slowly becoming more bearable for us all,’ she said. ‘I leant on Jennie a lot. She helped me cope with losing Gregg. Then it all fell to pieces again when we lost Jennie.’ The case itself was traumatic for the family, who had begged the CPS not to bring it to court. Angie Stone, 56, the girls’ mother, wore a moonstone necklace in the shape of a heart, given to her by her dead daughter, to keep her memory alive. Mother-of-one Jennie Stone had been studying to become a social worker at the University of Lincoln  at the time of the accident. She was pronounced dead at the scene after her car ploughed into a tree . The accident occured just months after the sisters' brother Private Gregg Stone died in Afghanistan . ‘Jennie bought it for me when she was just 16 years old. The day she was killed, I pulled it out of the drawer and I have worn it every  day since. Just because Jennie is not here, it doesn’t  mean she is no longer part of  our family.’ Her husband Bob, also 56, wore his son’s regimental tie with a lapel badge showing a tear on a Union Flag – a symbol worn by parents of fallen soldiers. Mrs Stone said grief for Gregg was suspended when their daughter died. ‘We began the grieving process for Jennie. But we felt we were betraying Gregg somehow. ‘Then, when the Crown Prosecution Service announced it was prosecuting Rosie-Ann, we stopped grieving altogether.’ Mr Stone told the Hull Daily Mail: ‘Then we had the fight of our lives on our hands. ‘And we were scared. More scared than we have ever been in our lives. ‘I cannot forgive the CPS for the pain, suffering and distress they put our family through. There have been no winners in this.’ When the verdict was announced, Mr and Mrs Stone stood, weeping, and embraced in the public gallery. The CPS has released a statement defending the decision to prosecute in the public interest, though Judge Simon Jack said after the verdict he had concerns about the case.","Rosie-Ann Stone, 21, had been accused of causing the death of her sister .

A senior Indian politician and his wife have denied reports they are to divorce after she apparently hacked his Twitter account and posted messages implying he was having an affair with a Pakistani journalist. Shashi Tharoor, India's human resources minister - known as 'Minister Twitter' for his love of the social messaging site - was left acutely embarrassed after the messages appeared on his feed. They suggested to his more than two million followers that he was in the throes of a passionate affair with Mehr Tarar, a high profile journalist. Mr Tharoor, 57, deleted the tweets, . claiming his account had been 'hacked'. But his wife, Sunanda Pushkar . Tharoor, subsequently told two Indian newspapers that she had published . the private messages between him and Ms Tarar. Shashi Tharoor was left red-faced after the messages appeared on his . Twitter feed suggesting he was having an affair with a Pakistani . journalist. His wife Sunanda (pictured right) later said she had published them . One . message, which appeared to have been directly sent from Ms Tarar's . account, said: 'I love you, Shashi Tharoor. And I go while in love with . you, irrevocably, irreversibly, hamesha [always]. Bleeding, but always . your Mehr.' Ms Tarar denied . sending the messages and any suggestion that she was in a relationship . with Mr Tharoor. She tweeted that she had 'always praised Shashi Tharoor . OPENLY on twitter. Wrote an op-ed on him. Reviewed his book. Forwarded . tweets. Only b/c [because] NOTHING to hide'. But Mrs Tharoor told India's Economic Times newspaper that she had published the tweets to show the world how Ms Tarar was 'stalking' her husband. She . said: 'Our accounts have not been hacked and I have been sending out . these tweets. I cannot tolerate this. This is a Pakistani woman who is . an ISI (Inter Services Intelligence) agent, and she is stalking my . husband. 'And you know how men are. He is flattered by the attention.' Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar is at the centre of the controversy . She was also quoted by The Indian Express as . saying that she would seek a divorce after learning that her husband . and Ms Tarar had been having a 'rip-roaring affair' since April, which . had left her feeling 'destroyed as a wife and a woman'. 'I completely stand by my tweets, I 100 per cent stand by that,' she told the paper. 'That . woman pursued and pursued him .. men are stupid anyways ... for all you . know she is a Pakistani agent. Where’s love, where’s loyalty in this . world ... I am so distraught.' Mrs Tharoor's claims were strenuously denied by Ms Tarar, who is a columnist for Lahore's Daily Times newspaper. In a statement given to India's NDTV . channel, she said: 'In her tweets, she has accused me both of stalking . him and of having an affair with him. How can it be both? 'It just shows there are wild allegations. Her tweets to me are so crazy that all I can do is laugh. 'Maybe . she took offense to the fact that I have praised him so much. But I am . very transparent - anything that I have said is on my Twitter timeline, . for the whole world to see.' Ms . Tarar interviewed Mr Tharoor in New Delhi last April, after which she . wrote a flattering profile in which she described him as 'strikingly . good looking' with a 'powerful, deep and sensuous' voice.

The grieving mother of a baby who died just hours after his birth has claimed two hospitals would not admit her when she started bleeding heavily. Christina Evans says Good Hope and Birmingham Women’s Hospitals both said they were unable to treat her as they were full. Jayden Lee Potts’ short life came to an end just hours after he was born, 16 weeks early, at Birmingham City Hospital. Christina Evans (pictured with her daughter, Elisha) says two hospitals were unable to admit her when she started bleeding heavily six weeks before her due date with baby Jayden . His mother said that before she was admitted to City Hospital and underwent a Caesarean section, both Birmingham Women’s and Good Hope Hospitals informed ambulance crews they didn’t have the capacity to admit her. The 25-year-old, from Rhyl, north east Wales, was visiting her father in Kingstanding, Birmingham, when the tragedy occurred. She has now called for a review of emergency hospital spaces for women in premature labour. ‘It was horrible,’ she said. ‘It felt like no-one cared about us. ‘Jayden was born after an emergency Caesarean section and weighed just 1lbs 9oz. I don’t ever want another woman to have to go through what I did.’ Ms Evans’ brother called 999 when she started bleeding heavily while staying with her father on November 1. She started bleeding because her placenta had ruptured. Ms Evans was eventually admitted to Birmingham City Hospital after being told Good Hope and Birmingham Women's Hospitals were too full. Jayden was delivered by C section but died soon afterwards . She claims paramedics spent precious moments calling hospitals in a bid to find a place for her to deliver Jayden. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘Being a visitor from north Wales, the patient was not booked into a maternity unit in Birmingham to have the birth. ‘As such, and to avoid the possibility of having to make a subsequent hospital transfer, the ambulance crew rang round local hospitals to establish who was able to accept her. ‘The situation was being explained to the patient while the ambulance crews were making the enquiries with hospitals. Good Hope Hospital says it's surprised Ms Evans was told by paramedics that she could not be taken there . ‘The first hospital to accept was City Hospital and she was taken there straight away.’ Following the tragedy, Ms Evans is now back in Rhyl with her partner Kriston, 21, and four-year-old daughter, Elisha. Concerns premature maternity services could be critically over-stretched have heightened after bosses at Birmingham Women’s Hospital admitted they were full to bursting on the night Ms Evans needed treatment. Birmingham Women's Hospital says it would have been 'clinically unsafe' to admit Ms Evans that evening as the hospital was very full . Chief executive at the hospital, Professor Ros Keeton, said it would have been ‘clinically unsafe’ to admit the mother. She said: ‘We are very sorry to hear of Mrs Evans’ traumatic experience and extend our sympathies for her loss. ‘We would like to reassure the public that Birmingham Women’s Hospital would never turn away an emergency patient because she wasn’t from the area and, indeed, we accept emergencies on a regular basis. Ms Evans says she hopes no other woman ever has to go through what she experienced . ‘The only reasons we would decline such an admission would be if we did not have the capacity to take a woman or her baby, and to do so would be clinically unsafe. ‘On this particular evening we could not offer the neonatal intensive care cot which Jayden would have needed, as all of our 39 cots were full. ‘The cross-city policy is for such emergencies to be referred to the unit with the specialist resources available.’ Maggie Coleman, matron and site lead for Maternity Clinical Services at Good Hope Hospital, said: 'We would like to send our sincerest condolences to Ms Evans at this very sad time. The safety and care of women and their unborn babies is our top priority and we have strict guidelines stating a woman would never be refused admittance to our maternity unit. 'Good Hope Hospital is a designated level 1, Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU), which provides special care only to premature babies of 34 weeks gestation and above. 'Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust  is part of the South-West Midlands Newborn Network (SWMNN), and has a level 1 unit at Good Hope Hospital and a level 3 unit at Heartlands Hospital. 'We take patient feedback very seriously and are surprised to hear that the paramedics told Ms Evans that we refused to admit her. I would urge Ms Evans to get in touch with us directly so we can investigate her concerns.' Jayden’s parents have also lodged a complaint against Birmingham City Hospital, alleging a delay in providing a death certificate meant they could not take the baby’s body home for a week. A spokesman for Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs City Hospital, said: ‘The death of any baby is very tragic and we understand that this is a difficult time for Christina and her family. ‘We have already provided a full and detailed response to Christina regarding the issues she has raised and would like to reiterate our sincere condolences to Christina and her family.’","Christina Evans called an ambulance when she started bleeding 16 weeks before Jayden's due date - she was staying with her father in Birmingham .

TBone explained that he'd needed the surgery to sew his buttocks together after being diagnosed with severe pilonidal cysts. The man told captivated readers how he had to have his buttocks sewn together after repeated surgery for a painful medical condition . These are painful boils that occur at the end of the tailbone or between the buttocks. It's unclear why they occur, but it's  generally thought they are caused by loose hairs that push into the skin. Certain things can increase . the chances of developing a pilonidal cyst, such as being obese, . having a large amount of body hair and having a job that involves a lot . of sitting or driving. TBone added: 'I've had multiple surgeries on it [the cyst] and instead of the usual procedure . which involves letting it heal, mine was so bad that a plastic surgeon . had to close it up. But they keep coming back, and it'll probably just . get worse as I age'. After several operations, his surgeon decided to close the space eight years ago to try and prevent the problem from recurring.

Long since a favourite with the Royal family, luxury department store Fortnum & Mason has announced the highest profits in its entire 306-year history. Often referred to as the 'Queen’s grocer', the store managed to buck 2013's bleak high street trend for pretty dismal festive sales figures. The company announced the incredible profits this week, which showed that sales reached £65m in 2013, up 10 per cent on the previous year, and profit before tax was £1.8m, a five-fold increase on 2012. Fortnum & Mason has announced the highest profits in its entire 306-year history, despite other high street stores struggling . Together with the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen visited Fortnum's, which has many royal warrants, last year . And despite people still feeling the effect of recent economic hardship, the British public are clearly not afraid to fork out for luxury, with sales of truffles up a whopping 130 per cent, and hand-carved wild salmon up 18 per cent. For the five weeks up to 5 January 2014, sales were up 16 per cent, which may in part be due to recent re-vamping of the Piccadilly store in 2013, including the launch of a jewellery room and a new room dedicated solely to candles. As well as the high-quality produce with which Fortnum's is synonymous, part of their festive success is down to their famous hampers, which sold in record numbers this Christmas. The world-famous hampers were up by 15 per cent, providing the group with the best hamper sales in its 306-year history. Another cause of the success may be the fact that Fortnum & Mason opened a new store and tea salon located inside St Pancras International statio in November last year . Fortnum's had a brilliant Christmas period, and in the five weeks up to 5 January sales were up 16 per cent . Truffles up 133% . Turkish Delight up 42% . Vintage Port up 26% . Hand carved wild salmon up 18% . Candles up 41% . Ewan Venters, chief executive of Fortnum & Mason, said: 'Christmas at Fortnum's was one of the best yet, both in terms of sales and customer satisfaction. 'The demand for more bespoke luxurious items, together with the Christmas staples, is at an all-time high, suggesting that consumers still want to treat themselves during the festive period. ‘We continue to invest in the business to provide our customers with the best possible experience, both in our stores and online - another area of significant year on year growth.' Established in 1707, the Queen's grocer Fortnum & Mason has been a Piccadilly stalwart for 307 years. The iconic Victorian building in Green Park, the heart of London, is a favourite tourist destination as well as the place well-to-do Londoners shop for luxury hampers and foie gras, or take high tea. Fortnum & Mason has supplied goods to royalty since 1707 when co-founder William Fortnum was appointed footman in the household of Queen Anne. Its close association with royalty - and the number of warrants it has received - mean it is one of the most prestigious and exclusive department stores in the world. A hallmark of luxury and extravagance, hamper sales were up by 15 per cent over the Christmas period as more and more people give them as gifts to impress.

A grandmother has been ‘left to die’ by the NHS after being refused life-saving chemotherapy - because her cancer is not ‘exceptional’ enough. After waiting eight months for the treatment using ‘anti-cancer’ drug Ofatumumab, Mary Stanton, 69, was told she was not eligible for it and there was nothing more doctors could do for her. The grandmother of four says she was given no explanation from the Cancer Drugs Fund – which is overseen by NHS England - except that her condition was not ‘exceptional’ enough. She was given the devastating news by her oncology consultant, Dr Richard Murrin, at Birmingham’s City Hospital, who was also baffled by the decision and vowed to appeal it. Mrs Stanton who was already ‘distraught’ with the news, was then handed a ‘My Life’ pamphlet by a hospital nurse advising her on what provisions to make when she becomes ‘too ill’ to carry out her wishes. Now Mrs Stanton - who is a full-time carer for her daughter Angela, 48, who has Down’s Syndrome and Crohn’s Disease - can only wait while she and her doctor fight for NHS England to change their mind. But if their appeal doesn't work, she said she will have no choice but to sell her house to pay for the £40,000 treatment. ‘It's the only option I'll have,’ she said. 'But then where would I go? I'd have nothing left.' ‘After I retired seven years ago I looked after my daughter. 'I saved the NHS thousands doing that and now they can't be bothered to fund my treatment.' She questioned how she can be refused a potentially life-saving treatment when some doctors are living ‘champagne lifestyles’ and being paid as much as £1,500 to work in A&E units at night – as revealed in the Daily Mail on Saturday. Speaking from her home in Nechells, Birmingham, yesterday she said: ‘It feels as though I have been given a death sentence. ‘I have been left dangling and keep getting fobbed off. No one is giving me any answers.’ Despair: Mrs Stanton - who is a full-time carer for her daughter Angela, who has Down's Syndrome - can only wait while she and her doctor fight for NHS England to change their mind . Mrs . Stanton, who worked since the age of 18 as a barmaid and shop assistant . until she retired, said her doctor recently secured funding for another . patient with very similar circumstances. Ofatumumab, or Arzerra,  is a treatment used for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia when the cancer drugs fludarabine and alemtuzumab are no longer working. The drug is what's known as a type of monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are made in the lab and used for targeted cancer treatment. They recognise and find specific proteins on the outside of cancer cells. Ofatumumab targets part of a protein called CD20 on the surface of the chronic lymphocytic leukaemic cells. The ofatumumab sticks to all the CD20 proteins it finds. Then the cells of the immune system pick out the marked cells and kill them. Source: Cancer Research UK . ‘It feels diabolical. I don’t feel like I’m ready to die. ‘How can they give one patient with the same condition treatment, but not me?’ Having already endured a 14-month wait for the drug, and with her health quickly declining, Mrs Stanton has endured two blood transfusions in the past three weeks in an attempt to keep her immune system strong. She has been previously treated with three rounds of chemotherapy, but could benefit from Ofatumumab - also known as Azerra - as it can help patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, when other drugs are not working. The mother of three said her main concern is for her daughter and mother who rely on her care and support. ‘I . have had to stop looking after Angela because of this, and that will . cost the NHS money as she has had to go into a residential home,’ she . said. ‘I have people who rely on me, my mother also has dementia, the situation makes me so scared for them if I'm left to simply die. ‘You see all these people who do nothing, and the people who come into this country brand new and they get treatment on the NHS. Happier times: Mrs Stanton on her 50th birthday. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma seven years ago - and says the latest decision feels like 'a death sentence' ‘Then I come along, having funded it all my life and they say no and leave me to die.’ Mrs Stanton said Dr Mullin has approached the drug companies directly to see if they will give his patient the treatment on 'compassionate grounds'. ‘If my doctors didn't think I had a chance they would have told me, they would not be fighting so hard now,’ she said. ‘Dr Murrin has been a great support and has done all he can to try to secure the funding, but there's only so much he can do.’ A . spokesman for NHS England said: 'Like any treatment, the decision on . whether to approve the use of a treatment from the Cancer Drugs Fund is . always based on clinical evidence of its effectiveness and clinical . benefit for each patient. Mrs Stanton aged 33, with her son Richard. She now fears that without funding for her life-saving treatment, she will be forced to sell her house . 'Each case is considered on an individual basis and has to meet set criteria, which includes exceptional clinical circumstances. 'When the decision is taken that a treatment is not of benefit for an individual we understand how distressing this can be. The decision is, however, based on whether the treatment will be effective and benefit the individual. 'There is an opportunity for the patient and their clinician to appeal against the process.' A spokeswoman from the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are reluctant to comment on individual cases. 'However we can confirm that we have applied so far unsuccessfully for exceptional funding. We continue to discuss options with our patient, and apologise unreservedly if discussing her care created an impression that there was only one option.'","Mary Stanton, 69, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma seven years ago .

One in five obese adults would rather be fat than have to watch what they eat, new research has revealed. Some 17 per cent also say they have never attempted to lose weight and 48 per cent are resigned to remaining obese because they lack the willpower to diet. Nuffield Health surveyed 550 obese people and asked them about their attitudes towards exercise and weight loss. A quarter said they do not have time to exercise and 40 per cent claimed to find exercise boring. A new survey has revealed that one in five obese British adults would rather remain overweight than have to watch what they eat - some 17 per cent also say they have never attempted to lose weight . Shockingly, one in seven said they would rather risk their healthy by being overweight than have to do exercise. The news comes just the day after Lord Tebbit said that fat people have only themselves to blame for their obesity if they insist on 'stuffing themselves silly'. The former Tory chairman said people’s ‘stupid actions’ in eating ‘rubbish’ foods all day was behind the rise in obesity. He was cheered in the House of Lords when he told peers that rather than setting up government initiatives to persuade  people to eat more healthily, ministers should simply tell them that weight is a matter of individual responsibility. Former employment secretary Lord Tebbit said: ‘People ought to know that if they stuff themselves silly with high-calorie rubbish foods, they will get fat. ‘It’s their responsibility and all the forums and other nonsenses are merely trying to divorce  people from the consequences of their own stupid actions.’ The researchers also polled 3,100 adults in Britain who were of varying weights. They discovered that 39 per cent of people claim not to eat healthily because it is too expensive to do so. A quarter of obese people say they do not have time to exercise and 40 per cent claim to find exercise boring . They also learned that 14 per cent of people think they lack the time to prepare healthy food and 10 per cent say they do not know how to eat healthily. As a result, it is little surprise that 40 per cent of people say seeing obese adults in the area they live in is common, and 38 per cent say childhood obesity is the norm. While a lot of people appear to feel . unable to resolve their weight problems, many have suggestions as to . what could be done to help them. Of . the people surveyed, 45 per cent said GP referrals for exercise should . be considered and 40 per cent said they would like to see increased . funding for recognised weight management programmes. Some . 43 per cent want stricter regulations on ‘unhealthy’ food and drink . chains sponsoring high profile events and 40 per cent said school meals . should be regulated. While the majority of respondents - 81 per cent - said obesity is the fault of the individual, when questioned about contributing factors to the UK’s obesity epidemic, more than half - 55 per cent - said the blame lies with the food industry. Dr Davina Deniszczyc, GP and Medical Director of Wellbeing at Nuffield Health, said: ‘If you are struggling financially, a cut-price fast food offer might seem like the best value option, but it is disappointing to see so many people are falling for this myth. ‘There is clearly a huge amount of work to be done to persuade people that the cheapest food can actually be the healthiest food. ‘That people would rather be overweight than eat healthily also needs to be addressed, because the repercussions of children and young adults growing up within this mind-set will be a tragedy. ‘When such high numbers are reporting childhood obesity as the norm in their towns and cities means we’re already playing catch-up if we are to help these children and young adults avoid a life of obesity and related ill health.’ The results of the poll come just the day after Lord Tebbit claimed overweight people have only themselves to blame for their weight if they 'stuff themselves silly' Jackie Donkin, Nutritional Therapist at Nuffield Health, said: ‘People who are trapped in the rut that is obesity need to take a step back and really think about the food they are eating. ‘As a nation, if we continue in this way we are heading for not only an obese population of children and adults, but a chronically ill population. ‘The key to success is not just dieting, it is long-term lifestyle changes that people need to adopt and which will only work if taken in small steps over a long period of time. ‘Eating more fruit and vegetables, cutting down on takeaways, or eating food in its natural state, rather than covered in rich sauces, will drastically reduce the amount of fat and sugar we eat. ‘Increasing day-to-day activity, walking up the stairs instead of taking the lift, walking those short distances instead of taking the car, going for a walk around the block in the evening, will all contribute to a healthier lifestyle, which once adopted will become much easier to maintain over time.’","17% have never attempted to lose weight and 40% say exercise is boring .

A grieving mother is suing the NHS after a locum doctor refused to give her a scan when her unborn baby was in distress. Ammie Fearon, 26, was 39 weeks pregnant when a midwife was concerned her bump had not grown so booked her in for an emergency scan at the hospital. But when she arrived at Birmingham . Heartlands Hospital, locum consultant Dr James Davis told her there were . no slots available and examined her before sending her home. Ammie Fearon (pictured with her partner, Paul Foster) is suing the NHS after her baby was stillborn just days after a locum doctor told her she didn't need an emergency scan . Four days later a GP examined Ms Fearon and discovered her baby had died in the womb. She was forced to give birth to her dead daughter Lily-Ella on April 26, 2012. Following the death, the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, carried out a full investigation which revealed six key failings. They included Ms Fearon not being referred for a scan, staff not having adequate training and poor communication between the midwife and Dr Davis. Ms Fearon, from Chelmsley Wood, Birmingham, is convinced that had she had undergone the scan on April 20, her baby could have been saved. She said: ‘I know that Lily could have been saved if the problems had been detected earlier. Instead I had to go through the worst experience of my life, something which no one should go through. When Ms Fearon was 39 weeks pregnant, a midwife became concerned her baby had stopped growing and referred her for an emergency scan but a doctor said it wasn't necessary . ‘Everything was fine with the pregnancy up until 39 weeks. I went for a check up on April 17 and the midwife was concerned my bump hadn’t grown. ‘I was booked in for an emergency scan but no slots were available until April 20. ‘A locum consultant then checked me out on April 20 and he just said I was fully engaged and there was no problem with the growth, so I didn’t have the scan. Four days after the scan should have taken place, Ms Fearon's GP realised her baby had died. Lily-Ella had to be induced and was delivered using forceps. Image shows her footprints . ‘The problem was he was looking at . notes which said I had been seen just a few days before so he said “of . course the baby hasn’t grown”. ‘He said it was unethical the nurse had referred me for a scan because it would have concerned me unnecessarily. April 17, 2012 - Midwife refers Ms Fearon for an emergency scan because of concerns her baby has not grown. April 20, 2012 - Locum consultant accidentally reads notes from April 17 check up and refuses to carry out scan wrongly believing the baby’s growth to be normal. April 24, 2012 - GP examines Ms Fearon and discovers the baby died in the womb. April 26, 2012 - Lily-Ella is stillborn. ‘That was the Friday (April 20) then on the following Tuesday (April 24) I felt something wasn’t right and I went to the GP. That was when he confirmed Lily had passed away. ‘I was in shock, I had felt her kicking the night before. ‘If I had had the scan on April 20 then all this would have been picked up. I was then induced to go into labour and sent home. ‘I had a 12 hour labour - it was horrible. My placenta ruptured and I was in so much pain, I was given every drug and even a spinal during the labour. ‘I was then taken into theatre and she was delivered using forceps. ‘It was very surreal, Lily-Ella was so quiet and there no crying. I was able to stay with her in the bereavement ward.’ Shockingly, . as she was in the bereavement ward another locum consultant wrongly . believed he was in the maternity unit and congratulated Ms Fearon on . being a new mum. Ms . Fearon, who works part-time at Asda, said: ‘Another locum consultant, . who clearly didn’t know where he was just came blustering into the ward . and said “congratulations” to me. Ms Fearon and Mr Foster have now had another baby - Macie - who was nearly lost like Lily-Ella as she also stopped growing and became distressed near the end of the pregnancy . ‘I didn’t know what to say but the nurses quickly told him he was in the wrong place and told him to get out. It’s just another example of how badly trained the staff were.’ After her ordeal, Ms Fearon became . pregnant with daughter Macie and at the same stage her midwife became . concerned the baby was not growing. This time she underwent a scan which revealed her unborn child was in distress and she had an emergency Caesarean. Ms . Fearon, who lives with partner Paul Foster, 21, and six-month-old . Macie, is now contacting solicitors to take legal action against the . NHS. Ms Fearon said: 'I know that Lily could have been saved if the problems had been detected earlier, instead I had to go through the worst experience of my life, something which no one should go through.' Image shows the order of service from her funeral . She said: ‘I was terrified during the whole of the pregnancy with Macie because I thought the same thing was going to happen again. ‘It did happen again though, the bump hadn’t grown enough but it was picked up on and I had a scan. The doctors said she needed to be delivered immediately. ‘Macie was born through a Caesarean six weeks early and she was in the neonatal unit for two weeks but she was absolutely fine - that was what should have happened to Lily. ‘I was treated like royalty during the second pregnancy and I always feel like it was because they knew something wrong had been done before.’ In his report to the NHS Trust, Dr Davis, who had been working at the hospital for seven months, said: ‘I was informed that there were no (ultrasound) slots available as the department was too busy. ‘I called the patient in to see me in the clinic room. I felt after clinical examination findings an ultrasound scan was not warranted. I transferred her back to midwife led care.’ The NHS Trust denies negligence but has apologised for the standard of care Ms Fearon received. Joy Payne, head of midwifery for Heart of England NHS Foudation Trust, said: ‘We would like to send our sincerest condolences to Ms Fearon and her family at this very sad time. ‘We take the safety and care of all of our patients very seriously and have undertaken a detailed investigation into the antenatal care Ms Fearon received. ‘I would like to apologise to Ms Fearon and would welcome an opportunity to meet with her to discuss any aspect of her care further.’","Ammie Fearon, 26, thinks her baby, Lily-Ella, would have survived if the care she had received at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital had been better .

Hard workers who log on after they finish work may be the most successful but they are most likely to develop compulsive internet use and risk their mental health, academics say. Increasing numbers of employees are working outside office hours, boosting their careers but putting their well-being at risk, a new study has shown. Researchers at two UK business schools said companies are ignoring the problems of staff developing compulsive behaviour - waking at night to check emails and feeling anxious when separated from their computer - because those affected are often the best employees. Successful employees who log on after work can become addicted and burn out, study says (file image) Dr Cristina Quinones-Garcia, of Northampton Business School, said the new phenomenon of hard workers becoming addicted to the web boosted their careers but had a downside, too. The academic, who co-wrote the study, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Those individuals who use technology to enable working beyond office hours tend to be highly successful in their jobs but are at a high risk of developing problems.' Co-author Nada Kakabadse, professor of policy, governance and ethics at Henley School of Business, said workaholics were likely to cross an invisible boundary and start to use the internet more than was healthy. Eating and sleeping patterns can become disrupted, relationships can suffer strain, and people can start to suffer withdrawal symptoms when separated from their computer, she said. 'They spend increasing amounts of time online, waking up to three times a night to check emails,' Dr Kakabadse said.  'They begin to lose judgement and make mistakes.' The academics said that what they discovered from their study of 516 men and women aged between 18-65 was that those most at risk of becoming addicted to the internet were not the young or unemployed people that they had anticipated, but hard workers with good jobs. Double-edged sword: Hard workers may do well in their careers, but at a cost to their mental health (file image) They now say employers should be aware of the risks to their employees' health and should draw up guidelines for their on how to use the internet outside the office safely. The researchers rated people for compulsive internet usage, emotional stability, excessive work and compulsive work and life satisfaction, and found that more than 60 per cent said they used the internet compulsively, often as a coping strategy. The study showed that those who became addicted to the computer were the most likely to suffer from isolation, depression and anxiety.","Workaholics who log on at night can harm their mental health, study says .

Deborah, 37, had scarring on her stomach following radiotherapy for Hodgkins lymphoma (cancer of a type of white blood cell) as a teenager and two subsequent Caesarean births. She had the 12-hour operation to remove the scar tissue, which was causing her pain, in September 2009. 'It went well, I was kept in for two days as planned, and sent home on the third,' says the former chef, from Greenford, Middlesex. 'I had anticipated the pain afterwards, which was moderate, but I didn't feel quite myself. I felt fluey, ached all over, and had a high temperature, but put it down to the after-effects of the op. 'On my second day home, I felt lethargic and wanted to sleep constantly. But I've had so much poor health - cancer, meningitis and pneumonia - that I didn't want to worry my loved ones. So I kept quiet and thought it was probably a normal reaction to major surgery.' But, by day three, Deborah's breathing had become erratic, she was totally exhausted and couldn't eat. 'I knew then something wasn't right. I tried to stand, but I collapsed, and I felt like I was suffocating,' she says. Deeply concerned, her family rang for an ambulance. But Deborah's partner Andrew ended up driving her to Charing Cross Hospital in London himself - although not their nearest hospital, it was where she'd had her operation. 'By the time we arrived, I couldn't stand and was struggling to stay awake,' says Deborah. 'Something was drastically wrong.' It was only because Andrew 'threw a tantrum' at A&E that doctors agreed to see her quickly, she says. 'He was very agitated, and more or less demanded that a doctor examine me - so I was seen within five minutes.' And it was this early intervention - rather than the four-hour waiting time she might have otherwise endured - that Deborah believes saved her life. 'I had a team of six or seven medics . around me, and one of them had dealt with a sepsis case before, so he . recognised my symptoms immediately, thank God,' she says. 'He . spotted my shallow breathing, flu-like symptoms and fatigue - all . tell-tale signs of sepsis - as well as the fact I hadn't been to the loo . for ten hours.' Breathlessness occurs as the body fights to increase oxygen flow to the brain, and sepsis patients struggle to pass urine as the condition affects their kidney function. Deborah was diagnosed with severe sepsis and taken to intensive care because her organs had begun shutting down. 'I was barely conscious and I felt like I was dying. My mum contacted my dad and got my brother to return from France, where he was working - no one thought I was coming home.' Sepsis occurs when the immune system over-reacts to a fungal, viral or bacterial infection, attacking the heart and other organs. It can cause fever, inflammation, low blood pressure, blood clotting problems and multiple organ failure. The most common causes are pneumonia, bowel perforation (when a hole opens up in the bowel, letting its contents into the abdomen), urinary infection and severe skin infections. However, an estimated 10 per cent of all cases are the result of post-operative infections, with bowel surgery carrying the highest risk because of the large number of bacteria in the area. It usually takes 48 to 72 hours for sepsis to develop  - genetic factors can affect the timing - but it can actually start developing several days after surgery. Around 37,000 people die from sepsis every year - more than from bowel and breast cancer (two of the most common causes of cancer deaths) combined. She was diagnosed with severe sepsis and taken to intensive care because her organs had begun shutting down . However, an estimated 13,000 of these deaths are preventable, according to a report last year from the Health Service Ombudsman, which blamed delayed diagnosis and treatment, failure to recognise the severity of the illness and poor procedures, for the deaths. Campaigners, including the charity UK Sepsis Trust, are calling for greater awareness of symptoms and for medics to be better trained to diagnose the condition. The charity was founded by Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care doctor at the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, following the death of a 37-year-old patient who developed sepsis in 2006 after a vasectomy. The patient's condition was missed by two GPs before he ended up being rushed to hospital. Within 48 hours he was dead. 'Part of the reason for the low awareness is that sepsis was only recognised relatively recently,' explains Dr Daniels. 'Tissue decay and bacterial infection have always existed, but sepsis is very complex and was only officially defined in 1991, following a consensus among international experts.' (It was formerly known as septicaemia, but this term tends to be associated with a bacterial infection of the blood through cuts or injury, which misrepresents the wide range of causes of sepsis.) Slurred speech, triggered by lack of blood supply to  the brain . Mottled or discoloured skin . Extremely painful muscles, due to lack of oxygen . Passing no urine (in one  day) as the kidneys stop working properly . Severe breathlessness - the body senses there isn't enough oxygen . getting to the brain, so it increases the 'drive' to breathe to increase . it . Chronic tiredness and swelling of the affected area . Another problem is that sepsis can affect all specialisms in medicine. As Dr Daniels says: 'Whereas heart attacks are “owned” by cardiologists, strokes by stroke specialists, and so on, there are no specific sepsis specialists fighting for money to combat it.' This makes funding harder to attract. Furthermore, it is difficult to diagnose, as there is no single tool for spotting it. 'All we have currently is a blood test that can help identify high levels of lactate, a chemical which can indicate organ failure and the approach of septic shock,' says  Dr Daniels. He adds: 'This is the most severe end of sepsis, when organs begin to fail and blood pressure falls. We welcome the report from the ombudsman because it highlights the human cost of the low awareness.' The good news is that researchers at Guy's Hospital in London recently discovered a group of biomarkers in the blood that signal the presence of sepsis, so a test may be available within as little as two years. As for Deborah, doctors located the main site of the sepsis on the right-hand side of her body, where a large amount of septic pus had collected. It's thought the infection had spread there, via the bloodstream, from the surgical incision. Three drains were inserted to remove the pus, and Deborah was given strong antibiotics and put on life support. 'I was induced into a coma for nearly a day while the fluid was draining so I could rest, mentally and physically, from the trauma, as I could not breathe properly for myself. When I came round I felt better,' she says. Now, three years on, she still has nerve damage in her back from where the pus had been removed via a tennis ball-sized drain hole. This damage means she sometimes suffers severe pain, as well as  frequent numbness from her shoulder to her knee. 'I'm not complaining though - I'd have died otherwise,' she says. 'I'm not blaming any doctors for the sepsis because post-operative infection is a risk with any surgery, but I strongly believe medics need to be better trained to spot it. 'I'm only here because the right doctor happened to walk past my bed at a critical moment, when my organs were starting to fail.' sepsistrust.org .","Deborah Dendle, 37, from Greenford, had an operation to remove scar tissue .

In scenes that wouldn’t look out of place in a school playground, rare footage has captured a female capuchin throwing stones, whining, and playing a form of kiss chase. Although this behaviour may seem aggressive, it is actually the female's attempt to grab the attention of a nearby male. Each of these attention-seeking moves form part of a larger seduction routine designed to tell the male that the female is ready for mating. Scroll down for video . Footage filmed in Brazil has captured a female capuchin trying, and failing, to get a male's attention. She starts by shaking the branch of a tree before throwing a stone at him, like the one pictured. Capuchins are renowned for using stones for digging and cracking nuts and researchers claim their throw is surprisingly accurate . Female capuchin monkeys do not display any physical indicators that could tell a male they are ready to mate. Instead, they perform a series of bizarre rituals to grab a male's attention and seduce him. Whining calls, pouting and branch shaking are designed to . attract males generally. Once a female selects a male, she will then additionally throw stones at him, and touch him before running away. Yet this behaviour is still preferable to how males attempt to seduce their mates. Male capuchins urinate on their hands and rub it over their body, like an aftershave. The recording was made during filming for a BBC and Discovery Channel documentary called Wild Brazil. A team of researchers managed to capture the bizarre mating ritual of the capuchins while filming in the dry, arid region of Caatinga in north eastern Brazil. They were helped by Professor Camila Galheigo Coelho from the University of Durham who has spent the last two years studying the social interactions of the monkeys. In the clip, the female capuchin is shown shaking a tree branch, while whining and pouting. When that doesn’t work, and the male continues to ignore her advances, she resorts to flirting with him by throwing a large stone.

As ubiquitous as Google and as inextricably part of the internet’s DNA, Amazon.com is a multibillion dollar company built on one man’s fear of regret. Twenty years ago, founder Jeff Bezos, then 30, cast his mind forward and asked himself what regrets he had in his life. He realized, he later recalled, ‘If I’d ignored the emergence of the Internet just as it was happening …I’d be a fool.’ This year Amazon.com celebrates its 20th anniversary just as Bezos celebrates his 50th. It is hard to believe that a man so driven would defer acting to get something he truly wanted. It's what makes his inaction on the matter of his biological father all the more pointed. Bullish, driven and determined: Bezos founded Amazon.com in a bid to live life without regrets . It is three months since Ted Jorgensen, 69, owner of a small biker repair shop in Arizona, was publicly revealed as Bezos's estranged father. But now, speaking to MailOnline, he has admitted that he has been forced to set aside the notion that Bezos would show some sign of welcoming the older man’s desire to reconnect with him. Speaking from his home in Glendale Mr Jorgensen said: ‘I don’t think he will come to me now. I haven’t heard a word for him or had any sign that he wants to connect with me. I hoped with the publicity it might happen but I can’t blame him. I guess I wasn’t a very good father.’ Mr Jorgensen was revealed as Bezos’s biological father last October. He only learned the identity of the son he last saw when he was barely one . year old when approached by a writer working on a biography of the . billionaire. Reporter Brad . Stone, author of 'The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and Amazon,' tracked Mr Jorgensen down to a small bike repair shop in Glendale . Arizona in 2012. He was stunned to discover that Mr Jorgensen had no idea . who Bezos was or his intimate connection to him. Then and now: Ted Jorgensen was a teenage . unicyclist (left) when his son Jeffrey was born, and he only learned . that the boy grew up to be Jeff Bezos last year (pictured right this . year, at age 69) Unlike his son who has mapped out his . life according to what he calls ‘a regret minimalization framework,’ Mr . Jorgensen revealed that he is riven with thoughts of what might have . been. Now in less than good . health, he said that an awareness of his own mortality has made him . feel the need to meet his son – his only biological child – more . keenly. He said: ‘I’m . anxious about it. I would like to connect with him. I’m not in great . health. I don’t plan on dying just yet but it does make me think, it . plays a part in wanting to see him. ‘I’m his biological father and I just want to shake his hand and tell him he’s done well and be recognised as his father. Father of choice not birth: Miguel Bezos with Jeff's mother Jackie. He adopted Jeff at the age of four and is the only father the billionaire has ever known . ‘I would want that no matter what he turned out to be.’ Bezos was recently listed number 15 in Forbes’s list of Most Powerful People, he ranks 12 in the Forbes 400 and his estimated worth is $27.5billion. But Mr Jorgensen insisted: ‘I just want to see him as my son, just to have him acknowledge that I’m his father and he’s my son. ‘Other than that I don’t want anything from him. I don’t want to push my way in or push the other dad out of the way. I’d just like to see him.’ Mr Jorgensen and Bezos’s mother Jackie were just teenagers when she fell pregnant in Alburquerque, New Mexico. Mr Jorgensen was 18 and a unicyclist  and rising star on the niche circuit. He and Jackie were married for two years before she left, taking their infant son with her. According to Mr Joregensen: ‘I had a number but Jeff’s mother asked me not to interfere so I didn’t want to call. ‘I used to wonder all the time though whatever happened to Jeff. Then I just reached a point where I thought he was long gone. That was the only child I ever had – that makes a difference too. The last time I saw him he was in diapers.’ When her son was four, Bezos’s mother married Miguel Bezos who adopted Jeff as his own. Mr Jorgensen is now married to wife, Lisa, and is stepfather to her four adult sons. All or nothing man: Bezos, pictured with wife Mackenzie, founded the 'everything store' but seems to want nothing to do with his biological father. At first the couple decided not to tell them about the identity of their half-brother. But early last year they changed their minds. Watching footage of their famous half-sibling the family were stunned to hear that Bezos shares the same distinctive, braying,  laugh as his biological father. Mr Jorgensen said: ‘We have the same laugh it’s true and it was very strange to hear that. I wonder what other things we share in common.’ He added; ‘I regret that I wasn’t a better father. I wonder how things might have been different.' And though the founder of the 'everything store' has given every impression of wanting nothing to do with the man to whom he owes his existence, Mr Jorgensen said he still held out hope. He said: 'But I do still hope to meet him even once. I haven't made my big plunge yet but I plan to. I will.' More than a year after learning who his son is and what he has become it is hard not to hear this vow as a hollow echo of the one made by MrJorgensen last October. And hard not to feel that unlike his son, Mr Jorgensen need not cast his mind very far forward to answer the question 'What regrets do I have in my life?'","Ted Jorgensen,69, was revealed as Jeff Bezos's biological father three months ago .

The keen eye of Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has spotted the Curiosity rover meandering towards a giant Martian mountain. Its tracks can be seen in two separate images taken by the spacecraft’s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on December 11 2013. The images show where the rover has zigzagged around obstacles on its route toward the lower slopes of Mount Sharp, its next major destination.

For scale, the two parallel lines of the wheel tracks are about 3 metres (10 feet) apart . HiRISE first imaged the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft while it was descending on a parachute to place Curiosity on Mars 17 months ago. Since then, it has provided updated views of the one-tonne rover's traverse, as seen from orbit. In the first image, the rover is near the lower-left corner of this view. For scale, the two parallel lines of the wheel tracks are about 10 feet (3m) apart. Two parallel tracks left by the wheels of the Curiosity Mars rover cross rugged ground.

A veteran police officer who was sacked last year after firing shots at a minivan filled with children said his 'heart sank' when he realized there were kids inside. Dramatic dash cam video revealed the moment that Elias Montoya, 53, fired three shots at the vehicle carrying a mother and her five children, aged six to 16, after a traffic stop spiraled out of control in Taos, New Mexico last October. Speaking out for the first time since the incident, Montoya, himself a father of three, told ABC News that tinted windows in the van kept him from seeing the children inside. 'My heart sank when they finally stopped and I was at the passenger side at that time seeing them get out at gunpoint again,' he said. 'I couldn't believe it that there were that many children in there.' Scroll down for video . Remorse: Elias Montoya was fired last month for shooting at a minivan filled with children after a traffic stop spun out of control. He has now spoken out to say he did not know there were children inside . He added: 'If I knew that there was even one child in that vehicle, I wouldn't have done it.' Montoya, who is appealing his department's decision to fire him, insisted that it was the first time he had fired his gun on duty during his 12 years on the force. The . motorist, 39-year-old Oriana Farrell, had been stopped by another State . Police officer for speeding. She had fled twice after the officer tried to . give her a ticket and then arrest her. When she was stopped for the second time, she refused to get out of the van and when she finally agreed, she jumped back inside as an officer attempted to restrain her. Her 14-year-old son could be seen on the video confronting the officer, leading to a scuffle, and he only stopped when the cop pulled out a Taser. Montoya then arrived as part of back up, and the woman and her children had locked themselves inside the vehicle. Montoya said he had only been told to respond to an 'unruly vehicle' and did not know children were inside.

Honour: The Queen has agreed to 'annul and cancel' the OBE of convicted choirmaster Michael Brewer . Choirmaster Michael Brewer has been stripped of his OBE after being jailed for sexually abusing a pupil. The 68-year-old was jailed for six years in March for indecently assaulting Frances Andrade more than three decades ago. She killed herself days after being subjected to a torrid cross-examination during his trial. Today it emerged the Queen has formally ‘cancelled and annulled’ his honour, granted for services to music. Judge Martin Rudland  branded Brewer . ‘a predatory sex offender’ who subjected Mrs Andrade to ‘depraved’ and . sometimes daily abuse when she was 14 and 15. Mrs Andrade described the ordeal of . giving evidence to the trial as 'like rape all over again' after . gruelling cross-examination. She died of a suspected overdose at . her home in Guildford, Surrey on January 24, six days after appearing in . court. She left behind her husband Levine and four children. Her son Oliver said in a statement at the time: 'Like all people she was not impervious. 'Being repeatedly called a liar and a . fantasist about a horrific part of her life in front of a court . challenged her personal integrity and was more than even she could . bear.' Brewer taught at the prestigious Chetham’s School of . Music in Manchester where he was director of music. He went on to work on the BBC series Last Choir Standing and helped found the . National Youth Choir. He was awarded the OBE in for services to music in the New Year's honours list on December 31 1994. Michael Brewer, 68, left, was convicted in February of indecently assaulting Frances Andrade, 48, when she was a student at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester. His ex-wife Kay, right, was also jailed . Brewer was convicted of five counts of indecent assault, an offence which can today carry up to ten years in jail. But judges must impose sentences according to the law when the offences took place. In 1980, the maximum sentence for indecent assault was two years’ imprisonment for each count. Violinist Frances Andrade took her own life after giving evidence against Brewer . Judge . Rudland said he could not take Mrs Andrade’s suicide into account, but . did impose consecutive sentences to reflect the overall term a defendant . would receive under current guidelines. Brewer will serve half his . sentence. His ex-wife Kay, also 68, was jailed for 21 months for one count of indecent assault. An announcement in the London Gazette today stated: ‘The Queen has directed that the appointment of Michael Curtis Brewer to be an Officer of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, dated December 31 1994, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order.’ Brewer's other victims included a 17-year-old student at Chetham's who he fondled in his office and admitted in court that he fell in love with at the age of 49, while another 17-year-old was pinned up against a wall during a school trip and sexually propositioned. He resigned from Chetham's in 1994 after an affair with a 17-year-old student was uncovered. The trial heard allegations that sexual activity between teachers and pupils at Chetham's was not uncommon. When it ended, a number of former pupils made allegations against other staff members in national newspapers. Ten key suspects have been identified in the wide-ranging inquiry called Operation Kiso which is also looking at the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM). Those suspects either taught at Chetham's, the RNCM or privately. Earlier this month, Greater Manchester Police said more than 30 women had made complaints that they suffered sexual abuse from classical music teachers. Some 39 individuals have been investigated so far in the operation, five of whom are dead.Renowned double bass teacher Duncan McTier, 58, was arrested at his home in London on May 10 over allegations of sex abuse against a 21-year-old woman in 1994. The alleged offence is said to have taken place while the victim was a pupil at the RNCM in Manchester. Mr McTier, who has been bailed pending further inquiries, was a part-time teacher in his specialist field at the Manchester college between 1984 and 1996. He is currently a professor of double bass at London's Royal Academy of Music and holds similar positions at the Zurich University of the Arts and the Queen Sofia College of Music in Madrid. Violin teacher Wen Zhou Li, 57, a professor at the RNCM and a former teacher at Chetham's, was held in February on suspicion of rape and is on bail pending further inquiries. Channel 4 News this month reported that sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour took place at five of the UK's specialist music schools over a 40-year period. Former fire chief Frank Sheehan (left), who was cautioned for indecent images of children, has been stripped of a CBE and Fire Service Medal while ex-grammar school teacher David Bradley has lost his MBE after streaking in front of pupils on a camping trip . It named Chetham's and also the Yehudi Menuhin School in Surrey. Surrey Police confirmed they have . been contacted by the Yehudi Menuhin School following 'allegations of . historic sexual abuse against a member of staff who is now deceased'. Under official rules honours can be taken away from people who have 'done something to damage the honours system's reputation'. Reasons . to revoke an honour include being jailed for at least three months or . being struck off by a professional body relevant to their honour. Last year former RBS boss Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood for his role in the banking crisis. The Honours Forfeiture Committee considers each case confidentially before making a recommendation. The Prime Minister then sends the decision to the Queen who decides if the honour should be forfeited. It . was also announced today that former grammar school teacher David . Bradley is to lose his MBE from 2007 after streaking in front of pupils. He . was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct in January, after . running naked across a garden during a camping trip with a group of 12- . and 13-year-olds. Meanwhile Francis Sheehan is to be stripped of his CBE from 2008 and Fire Service Medal awarded in 2003. The former West Midlands fire chief made indecent images of children. In 2009 he accepted a formal caution and was placed on the sex offenders' register for two years after the Crown Prosecution Service deemed it was 'not in the public interest' to charge him.","Michael Brewer was jailed for six years in March for indecently assaulting Frances Andrade more than three decades ago .

A Minnesota woman whose body was found just steps from her front doorstep died of hypothermia complicated by acute alcohol intoxication, the state medical examiner has concluded. Andrea Christine Marker, 32, was found around 4pm on January 7 by her sister close to the front door of the home she shared with her parents and one of her sisters on Illinois Court, Lakeville. Her body had been obscured by snowbanks and the police chief said she could have been outside for as long as 20 hours. Close to home: Andrea Marker had almost reached her front door but died in the snow of hypothermia complicated by alcohol toxicity . The last time a family member had spoken to Marker was 8pm the evening before. Interim Lakeville Police Chief John Kornmann told the Star Tribune that Marker had removed most of her clothing when she was found, indicating she had experienced something known as paradoxical undressing, common in victims of hypothermia. The phenomenon makes a person feel warm even as they are freezing to death. The family of Andrea Marker said last week that she had waged a long battle with alcohol. Addiction: Marker, a mother, aunt, sister and daughter, had long struggled with alcohol, according to her family .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 09:04 EST, 17 February 2012 . Tragic: Anthony Shadid, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Iraq, died today in eastern Syria . A New York Times reporter has died from an asthma attack as he attempted to leave Syria on horseback. Pulitzer-Prize winner Anthony Shadid had been in eastern Syria reporting on the uprising against President Bashar Assad when he suffered the attack as he left the country. Times photographer Tyler Hicks was with him at the time and said he had suffered another attack a week ago as they entered the country, again on horseback. Mr Hicks carried his colleague's body over the border into Turkey. Both men were in the country without the permission of the Syrian government. He told the New York Times: 'I stood next to him and asked if he was ok, and then he collapsed.' He added that Mr Shadid was unconscious and his breathing was shallow and a few minutes later he stopped breathing. He was apparently allergic to horses. Mr Shadid had been reporting in Syria for a week, gathering information on the resistance to the Syrian government. New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson sent a note to the newsroom this evening, relaying the news of Shadid's death and remembering him. She wrote: 'Anthony died as he lived - determined to bear witness to the transformation sweeping the Middle East and to testify to the suffering of people caught between government oppression and opposition forces'. Mr Shadid, long known for covering wars and other conflicts in the Middle East, was among four reporters detained by Libyan forces loyal to Moammar Gaddafi last March. The Libyan government released Mr Shadid, Mr Hicks, Stephen Farrell and Lynsey Addario after several days in captivity. Speaking to an audience in Oklahoma City about a month after his release, he said he had a conversation with his father the night before he was detained. Honours: Mr Shadid won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 2004 and 2010 for his Iraq coverage . 'Maybe a little bit arrogantly, perhaps with a little bit of conceit, I said, ""It's OK, Dad. I know what I'm doing. I've been in this situation before,"" Shadid told the crowd of several dozen people. 'I guess on some level I felt that if I wasn't there to tell the story, the story wouldn't be told.' More...

Shadid's father, Buddy Shadid, who lives in Oklahoma City, said a colleague tried to revive his son but couldn't. 'They were in an isolated place. There was no doctor around,' Buddy Shadid said. 'It took a couple of hours to get him to a hospital in Turkey.' Freed: Mr Shadid, right, is pictured with Turkey's Ambassador to Libya Levent Sahinkaya, centre and his New York Times colleagues Stephen Farrell, left, Tyler Hicks, second from left) and Lynsey Addario shortly after their release by the Libyan government . He said Anthony Shadid had asthma all his life and had medication with him. '[But] he was walking to the border because it was too dangerous to ride in the car,' the father said. 'He was walking behind some horses - he's more allergic to those than anything else - and he had an asthma attack.' The 43-year-old American of Lebanese descent won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 2004 and 2010 for his coverage in Iraq. He was married to fellow Times reporter Nada Bakri, with whom he had a son. Mr Shadid had previously worked for Associated Press, the Boston Globe and the Washington Post.","Reporter, 43, died as he attempted to cross border with Turkey on horse .

Police say that a 17-year-old male suspect has turned himself in today after shooting two high school students in Philadelphia yesterday. The teen is charged with two counts of aggravated assault and other related offenses. Police obtained a warrant for his home at the 7400 block of Rugby Street where he was questioned and eventually tuned himself over to law enforcement at around 1 p.m. Two other teenage suspects were questioned but neither of them were charged. Police say the shooting may have been an accident, reports CBS. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scene: The shooting took place inside the gym at Delaware Valley Charter High School in northern Philadelphia and the two victims were teenage students but are both said to be in stable condition . Police obtained a warrant for the suspect who turned himself in at the 7400 block of Rugby street . The first suspect police questioned was a 15-year-old male that matched a description provided by school security. The authorities took him into custody immediately following the shooting but later realized that he was not involved. His angered parents said he was a 'straight A student' and police believe that school security misinformed them about the boy, reports NBC. The other suspect, A 16-year-old male, was questioned at Philadelphia Police's Northwest Detective Division and is thought to have been a co-conspirator in the shooting. He was not charged at this time. The Shooting took place Friday at around 3.20pm in the gym of Delaware Valley Charter High School in Philadelphia. 'There is a video and according to the video there were roughly 7 kids in there- it wasn't a gym class some where shooting hoops,' police commissioner Charles Ramsey said to CBS Philadelphia. For the first hour after the shooting, police were searching for the suspect as he was able to flee the scene but they used the video tape to try and identify the suspect. Authorities say a male student, 17, and a female student, 19, were shot in the arm. The students were taken to Albert Einstein Medical Center in stable condition. The girl was released but the boy is still in the hospital. Arrested: Police commissioner Charles Ramsey reported that a 15 year old male suspect was arrested at his house about an hour after shooting but that he was not involved in any way . Caught: The suspect, who has so far only been identified as a male, was caught by police as he was either entering or leaving his home on this block in Philadelphia about an hour after the shooting . Police Inspector Joe Sullivan tells KYW-TV it's unclear whether the shots were fired from inside or outside the school. A spokesman for the school district hasn't responded to a call seeking comment. Yesterday's  incident in the Logan neighborhood in Philadelphia is the second school shooting of the new year as two students were injured by a fellow student in New Mexico. A shotgun was used in the Tuesday shooting Roswell shooting but the make of weapon from yesterday has not been released.

A married mother wants to teach a lesson to the couple who sent an explicit porn video and racy pictures to her using her own stolen phone. Victoria Brodsky, 39, who works in social services, told MailOnline today that she initially felt sorry for the couple who appear to have unwittingly sent the steamy material via the phone to her file-saving service Dropbox - but now feels they need to learn that stealing has consequences. Mrs Brodsky was at a street fair last August 25 with two friends when her Samsung Galaxy S3 was pick-pocketed in Brighton Beach, New York. Do you know these people? Contact MailOnline below . A Brooklyn mother wants the couple who posted dozens of naked selfies on her stolen phone that 'stealing is wrong' The couple posted dozens of images in various states of undress and a homemade sex tape which is took explicit to reveal . Mrs Brodsky told MailOnline from Brooklyn on Thursday: 'I was moving through the crowd and then when I went to call my husband, the phone and my wallet were gone.' The mother, who has a daughter, four, and 18-month-old son, immediately contacted police to report the crime and canceled her credit cards. However because Mrs Brodsky had not seen anyone actually stick their hand in her bag to take the belongings, police listed the phone as 'lost' and not stolen. A few days later, Mrs Brodsky began to receive images of a couple she did not recognize in Dropbox - a free service that lets users save pictures automatically from a phone which is synced to their computer. The 39-year-old said that she did not recognize the couple who came to have possession of her phone. Mrs Brodsky said: 'I evaluated the pictures but I didn't recognize the couple. At first, it's not bad. It's him posting pictures of her smiling and some of him, posing for the camera. 'I felt sorry for them. They looked poor, they were living in a place with a mattress on the floor and I thought ''okay, I get why you stole it.''' Victoria Brodsky had a homemade sex tape and graphic photos sent to her home computer by an unknown couple after her phone was stolen . A few days later, Mrs Brodsky was sickened to find that the couple had posted sexually charged, naked photos of themselves to her Dropbox account along with a homemade sex tape which is too graphic to be published. It appears that the couple were unaware that the photos were being sent to Mrs Brodsky's home computer and her iPad. She said: 'When they posted the pictures and video of them naked and having sex, I thought, ''you know, they are enjoying the whole process and don't feel bad about it at all.''' Mrs Brodsky said that the Samsung does have an alert when an image is sent to Dropbox but that if you don't known how to use the phone fully, you might be unaware it was happening. Write caption here . The unknown couple's pictures start off innocently enough when they were sent to a Brooklyn mom's computer . The photos and video appeared in the space of a couple of days before Mrs Brodsky got a new phone and transferred her number, causing the stolen phone to be blocked. The mother-of-two had to pay $150 dollars for a new phone and an additional $40 for the protective case. Mrs Brodsky contacted police to see if they could track down the alleged phone thieves. However officers said they could not pursue the couple as they did not have proof they stole the phone - and had no way of tracking them. Social worker Mrs Brodsky, pictured with her husband, said that she wanted to send the message that there was consequences to stealing . Mrs Brodsky said: 'At first I left it alone but then I thought I would love it if they learned a lesson not to steal and be publicly scrutinized for what they did. She added: 'If you are poor, figure out what to do about it but this is not the answer.' Do you know the couple in the photographs?

A half-hour demonstration outside Madison Square Garden Tuesday took a different focus on Mitt Romney and his oft-told story of traveling with his Irish setter, Seamus, strapped to the roof of his car. Mr Romney has said he put the dog inside a crate and strapped it to the roof rack in 1983 for a 12-hour drive from Boston to Canada.

Sturz Jr studied them intently, checking their body type and making . them run around several times before making his final choice. On this afternoon, Ace was in the right place. Best dog of his breed. 'Today was our day,' Ness said. 'Eye of the tiger, baby!' Ace, however, was topped by the Irish setter in the sporting round. Eira . made a real early exit. She won the prestigious National dog show that . was televised on Thanksgiving Day and was the top terrier last year. That meant a lot - terriers often rule Westminster, with wire foxes . winning the silver bowl more than any other kind. It was, however, a really big day for a Tibetan mastiff, and even more so for his owners. Major . won his breed, a nice start for Debbie Parsons and Brad Slayton.

Profile peaks: With celebrities a common sight to see, Glenn Close, Kristin Davis and Mary Tyler Moore have made appearances . Expanding: In a few years, there could be up to 240 breeds at Westminster with the expanding pedigrees possibly accompanying Old English Sheepdogs like this one . The xoloitzcuintli, formerly known as the Mexican hairless, is among six new breeds at this year's show. They're called a 'show low' for short and Giorgio Armani drew cheers from the fans crowded around the ring when he was picked as the best of his breed. In a few years, there could be up to 240 breeds at Westminster. To get to Westminster, a breed must meet American Kennel Club criteria â€” there has to be an ample population with a three-generation pedigree, a geographic spread of those dogs and a parent club to establish breed standards.","Four-year-old pooch was top toy in show's most competitive group .

"By . David Mccormack . PUBLISHED: . 19:52 EST, 19 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:34 EST, 20 January 2014 . Eating white dirt is an ancient southern tradition that continues to be carried out to this day, mainly by women who crave the chalky white substance. The extraordinary phenomenon, known as geophagy, is the subject of a new documentary film, Eat White Dirt, which explores the curious culture of earth-eating that continues to thrive in parts of the South. The particular rock in question is called kaolin and can be found along the Atlantic Coast Fall Line that runs through southern states including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Scroll down for video . Tammy Wright consumes around a pound of kaolin every day and claims it has helped her lose over 60lbs since she began eating it . Though the practice is rarely if ever recommended by medical professionals, some nutritionists admit the habit of eating clay may help absorb toxins . It is used medically to treat . diarrhea, dysentary, cholera, and is also used in paper making, paint, . fiberglass, porcelains and ceramics, china, and toothpaste. Though the practice is rarely if ever recommended by medical professionals, some nutritionists admit the habit of eating clay may have some real health benefits. ‘It is possible that the binding effect of clay would cause it to absorb toxins,’ Dr. David Katz, a nutrition expert at the Yale School of Medicine, told ABC News in 2005. Director Adam Forrester said he became intrigued by the tradition after he started to notice ‘mysterious little bags of white, chalky rocks’ for sale in many of the locally-owned convenience stores where he lived in Columbus, Georgia. Director Adam Forrester decided to explore the topic of white dirt after he found plastic bags of the stuff for  sale in convenience stores in Columbus, Georgia . ‘These Zip-loc bags, labeled “White Dirt” were most often for sale right at the front of the store, next to the register,’ he told Feature Shoot. ‘I’d never seen anything like that before. I would ask the clerks, “What is this white clay for?” They would reply, “Oh I don’t know, people eat it.”’ In Eat White Dirt, due to be released in the summer, Forrester examines the prehistoric origins of eating dirt, its medical mythology and the abiding relationship that people in the South continue to have with the peculiar mineral. Geophagy has been practiced by many different cultures from the ancient Greeks to Native Americans for centuries. In most places the habit is limited to women, especially women who are pregnant or of childbearing age. Tierra Griffin confessed that she stops by her local convenient store in Greensboro, Georgia, two to three times per week to purchase a bag or two . Kaolin is used medically to treat diarrhea, dysentary, cholera, and is also used in paper making, paint, fiberglass, porcelains and ceramics, china, and toothpaste . The practice is common in sub-Saharan Africa, and many anthropologists believe it was brought to the United States by African slaves. It is now most commonly found among African-American women in the rural South. Forrester interviewed several women who admitted to craving the taste of white dirt, which is typically described as ‘fresh, natural-feeling, like the rain or something’. 'I eat white dirt every day,' said Tammy Wright, who admitted to consuming about a pound of kaolin every day and claims it has helped her lose over 60lbs. ' I just had a craving for white dirt and I just started eating it and eating it and I've never stopped,' said Tierra Griffin, another kaolin lover. She confessed that she stops by her local convenient store in Greensboro, Georgia, two to three times per week to purchase a bag or two. The particular rock in question is called kaolin and can be found along the Atlantic Coast Fall Line that runs through southern states including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama . According to Forrester, one of the greatest misconception about those who eat white dirt are extremely poor. ‘Most often this practice is erroneously associated with poverty. Dirt itself is considered the lowest of the low. 'We literally walk all over it daily. Many people assume that anyone that would be willing to put dirt - in all of its dirtiness - in their mouth must be incredibly hungry, and have no other option. 'This just simply isn’t true. I’ve met so many wonderful people who are practitioners of geophagy, or earth-eating, and most of them are living comfortable middle class lives. I’ve even met several Doctors of Philosophy that choose to eat white dirt as well,' he said. Some of other names that white dirt is known as are clay dirt, white clay, porcelain clay, china clay, chalk, or the scientific name of aluminum silicate hydroxide.","Eating white dirt is an ancient southern .

Although the young supporter managed to watch the first 45 minutes of the match he was taken to a first aid centre at half time after his arm ballooned in size. He was later taken to hospital where he had a plaster cast put on his injured wrist. Injured: Schoolboy Jamie in a plaster cast he had fitted after Wayne Rooney broke his right wrist during his first Man Utd match . Jamie said today: 'It all happened so fast, one minute I was watching Wayne take shots at goal and the next the ball was flying towards me. 'It was coming really fast and I just put my hands up. 'I felt like a rocket had hit my arm but I was buzzing because Wayne had kicked it. 'I thought my arm and wrist was okay but it was getting more painful.' Despite begging his dad to let him watch the whole game he was whisked away to be treated by first aiders at the ground. Jamie added: 'I missed most of the second half but it was worth it. I think it's brilliant that Wayne Rooney broke my wrist. 'Everyone at school wanted to sign my plaster cast.' The Manchester United fan, from Wem, Shropshire, was sitting in the front row for the game against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux last Sunday with his father Andy, 31. Although England forward Wayne Rooney, 26, did not realise he had injured Jamie, he has since used his Twitter page to say sorry to the schoolboy and promised to send him a personalised gift. He said in a tweet: 'I want to apologise to Jamie Thomas. I have arranged for a letter and a signed shirt to be sent to his home address.' Premier League champions Manchester United won the game 5-0. Jamie's father Andy, who works at a slaughterhouse, said his son was unable to avoid Wayne Rooney's mis-hit shot. 'It was his first Man Utd game and we were in the Wolves end because somebody got us tickets,' he said. 'We were sat on the first row right at the front. We were with my nephew, Jamie's uncle, his sister and her brother. 'The players were warming up and Rooney and (Javier) Hernandez were taking a few shots. Rooney missed one and it was coming straight towards Jamie so he put out his hands to stop it hitting him and it broke his wrist. 'He did well to put his arms up because it would have taken his head off otherwise - it was a hell of a shot. 'At first we thought it was just bruising but Jamie wasn't enjoying the game and it ballooned in size so we went to first aid at half time. We ended up missing most of the second half.' Andy took his son back to Shrewsbury where he had an X-ray which confirmed the wrist had been broken. He added: 'They . said it was a clean break and he has to go back in a couple of weeks. 'He went back to school on Wednesday and he was loving it, everyone . wanted to sign his cast. 'He's . been telling everyone Wayne Rooney broke his wrist. 'He can't write . with his hand and we are having to help him get changed but he doesn't . care. 'It shook him up a bit but he's fine about it now and I don't think it's put him off going to other games.' Hurtling: The ball edges closer to Jamie but he is unable to get out of the way in time . Warm-up: Rooney, centre, is seen stretching before he accidentally broke Jamie Thomas' wrist . Big break: Wayne Rooney in action against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux last weekend. The player had no idea he had broken a fan's wrist . A spokeswoman for the club said: 'Wayne did not have any idea this had happened. He has now signed a shirt for Jamie and will be writing to him to apologise.' The lucky supporter has also been promised the chance to meet the Wolves players after being injured at the match. A club spokesman said: 'We were very sorry to hear about Jamie's injury and the fact it meant he had to miss some of the game - hopefully he can make a speedy recovery and be back watching football soon. 'We have been in touch with the lady who contacted us about the incident and have offered Jamie the chance to come down and meet the players at our training ground.'

Knock-off movies are enjoying a resurgence thanks to the rise of online film distribution sites which make it easier to 'confuse' customers into buying the wrong flick. Production companies say distribution systems such as Netflix and Redbox provide a 'great opportunity' to sell their imitations, which are made at a fraction of the price. But consumers have taken issue with the . tactics because it is harder to distinguish between the two when glancing online as opposed to browsing in the rental store. Confusing: The DreamWorks blockbuster Puss In Boots (left) cost $130million, whereas its 'mockbuster' Puss In Boots: A Furry Tail had a budget of just $1million. The imitation was released around the same time on DVD . Slick: The DreamWorks version of Puss In Boots was made using the very latest an animation over four years . Mocked up: Behind the similar DVD cover design of Puss In Boots: A Furry Tail lies a rather less sophisticated animation . The knock-offs - known as . 'mockbusters' - are what the film industry calls a 'drafting . opportunity' which looks to piggyback off a box office smash by using . similarly titled versions. They . invariably come out on DVD at around the same time as their . budget-busting equivalent in a bid to cash in on the $18.8billion-a-year . home entertainment business. One example was last year's Puss in . Boots: A Furry Tail, which was made by 12 people in an office building . by Renegade Animation for less than $1million. By comparison, the DreamWorks version . Puss in Boots, starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek, was made by . 300 people for fours years at cost of $130million. Too similar: Production company The Asylum . changed the name of its Battle: Los Angeles mockbuster, Battle of Los . Angeles, to Attack Los Angeles because it was confusing buyers . Big budget: A scene from 2011's alien-invasion film Battle: Los Angeles . Cashing in: Battle of Los Angeles looked to exploit its blockbuster by creating a similar look to original . Its other knock-off The True Story Of Puss 'N Boots was given more than 1,300 negative reviews on Redbox. One customer said: 'I made the mistake of renting this thinking it was the Antonio Banderas version. BIG mistake.' Other mockbusters include Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies . (imitating Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), Kiara the Brave (based on . Pixar's Brave) and Life's a Jungle: Africa's Most Wanted (exploiting . Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted). David Rimawi, a partner at The Asylum, which has built much of its business on mockbusters, admitted to the Los Angeles Times that they are having to change the designs of their products to avoid such confusion. As a result, 2011's Battle Of Los Angeles became Attack Los Angeles. 'Preying on confusion': Disney's animation Brave (left) has an imitation in the form of the cut-price Kiara The Brave (right). The rise of sites like Netflix appear to be making it easier for consumers to pick the wrong film . Feeding off the box office hit: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and its knock-off Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies . Piggybacking: The big budget DreamWorks production Madagascar 3 (left) and its mockbuster (right) Drafting opportunities have been given quite a free reign legally since 1993 when Disney lost a lawsuit against Good Times Entertainment, now owned by Gaiam, over their versions of Aladdin. A U.S. district court judge ruled that the VHS boxes were not similar enough to violate the law. More recently, Universal Pictures sued The Asylum over claims the latter's American Battleship knock-off was too similar to the former's Battleship. The companies settled out of court, with The Asylum agreeing to change its name to American Warships. 'As people have migrated to these new platforms, it has been a great opportunity for us,"" said Sam Toles, vice president of content and acquisitions for Gaiam Entertainment. 'We're not trying to confuse people. We're trying to take advantage of a level of interest in a concept that exists thanks to the major studio release', he told the Los Angeles Times.","Imitations enjoying a resurgence as they look to cash in on $18bn industry .

David Cameron faced claims of a ¿Chequers cover-up¿ last night after the Government failed to publish a full list of visitors to his grace-and-favour country residence . David Cameron came under fresh pressure today to name every supporter, friend and lobbyist who has been wined and dined at his grace-and-favour mansion. Downing Street has refused to release a full list of guests at the Prime Minister's Chequers retreat. It claims there is no commitment to transparency where the bill for meals, drinks and hospitality was picked up by the Tory party. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'There are distinctions that are drawn with government business and party political business. I don;t think there is anything new in that.' But he refused to say how many people had secretly visited Chequers or how much the Conservative party paid for entertaining supporters at the taxpayer-funded property. The spokesman added: 'The approach is the one that has been taken forward for a very considerable time going back to before 2010.' He insisted that despite the refusal to release the full Chequers guest list, the government is 'more government information than ever before'. Mr Cameron faced claims of a ‘Chequers cover-up’ last night after the Government failed to publish a full list of visitors to his grace-and-favour country residence. Downing Street was accused of exploiting a loophole which means visitors to Chequers funded by the Conservative Party, or the Prime Minister personally, are kept secret. The latest annual Chequers guest list was finally published more than a year late on Friday evening, with no warning. It reveals that Mr Cameron entertained the Emir of Qatar and the provost of Eton, his old school, but is largely dominated by an uncontroversial string of Conservative and Liberal Democrat ministers. The last Chequers guest list included News International’s Rebekah Brooks, now on trial over phone hacking and other alleged offences, and Tory donor and treasurer Stanley Fink. In 2012, Mr Cameron was forced to admit seeing at least 15 Tory donors, who have handed the party £23million, in a series of secret lunches and dinners at Downing Street and Chequers. Michael Spencer, then Tory party treasurer and one of those who enjoyed hospitality, said in late 2009 that he expected a Tory government to axe the 50p rate, which it did on taking office. A list of guests to Chevening, Nick Clegg’s official residence, was also published on Friday evening. It contains politicians, journalists and TV personalities, including Joanna Lumley and Clare Balding. Critics said it appeared the Conservative Party was seeking to avoid scrutiny of sensitive friends and supporters’ visits to Chequers, near Ellesborough in Buckinghamshire, by paying for their hospitality. No details of how much was paid, or how charges were calculated, were available. Michael Dugher, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, has written to Mr Cameron demanding full publication. ‘There are some glaring omissions from the list,’ he wrote. ‘Chequers is a public building and being able to access it is  a privilege. The fact that the Conservative Party may have nominally paid to host various people at Chequers cannot be used as a device to block transparency in relation to lobbyists and others gaining access.’ Mr Dugher said it appeared that there was an ‘attempt to buy out of transparency, which leaves the perception of a Chequers cover-up’. He added: ‘Regrettably – given you once said “sunlight is the best disinfectant” – your previous commitments to openness have not been met. ‘It is now vital that a full and complete list of all visitors to Chequers and Downing Street, whether paid for by the Prime Minister or by the Conservative Party, is published.’ A general view of Chequers, the Prime Minister's official country residence, in Buckinghamshire . John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said releasing the list quietly on a Friday night ‘smacks of burying bad news’. He said: ‘You would only do this if you’ve got something that you would be embarrassed about.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘This return includes guests who have received official hospitality at Chequers, excluding officials and special advisers. ‘Consistent with the practice  of previous administrations, it does not include those receiving  hospitality paid for personally by the Prime Minister or by the Conservative Party.’ The Tories accused Labour of ‘hypocrisy’ because Ed Miliband promised to give regular updates on meetings with trade unionists and donors, yet this has not happened since March 2012. A Conservative spokesman said the party had published a list of the Prime Minister’s meetings with donors – including at Chequers – quarterly since 2012. A Tory source said: ‘We’ve published expenses over £500 online and details of ministerial meetings. This is Grade A hypocrisy.’","Latest annual Chequers guest list was published more than a year late on Friday with no warning .

Ed Miliband insisted shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will not be sacked before the election – but failed to guarantee him in his job after 2015. Amid reports that Labour MPs are increasingly unhappy with the performance of the abrasive Mr Balls, the Labour leader dismissed speculation that he could be replaced by former Chancellor Alistair Darling or shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves. ‘Ed Balls is doing a really good job and, absolutely, I’ve said that he’s going to be the shadow chancellor going with me into the election,’ Mr Miliband told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. Insists: Mr Miliband told Andrew Marr the shadow chancellor will keep his job until at least 2015 . However, observers asked why the Labour leader had not gone further, and pledged that Mr Balls would serve as Chancellor in a Labour government. Some speculated that Mr Miliband might want to keep the option open of putting someone else in charge of the Treasury - possibly Business Secretary Vince Cable in the event of a Lib-Lab coalition. The Labour leader added: ‘People have their critics. 'The thing I’d say to you about Ed Balls: he’s got a clear sense of what this economy needs, he’s working with me on tackling the cost-of-living crisis that we face and he’s got the toughness to stand up to lots of people who want more spending when actually it’s going to be tough for Labour.’ Yesterday, an Opinium poll for the . Observer found that just 18 per cent believe Mr Miliband and the shadow . Chancellor would be the best custodians of the economy. Concerns: Labour MPs are said to be increasingly unhappy with Ed Balls' abrasive performance . An anonymous Labour MP was reported as complaining that Mr Balls had ‘lost his mojo’. ‘Balls used to throw his weight around in shadow cabinet meetings and ignore Ed Miliband when he spoke,’ the MP said. ‘Now . Balls is totally out of sorts. He doesn’t say much at shadow cabinet . meetings and when he does, he is the one who is ignored. He has lost his . mojo.’ Last week, Mr Balls dismissed speculation over his future in the shadow cabinet as ‘tittle tattle’ and insisted he has a ‘very good relationship’ with Ed Miliband. The shadow chancellor, whose response to the Autumn Statement last month was widely criticised, was not mentioned in a major speech by the Labour leader, prompting further questions about the security of his position. Candidates? Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves and former Chancellor Alistair Darling . ‘If you are a grown up in politics then you don’t take that kind of tittle tattle seriously at all,’ Mr Balls said. ‘I’m the person who is going to make sure we have sound public finances but also have fairness in our labour market, fairness in our tax system, preserve our National Health Service and have competition in banking in our economy to tackle the cost of living crisis and every day I’m going to work hard to do my job for the benefit, not of the Labour party, but for the British people.’ Conservative party vice chairman Bob Neill said: ‘It’s clear Miliband hates Balls but he’s too weak to move him. ‘Every time he praises him he does so through gritted teeth. Every single call Balls has made on the economy has turned out to be wrong. The only thing he and the Labour Party stand for ate more borrowing, more spending and higher taxes.’","Denied Rachel Reeves or Alistair Darling will get the job before 2015 .

Labour's work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves is set to announce plans to remove benefits from unemployed people who refuse training to get them back into work . Jobseekers who fail basic English and maths tests would lose their benefits if they refused training under Labour plans unveiled today. Rachel Reeves will say all new applicants for jobseeker’s allowance should undergo a ‘basic skills test’ within six weeks of signing on. ‘Those who don’t have the skills they need for a job will have to take up training alongside their job search or lose their benefits,’ she will say in her first major speech as Labour’s work and pensions spokesman. The policy is intended to indicate that after months of being branded the ‘Welfare Party’ by the Tories for refusing to back any of the Government’s benefits cuts, Labour is ready to countenance reform. But critics pointed out the Government has already announced plans to pilot skills checks and training for the young unemployed, from day one of their claim. Extending the policy across the system would not save money, but cost more, since training programmes for the jobless are expensive. Miss Reeves, speaking to the Institute for Public Policy Research in London, will claim the Government’s failures are adding to the vast welfare bill. She will say increased levels of youth and long-term unemployment will add to costs and hit tax revenues for ‘decades to come’. She will also claim that record numbers of people are stuck in low-paid jobs, or working shorter hours than they want, resulting in rising expenditure on in-work tax credits and housing benefit. ‘Only Labour, the party of work, can deliver the reforms needed to tackle the causes of rising benefit bills, so we can keep the costs of social security under control, while recognising responsibility and contribution,’ Miss Reeves, who is increasingly tipped as the next Labour leader, will say. Poor English and maths, she will add, often hold people back from getting jobs or trap them in a cycle of low-paid, insecure work and benefits claims. Tests: Unemployed people claiming jobseeker's allowance would have to take English and maths tests within six weeks of signing on . ‘A Labour government will introduce a basic skills test to assess all new claimants for jobseeker’s allowance within six weeks of claiming benefits,’ she will add. ‘Those who don’t have the skills they need for a job will have to take up training  alongside their job search or lose their benefits. ‘Labour’s basic skills test will give the long-term unemployed a better chance of finding a job and will help us to earn our way out of the cost-of-living crisis.’ Nearly one in ten out-of-work-benefit claimants lacks basic literacy skills, and one in ten lacks basic numeracy. The lack of IT skills is even more of a problem, with more than half unable to complete basic word processing and spreadsheet tasks. A Tory spokesman said: ‘Labour are copying a Conservative policy that already exists and that is superior.’ In the autumn statement, George Osborne announced a pilot project to retrain young JSA claimants without Level 2 English and maths from day one of their claim.","Unemployed would have to take skills test within six weeks of signing on .

From Bar to kitchen: Judith King has given up her job as a barrister to run a B&B, saying it pays better . A barrister who said she could no longer make ends meet thanks to legal aid cuts has quit her career - to open a B&B. Judith King, 54, spent 10 years defending clients in Kent but said she was forced to rent a 'tiny house', drive a 'tiny, economical car' and rely on savings to pay basic household bills. The mother-of-two claims her new business, in Grade II listed Greco-revival style townhouse 280 miles away in the Yorkshire Dales is better-paid and she is happier than she has been for years. She said: 'The Government would like people to believe that all lawyers are fat cats - earning six figure sums. 'The truth is that many earn much less than that - some, like me, struggled to make ends meet. 'For me, defending and prosecuting the sort of cases I did and not to be able to afford a very modest lifestyle is ridiculous. 'At that time, I was renting a tiny house and running a tiny economical car yet I just couldn't earn enough to pay the basic household bills and I was subsidising everything with my savings.' The former nurse used her medical expertise to prosecute complex cases including one of child rape and another involving the torture of two children. After her first child was born, she completed a Masters degree and was called to the Bar in 2002 - but said she and her colleagues were hammered by successive cuts to legal aid. Barristers walked out of courts across the country earlier this month in the first ever criminal bar protest over justice secretary Chris Grayling's plans to make Â£220 million in cuts by 2019.

Gown off, sleeves rolled up: Ms King trying her hand at DIY, left, and right with her partner Martin Perkins . So Ms King moved to Settle, North Yorkshire, with her partner Martin Perkins, who quit his medical sales job so he could help her convert their new home. 'I was used to opening a case in the crown court but this opening has made me very nervous,' she said. She added: 'Although it is strange no longer being in court, in reality I am now happier than I have been for many years. 'I have no regrets. And when I saw my former colleagues stood in protest outside the Crown Court it just reassured me that I had made the right choice. 'The level of financial and personal sacrifice it takes to get to the Bar is considerable. 'Over the last few years the demands have become higher and higher and the money lower and lower. Protest: Barristers walked out of the Old Bailey earlier this month to protest against planned cuts to legal aid . Lawyers say the cuts could lead to miscarriages of justice. Conservatives say the budget is too bloated . 'I was faced with the prospect of having to go up to London every day to get work there and I just couldn't face that. I loved Kent. 'Then I realised if the work was no longer enjoyable and you are not earning enough - then what was the point? However, the barrister has not yet ditched her gown and wig, she said - adding: 'You never know'.","Judith King spent 10 years defending clients in Canterbury, Kent .

But campaigners claim there is a gulf between Conservative MEPs, who support their boost to business, and those in Westminster who fear they will cause more road deaths. Monsters: 83ft 'Megatrucks' like this one could soon be allowed on Britain's roads under plans to widen their use . Philippa Edmunds, of the Campaign for Better Transport, told the Telegraph: 'Conservative MEPs plan to support the increased use of massive trucks across the EU. 'This is despite the Westminster government opposing their use on UK roads because they cause more fatal accidents, more congestion and more pollution. 'We risk letting mega trucks on to our roads via the back door.' The vehicles, known officially as Longer and Heavier Vehicles or LHVs, can be as much as 22ft longer than the largest HGVs currently allowed in Britain. They transport billions of tonnes each year in Sweden, where they carry 90 per cent of all road freight. The huge trucks also carry almost three-quarters of the road freight in Finland. Trucks: More than a billion tonnes of freight a year are moved around Britain using traditional HGVs, pictured . Yet they have been slow to spread to other EU countries because of concerns about their safety. They are being trialled in Denmark, the Netherlands and most recently in Germany, where they are only allowed to use motorways and major national roads. The trucks were barred from crossing international borders until a ban was partially lifted by the European Commission in March 2012. The report, to be considered today by the transport committee of the European Parliament, said: 'There is widespread agreement that LHVs would reduce operating costs for road freight and greenhouse gas emissions per tonne-km of goods transported as less vehicles would be used to transport the same amount of goods.' However, pollution could actually increase if the ultra-long trucks shift more freight away from the railways, the report admitted. Danger: Shorter HGVs have been involved in several collisions with cyclists in the past, including this one in Camden, north London, in October. There are concerns larger lorries could pose a bigger risk . 'LHVs could help with the EUâ€™s objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020, but that there is a significant variation in the predicted impact, and that if modal shift towards road freight is significant, greenhouse gas emissions could in fact increase,' it said. Conservative MEP Jacqueline Foster told the Telegraph British hauliers should be allowed to compete on a 'level playing field'. She added the government could refuse entry to Megatrucks if it decided they were 'not appropriate for our roads'.","LHV lorries weighing up to 60 tonnes are twice the length of a bus .

As a 17-year-old boy, Mike Coots lost his right leg in a shark attack while surfing off the coast of Hawaii. But the 1997 tragedy has done nothing to diminish Coots' love for the ocean, as seen in a series of stunning photographs he has been posting on his Instagram page. Not only has Coots, now 32 years old, continued surfing after the tragedy using a prosthetic limb, but he has become an activist campaigning for the conservation of sharks. Scroll down for video . Lived to tell the tale: Hawaii native Mike Coots has been posting inspiring photos on his Instagram account showing himself surfing with a prosthetic leg 17 years after a terrifying shark attack . Dark humor: Coots shared this image of an inflatable shark next to a toy diver with his leg missing . Harrowing ordeal: Coots was 17 years old in 1997 when a tiger shark swam up to him in Major's Bay on Kuai and chomped off his right foot, leaving him clinging to life . Back in the water: Coots went back to surfing shortly after being fitted with a prosthetic leg . When he is not busy doing water sports or saving marine predators, Coots works as a professional photographer whose work has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Hawaii Magazine, Discovery Channel and other outlets. Many of his inspiring images show the Kauai native shredding waves on his surfboard, or admiring the incredible natural beauty of the island: golden sunsets, palm trees and waves crashing against the shore. He has even managed to find humor in his predicament, posting a photo of an inflatable shark alongside a toy diver with his right leg missing. The photographer and environmentalist bears no ill will towards the sea creature that injured him nearly two decades ago. No hard feelings: Two months ago, Coots (bottom second left and top), swam with sharks . Paradise found: Many of Coots' photos celebrate the natural beauty of his state . Life is good: Coots, 32, pictured here fishing from a jet ski, spends his days surfing and taking photographs for hotels and various publications . Several years ago, Coots was approached by the Pew Environment Group asking him to join a campaign aimed at putting a stop to shark finning. In his capacity as an ambassador for the organization, Coots has traveled to the United Nations and the U.S. Capitol to speak in favor of shark conservation. In 2010, his efforts came to fruition when Hawaii became the first state in the nation to pass a ban on possession and sale of shark fins. Coots' chilling story of survival has been told many times in the last 17 years, including in a Discovery Channel documentary titled Shark Fight that premiered in 2012 to mark the 25th anniversary of the network’s popular Shark Week. Environmentalist: Coots has long been working for the cause of putting an end to the pollution of oceans . Sharks' best friend: Coots has been named a Pew Environment Group ambassador, helping in 2010 to pass a ban in Hawaii on the possession and sale of shark fins . In October 1997, then 17-year-old Coots was bodyboarding at Major's Bay on Kauai’s west side when suddenly a tiger shark surprised him, swimming up from the deep 'like a submarine' and plunging its razor-sharp serrated teeth into his right leg. The startled teenager repeatedly punched the fish in the head until finally it released his limb and swam away, the Huffington Post reported in 2012. Coots and a surfer friend who was with him at the time began to paddle back to shore when the teen felt a spasm in his right leg and realized that the shark had severed his foot with almost surgical precision. A semi-conscious Coots was loaded into a pickup truck and rushed to a local hospital. Going public: Coots shared his story of survival in the 2012 Discovery Channel documentary Shark Fight . As he lay in the rear of the vehicle, he recalled seeing blood gushing from his wound and spilling out of the tailgate like a waterfall. Doctors were able to save his life, but Coots ended up losing his right leg at the calf. The teen, however, was so relieved to have survived the terrifying ordeal that he felt blessed rather than angry. While recovering from his injury, Coots developed a passion for photography, which he later turned into a successful career. Once back on his feet, Coots returned to the ocean without a moment’s hesitation. He chose to surf for the first time since the attack not far from the spot where he was bitten. ‘I remember the first time getting back in the water... I remember jumping in the ocean, and it felt glorious,’ he told the site.","A tiger shark bit off Mike Coots' right foot as then-17-year-old was bodyboarding off Kauai in October 1997 .

Kazakhstan's brutal regime has gloated that David Cameron and Tony Blair have put their bloodsoaked country on the map yesterday. The foreign minister of the former Soviet dictatorship, best known as the home of comic creation Borat, said the country was ‘very honoured and privileged’ that two prime ministers have sought to bring the country in from the cold. Mr Cameron yesterday became the first serving prime minister to visit Kazakhstan and its ageing autocrat Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is accused of sanctioning the torture of his political opponents. Scroll down for video . 'Honourable' visit: David Cameron delivers a speech during a presentation at the Bolashak oil plant, near Atyrau in Kazakhstan on Sunday . But he dismissed concerns about human rights, saying that it was more important to drum up business deals. Mr Cameron is set to win business worth around £700m on the trip with another £85 billion in the pipeline in the years to come. He said he would raise the issue of human rights with President Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. But he made clear he thinks it is more important for Britain to cash in on oil deals with one of the world’s fastest growing economies. ‘I always raise all these issues with all the partners that we have around the world. Business trip: David Cameron pictured at an oil plant in Kazakhstan on Sunday, hopes to sign trade deals worth more than £700 million . UK's friend: Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, accused of violating human rights and million pound corruption, is Cameron's prospective business partner . But let’s be clear, why am I in Khazakstan on a Sunday? We are in a global race. This is one of the next emerging countries of the world. ‘I’ve over 30 British companies with me. We hope to conclude £700million worth of deals, that will mean jobs back at home. That’s what this is about.’ He and President Nazarbayev also discussed plans for Britain to evacuate military kit from Afghanistan using Kazakh air bases and trains. In a sign of Mr Cameron’s closeness to the Kazakh regime, the Prime Minister last night flew from the oil port city of Atyrau to the capital Astana in Mr Nazarbayev’s personal private jet, while his aides followed in a charter plane. Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov made clear that Tony Blair helped pave the way for the visit. Mr Blair’s consultancy has secured a £16 million two year deal to advise the government of Kazakhstan on political reform - a move which critics say has led to a ‘whitewash’ of the country’s human rights record. Mr Idrissov said: ‘We are very honoured and privileged to have such attention on the part of two prime ministers [towards] kazakhstan - Tony Blair and David Cameron. We cherish and enjoy the support of developed countries on our part for development.’ 'Jagshemash': Sasha Baron Cohen's character Borat is what most Britons associate Kazakhstan with . He added: ‘We are grateful that Mr Tony Blair and his colleagues are providing invaluable advice.’ Mr Cameron last night faced warnings that his visit would boost the standing of the dictatorial regime which gunned down 15 unarmed protestors during a strike by oil workers in December 2011. Algerim Dzhakisheva, whose father . Muktur was seized by secret police and imprisoned on trumped up charges, . said: ‘The government of Kazakhstan is carrying out a massive PR . offensive around the world and looking to be seen as a credible, . constructive player on the world stage. ‘But . that shouldn’t blind people to its massive abuses of the human rights . of its own citizens.’ Mr Cameron also risked a diplomatic row last night . by admitting that he has watched the Borat movie, in which comedian . Sacha Baron Cohen depicted the nation as a group of idiots and rapists . who throw Jews down wells. 'As . for the film, I did see it, it was a long time ago. I think I will rest . on the words of the foreign minister who I gather pointed out that his . country had survived Stalin and could probably survive anything else.’ Mr Idrissov admitted that Kazakhstan has faced criticisms and made the . adventurous claim that it is on the path to democracy despite the most . recent rigged election giving Mr Nazarbayev 95 per cent of the vote. He said: ‘We do not claim that we have got everything right or that there are no problems to overcome. ‘It . was never going to be possible to turn a country with no democratic . institutions or culture into a Jeffersonian democracy in two decades. What is important is the direction of travel. Kazakhstan remains . committed to a democratic path.’ A . spokeswoman for Tony Blair insisted the former prime minister does not . personally profit from his dealings with the Nazarbayev regime. She said: ‘Kazakhstan is an important country in an important region at an important time for the world. ‘David Cameron is absolutely right to be seeking to forge closer economic and political ties for these reasons and because of Kazakhstan’s strategic positioning in the world and the supportive role it is playing with regard to troops returning from Afghanistan.’ Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron became the first Western leader to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif since his recent election. He urged the Pakistanis to press the Taliban to engage in peace talks. On Saturday he visited troops in Afghanistan to mark Armed Forces Day.","David Cameron became first UK Prime Minister to visit Kazakhstan .

Hedge fund manager Daniel Shak is suing his ex-wife, Beth, for 35 per cent of all the shoes she owns, claiming she kept them hidden as they thrashed out a $3.25million (£2m) divorce settlement.

A couple who took their children out of school so they could have their first family holiday in five years risk being jailed after refusing to pay fines introduced under controversial new laws. Stewart and Natasha Sutherland will appear before Telford Magistrates' Court tomorrow after they took their three children to the Greek island of Rhodes during the school term. The couple were given an initial fine of £360 after the family of five went away for seven days at the end of September, but were unwilling to pay. The penalty then doubled to £720 because they did not pay the fee within 21 days. The Sutherland family: (left to right) Sian, 13, mother Natasha, Keane, six, father Stewart and daughter Rhiannon, 15 on holiday in Rhodes . Now the week-long break could cost the couple up to £2,000, while they also face the prospect of a three-month prison sentence. The family booked the holiday in October 2012, before the new guidelines were put into force on September 1 least year. Before they went away, the couple were warned they each risked a £60 fine for taking their six-year-old son, Keane, and their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, on the break. Mr Sutherland, 39, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said, the family struggle to fit in a regular holiday and were desperate to get away. ‘It’s like a revolving door in our house - I come in from work and my wife goes out.' he said. ‘We haven’t been able to get leave in the school holidays at the same time for five years, and we desperately needed a family break. Paradise: The family of five went to the Greek Island of Rhodes, a destination popular with British tourists . ‘I work in a sensitive job where . staffing levels have to be maintained - there’s been a recruitment and . overtime ban and it’s been impossible to arrange summer leave that fits . in with the rest of the family. ‘I . know how important education is - but there’s a bigger picture. Family . time is important, too, and the children’s behaviour and schooling has . improved massively since our holiday together.’ The amendments to school attendance regulations ended a policy which let schools grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays. Headteachers now are not obliged to give pupils leave during term time, expect in 'exceptional circumstances.' Now, according to Section 444 of the Education Act, 1996, parents are legally required to send their children to school on a regular basis, and failure to do so can land them a fine or prison sentence. Youngest: Their six-year-old son Keane was taken out of Donnigton Wood Primary School in Telford . Mr Sutherland added ‘I informed the school after the summer holidays that we were taking the children out for six days. At that point, I wasn’t even aware of the new legislation. ‘We had a letter back warning that as the time off was not authorised we could be fined, but the holiday was already booked and paid for - what could I do? ‘I’ve since become aware that other parents just lie and tell the school their kids are ill, but I was upfront from the outset and raise my children to be honest. ‘I’ve even heard of local schools . advising parents to say their children are sick to avoid getting fined. What kind of lesson does that teach them - that it’s OK to lie and be . deceitful?’ The couple are . arguing that the education authority has no appeal process and they have . no choice but to go to court to have their say. Older children: Their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, both attend Sutherland Business and Enterprise College in Telford . Mr Sutherland said: ‘This is not about the fine or the cost of the holidays outside of school term, it is about the principle. I could not have holiday any other time. ‘We spoke to the school attendance officer and things looked hopeful that the fines would be quashed. ‘But the next day we had an email back saying once a fine had been issued, it couldn’t be withdrawn. ‘I asked the attendance officer to put herself in our shoes - the kids go back to school and their friends ask where they’ve been over the holidays. ‘They have to say 'nowhere, my dad was working. The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school. It equates to £60 per child, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 21 days. After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court. The couple are being prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act, subsections one and eight.The two parts refer to a parent's failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil. If a child of compulsory school age fails to attend the school regularly, his parent is guilty of an offence. If the parent knows that his child is failing to attend regularly at the school and fails without reasonable justification to cause him to do so, he is guilty of an offence. If a person is guilty to any of the above offences they are liable on summary conviction with punishments ranging from a fine to a three-month prison sentence. The guidelines apply to all state-funded schools. 'I told the attendance officer they were trying to deprive children of having a holiday and I was told I’d deprived them of six days education and should feel guilty. ‘We are their parents; it should be up to us. I have no concerns over any of my children or their level of education. They are all in the top sets, and we believe quality family time is just as important as schooling. ‘We are bringing our children up to value their education, we know how important it is, but we are being punished for three things, because we work full-time, the fines are double because we are married, and finally because we were honest enough to tell the school the truth about the holiday instead of simply saying the kids were ill.’ Kay Burford, attendance support team leader for Telford & Wrekin Council said the new legislation is clear and any time off is disruptive to a child’s education. She said: ‘Our policy supports new legislation which makes it clear that head teachers may not grant any leave of absence during term time unless there are exceptional circumstances. ‘Leave in term-time which results in significant absence from school is disruptive to the child’s education and has a detrimental impact on attainment. There is no automatic right to any leave or holiday in term time. The regulations clearly make the point that the headteacher has the final decision as to whether to authorise the leave or not. ‘The Telford & Wrekin Council LA Policy Statement has been developed within the context of the national and local priority of raising the educational achievement and attainment of pupils. The Government has renewed appeals to parents not to take their children out of school during term time.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging . effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more . likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. 'That is why we have given schools more power to tackle . poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We have also . increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the . amount of time they have to pay. 'Parents should never simply discount a possible penalty . notice from the cost of a cheaper holiday, because this is a criminal offence . and when doing so they are always risking prosecution'","Stewart and Natasha Sutherland will appear at Telford Magistrates' Court .

Archaeologists believe they have discovered the world's oldest 'calendar' in a field in Scotland. A group of 12 pits recently excavated in Aberdeenshire appear to mimic and align with the phases of the moon, making it possible to track lunar months over the course of a year. Researchers from the University of Birmingham now believe that the monument dates back 10,000 years - predating the earliest known calendar by 5,000 years. A group of 12 pits recently excavated in Aberdeenshire appear to mimic the phases of the moon to track lunar months over the course of a year. Researchers from the University of Birmingham now believe this monument could be the world's oldest 'calendar' and dates back 10,000 years . A Mayan calendar was recently uncovered inside a vast city built by the ancient civilisation near Guatemala. One wall of the calendar was covered in calculations that appeared to relate to the Mayan calendar. It featured a line-up of men in black uniforms and the astrological calculations are not fully understood. Archaeologists from Boston University . believe the dates stretch up to 7,000 years into the future and . contradicted the 'doomsday' predictions about 2012. The first formal time-measuring devices were thought to have been created in Mesopotamia about 5,000 years ago. The pit alignment near Crathes Castle predates those discoveries by thousands of years, experts say. The Mesolithic monument at Warren Field is said to have been created by hunter-gatherer societies nearly 10,000 years ago. It was excavated between 2004 and 2006 and was recently analysed by researchers from the University of Birmingham. They found that the monument pits . align during the Midwinter sunrise, which researchers say would provide . an annual 'astronomic correction' to maintain the link between the . passage of time indicated by the moon, the solar year and the seasons. The project was led by Vince Gaffney, professor of landscape archaeology at the University of Birmingham. This is an artist's impression from the University of Birmingham of a fire burning in one of the lunar calendar pits at Warren Field from around 8,000 BC, in Crathes, Aberdeenshire . He said: 'The evidence suggests that hunter-gatherer societies in Scotland had both the need and sophistication to track time across the years, to correct for seasonal drift of the lunar year and that this occurred nearly 5,000 years before the first formal calendars known in the near east. University of Birmingham professor Vince Gaffney, pictured, stands in front of the 10,000-year-old excavated lunar pits . 'In doing so, this illustrates one important step towards the formal construction of time and therefore history itself.' Dr Richard Bates from the University of St Andrews, was also involved in the project and said the pit monument provided new evidence of the 'sophistication' of societies in early Mesolithic Scotland. 'This is the earliest example of such a structure and there is no known comparable site in Britain or Europe for several thousands of years after the monument at Warren Fields was constructed,' he said. The pit site was first discovered when unusual crop markings were noticed during an aerial survey by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. It lies on the National Trust for Scotland's Crathes Castle estate and was excavated by the trust and Murray Archaeological Services. Dr Shannon Fraser, the trust's archaeologist for eastern Scotland, said: 'This is a remarkable monument which is so far unique in Britain. 'Our excavations revealed a fascinating glimpse into the cultural lives of people some 10,000 years ago - and now this latest discovery further enriches our understanding of their relationship with time and the heavens.' The research was published in the journal Internet Archaeology.","The monument is made up of 12 pits that appear to mimic moon phases .

New York's dingy LaGuardia Airport will get a much-needed $3.6 billion makeover, it was revealed today. The bustling hub has been repeatedly ranked as the worst in America in customer satisfaction surveys. But now Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced . the state is taking control of an ambitious construction . project to build a new central terminal. Worst in America: A traveller takes pictures of a flight monitor showing cancelled flights at LaGuardia airport in New York . New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has said LaGuardia Airport will benefit from a $3.6billion refit . The project will create vast open spaces, restaurants, shopping plazas, new parking garages, free wi-fi and other amenities now common in other airports. Cuomo also wants to develop a plan to upgrade cargo operations at nearby John F Kennedy International Airport. 'We are going to redevelop those airports the way they should have been redeveloped many, many years ago,' Cuomo said in his annual State of the State address. Cuomo, who is running for re-election and has been mentioned as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, said he had become frustrated that talk of such renovations has been going on since the 1990s with little progress. He wants to jump-start construction just as he has done with a $3.9 billion project to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge, north of New York City, which also had been stalled for years. LaGuardia, along the Flushing and Bowery . bays in northern Queens, is the closest of the New York area's three . major air hubs to midtown Manhattan, just eight miles, and it handled a . record 27 million passengers last year. Set for a refit: American Airlines planes at LaGuardia Airport in New York . Cramped: A Port Authority police officer guards a terminal at LaGuardia Airport in New York . LaGuardia Airport has been repeatedly ranked as the worst in America in customer satisfaction surveys . Often the first building they see is the sprawling, boomerang-shaped Central Terminal, which opened just in time to receive visitors to the 1964 World's Fair. Many passengers say it is like stepping back in time. They immediately encounter low ceilings and dimly lit, narrow hallways. Check-in kiosks are arrayed haphazardly in rows just inside the entrances, where bright green neon lights blare 'Welcome to LaGuardia Airport.' On the west side of the terminal sits a modest food court featuring a hamburger counter, a pizzeria and a Dunkin' Donuts. 'It's probably the worst of all the terminals I go in and out of,' said Thomas Smith, a frequent-flying energy company executive from Chicago who has seen buckets on the floor under leaky ceilings and other signs of decay. 'There's no real food service other than small snack shops. The gate areas are old.' Most passengers have to drag their carry-on bags down a flight of stairs to get from their gates to baggage claim because only one concourse has an escalator. Others have complained that neither Kennedy nor LaGuardia provides free Wi-Fi, something that has been industry standard for years. The four New York metropolitan-area commercial airports have set an all-time record in 2013 for the number of passengers flying in and out. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced Monday that the airports saw a total of 111.6 million passengers last year. They are John F. Kennedy, Newark Liberty, Stewart International and LaGuardia airports. John F Kennedy had approximately 50 million passengers. LaGuardia had 27 million, Newark had 34 million and Stewart had 320,000. In 2012, the number of passengers at all four airports was 109.4 million. The 2013 record surpassed the previous mark, set in 2007. That year, 109.4 million passengers used the airports. Built to accommodate 8 million . passengers a year, the central terminal now handles 12.5 million. Cuomo . envisions a new terminal that could handle as many as 17.5 million . passengers by 2030. LaGuardia's three other terminals — which include . the Art Deco-style Marine Air Terminal, where seaplanes landed in the . 1940s — are not slated for renovation. 'When . you see the difference between these airports and some of these other . countries' (airports), it's shameful,' said George Hobica, who runs the . website Airfarewatchdog.com. He noted that after the September 11, 2001, . terror attacks, airports had to install security equipment for luggage . and passenger screening. 'The TSA equipment barely fits at LaGuardia,' Hobica said. 'LaGuardia is just functionally disjointed.' In 2012, Travel and Leisure magazine put LaGuardia at the bottom of its ranking of the nation's worst airports, saying it had the 'dubious honor of ranking the worst for the check-in and security process, the worst for baggage handling, the worst when it comes to providing Wi-Fi, the worst at staff communication, and the worst design and cleanliness.' The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, concedes the facility is in need of an overhaul and had already begun awarding contracts for preliminary work at LaGuardia. A spokesman said it welcomes the state's involvement to expedite the project. Four companies have been asked to submit proposals for the Central Terminal Building project by April 15, and construction is expected to begin by the end of the year. The tricky part will come when construction is fully underway while the airport continues to serve millions. 'Everybody acknowledges that this is a complex undertaking but one that is absolutely necessary,' said Stephen Sigmund, executive director of the Global Gateway Alliance, which has advocated for improvements at New York's airports. 'It's going to be a nightmare,' added Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst. 'This is going to be the equivalent of General Motors trying to change one of its models while the assembly line is still running. ... But this is the way airports get redeveloped. Every airline understands this.' Darius Douglass, a New York writer waiting for a flight at LaGuardia, said the workers throughout the airport try to be friendly and helpful. 'But it's an old airport. It just needs to be refurbished. It was good in its heyday, but nothing has been done.'","Governor Andrew Cuomo says New York state will take control .

A scientific breakthrough could finally make a male contraceptive pill reality, researchers said last night. Previous attempts to develop a pill have tried either to alter a man’s hormones or to make his sperm ineffective. The new technique works like a . temporary vasectomy, stopping sperm leaving the body during sex – which . scientists say will reassure men concerned that other approaches could . affect their long-term virility and libido. Male pill? A temporary vasectomy, which stops sperm in its tracks without the need for surgery, is finally on the cards after years of research . It . is also likely to appeal to women uneasy about the female pill’s . potential to raise the risk of heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. But . some women may not welcome the news. In 2011 a survey by Anglia Ruskin . University found that half of women would not rely on a male pill as . contraception – because they did not trust their partners to remember to . take it. Dr Sabatino Ventura, whose team at the Monash University in . Australia published their findings last night, said the technique works . by blocking two proteins involved in the ejaculation process. Using . medication to target the mechanism by which sperm leaves the body, . rather than trying to alter a man’s hormones or kill his sperm, meant . the potential side-effects would be vastly reduced, he said. Significantly, . the technique would not affect a man’s sex drive, and fertility could . be switched back on simply by not taking the pill. Dr Ventura said: . ‘Most of the previous strategies to make a male contraceptive have . either been hormonal strategies, which would produce a lot of sexual . side-effects or effects on masculinity, or they would make sperm . dysfunctional, which might produce long-term effects on offspring. Our . strategy avoids all those problems.’ Taken . daily, a male pill would let couples share the task of family planning. Although there are a range of contraception options available to women, . for men currently there are only condoms or a permanent surgical . vasectomy. The new . technique, detailed in a paper published in the Proceedings of the . National Academy of Sciences, has been shown to work in mice. The . male mice were 100 per cent infertile after two proteins were deleted . from their bodies. Crucially, the sperm retained in their body was . undamaged and was later used via IVF to produce healthy baby mice . Women still appreciate chivalry from men, according to a study. More than four out of five like it when a man holds a door open, and three quarters like to be offered a seat, a survey found. Nearly two thirds like men to pull out their chair at a meal. Men were less keen, however. More than a third said they were unlikely to help a woman carry heavy bags or a pushchair up stairs. And 21 per cent said they would be too embarrassed to give up a seat, with some fearing being seen as patronising. Only 7 per cent of women said they disliked such behaviour. Reviewing the research, psychologist Donna Dawson said: ‘There seems to be a “disconnect” between what women appreciate . . . and how men think women want to be treated.’ The survey of 5,000 people was carried out for insurer AXA. Stagnant: In the past 50 years there have been few changes in male contraception compared with the range of options available to women . In . humans the same process would work by using medication to disrupt the . same two proteins, blocking a message from the brain which moves sperm . into the penis. The man would still ejaculate but there would be no . sperm. Dr Allan Pacey, . fertility expert at Sheffield University, said the study showed great . promise but added: ‘There is a long way to go. We need to do a few . studies in humans to be sure this works in the way it has in mice and . there are no side-effects.’","The temporary 'vasectomy' stops sperm in its tracks, avoiding surgery .

The U.N. secretary-general withdrew his invitation to Iran to join this week's Syria peace talks, saying he is ""deeply disappointed"" by Iran's statements Monday. A spokesman for Ban Ki-moon announced the withdrawal less than 24 hours after Ban surprised the U.S. and others by saying he had invited Syria's closest regional ally. The invitation was withdrawn shortly after Iran's U.N. ambassador declared the Islamic Republic wouldn't join the Syria talks if required to accept the roadmap sketched during a 2012 Geneva conference on Syria. Peace talks: UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks U.N. headquarters in New York on the decision by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Armed Forces to participate in the upcoming Geneva Conference on Syria and invite Iran . A spokesman for Ban, Martin Nesirky, said senior Iranian officials had assured Ban that Iran understood the terms of his invitation. 'The Secretary-General is deeply disappointed by Iranian public statements today that are not at all consistent with that stated commitment,' Nesirky said. 'He continues to urge Iran to join the global consensus behind the Geneva CommuniquÃ©.' The talks are set to begin Wednesday in the Swiss city of Montreux, with delegations from the United States, Russia and close to 40 other countries attending. Face-to-face negotiations between the Syrian government and its opponents - the first since the three-year civil war began - start Friday in Geneva. Bloody civil war: Syrian president Bashar al-Assad said yesterday that he expects his country's bloody conflict to drag on, describing it as a 'fight against terrorism' and rejecting any distinction between opposition fighters and radical jihadists . But Ban's announcement Sunday night that Iran was invited to Montreux angered Syria's main Western-backed opposition group, which over the weekend had announced it would join the talks after intense international pressure. The opposition group will be attending the peace talks. The opposition set a Monday afternoon deadline, saying Iran had to commit publicly by 1900 GMT Monday to the terms set in the 2012 Geneva talks - the formation of a transitional government for Syria that would pave the way for democratic elections - or the U.N. should withdraw the invitation. Senior U.S. officials also said Ban's invitation had to be withdrawn unless Iran fully and publicly endorsed those terms. Syrian ally: Iranian president Hassan Rouhani with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei at the 27th International Islamic Unity Conference in Tehran yesterday . Invitations to the Montreux meeting had been subject to approval by the initiating states, Russia and the United States, but the two countries had been at an impasse over Iran. Amid the anger, Ban said Monday morning that he was 'urgently considering his options' in light of the 'disappointing conduct of some participants' in the peace talks. 'Throughout the Syrian conflict, the Secretary-General has sought to do everything within his power for a political solution, which is the only path forward,' the U.N. statement Monday afternoon said.","Ban Ki-moon has withdrawn his invitation to Iran to join this week's Syria peace talks .

A young horse that was rescued after being found frozen to the ground in a patch of mud, two weeks ago, has died. The one-year-old horse, Elsa, was just hours from death when she was pried from the frigid floor in an Enoch City yard, but managed to hang on for ten days before losing her life over the weekend. Veterinarians have described it as one of Utah's worst cases of animal neglect. The yearling was suffering from hypothermia with sores on the side of her face and an eye infection from prolonged contact with the frozen ground. Horrific: Elsa, a one-year-old horse, was found emaciated and frozen to the ground in a Enoch City, Utah on January 9th. She did this weekend despite round-the-clock care for her . Harness: A sling was used to try and held Elsa stand on her legs . All hands on deck: While Elsa had been eating and standing with the help of a sling just hours earlier, there were a number of problems that could have led to her death . Her mother who was also rescued at the same time, was found starving alongside her. 'It was something where she hadn’t been properly cared for, probably since birth,' Grimes said, explaining that while Elsa had been eating and standing with the help of a sling just hours earlier, there were a number of problems that could have led to her death. In addition to severe malnutrition, the horse suffered from an assortment of ailments related to the poor conditions in which she was left, including sores on the side of her body. 'This is absolutely one of the worst cases in my career,' Enoch City animal control officer Chris Johnson told KUTV.com. 'When I got there she was laying in the mud. She had been starved. She had no strength from lack of nutrition.' '(The ground) was completely frozen. When we rolled her over you could see the indent was still there and the ice and ground wasn't moving.' The filly and her mother, Anna, were rescued from their corral after a concerned passerby saw the dangerously thin horses and called emergency services.

The family of Uriel Jaurez-Popoca allege that dropping the Mexican man at a Taco Bell was part of a 'perverse joke' about his heritage . The family of a drunk Mexican father who was run over and killed after police dropped him off at a Taco Bell instead of arresting him are suing the force for racial discrimination. Uriel Juarez-Popoca, 22, was hit and killed while walking along a four-lane highway on June 28 2012 near Columbus, shortly after Ohio state police found him sitting in his truck while clearly intoxicated. But instead of arresting him, the officers took him five miles away to the nearest Taco Bell before leaving him there, an act which the family claims is part of a 'perverse joke' about his heritage. The family has now launched legal action for unspecified damages against the Delaware County Sheriff's Office in Ohio, several of the agency's deputies and an officer with the Ohio State Highway Patrol. According to Courthouse News Service, the complaint reads: 'Violating all of their own rules of conduct and safety, defendants ridiculed Mr. Popoca as a Mexican, ultimately leaving him disoriented and intoxicated in a dangerous area where he was predictably killed by a passing motorist. 'The defendants mocked and ridiculed Mr. Popoca based on his Hispanic or Mexican national origin. Defendant Trooper Carpenter failed to stop the discriminatory behavior of the deputies. 'Defendant Deputy Beggs then advised defendant Trooper Carpenter that they were going to transport Mr. Popoca to a nearby Taco Bell.' Police said at the time that they dropped Juarez-Popoca off at the Taco Bell expecting him to call for a ride. However the lawsuit alleges the officers received numerous calls about him . from the store manager and drivers along the highway during the 50-minute . period after they dropped him off, and failed to take proper action . Juarez-Popoca was hit and killed near to Alum Creek Bridge on U.S. 36 (pictured). His wife, two children and parents are now suing the police for racial discrimination . Juarez-Popoca, who was working in the U.S. at the time and sending money back to his wife, two children and parents in Mexico, was hit on U.S. 36 just north of Columbus, Ohio, and died of severe head, neck and chest injuries. An attorney for the patrolman said the discrimination allegations are ludicrous and that the officers gave Juarez-Popoca 'a major break' by letting him go, especially considering that his legal status in the country was in question. Sam Shamansky, the attorney representing the Ohio state patrolman named in the lawsuit, said that Juarez-Popoca's death was a tragedy but that authorities were not discriminating against him. 'There's no discrimination here,' he said. 'If you ask me, it could just as easily be said that deputies were giving him a major break by not taking him to jail, maybe in order to not have discriminatory actions taken against him, vis-a-vis deportation. 'As an observer trying to be independent, I would suggest that's way more plausible than that they were discriminating against him because he's Hispanic.' Two deputies, Christopher Hughes and Derek Beggs, were fired over the matter. Patrolman Sean Carpenter also was fired but won an appeal of that decision and was reinstated.","Uriel Juarez-Popoca, 22, died in 2012 after being hit while walking on US 36 .

A nightclub boss lied about being kidnapped by lapdancers to escape paying them more than in £42,000 unpaid wages, a court heard. Curtis Woodman, 34, hired lapdancers and staff to work at his pop-up nightclub during the . Cheltenham Festival in March 2012. But the Embassy Club in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was stormed by 50 police officers at around 9pm on the third night of opening and closed down for breaching its licence.

An ex-banker wrote an op-ed Sunday lifting the lid on what he deems the 'wealth addiction' of stock brokers and bankers, which he claims still rages on post crash. Sam Polk went from a drug addicted Columbia University student to a highly funded money addicted Bank of America trader. Polk describes in his New York Times op-ed how in college, he used alcohol, cocaine, pot, Ritalin, ecstasy, and meaningless sex to fill his never satisfied soul. He confesses to getting suspended from Columbia for burglary and fired from a job at an internet company for fist fighting. Sam Polk was addicted to drugs and alcohol, then wealth, and now his new addiction is raising money for families in need . Polk managed to lie his way into an internship with Credit Suisse and got a therapist to help him get sober--from drugs that is. Finally Polk was able to flush drugs and alcohol from his system to allow a new drug in--money. He describes how he got his Job at Bank of America by making daily phone calls to the director. He says he was thrilled to not have to check his balance before withdrawing money for the first time in his life, but for Polk too much was never enough. After Bank of America, he got a job at a hedge fund and was disappointed that he 'only made $1.5 million' his second year there, recounts New York Magazine. He wrote that his therapist told him , 'I might be using money the same way I’d used drugs and alcohol — to make myself feel powerful — and that maybe it would benefit me to stop focusing on accumulating more and instead focus on healing my inner wound.' He said that he began to agree with his therapist after seeing other bankers ferociously hating anyone who tried to regulate their bonuses. 'In the months before bonuses were handed out, the trading floor started to feel like a neighborhood in “The Wire” when the heroin runs out,' Polk wrote. Whether it was partying with drugs or partying with money, Sam Polk needed more . Polk made the decision to quit the hedge fun after his boss refused to up his bonus from $3.6 million to $8 million. That's when he went on to start a charity called Groceryship that helps poor families put food on their tables. Before becoming a philanthropist he spent an entire year going through money 'withdrawal' and would wake up in the middle of the night worrying about not making enough even though he had plenty. After some time, he was finally able to look at Wall Street and money in a new light. Sam Polk, pictured here with a female friend, is now dedicated to raising money for others instead of for himself . 'We all confront our part in enabling wealth addicts to exert so much influence over our country,' the culture of which currently 'supports and even lauds the addiction,' concludes Polk. His op-ed suggests an idea that would make the world a more financially equal place. 'Let’s create a fund, where everyone agrees to put, say, 25 per cent of their annual bonuses into it, and we’ll use that to help some of the people who actually need the money that we’ve been so rabidly chasing. Together, maybe we can make a real contribution to the world,' he said. In addition to using the New York Times as a forum, he jokes about wealth addiction on twitter. '12-step programs only work when addicts hits bottom. How can wealth addicts hit bottom amidst such ingrained cultural support?' he said. He also wrote, 'Everyone wants to win the lottery. Wealth addicts want to win it 2x, 3x, a 100x.' Even though money is no longer on Polk's mind, his life appears to be more rich.

The way police dealt with neglect allegations concerning a four-year-old boy, who was eventually starved to death by his alcoholic mother, are to be investigated. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will examine West Yorkshire Police’s conduct in relation to the case of Hamzah Khan, whose decomposed body was found in a cot at his home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2011. The child's severely malnourished and skeletal remains . were discovered in a bedroom of his . mother's filthy house nearly two years after he died. Victim: Hamzah Khan's starved to death by his mother in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2011 . Mother-of-eight Amanda Hutton, 43, was jailed for 15 years last year for Hamzah’s manslaughter, as well as neglecting five of her other children. At her trial at Bradford Crown Court, it emerged that a range of agencies, including police officers, had contact with her family but no-one spotted the danger the children were in. The court also heard how Hamzah's father, . Aftab Khan, raised concerns with officers after he was arrested for . attacking Hutton, but detectives said the claims were investigated . and no problems found. The IPCC said it is now investigating West Yorkshire Police’s handling of concerns raised about Hamzah’s welfare. It said allegations of neglect had been made to West Yorkshire Police and other agencies prior to the discovery of the youngster’s body and it had contacted the force to ask for details of complaints to police. Sentenced: Amanda Hutton was jailed for 15 years after being found guilty of manslaughter, after her son's mummified body was discovered two years after he died . The commission said it will examine what action West Yorkshire Police took after concerns about Hamzah’s welfare were raised. It will also look at why the matter was not referred to the IPCC in 2011. IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts, who will oversee the investigation, said: 'The death of Hamzah Khan was a truly shocking example of the most cruel neglect imaginable and at the heart of it lies the loss of a young life. 'Our investigation will examine what action West Yorkshire Police took and also why the contact was not referred to us in 2011.' Police had extensive contact with Hutton and her family over a number of years but mainly because she was a victim of repeated domestic violence. A serious case review in Hamzah's case published last year concluded that the child was 'invisible for almost a lifetime'. But the review was criticised by Children's Minister Edward Timpson who expressed his 'deep concerns', saying it had failed to fully explain 'missed opportunities to protect children in the house'. Squalor: The child's body was found in awful conditions in a bedroom at Amanda Hutton's house . Hutton was living in what the report described as 'breathtakingly . awful' conditions with five of her young children as well as Hamzah's . mummified remains when shocked police entered her four-bedroom house in . September 2011. A jury found . she had allowed Hamzah to starve to death in December 2009 and left his . body in a cot with a teddy. The . remains were only discovered due to a police community support . officer's tenacious pursuit of a minor anti-social behaviour complaint . because she knew something was wrong. But . Hutton failed to co-operate with many children's services. Detective . chief superintendent Andy Brennan, head of West Yorkshire Police . Professional Standards, said: 'West Yorkshire Police referred this . matter to the IPCC in November last year and they have decided this will . be an independent investigation which we will fully support and assist . in any way we can.'

Michael Cope, 28, was due to stand trial at Manchester Crown Court for the pretty 25-year-old's murder, but suddenly entered a guilty plea. The body of Miss Ashton, described as a 'loving and doting mother' by her family and friends, was found at her home in Winton, Salford on June 29 - sparking a manhunt for her killer. Cope went on the run immediately after the killing, and finally handed himself in after five weeks. He showed no emotion as he pleaded. The killer has also admitted three assaults on Miss Ashton, including strangling her twice and headbutting her in the months before the murder. He will be sentenced at 10.30am tomorrow. He had previously protested his innocence. Miss Ashton had lived with her two daughters, Destiny, seven, and Daisy, two, after she split up with her youngest child’s father, Liam Grime. The break-up was amicable and it is understood the two had remained close friends. He was bringing Daisy back to Miss Ashton’s house when he came across the murder scene and found his former partner lying dead with horrific facial injuries. The shock of the murder on June 29 swept around her estate and tributes were also paid to her in Eccles town centre, where she worked as a barmaid at the Duke of York.

He thanked friends for their ‘kind . messages’, adding: ‘Although we were not together, Linzi was and still . is the love of my life.’ It is thought Cope had been sleeping rough just yards from where he was finally arrested. After five weeks on the run 28-year-old Cope handed himself in at a terrace house in Leigh.

A schoolboy bully who hurled eggs at a profoundly deaf woman and verbally abused her and her family while their backs were turned has escaped with just an apology. The 13 year-old launched a campaign of abuse against Kirsty Mills, 21, and her family, shouting profanities and teasing them for using sign language to communicate with each other, and was even encouraged by his mother. The boy - whose identity is protected by law - threw eggs at the student’s family home and pelted the car of a friend, who dropped her off from lectures at Bolton University in Greater Manchester, where she is studying photography. The 13-year-old launched a campaign of abuse against Kirsty Mills, 21, and her family, shouting profanities and teasing them for using sign language to communicate with each other, and was even encouraged by his mother . Targetted: Kirsty (centre), her brother Paul and sister Gemma (right) were verbally-abused by the youngster and had eggs thrown at their house . Attack: The boy pelted their terraced home with eggs several times before police asked him to apologise . The boy would also taunt Miss Mills’s mother calling her a ‘fat b***h’ and a ‘prostitute’. Miss Mills said his reign of terror left her scared of walking down the street near her home in case she bumped into him. But police swooped on the bully after Miss Mills's brother Paul, 27 - who is also deaf - lip read the boy's insults. Then, Miss Mills managed to capture a picture of her tormentor as he ran off after throwing an egg - and handed the image to officers. The boy was questioned on suspicion of causing harassment, alarm and distress and police considered trying to securing an Asbo. Egg attack: Kirsty Mills took pictures of some of the attacks on her home . Mess: Egg shells can be seen in this image, scattered across their drive . But due to the fact it was his first time in trouble, he agreed to make an apology which was submitted to Kirsty under the Home Office Restorative Justice Scheme. Miss Mills, from Walkden, near Salford who was born deaf and communicates through sign language said: 'He did come over and say sorry but I did not feel that it was a proper sorry. 'He was smirking and he was acting as though he felt more sorry that he got caught by police. It appeared to me that he wasn’t sorry for what he had done to us. I don’t think he realised how much he upset us. 'The good news is that the attacks have stopped and we feel safe to walk down the street again. I feel confident and my family are happy again. Everything has gone back to normal. 'If I could speak to the boy, I would ask him why he did all this. This is the first time I have ever experienced anything like this and I hope it will be the last.' She said she began getting teased by the boy in October 2013. when he started walking by her home where she lives with her parents Anthony, 50, and Denise, 49, and older siblings. Miss Mills, from Walkden, near Salford who was born deaf and communicates through sign language, was left scared to leave the house by the ordeal . The teenager would taunt Miss Mills and her older brother as they walked to hospital appointments. The boy would insult the siblings by calling them names such as 'deaf and dumb' and 'sp***a'. She said: 'Whenever we took the dog for a walk at night time the boy would find us and call us names. When we went to hospital appointments the boy was shouting and calling us deaf, dumb, sp****s, anything like that. 'We didn’t really understand what he had said because our backs were turned. My brother heard some kind of noise and turned around to ask what was being said and we could lip-read and see what he was calling us. 'I felt angry, frustrated, upset and scared at the same time. I didn’t understand why he was discriminating against us but I do think the main reason is because we are deaf. I felt we were being victimised because we are deaf. 'He would even call our mum a ""s**g"", a ""fat b***h"" and a ""prostitute"".' The bullying gradually progressed from name-calling to the point where the boy would throw eggs at the house and at Kirsty’s friend’s car whenever she dropped her off after university. Miss Mills added: 'The first time the boy threw eggs at the house the police told us they needed more evidence but then one day I was coming home from university with my friend and we happened to see him throw an egg and he ran off - I got out of the car and took a picture. 'Even his mother used to make fun of how we use sign language. We felt like we couldn’t walk down the street, we used to walk down other streets to avoid him.' Miss Mills hopes to use her story to encourage other victims of hate crime to come forward during Hate Crime Awareness Week. She said: 'I would tell other victims to be strong and speak to the police. The police are very helpful. Because my family and I spoke out about what was happening to us we can walk on our street again without feeling scared. 'Hate Crime Awareness week is important because it will help resolve discrimination and help everybody to become more aware about what is going on. 'It’s not just about the colour of skin or about people being disabled, it’s about everything. Anyone can be a victim of hate crime. Ass Ch Con Garry Shewan, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'I want the message to get through really clearly that we will not tolerate any offence of this kind. 'We need to continue to do more to encourage reporting from all communities, and we are currently doing a lot of work to raise awareness of our third party reporting centres, which people can attend if they would rather not go to a police station. 'Hate crime undermines the energy and richness that is an essential part of life and I would ask anyone who suffers a crime motivated by hate to come forward, as all reports will be thoroughly investigated.'","He launched campaign of abuse against Kirsty Mills, 21, and her family .

Kevin Keith, 49, and his wife Catherine were held and questioned after the body of Nicole Falkingham, 41 was discovered lying on the back seat of their car . A man arrested after a millionaire property developer's wife was found frozen to death outside his home has been jailed for using his luxury house as a cannabis factory. Construction worker Kevin Keith, 49, and his wife Catherine were held and questioned after the body of Nicole Falkingham, 41, was discovered lying on the back seat of their black Vauxhall Insignia car in sub zero temperatures. No charges were brought against the couple for her death, but police investigating the tragedy found nearly 100 cannabis plants being cultivated across three bedrooms at their home in Otterspool, Liverpool. Once harvested the drugs could have sold on the streets for over £100,000. Keith  - who also ran a bar - later claimed he was approached to convert part of his house into a drugs farm in return for money after he faced eviction when his own business interests ran into financial difficulties. He has today been jailed for 20 months after a judge said the size of the yield had to warrant a sentence of imprisonment. His wife, also 49, wept as she was given a 12-month jail term suspended for two years with supervision. The couple  - who have never previously been in trouble with police - were also each ordered to pay £100 victim surcharge after they admitted drugs offences. A post mortem examination on 41-year-old Mrs Falkingham, from Allerton, who was estranged from husband Jonathan, revealed that she died of hypothermia and acute alcohol intoxication. The tragedy occurred last year whilst . Mrs Falkingham was fighting a divorce battle against her 51-year-old . husband - chief executive of property development firm Urban Splash. An inquest heard that on the evening of January 24 she had . been drinking wine in the Vinci bar in Allerton, Liverpool, with four . friends when according to a barman her condition changed dramatically . and she suddenly became ‘comatose’. Bar staff alerted the emergency services, but before they arrived she was picked up by the Keiths, who were family friends, and who gave her a lift back to their home. Her body was discovered the following morning inside the vehicle dressed in her hooded jacket and luxury Hunter wellington boots after temperatures dipped to minus 2 degrees celcius overnight. It was never revealed why Mrs Falkingham had been in the car. No charges were brought against the couple for Mrs Falkingham's death, but police investigating the tragedy found nearly 100 cannabis plants being cultivated across three bedrooms at their home in Otterspool, Liverpool . At the inquest last October a coroner . recorded a narrative verdict into Mrs Falkingham’s death saying she had . been 'placed in a vehicle, where she remained overnight.' But . police and the coroner’s office declined to reveal the contents of a . report on the investigation saying it contained 'confidential . information.' She had been more than four times over the legal limit and had a blood toxicity level of 333 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Police questioned the Keiths on suspicion of manslaughter through gross negligence - but prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to charge them. At Liverpool Crown Court, prosecutor Geoffrey Lowe said during inquiries into the tragedy, officers searched the couple’s home and found three bedrooms had been adapted to grow 95 cannabis plants. Her body was discovered the following morning inside the vehicle outside the couple's home, dressed in her hooded jacket and luxury Hunter wellington boots after temperatures dipped to minutes 2 degrees celcius overnight . A post mortem examination on 41-year-old Mrs Falkingham, from Allerton, who was estranged from husband Jonathan (pictured) - chief executive of property development firm Urban Splash - revealed that she died of hypothermia and acute alcohol intoxication . The electricity meter was also tampered with and bypassed to help with the cultivation process. The first bedroom yield was estimated to valued at up £28,200, the second bedroom at up to £37,000 and the third bedroom at up to £42,000. Mr Lowe added: 'He took full responsibility of the production to help out with the financial difficulty they were currently in. 'He maintains he was approached by others who were aware of his financial difficulty, he did not supply all the equipment, he did not arrange for the electricity to be bypassed. 'It was the first crop, there was no earlier cultivation, the fee would have been dedicated to clearing the mortgage arrears. He accepts that he fed and watered the plants.' Keith admitted producing Class B drugs between December 1, 2012 and January 25, 2013 and of dishonestly abstracting electricity without authority. His wife admitted allowing the house to be used for the production of cannabis. In mitigation Keith’s lawyer Damian Nolan said: 'This is a man who has been hard working, no previous convictions or cautions. The tragedy occurred last year whilst Mrs Falkingham was fighting a divorce battle against her 51-year-old husband . 'In 2010, the downturn in the economic situation, the bar business struggled and the business folded. 'He was still liable for financial commitments the bar had incurred and he wasn’t able to as well as his own mortgage. His daughters were still at school age and he found it an incredible burden. 'Someone approached him and offered to him for a short period of time, if willing to turn over part of his house for the cultivation of cannabis, he would be provided with a sum of money. 'He was not involved in the purchase of equipment or arrangement of how to set it up, he was not responsible, but he has to accept for the interference in electricity supply, the bedrooms where the crop was growing was cost free. 'Those who owned the crop would reap the benefits of cultivation. He knew he would receive something sizeable enough to make it worthwhile. 'Simply the money would be to pay off debts.' For Mrs Keith, Miss Martine Snowdon said: 'She has had a happy, successful and law-abiding life and up until these offences she had everything to be proud of. 'The inability to stand up and deal with it all has meant it all come crashing down around her. She has lost her home. 'She feels real deep shame and regret for her involvement in this. She feels deeply ashamed to her three daughters that she allowed herself to become involved in this. 'She has had a terrible 12 months with this hanging over her.' Passing sentence the judge Miss Recorder Elizabeth Nicholls told Keith: 'The court is very, very much aware of the tragic circumstances that brought police to your door and everyone will have nothing but heartfelt sympathies to her family and friends. 'No doubt 25 January was not only traumatic for you and those involved and will cause hurt but out of these facts arose the offences you are to be sentenced for, they have nothing to do with the tragic circumstances of the police attendance. 'I have taken into account the beautiful character references, the fact you have never been in trouble before. 'No doubt this has had a profound effect on you and your family but I’m afraid with 95 plants ranging in value from £53,000 to £107,000 there has to be an immediate term of imprisonment. 'I hope that when you are released you continue your law abiding existence.'","Kevin and Catherine Keith held after Nicole Falkingham's body discovered .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 10:32 EST, 20 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:42 EST, 20 January 2014 . Jailed: Barman Charles Franklin has been convicted of rape after attacking a woman when she was walking home from a wedding drunk . A barman was today jailed for nine years after raping a woman on the floor of the pub where he worked when she was returning home from attending a wedding. Charles Franklin approached his victim in the street when she was almost 'paralytic' then took her to his pub and attacked her, a court heard. He claimed they had consensual sex - but the 30-year-old woman, who is a lesbian, said that he told her he would 'break her neck' if she struggled. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, could not remember leaving the wedding in Bristol where she had been a guest and her first memory was waking up while being raped. Franklin, 30, denied the charges of rape and attempted rape, but was convicted and sentenced to nine years in prison following a trial at Bristol Crown Court. Sentencing, Judge Michael Roach said: 'It's easy to have a picture of girl in desperation, trying to escape. You have blighted her life. 'From witnesses we heard during your trial it was made clear that you are a man of good character but on the night in question you put that woman through a terrifying situation. 'The sentence I am about to hand you should be in double figures, but your good character has reduced it to just under that.' During the trial, the court heard how the woman left the wedding party in November 2012 at 1am after 'a lot of drinking'. She could not remember leaving, but it later emerged that by 3.45am she had alcohol in her system equivalent to three times the drink-drive limit. 'The next thing I remember was being on the floor of this pub with a guy,' she said. 'He stripped me. He was trying to force himself on me. I was struggling quite a lot. He told me if I kept struggling he would break my neck, so I let him do what he wanted.' Attack: Franklin invited his victim to the Somerset House pub in the Clifton area of Bristol and raped her there . Franklin claimed he met the woman in the street, offered to charge her phone at The Somerset House pub in Clifton, and 'one thing led to another' on the floor. After the attack the man sat at the bar and watched TV while his victim lay naked on the floor, she claimed. 'I managed to find my coat and I pretended to be asleep so he wouldn't come back,' she said. 'I looked around to see where the doors were. I decided to get up to see if there was a toilet or a window.' She could not find a way out and the pair went upstairs to a bedroom where the man tried, but failed, to have sex with her again before falling asleep. The victim then put on Franklin's jeans and T-shirt before climbing out of a window. She went to a kebab van and borrowed a mobile phone to raise the alarm with her mother, who came to pick her up. Denial: Franklin pleaded not guilty and insisted that he had consensual sex with the woman . Police later found Franklin's wallet in the pocket of his trousers and tracked him down to the pub, where he was still asleep at 9am. Tara Wolfe, prosecuting, said: 'The attack had devastating consequences on the victim's life. She was forced to take medication after the attack and as a result she was unable to pursue her career for 12 weeks.' Edward Burgess, mitigating, said: 'Mr Franklin is a man of good character, as you heard from several witnesses in the trial, and prior to this he has no previous convictions. 'Since the night in question Mr Franklin has struck up a new relationship and as you will see now, and did throughout the trial, she is visibly distressed by the accusations which she finds hard to believe. 'This is not a case which cries out with features of heavy violence.' Franklin, from Withywood in Bristol, was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register.","Charles Franklin, 30, bumped into woman on the streets of Bristol while she was walking home from a wedding .

A fourth member of a gang branded the 'ASBO Angels' has been named and shamed after exploiting frail old men for cash - by stealing kisses from them. The four women would target the elderly by posing as carers or offering to help with their weekly shopping before asking for and taking their money. CCTV captured one of the women flirting and planting a kiss on the cheek one of the victims after bluffing her way into his home. Caught: Andrena Kelly (left) and Emma Reeves (right) who targeted elderly men for money . At least 40 victims aged in their 70s and 80s handed over cash to Andrena Kelly, 36, Emma Reeves, 36,Tracy Halliday 40, and Lesley Bennett, 36, after the women carried out activities on their neighbourhoods looking for likely targets. Police fear there are many other elderly men targeted by the women in Chorley, Lancashire, but are too embarassed to come forward. Today Kelly joined accomplices Reeves, Halliday and Bennett by being issued with an anti social behaviour order, which has banned them from all sheltered housing and supported living accommodation in their hometown. The orders say they cannot offer to provide any services for gain - except for legitimate employment or business. Lesley Bennett, left, and Tracy Halliday, right, were part of a three-strong gang dubbed the 'ASBO Angels', who preyed on elderly men in Chorley, stealing money as they posed as carers . They also cannot carry ID or bank cards belonging to another person. After the hearing at Chorley Magistrates' Court, Inspector Dave Robinson of Lancashire Police said: 'This activity has been going on for some years and the victims we know about are potentially only the tip of the iceberg. 'There are likely to be many other vulnerable victims we are not aware of who have not reported issues due to embarrassment or a lack of capacity to do so. 'A lot of this activity has taken place behind closed doors and so has been very difficult to get a handle on. 'This is a great result for us and indeed the community of Chorley as a whole. 'Most of the victims have suffered some financial loss, as well as being made to feel threatened and intimidated in their own homes. The victims’ vulnerabilities and associated problems have in the past presented considerable difficulties in mounting substantive criminal prosecutions. CCTV images showing one of the women flirting with one of her victims and planting a kiss on his cheek . 'These ASBOs will give us the ability to closely monitor these individuals’ activities and hopefully prevent many more vulnerable people becoming victims. It will also give us the means to get these individuals quickly before a court for any breaches.' Local Labour Councillor Adrian Lowe said: 'I’m delighted that these women have been given ASBOs. 'They preyed on men who were particularly vulnerable. 'A lot of hard work has been done by our officers working in partnership with the police and other agencies to gather the evidence to achieve this result. 'I would hope that this will give people who feel they’re being exploited the confidence to tell us and not feel embarrassed. If you are a victim of this type of crime, or any type of anti-social behaviour, then please tell someone, it’s the only way we can put a stop to it.' Police said officers gathered a dossier of evidence showing the three women stealing from and offering services to vulnerable members of the community over the past year. It included taking inappropriate sums of money to assist with domestic chores such as shopping. They also offered sexual services for financial rewards. Reeves had previously served three years jail after talked her way into the home of a couple aged 79 and 83 before stealing £740. Emma Reeves (right) arriving at Chorley Magistrates Court.

She was captured on CCTV taking money from one of her victims after giving him a kiss. David Dickinson, 55, whose father Jack, 80, was targeted by the women in another incident said: 'My dad has has Alzheimer’s and now he keeps repeating: ""Have I told you I’ve been robbed?” He has been left upset and confused. 'He keeps saying ""I thought I was safe here"".' Mr Dickinson added: 'I am so angry with these women. They’re just horrible people. Your natural human instinct is to look after vulnerable old people yet these women pretended to care when they didn’t. 'In my dad’s case the woman said she was his carer but when he let her in, he realised straight away that she wasn’t his carer because they have a set routine and this woman wasn’t behaving in a way that the carers usually do. 'She started looking around and asked him if he had any money. God knows what she took. But apparently she was in and out straight away. Even if it was only a couple of quid, the effect it has had is awful. 'Then another time they came to the window and asked for a cigarette so he gave them one and she said 'have you not got anymore? I know you’ve got more.' 'They imposed themselves on him. They were making excuses trying to get into the building. It’s disgusting. They’re preying on the vulnerable. I’m not sure what good an ASBO will do? Some take pride in it, don’t they. They should be in jail.' The orders will remain in place until December 2015.","CCTV captured one of the women flirting and planting a kiss on the cheek one of the victims .

Marie Margaret Sloan is accused of 'a catalogue of misconduct' during her four years as care manager of The Sisters of Loreto's north Wales branch . A foul-mouthed convent nurse referred to frail patients as being a 'pain in the arse' and locked a staff member in a room with a dead body, a panel was told today. Marie Margaret Sloan is accused of 'a catalogue of misconduct' during her four-year spell as care manager of The Sisters of . Loreto's north Wales branch. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) in Cardiff heard Ms Sloan also mistakenly gave a . Sister the wrong tablets and suddenly stopped one elderly woman's . prescription before telling a colleague she had smuggled the . stockpiled drugs into South Africa for her ill brother-in-law. Ms Sloan began working at The Sisters of Loreto in Abbey Road, Llandudno, in 2008, after bosses decided to create a new position for a care manager. The facility is a former boarding school, but is now described as a 'spiritual retreat' and offers residential places for up to 20 Sisters. Finance manager Gareth Maloney said while the facility was not a care home as such, officials expected Ms Sloan to put her previous nursing experience to good use. Explaining her specially-created post, he added: 'In the job specification we wanted someone who was a Level 1 registered nurse. 'Previously when we had agency staff we would have to take residents to the doctors for simple things (such as giving injections or checking their blood pressure).' However, concerns about how capable Ms Sloan was for the job amid claims about the chaotic way she carried out her duties prompted auditors to carry out an inspection in 2012. 'They (the drugs) were in the staff room in a drawer and in some cases on top of the cupboard,' Mr Maloney added. 'There was a long list of tablets and ointments dating back three to four years.' Mr Maloney said Ms Sloan's defence at the time was 'it's a convent not a care home' - remarks which he said he had been 'shocked' by. The NMC panel also heard details of a conversation between Ms Sloan and a staff member regarding a woman known as Patient A. They heard how Ms Sloan took it upon . herself to 'no longer give Patient A a drug' that she was on because it . was making the woman 'fall over and was not doing any good'. Once the drugs had stopped, they continued to be prescribed and a stockpile was built up. The . panel was told: 'The registrant [Ms Sloan] stated she was going to take . the drugs to South Africa for her brother-in-law who had the same . condition as Patient A.' 'Spiritual retreat': Ms Sloan worked at The Sisters of Loreto's branch in Llandudno, north Wales, pictured, which provided residential housing for 20 elderly sisters . A staff member warned Ms Sloan against stock-piling the drugs, saying it 'was drug smuggling' and she 'might get caught'. When care home bosses questioned her about the remarks, Ms Sloan claimed that she had only been joking but appeared agitated when the matter was brought up during a disciplinary. Mr Maloney remarked: 'She was physically in a state of shock. Her actual words were: ""I can see where this is going"". 'At the time I did not know what to believe. She said it was a joke, but then where were the tablets?' Four charges - containing 15 allegations - were read aloud to panel chairwoman Christine Castledine at today's hearing in the NMC's offices in Cathedral Road. As well as claims of failing to manage medication properly, Ms Sloan was accused of failing to provide 'appropriate management'. It said she failed to respond to concerns about 'a member of staff attending work under the influence of alcohol' as well as 'staff threatening violence towards another' and allowing a patient to light candles in her room beneath a wooden shelf. It was also alleged she made . inappropriate comments about her patients, including saying 'they are . all bonkers' and 'I ain't f****** taking that woman again because it's a . pain in the arse'. 'Marie regularly swore and used to call the sisters witches. They were far from that. They were lovely and incredibly sweet old ladies who had dedicated their lives to helping others' Housekeeper Luci Watson . The panel also heard evidence about the sudden collapse of Patient A in the dining room. Housekeeper Luci Watson said when it was discovered the woman had in fact died, the door to the room was locked - despite a cleaner called Maureen still being inside. Mrs Watson said: 'She was locked in the room for quite a long time. Considering she was just the laundry lady with no nursing training that was totally inappropriate. 'I would have been petrified if I had been locked in the room with a dead body. Why did she lock the room? So nobody else could get in I presume.' Mrs Watson also claimed the Ms Sloan was not qualified to do the job, and was only employed because she knew someone else who worked at the convent. She added: 'She had no respect for the sisters at all. They were being totally neglected. And if a member of staff wanted to talk to her in confidence she would open her mouth to the next person and it would be around the home anyway. 'Her office was not used as an office. It was an open room where she was constantly sat on the computer.' Mrs Watson told the panel she regularly found pills and tablets on the floor. 'Obviously the sisters were given them but they weren't taking them,' she said. 'They were put on the table in a plastic cup and just left there. Nobody stood or watched the sisters take their medication.' Mrs Watson said: 'Marie regularly swore and used to call the sisters witches. They were far from that. They were lovely and incredibly sweet old ladies who had dedicated their lives to helping others. 'Considering Marie was a religious person she wasn't a very good Christian.' The panel also heard that the registrant remained as care manager until her dismissal in May 2012. The NMC's four-day hearing is expected to resume tomorrow.","Marie Sloan was care manager of The Sisters of Loreto's north Wales home .

Nigel Phillips, 58, faces being struck off after stuffing paper towels into an elderly dementia patient's mouth at a Bupa care home in Hartlepool . A head nurse who stuffed paper towels into a dementia sufferer’s mouth to make her 'shut up' faces being struck off for life. Nigel Phillips, 58, of Stockton-on-Tees, also bent the elderly woman's fingers back as he treated cuts on her hands at the Bupa care home in Hartlepool, County Durham where he was head of mental nursing. Phillips, who accepted a police caution after admitting carrying out the attack on November 27 last year, said in his defence that he was 'stressed' because of difficult family circumstances. He has now been suspended for 18 months on the grounds of 'public protection' pending an investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) into the incident at the Brierton Lodge home. The 58-bed home charges up to £619 a week and caters for patients with physical disabilities, dementia, elderly patients and those with other mental health issues. A report by the NMC's Conduct and Competence Committee said: 'Mr Phillips was at the time a senior nurse with considerable experience who should have been able to be relied upon to provide proper care to vulnerable patients.' It says: 'It is alleged that while tending to cuts on the fingers of a vulnerable female, elderly resident with dementia, Mr Phillips bent her fingers back and forcefully squeezed her hand, shouted in her face to ""Shut up"", and stuffed paper towel in her mouth. 'Mr Phillips indicated that he recalled shouting but not what he said or that he had shouted in the resident's face.  He acknowledged stuffing the paper towel in the resident's mouth. 'He indicated he had been stressed at the time due to difficult family circumstances.' The case is currently being investigated and Phillips, who did not attend an initial NMC hearing into the case last month, could face being barred from practising as a nurse again if the allegations against him are upheld.

She also planned to donate money raised from the charity head shave - carried out on Saturday - to the Teenage Cancer Trust, as a thank you for helping Georgina’s family throughout her ordeal. It is understood that Mia's mother has ordered a wig but until it arrives her daughter is having to be schooled at home. A Facebook group called 'Let Mia Flood Back into Redcar Academy’ claims that the school class the head shave as an ‘extreme hairstyle’ and she has been forbidden from attending lessons unless she wears a wig. A post on the Facebook page reads: 'Redcar Academy, the school that Mia Flood goes to had said that if Mia was to get her head shaved, she would not be allowed to attend school, because her shaved head is classed as an “extreme hairstyle”.” The post appears to have promoted scores of pupils to stage a protest outside the academy this morning. Cleveland Police have confirmed they arrested a 'young person' at the Academy, on suspicion of a public order offence and he has now been charged. A statement released by the academy and Mia's family said that it had been agreed that arrangements for Mia's education would be made if she went ahead with the shave. It reads: 'It is with great regret that the fund raising event held in memory of Georgina Anderson, raising money for Teenage Cancer Trust has been overshadowed by a distortion of the facts. 'Mia’s parents and Redcar Academy agreed prior to the event held on Saturday 18 January on arrangements for her education, should she choose to have her head shaved. 'At no point did Redcar Academy intend to suspend or exclude Mia from education. 'The Academy has supported fund raising for the Teenage Cancer Trust by hosting events in school, promoting the download of the Georgina Anderson single before Christmas and widely promoting Saturday’s event. 'Mrs Flood confirmed ""this was never about my daughter or Redcar Academy, it was always about raising funds in Georgina’s memory. '""I am saddened that due to exaggeration and inaccuracies in the press that my family and Redcar Academy have received unnecessary attention from the local media”. 'Redcar Academy and the Flood Family would like to thank everyone who has supported them and their fundraising efforts for the Teenage Cancer Trust, in memory of Georgina Anderson.' Georgina, of Marske-on-Sea, died after a four-month battle with a rare and aggressive form of liver cancer. The police were on standby for the strike by pupils at the academy . The talented musician had a lifelong dream of having her music heard around the world but died before her ambition could be realised. However, following her death one of her songs, entitled Two Thirds of a Piece, was released, drawing praise from Simon Cowell. At first medics thought Georgina might have been suffering from gall stones but found she had an extremely rare and aggressive form of cancer. She underwent chemotherapy but the disease spread to her lungs and doctors later gave her and her family the news that there was nothing more they could do. Georgina passed away in November last year, leaving her parents Paul and Helen, devastated. Facebook users have written on Facebook of the school’s decision to ban the teenager from lessons. One posted: 'Takes a lot of courage to do that and for a secondary school not to support her is shocking. 'She’s done it for a good cause not because she fancied a different hairstyle.' Another added: 'Get a petition up for all the pupils and parents to sign to let Mia back in school, Redcar academy should be ashamed x' Another added: 'Well done very courageous. The whole school should shave their heads...'","Mia Flood, 14, vowed to shave head when Georgina Anderson, 15, died .

Jailed: Spartakas Grachauskas, who once tried to steal an IRA bomb memorial, has been jailed for money laundering after taking part in an online scam . A career criminal who once tried to steal a memorial to child IRA bomb victims to sell for scrap metal has been jailed for his part in an online scam involving discounted 'Olimpic Cameras'. Lithuanian Spartakas Grachauskas, 27, was part of a gang who conned customers into paying for cheap cameras they never received. The gang advertised discounted . cameras, via websites called Olimpic Cameras,Technologies Shop, and . Lions Tech, but the online shops were set up so that card payments would deliberately fail. Customers were then asked to make a bank transfer and the money was taken without the goods being provided to the customer. Grachauskas has now been sentenced to 11 months . imprisonment for money laundering, and one month for breaching bail . conditions at Chester Crown Court. In May 2012, Grachauskas was sentenced to . 18 weeks by Manchester Magistrates’ Court after attempting to steal a . plaque that forms part of the River Of Life memorial in Warrington to 12-year-old . Tim Parry, and Johnathan Ball, aged three, who died in the . February 1993 explosion. He was caught in the act trying to prise off part of the River of Life water feature, on Bridge Street, Warrington, to sell as scrap metal. Grachauskas has six previous convictions for eight offences in England, including a 10-month custodial sentence for burglary, and four previous convictions in Lithuania. In sentencing the gang members earlier this month, Judge Roger Dutton said the group had tried to lie their way out of trouble. He said: 'Each of you came to the UK, . it seems from the evidence heard, none of you can speak a word of the . language and are reliant on family. Scam: The gang advertised discounted cameras, via websites called Olimpic Cameras,Technologies Shop, and Lions Tech, but the online shops were set up so that card payments would deliberately fail . 'However, you knew what bank accounts to get, and how to play your part. The air of innocence you portrayed to the jury was clearly a facade. Each of you knew precisely what was going on. 'You were telling a cock and bull story that had probably been fed to you by those running this. The sad fact in this is that none of you realised how ridiculous those accounts were. Grachauskas, of Orford, Warrington, allowed his own bank account to be used to launder  £4,307 from the illegal operation, the court heard. Three other defendants - Lilija Gincman, 53, of Orford, Rita Jablonskaite, 37, from Stoke, and Aleksas Bagdonavicius, 52, from Crewe - . were also found guilty of money laundering after they allowed their . personal bank accounts to be used and were each given a one year prison . sentence. Judge Dutton . said that in making their bank accounts available the Lithuanian . nationals had allowed criminals to rip off residents ‘at arm’s length’. Gang: Alexsas Bagdonavicius, 52, and Rita Jablonskaite, 37, were also convicted of money laundering . Father-of-one . Grachauskas was not present for the trial in December, but admitted . money laundering at what Judge Dutton called the ‘eleventh and three . quarter hour’. Lucy O’Gara, defending, said he failed to appear as he did not have money for transport. 'He was worried about supporting his family so he allowed his bank account to be used,' said Ms O’Gara. Involvement: Judge Dutton said there was evidence to suggest  Lilija Gincman was more deeply involved in the fraud, with police finding a diary of passwords, contacts and account details at her home . 'He says he was not aware of the larger scale of the operation.' The . court heard criminals behind the online fraud, that operated from June . 5 to December 1, 2012, are probably based in Lithuania and have . not been caught. Customers across Europe were conned with victims reported in Greece, Germany, France and Italy. Gincman, a full time carer for her family who has no previous convictions, laundered £16,695. Judge . Dutton said there was evidence to suggest she was more deeply involved . in the fraud, with police finding a diary of passwords, contacts and . account details at her home. The court accepted the defendants had been targeted by more ‘criminally sophisticated’ fraudsters. Jablonskaite . moved to the UK to work in a car wash in Crewe, but was made redundant, . while Bagdonavicius works in a tomato plant in Middlewich, the court . heard. Judge Dutton said: 'It’s often said the internet has changed our lives immensely over the years. 'What . it has also done is open up opportunities for unscrupulous criminals to . exploit unsuspecting members of the public at arm’s length, who send . money off to websites in the trusting expectation they will receive the . goods which they have paid for. Memorial: In May 2012, Grachauskas was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison after he attempted to steal a plaque that forms part of the River Of Life memorial in Warrington . Victims: Johnathan Ball, three, (left) and 12-year-old Tim Parry were killed in the explosion in February 1993 . 'In order to operate a criminal scam of this kind it requires criminals who are prepared to allow existing bank accounts to be used for money from the unsuspecting public to be channelled into these accounts and then, within days, the cash withdrawn and funnelled back to the criminal enterprise.

Usually when thieves are caught carrying out their crimes, they are said to be caught red handed, but not this adventurous pickpocket in China. Instead of using his fingers to grab this man's smartphone from his pocket, he is instead filmed using a pair of chopsticks. But unfortunately for him his skills don't seem to be up to the task as he quickly drops the mobile, causing the unsuspecting victim to turn around and foil the crime. Scroll down for video . A man has been caught trying to steal a phone from another man's pocket using chopsticks in China . The video starts with the thief (in black) and the victim (in grey) lounging around on a street corner . As the victim moves towards the wall the criminal moves around behind him and tries to grab his phone . In the short clip the criminal makes several attempts to take the mobile from the man, at first crouching down behind him in order to get into the right pocket of his hoodie. As the unsuspecting victims moves to lean on a wall the pickpocket has no choice but to follow beside him. He is nearly discovered when the victim moves his arm and almost touches the thief's hand. Undeterred the man keeps tugging at the phone, but is forced to abandon the attempt after the phone owner turns his head, hiding the sticks under a hat he is carrying to avoid detection and leaving the mobile hanging tantalisingly out of reach. But he is soon back at it, and after a few more pulls he manages to get the mobile in his grasp, and tries to quickly put it into the hat to avoid getting fingerprints on it. As the phone owner moves to the right of the picture the thief follows him with the sticks in his pocket . The thief risks detection with his determined efforts to take the man's mobile away from him . He eventually manages to get the handset, but while trying to slip it into this hat he drops it . But he tries to do it too quickly, and at the last second drops the handset on to the floor, causing a noise which the victim obviously hears as he suddenly turns around. For a moment the two men stand frozen, as the victim can hardly believe he is looking at his own phone on the floor. The less-than-master thief pats down his pockets, perhaps trying to pretend that the phone is his, before walking away once the victim has gone in for a closer look. As the mobile falls to the floor the criminal pats his pockets, as if tying to pretend it was his phone . It is not the first time a chopstick thief has been caught picking pockets in the country. Back in April last year Wang Hongbo, 32, was snapped lifting the phone from a woman’s pocket as she cycled through Zhengzhou, the capital of central China’s Henan province. Photographs show him running after the unsuspecting cyclist along a busy road. The pictures were posted online and after national news coverage, Hongbo handed himself in to the police.","A man has been caught using chopsticks to pickpocket people in China .

Karl Winkler, 50, built the house for his children Beatrice,11, Boris, nine and Claude, five,  to spend their summers at the home in Viewforth, Edinburgh. Sarah Winkler with children Beatrice, 11, and Claude, 5. The family have been ordered to tear down the tree house which was erected in their back garden because it doesn't have planning permission . But despite applying for retrospective planning permission, the family were turned down, and are now launching their fourth appeal to keep the building. They have been appointed an independent adjudicator by the Scottish government, who could override the council's decision not to allow the Winklers to keep the structure. Mr Winkler, a project manager, said Edinburgh City Council officers were tipped off by a neighbour. He said: 'If someone builds something that’s really ugly, the rules allow you to do something about it.'But this is a kiddies’ playhouse - the council are using the regulations in the wrong way. 'There’s a small balcony the kids use in the summer which the council said invades the neighbours’ privacy, even though it faces away from them.' The wooden structure, which cost £1,000 in materials to build, has been deemed 'too close' to the edge of the garden for its height, invading nearby residents’ privacy. But Mr Winkler said none of his neighbours - who he said had been supportive of the treehouse - had made any complaints. He said: 'There’s a small balcony the kids use in the summer which the council said invades the neighbours’ privacy, even though it faces away from them. 'I hold my hands up and admit it does breach the planning rules but to me the council are being unreasonable and heavy handed about this.

'I could maybe take the stilts off, but it defeats the purpose of it being a treehouse.' A decision on whether to allow the Winklers to keep the treehouse will be made by the Scottish government’s Directorate of Planning and Environment. Mr Winkler and wife Sarah have now enlisted the help of demolition experts to see if the structure can be moved from the edge of the garden in a last-ditch attempt to save it from the chop. A council spokeswoman said: 'The planning application was refused on the grounds it is inappropriate in a built-up area, causing issues with privacy for neighbouring gardens. 'This was then considered by the local review body, enforcement notice has been served and an appeal lodged with the Scottish Government.' In 2012, Harry Potter author JK Rowling won a battle to build two Hogwarts-style tree houses in the garden of her Cramond home, despite protests from residents who said they would blight the appearance of the surrounding conservation area.

Anne Hidalgo, who until recently was President Francois Hollande's Socialist culture minister . A leading French politician described London as a ‘suburb of Paris’ today as the two cities continued a war of words over which is the most popular in the world. Anne Hidalgo, who until recently was President Francois Hollande’s Socialist culture minister before running for mayor of the French capital, said there was more crime in the English capital, less entrepreneurial businesses starting up, and fewer foreign visitors. But she did concede that there was more dog waste on Paris pavements, and that notoriously rude Parisians 'should be kinder'. UK-based tourist agency Visit Britain claimed London broke the 16-million visitor bar last year, with Paris attracting 15.9 million people. But in an angry riposte, Paris city hall put out a statement today saying the figures were utterly misleading. ‘So at this stage Paris remains the top tourist destination in the world,’ said a statement for the city hall. Ms Hidalgo said: ‘Competition between the two giant metropolises is all well and good but we have to stick to the truth. ‘The figures show that Paris is still above London as the most visited city in the world’, adding:‘Paris is safer than London, where there is four times as much crime. Paris is also safer than New York if you compare crime data.’ Responding to reports of the masses of Roma gypsy gangs preying on tourists in Paris, Ms Hidalgo said: ‘Yes, there is a lot of talk about tourists in Paris being targeted and we need to deal with that. ‘That’s why we are working with the museums, the police , the transport authorities and the tourist office. Hidalgo said there was more crime in the English capital, less entrepreneurial businesses starting up, and fewer foreign visitors . ‘There are organized gangs of Eastern European criminals working here. We have to deal with this problem, but they also operate in other cities like Madrid and Brussels.’ Ms Hidalgo, 54, who was speaking to members of the Anglo-American Press Association of Paris, said 'London is in some ways a suburb of Paris'. She said that there were too many giant retail corporations in London. ‘Shopping streets in Paris work when there’s a variety of different types of shops,’ she said. ‘This is what attracts customers and I will not change this culture just so we can have giant stores opening like in London.’ Bizarrely, she also claimed: ‘Paris has more shops open on a Sunday than London. In London it is all big commercial centres but in Paris there is a network of small independent stores that are open. We want to protect these local stores; this is the identity of Paris. It’s our strength.’ She also claimed: 'Paris has more shops open on a Sunday than London. In London it is all big commercial centres but in Paris there is a network of small independent stores that are open' Londoners may not like to hear this, but there may be some truth in Hidalgo's pronouncement about Paris's crime figures being lower than the UK's capital. At least where assaults are concerned. According to the Metropolitan Police's website, there were 148,088 acts of violence against a person reported to the police in London in 2013. Meanwhile, according to the most recent statistics available for Paris, recorded in 2011, there were just 35,000 assaults reported. They are statistics for different years, but it's not likely Paris's assault rate has changed dramatically in two years. However, when the population figures are taken into account, the difference narrows significantly. Paris has a population of 2.2million, meaning there are 16 assaults per 1,000 people. But London has a population of eight million, meaning there are 18 assaults per 1,000 people. In fact strict Sunday trading laws still exist in Paris, while almost all shops are open in London. And when it came to arguing that Paris was indeed a business-friendly city, Hidalgo again chose to compare it to London. Ms Hidalgo, who was born in Spain, also said: ‘Paris is ahead of London in terms of the creation of start-ups. We will soon be home to the biggest start-up hub in the world. ‘Yes French people go abroad to live and to work, but they come back, because of the public services that France can offer. Just like the creches, for example. These are services of high quality that cost less than in London.’ Ms Hidalgo did concede, however, that there was more dog mess in Paris, saying: ‘It annoys me too. It’s unacceptable.’ And she said that notoriously rude Parisians could ‘be a little kinder’ to each other in the street so as not to upset tourists. Visit Britain’s 16 million figure was actually a projection based on visitor numbers for the first nine months of 2012, said Paris city hall. In contrast, the 15.9 million figure for Paris was for the same period in 2012, with the exact number for 2013 not yet finalised. In fact, say the Parisians, there were 29 million visitors to Paris in the whole of 2012, and 27.6 million to London. As the war of words threatened to turn into a full scale diplomatic dispute, the British pointed to recent reports which highlighted how Paris was falling behind the times. A survey in 2013 revealed how London had stolen the ‘World’s Best City’ title from Paris, with the authors describing how ‘It should be a warning sign to all stakeholders of Paris.’ The office of London Mayor put the city’s success in attracting millions of visitors in 2013 down to the ‘Olympic effect’ following the  2012 games. ‘The image of London has changed because of the Olympics,’ said Kit Malthouse, deputy mayor. ‘People saw a beautiful city, open and vibrant and not just the usual cliches about Beefeaters and the Queen.’","Comments were made by Anne Hidalgo, who until recently was President Francois Hollande’s Socialist culture minister .

Polite society: Mr Selfridge star Jeremy Piven has put the success of period dramas down to viewers hankering for a simpler life before mobile phones and the internet . The star of popular ITV series Mr Selfridge has put the success of period dramas down to viewers hankering for a simpler life before mobile phones and the internet. Actor Jeremy Piven, who plays American entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge in the hit show, says audiences enjoy the programme, and others such as Downton Abbey or Call The Midwife, because they depict life before text messaging and the availability of electronic gadgets. Mr Selfridge, which returned last night for a second series set on the eve of the First World War, portrays a society where customers are greeted by name as they walk into the famous department store, and men still stand when a woman enters the room. The show is set at a time when Londoners still relied on telephone, telegraph, radio and even carrier pigeon, to converse. ‘It’s just a simpler time when people really had to . communicate with each other and they could not hide behind text messages . or email,’ Mr Piven told The Lady magazine. ‘Maybe we’re all longing for that.' Three-time Emmy winner Mr . Piven also told the magazine that viewers more used to wearing . tracksuits than top hats and tails, enjoy seeing the pristine outfits . put together by the characters as they hit Selfridges to stock up on . intricate feathered hats and gloves. In last night's programme Mr Selfridge, despite being something of a serial womaniser himself, was seen chastising new arrival Lord Loxley for not behaving like a 'gentleman' towards his wife Lady Mae. 'Everyone . put so much time into their appearance then, too. People now are a lot . more casual,' said Mr Piven, who found global fame playing foul-mouthed Hollywood agent Ari Gold in HBO series Entourage. Return: Mr Selfridge, which returned last night for a second series set on the eve of the First World War, portrays a society where customers are greeted by name as they walk into the famous department store . ‘Also, I think, Harry really believed in putting on a . show, and that exists in Selfridges to this day. It doesn’t necessarily . apply everywhere, and that’s too bad.’ Mr Selfridge has proved a hit with viewers, with nine million viewers tuning in for the first episode of series one, while more than 11 miilion are hooked on Downton Abbey. Creator Julian Fellowes, whose show is set between 1912 and 1923, backed up Mr Piven's observations about the programmes harking back to a simpler time.

The 64-year-old has previously lamented the lost manners of a bygone age where 'most men would stand when a woman walked into a room', according to The Times. 'I do agree that there does seem to be an appeal from an apparently simpler and more straightforward lost world,' he said. However, Lord Fellowes added that the era depicted in Downton Abbey was also blighted by high levels of infant mortality, poor living conditions for many people, and limited medical resources - as well as the First World War, in which nearly a million Britons lost their lives. He suggested that going back in time via a television show is a 'safer option'.","Jeremy Piven says viewers enjoy shows which depict a 'simpler time'

Thief in the night: This CCTV shows John Howlett carrying £5,000 of bridal gowns he stole from Victoria Bridal shop in Swansea, which he then took home and passed out on . On the run: Howlett, who had been drinking and taking drugs, claimed that he had no memory of the crime, forcing police to show him the CCTV . Howlett managed to stagger a mile-and-a-half-home and make it up to bed before passing out on top of the dresses.

Probation officer Nicola Thomas told the court: 'He had been drinking and woke up surrounded by wedding dresses. 'He says he cannot remember anything about the burglary.' Howlett panicked and stuffed the dresses into a cupboard under the stairs at his home in Swansea, South Wales. A court heard how they were still there when police tracked him down from the CCTV film - and arrested him. Bemused Howlett admitted taking the dresses after being shown footage of his drunken spree. Magistrates heard Howlett had broken into Victoria's Bridal in the centre of Swansea after midnight and was caught on the shop's CCTV. Miss Jones said: 'One of the dresses belonged to a bride whose wedding was just days away. 'She had been forced to get another gown at short notice.' The father-of-one appeared at the city's magistrates court where he admitted burglary following the raid in November last year. Howlett, from Townhill, Swansea, also pleaded guilty to separate count of fraud after writing blank cheques totalling £1,320 to pay gambling debts. Sentencing was adjourned by Swansea magistrates until later this month for reports. Howlett was granted bail and given a night time curfew told to stay away from shops in Swansea city centre.

Skulls discovered within the boundaries of ancient London a quarter of a century ago are now believed to be those of gladiators, brutally killed for the amusement of Roman audiences. The haul of 39 skulls, discovered beneath the site of the Guildhall in the City of London, were discovered in 1988 and were believed to have originated from human remains washed out of burial sites by the Walbrook, one of the area’s lost rivers. But now after 25 years in storage, the remains have been re-examined by an historian from the Museum of London, who believes they are the first evidence of gladiators in London. Skulls discovered within the boundaries of ancient London a quarter of a century ago are now believed to be those belonging to gladiators, brutally killed for the amusement of Roman audiences. This skull shows sharp force injuries . Studies have revealed that most of the skulls show signs of injury before death  - despite them dying during peace time. Rebecca Redfern, of the museum's Centre for Human Bioarchaeology, now believes that the skulls are either the result of sacrificial headhunting, or the remains of gladiators, killed for sport. Some of the heads had been decapitated and one of the haul had part of its jawbone sliced off - almost all had been the victims of violence - The Independent reports. 'The level of violence here exceeds the level needed to kill someone', Dr Redfern said, adding that they showed 'lethal, multiple blows to the head' alongside healed injuries consistent with a brutal life. The full findings of her research will be published this week in the Journal of Archaeological Science. The skulls were discovered in a pit beneath what is now a Waterstones bookshop - at 52 - 63 London Wall - which was excavated in 1988.

She said: 'It’s utterly, utterly amazing. We don’t have evidence for this type of thing in Roman London. She added: 'There is no primary source evidence for gladiators in London... There is a gladiator tombstone, but we think it was brought to Britain (from Europe no earlier than the 17th century). The Times reports that the remains were thrown into the pits between 120 and 160 AD - which was peace time in Roman Britain. Dr Redfern said the bones were not supposed to have been in the pits at all as this was within the walls of the City - where corpses were not supposed to have been buried.

A powerful alliance of Syrian Islamist rebels today rejected upcoming peace talks as activists claimed Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad's forces carried out another air strike in Aleppo. Shocking images of the aftermath of the alleged attack on the city today show residents hunting for survivors in the rubble of building brought to the ground in the blast. It is not yet known how many fatal casualties were caused by the strike in the Al-Ansari neighborhood of Aleppo.

Casualties: A body is extracted from rubble in Aleppo as people search for survivors after a building collapsed  during an airstrike on the northern Syrian city . It comes some rebels leaders refused to co-operate in upcoming peace talks, meaning that any breakthrough in the three year old civil war will be harder to implement it on the ground. Syria's main political opposition group in exile, the National Coalition, agreed on Saturday to attend the talks beginning on Wednesday in Geneva, setting up the first meeting between President Bashar al-Assad's government and its foes. But the Islamic Front, an alliance of several Islamist fighting forces that represents a large portion of the rebels on the ground, said it rejected the talks today. Syria's future would be 'formulated here on the ground of heroism, and signed with blood on the front lines, not in hollow conferences attended by those who don't even represent themselves,' Abu Omar, a leading member of the Islamic Front, said on his Twitter account. Some 130,000 people have been killed and a quarter of Syrians driven from their homes in the civil war, which began with peaceful protests against 40 years of Assad family rule and has descended into a sectarian conflict, with the opposing sides armed and funded by Sunni Arab states and Shi'ite Iran.

A resident holds on to a child who survived shelling in the air attack as they flee the area . In what appeared to be a symbolic conciliatory move ahead of the talks, Syria permitted some aid to reach a besieged suburb of Damascus on Saturday and Sunday, state media said. Saturday's shipment included only 200 food parcels for Yarmouk, a camp of Palestinian refugees where 15 people have died of malnutrition so far under a seven-month siege. U.N. Relief Works Agency spokesman Chris Gunness said it would feed just 330 of the camp's 18,000 residents for a month. It was not immediately clear how much aid made it through today. Cold War foes Moscow and Washington, which have emerged as the leading pro- and anti-Assad powers, have urged both parties to make concessions, including ceasefires, access for aid and prisoner exchanges, to build confidence before the conference. Russian news agency Itar-Tass cited Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov as saying that the opposition Coalition had made 'a correct decision' in agreeing to attend. 'We have been saying the entire time that it is necessary to go to the forum and enter into dialogue with the government.' There has been little sign of violence abating in Aleppo the government claiming plans for a truce are underway . Dust from collapsed buildings made it difficult for residents to see more than a few feet in front of them during the strike . Activists claim President Bashar Al-Assad's forces are using inaccurate 'barrel bombs' in their strikes which can cause entire apartment blocks to collapse . Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, on a visit to Moscow this month, said he had given Russian officials a plan for a truce in Aleppo, Syria's biggest city, and said the government was ready to swap lists of prisoners to be freed. But there is little sign of violence abating or of either side winning a final victory on the battlefield. Activists around the country, from the capital to Aleppo to the eastern province of Deir al-Zor on the border with Iraq, said that the Syrian air force was using jets and helicopters to bomb rebel-held areas. Rebel fighters from Syria's Qalamoun mountain range, near the border with Lebanon, said more than 60 opposition militants had been killed in an ambush by forces loyal to Assad on Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an anti-Assad monitoring group, said that helicopters over Aleppo were using crudely-made and inaccurate 'barrel bombs', which can collapse entire apartment blocks.

Death tolls on such a scale have become almost routine as fighting has intensified in the past year. After two years when Western countries believed Assad's days were numbered and rebels seized whole swathes of the country, the past year has seen the war largely go the president's way. Rebels have fought each other, with groups turning against a powerful al Qaeda-linked Islamist faction. Assad's forces have recovered lost ground, and the rise of Islamists among the rebels has cost them Western support. A last-minute decision by Washington in September to scrap plans for strikes to punish Assad for using chemical arms effectively ended more than two years of speculation that the West might join the war against Assad, as it did in 2011 against Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Sunday that Assad had told Russian lawmakers he would not yield power. Syrian state media denied the quotes as 'not accurate', however. It was not immediately clear why Damascus would object to a Russian agency reporting the president's defiant line. State media said later on Sunday that Assad had met Russian religious leaders and parliamentarians and called for an international effort to fight 'terrorists', the label Damascus uses for the armed opposition.

A swell shark is pictured . Its findings could lead to the discovery of new fluorescent proteins that could be used in biomedical research, according to the study, which was published in the journal Plos One. 'We’ve long known about biofluorescence underwater in organisms like corals, jellyfish, and even in land animals like butterflies and parrots, but fish biofluorescence has been reported in only a few research publications,' said co-lead author John Sparks, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History’s Department of Ichthyology. Researchers from the museum explained that fish live in a world that is predominantly blue because with depth, water quickly absorbs the majority of the visible light spectrum. In recent years they have discovered that many fish absorb the remaining blue light and re-emit it in neon greens, reds, and oranges.

The researchers’ investigations into fish biofluorescence began because they came across a show of green eel fluorescence off of Little Cayman Island while imaging coral biofluorescence for a museum exhibit. To explore the phenomenon further, they were joined by scientists from three universities and photographers to capture images of fish in the waters of the Exumas in the Bahamas and the Solomon Islands. They dived by night and stimulated biofluorescence in the fish with high-intensity blue light arrays housed in watertight cases. The resulting underwater light show was invisible to the human eye. The researchers¿ investigations into fish biofluorescence began because the researchers came across a show of green eel fluorescence  (pictured) off of Little Cayman Island while imaging coral biofluorescence for a museum exhibit. A glowing ray is pictured left . To record the show, the researchers used underwater cameras with yellow filters, which block out the blue light. Their expeditions revealed a zoo of biofluorescent fish from sharks and rays to bony eels, especially those that were patterned and well camouflaged living in coral reefs. The team discovered that many biofluorescent fish have yellow filters in their eyes, possibly allowing them to see the otherwise hidden fluorescent displays taking place in the water. Although more research is needed, this finding indicates that biofluorescence could be used for interspecific communication while remaining camouflaged to predators. This ability might be especially important during full moons, when fish have been shown to partake in mating rituals. ‘The cryptically patterned gobies, flatfishes, eels, and scorpionfishes - these are animals that you’d never normally see during a dive,’ Dr Sparks said. The scientists' expeditions revealed a zoo of biofluorescent fishes from sharks and rays to bony eels, especially those that were patterned and well camouflaged living in coral reefs. A frogfish (f), stonefish (g), surgeonfish (n) and threadfin bream (o) are pictured . ‘To our eyes, they blend right into their environment. But to a fish that has a yellow intraocular filter, they must stick out like a sore thumb.’ Further study on the mechanics of the glowing fish could uncover new florescent proteins for use in experimental biology. ‘The discovery of green fluorescent protein in a hydrozoan jellyfish in the 1960s has provided a revolutionary tool for modern biologists, transforming our study of everything from the AIDS virus to the workings of the brain,’ Dr Gruber said. ‘This study suggests that fish biofluorescence might be another rich reservoir of new fluorescent proteins,’ he added.","Biofluorescence could be used for communication within species while remaining camouflaged to predators .

She applied to the NHS for £2,000 treatment to improve the appearance of her patchy hair three times but was denied it each time. Samantha Green, 29, had hair replacement therapy after it was offered to her free of charge by Lucinda Ellery, a hair loss expert, who read about Ms Green on MailOnline . Ms Green (pictured left before her hair loss) developed alopecia (right) after two battles with leukaemia. She applied to have hair replacement therapy on the NHS but was refused the treatment three times on the basis her case was not 'exceptional' But when MailOnline covered her story in December, hair loss expert Lucinda Ellery offered to give Ms Green the treatment free of charge. After having the therapy last week, Ms Green, who has an eight-year-old daughter,  is now delighted with her thick head of hair. She told MailOnline: ‘I'm really pleased with it – it feels like part of me already. It’s amazing. ‘When I got the call to say Lucinda Ellery had offered to do it I was speechless. I got quite emotional. I didn’t know what to do – I was shocked.’ Ms Green (pictured during her hair replacement therapy) said: 'I was gobsmacked watching them do it. I was really nervous and excited and they were so lovely and friendly - they made me feel really comfortable' Designed for women with moderate to severe hair loss or thinning, this is a hair replacement prosthesis. It . is constructed from a breathable mesh and integrated into the existing . hair, without the need to cut or shave off any natural hair. It . can be an effective way of managing both the later stages of hair loss . and the short hair re-growth when treatment has finished. To begin with, the mesh is gently placed between the existing hair and the scalp. Panels, made of ultra-fine mesh containing additional human hair, are then added to it to completely disguise any hair loss. To complete the look a parting is also added to the crown section. It allows the person to take part in sports, including swimming, without worrying about their hair. The hair can also be washed, brushed and styled as normal. The hair needs to be maintained every six to eight weeks. An initial consultation costs £55 and the treatment starts from £895. For more information, visit www.lucindaellery-hairloss.co.uk . She added: ‘My daughter Madison loves it – the first thing she did was start plaiting it. ‘I just want to say thank you to you for publishing it and to Lucinda Ellery – it wouldn’t have happened otherwise.’ Ms Green, an administration worker who was training to be a nurse until she was taken ill, was first diagnosed with leukaemia in August 2005. She underwent two rounds of chemotherapy and had a bone marrow transplant. After this, her hair grew back fine. However, she relapsed in 2010 and had another two bouts of chemotherapy and another bone marrow transplant. This . time she was treated with Busulfan which she thinks caused the . alopecia, but it was the only treatment available to her at the time. As . a result, she has applied repeatedly for hair replacement therapy on . the NHS but The Central Midlands Commissioning Support Unit, which . advises on NHS spending, decided her case was not exceptional. Ms Green says the verdict crushed her remaining confidence. 'Hair makes a woman feel feminine,' she said. 'A lady who had a double mastectomy would not be refused a . breast reconstruction. 'Yet someone who suffered alopecia due to intense . chemotherapy is classed differently.’ When . MailOnline ran Ms Green’s story in December, it was greeted with . outrage from readers who felt the mother had been treated unfairly. The day . after the story was published, we were contacted by Lucinda Ellery, a . hair loss expert who runs hair loss and extension studios across the country. She offered to give Ms Green the treatment for free. The hair replacement therapy, called the Intralace system, lasts two years. It works by fitting a mesh . over any area with little or no hair, pulling the existing hair through . the mesh and plaiting tiny wefts of fine real hair to it. Unlike normal hair extensions, it doesn't place stress on the remaining strands. Ms Green, from Wolverhampton, travelled to London for the treatment which took a whole day. She . said: ‘I was gobsmacked watching them do it. I was really nervous and . excited but they were so lovely and friendly. They made me feel really . comfortable.’ Ms Green (pictured before the hair replacement therapy) hated wearing a wig as she found it hot and itchy and she worried that people were staring at her and wondering if she was wearing a wig . Ms Green (pictured with her daughter, Madison, before her hair loss) said: 'My daughter loves it - the first thing she did was start plaiting it' Ms Green says she is delighted to be able to leave behind the wig she has been wearing for three years. She . said: ‘I won’t have to think about the hot, itchy wig any more. The . hair will make me much more confident as I won’t worry that people are . looking at me and wondering if I am wearing a wig.’ Ms Green says she is now looking forward to celebrating her 30th birthday next month with her new hairdo. Dr Dan De Rosa, chairman of Wolverhampton Clinical Commissioning Group, which spends almost £1m a day on the city’s healthcare, said at the time Ms Green was refused NHS help: 'The decision in this case was made following detailed assessment by a panel of clinicians who took into account a wide range of factors. 'In general, we need to prioritise limited funding based on the needs of the local population and we do this as fairly and equitably as possible.' When .

A WIFE accused of living a life of luxury on the proceeds of her husband’s criminal empire has insisted she paid for everything herself – with her state benefits. Jobless mother-of-four Lisa Lowndes took at least two luxury holidays every year and drove a fleet of high-performance cars. But the 38-year-old claimed in court that she funded it all with a generous package of state handouts. Lisa Lowndes, right, who claimed state benefits footed the bill for her lavish lifestyle when denying charges she profited from her husband (pictured) Colin's motoring scam . Flashy: Colin Lowndes pictured in his Porsche Boxster, one of the luxury cars he was able to drive using illegally obtained money which his wife also benefited from . The court heard that she received welfare payments of almost £18,000 a year over four years, adding up to some £72,000 of taxpayers’ cash. In that time, she enjoyed ten five-star holidays, including a £3,000 break in Alicante, a £2,700 getaway to Zante and a £2,400 trip to Egypt. While away on her trips she would cruise around in rented top-of-the-range vehicles, including a £70,000 Porsche Cayenne. But detectives found Lowndes was actually funding her lifestyle with the ill-gotten gains of her husband’s fraud, and she was convicted of 11 offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act . Her husband Colin, 41, masterminded Britain’s biggest motoring scam, in which he charged drivers up to £400 a time to dodge speeding points. Earlier this year he was sentenced to seven years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and 30 charges of fraud. In 2002, the serial conman was behind a £450,000 scam to illegally obtain goods from catalogues by rifling through bins for discarded credit card slips and then quoting the card numbers and expiry dates to place telephone orders. In 1999, Lowndes had used the same trick to buy jewellery worth up to £250,000 from Sky Television’s QVC shopping channel. Despite living in a terrace house on a council estate in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, Lowndes would be seen cruising around in a £120,000 Bentley Continental, a £115,000 red Ferrari Spider and a £67,000 Range Rover Sport. At Manchester Crown Court his wife denied charges of living off the proceeds of crime, claiming her lifestyle was financed entirely by her state benefits. Mrs Lowndes said she had pocketed so much money because of her state benefits, after her husband, pictured in his Range Rover, was jailed for Britain's biggest motoring scam . Cruising: Mr Lowndes in his Bentley which he could afford due to his motoring scam . Whilst on Mrs Lowndes' jaunts she would cruise around in a fleet of vented vehicles. Picture is her husband in a red Ferarri . But Judge Roger Thomas QC told her: ‘You were leading a cosy lifestyle to put it at its least – you were running a car and there were umpteen holidays. Your family were a good deal better off than many other families I come across, and you made great play to the jury as to how generous state benefits were in your direction. ‘Unpaid work seems a just punishment because honest work is something you have done  very little of.’ He sentenced her to 180 hours  of unpaid work and 12 months in prison suspended for two years. He imposed a six-month curfew, but spared her from jail because of the detrimental effect it would have on the couple’s four children.

Police Constable Vaughan Davies, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘Neither Colin nor Lisa had any source of legitimate income yet lived the kind of lifestyle many others can only dream of. ‘We found no evidence of Lisa having worked a day in her life and while many decent hardworking people have been feeling the pinch and are struggling to make ends meet, she was living it up, enjoying sun-drenched holidays a number of times a year.’ Her brother Lee Derek Foster, 40, of Hyde, was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and was jailed for 18 months. The couple could afford ten foreign holidays in just four years .

Jailed: Cynical con artist David Bowerman, 35, from Chelmsford, Essex,  swindled up to £7.5 million from investors including terminally ill cancer patients through a massive Ponzi scheme . A cynical con artist who swindled up to £7.5 million from investors including terminally ill cancer patients through a massive Ponzi scheme has been jailed. David Bowerman, 35, from Chelmsford, Essex, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle as he blew a fortune on fast cars, luxury holidays and a toxic gambling habit after investors pumped millions of pounds into his bogus scheme. More than 250 people were taken in by the intricate con including Manchester City ace Richard Wright, 35, who handed over £400,000. Bowerman blew investors' cash on three Caribbean cruises and a whole host of flashy cars including a £38k Audi sports car, a BMW and an Aston Martin. The charismatic con man - who was seen lighting cigarettes with a £50 note - even stole £36,500 from his own mother, Cynthia Bowerman, to fund his affluent lifestyle. He eventually handed himself in to police in August 2010 as his debts mounted and demands for repayment from frustrated investors became unbearable. Bowerman did not react as he was sentenced to eight years in prison at Chelmsford Crown Court today. The former investment advisor wore a grey suit and stared emotionlessly from the dock as the court heard a harrowing list of his many victims. The list included two terminally ill cancer sufferers who invested in the scheme in the hope of leaving their loved ones with money after they died. Other victims lost their life savings or pension pots they had worked for years to amass resulting in problems with stress, depression and suicidal thoughts. The court heard it is unlikely any investor in the scheme will ever be refunded. Judge Charles Gratwicke said: 'You acted in a totally wicked, disgraceful and cynical manner without any regard for the effects of your dishonesty on those who trusted you. 'Over the five-year period you quite clearly engaged in multiple acts of dishonesty obtaining something in the region of £7.5m. 'There must clearly be a substantial prison sentence to reflect the effect it had on your victims.' The Ponzi scheme worked by offering existing investors money from new investors to give the impression of a profit-making business. Duped: More than 250 people were taken in by the intricate con including Manchester City ace Richard Wright, 35, who handed over £400,000. The goalkeeper is seen here playing for Everton . Bowerman began in early 2005 by selling fake bonds and offering loans under the pretence his experience as an FSA-approved financial advisor would help boost their credit rating. Records show that the charismatic crook blew vast amounts of his investors' cash with unsuccessful betting sprees at online websites such as www.bet365.com. Ironically - despite his woeful record with online betting - Bowerman then set up an online bookmaker called Shearer Hare and encouraged friends and family to invest heavily in it - using the funds to give the impression of a profit-making business. The business generated £4.85m but £3.8m soon disappeared through online betting by Bowerman with an unknown amount being blown on his increasingly lavish lifestyle. Antony Swift, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant systematically and cynically defrauded family, friends and acquaintances out of large sums of money. 'The total sum is in excess of £7 million. 'He raised funds in order to feed an insatiable gambling habit. 'It was characteristic of the defendant's offending that he would keep going back to get as much as he could off his victims.' The court heard that nearing the end of Bowerman's five-year con he began targeting big money earners as his debts mounted. Mr Swift continued: 'His victims included the footballer Richard Wright, Manchester City goalkeeper, and Peter Stroud, former chairman of Chelmsford City football club. Luxurious: Bowerman used the money he swindled to fund a lavish lifestyle, which included buying an Aston Martin. This is a file picture of an Aston Martin Vanquish V12 sports car . 'These people had large amounts of cash at their disposal. 'The defendant needed large amounts of cash to keep his various balls in the air so he persuaded them to invest in separate schemes. 'He was telling them there was a particular betting syndicate guaranteed to make money and large returns - but the returns never came.' Peter Stroud, 46, the former chairman of FA Cup giant-killers Chelmsford City Football Club, was one of Bowerman's biggest victims after handing over more than £1 million to the former mortgage advisor. The father-of-four said: 'I hope he dies in prison. 'The impact he has had on so many lives is unbelievable. It has had a massive impact on my family.'I trusted him implicitly. 'He worked for a good company and I had known him for ten years. He was charismatic and flamboyant but what he did, he did with malice. 'He did it to buy himself an Aston Martin and there were pictures of him on Facebook lighting his cigarette with a £50 note he had set fire to. 'That is what a fraudster does and, looking back, I realise there were small signs and I have blamed myself. 'He took over a million pounds from me. I was wealthy and had a good life, the money I gave him was to pay off the mortgage on a new house in Little Waltham and pay off my ex-wife's mortgage. Mitigation: BBC presenter Alexis Conran, left, praised Bowerman for being 'instrumental' in helping put together BBC3 documentary 'Gambling Addiction and Me: The Real Hustler' in a character reference read out in court. This is a picture of the presenters of the show . 'You just can't imagine the impact it had. I don't get a good night's sleep now. I get up at 4am.'I had to sell my business and am selling off a home in Cornwall. 'My children were used to a dad who had money and now when they want an ice cream I have to say no. 'There was a moment when I thought everyone would be better off without me, but things are improving now and I have a new company which is doing well. 'It will just be about working hard and in a few years I hope to look back and see this as an experience.' Bowerman had pleaded guilty to 33 charges of fraud - including 17 offences of fraud by false representation, 14 offences of obtaining money transfer by deception, one of theft and one of participation in a company on a fraudulent basis - when he appeared at an earlier hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court in September 2012. Christopher Kerr, mitigating, today told the court of his client's 'deep shame' over his actions. He said: 'He does express deep shame and remorse for he did. 'He is very aware of the very great loss, both financial and emotional, he has caused. 'It is clear the offences were the result of a chronic and acute gambling addiction. 'He did believe he could turn all of this around by gambling. He accepts that that belief was thoroughly deluded and without foundation. 'It was not his intent to cause a loss.' The court was told that, since handing himself in August 2010 and being released on bail, Bowerman has undergone intensive treatment for gambling addiction and has begun lobbying parliament to regulate the gambling industry. He has helped set up a campaign group called Gambling Reform and Society Perception (GRASP) and has contributed towards BBC and Channel 4 documentaries on the subject. BBC presenter Alexis Conran praised Bowerman for being 'instrumental' in helping put together BBC3 documentary 'Gambling Addiction and Me: The Real Hustler' in a character reference read out in court. He added: 'I am very sure he has helped many gambling addicts and their families avoid ruin.' Detective Constable Peter Sutton, from the Kent and Essex Fraud Squad, said: 'David Bowerman's criminality touched the lives of over 250 people and netted him in excess of £7.5 million. 'Some of his victims suffered more than once as he continued to abuse their trust whilst he fraudulently raised funds to feed his insatiable appetite for gambling and to finance a lavish lifestyle way beyond his legitimate means. 'The cynical way in which Bowerman exploited the trust of his victims is the worst example seen by the case office in over 28 years of police service. 'Bowerman has caused considerable hardship and loss to his victims from which many are likely never to be able to recover.'","David Bowerman, 35, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle as he blew a fortune on fast cars, .

Your socioeconomic status is based on a combination of factors including income, education and occupation . Those looking to improve their sex life may think key factors are sexual chemistry, physical attraction and energy. However new research suggests that your socioeconomic status (based on income, education and occupation) affects how satisfying you are likely to find your love life. A new analysis based on the first Spanish National Sexual Health Survey, carried out in 2009, confirms that socioeconomic factors affect sexual satisfaction and found that people with a lower economic status claim to be less sexually satisfied, particularly women. Investigators at the Barcelona Public Health Agency (ASPB) have analysed the influence of various socioeconomic factors on the results of the first Spanish National Sexual Health Survey carried out by the Centre for Sociological Research. This survey, for which 9,850 interviews were carried out, showed that approximately 90 per cent of men and women claimed to be very satisfied or quite satisfied with their sex life in general, and that 95 per cent were satisfied with the sexual relations they had had during the previous year. Furthermore, people claimed to be more satisfied with sexual relations they had with a stable partner (97 per cent of men and 96 per cent of women) than with a casual partner (88 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women). With the new study, the experts confirmed that socioeconomic factors affect sexual satisfaction. 'People of a lower socioeconomic status claim to be less satisfied sexually, which especially applies to women, who seem to be more influenced by these factors,' explains Dolores Ruiz, the main author of the study, to SINC, a Spanish scientific site. 'People that have a more . disadvantaged socioeconomic status tend to have less satisfying and less . safe sexual relations, as well as suffering more experiences of sexual . abuse. The higher your socioeconomic status the more likely you are to be satisfied with your sex life (and practice safe sex) 'Furthermore, women usually suffer more experiences of sexual . abuse than men and they claim to have less sexual gratification during . their first sexual intercourse,' she states. Those with a higher socioeconomic status seem to have a better . awareness of their own needs and a greater capacity for developing their . sexuality in a way which is satisfying for them. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), sexual health 'is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. 'Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence'. Socioeconomic standing was also found to affect how much people practice safe sex, with those at the lower end using less contraception. In relation to experiences of sexual abuse, more than 4 per cent of men and 6.5 per cent of women claimed to have had some kind of sexual relation against their will during their life, and 1.6 per cent of men and 6.1 per cent of women claimed to have been sexually abused or raped at some time in their life. 'Once again, it's particularly women of a lower socioeconomic status who suffer more experiences of sexual abuse. It's important to bear in mind that these women also might have more problems when it comes to contacting the various organisations that can provide help for them,' the ASPB researcher points out. 'There is a need to introduce public policies which aim to reduce socioeconomic and gender inequalities that we have found in sexual satisfaction, in the use of contraceptives and in abusive sexual relations,' Ruiz concludes.","Results from analysis of Spanish National Sexual Health Survey .

When NGO Consumer Voice revealed in 2010 that the vegetables and fruits that Delhiites eat everyday are extremely toxic, with chemical content that could cause serious health problems, the Delhi High Court of its own accord told the state government to review the situation. The government literally watered down the report, telling the court that the food was perfectly safe and that the NGO's figures were hugely exaggerated. Now, in a stinging and embarrassing no-trust vote against the Delhi government, the Delhi High Court has told the government to conduct toxicity tests over again. Fears: Pesticide chemicals are used as ripening and colouring agents for fruit and vegetables. Recent reports claim that poisons found on vegetables and fruits had the lethal potential to cause cancer . Not just that, it has also asked a court-appointed expert committee as well as an amicus curiae (assistant to the court) for a much larger sample to be tested and also a checklist of preventive measures. The court's order came on November 6, the last date of hearing in the matter. The order followed a submission by the Delhi government earlier this week stating that the pesticide content present in fruits and vegetables being sold in the Capital was within permissible limits and that they were not harmful. Consumer Voice found that pesticides such as chlordane, endrin and heptachlor (which can cause serious neurological problems, kidney damage and skin diseases) were rampantly being used in fruits and vegetables supplied across Delhi. The chemicals are used as ripening and colouring agents. It also said that poisons found on the vegetables and fruits had the lethal potential to cause cancer. The NGO found several banned pesticides as well and the level of some of the pesticides were 750 times that of European standards. The court's own panel of experts had told the HC that it had visited markets in Kotla, Mayur Vihar, Sarojini Nagar, INA, Defence Colony, Vasant Vihar and Lodhi Estate and found pesticides, toxic colours and hormones present in the samples it had checked. The court had ordered an inspection of fruits and vegetables for pesticides content while hearing a PIL on May 29. When the government went back to court, its reply said that the amount of pesticides consumed through fruits and vegetables in India was a fraction of that in America and Europe. This, it claimed, had been deduced by several sample surveys carried out by its lab. It also submitted that the Food and Supply department picked up 88 samples since January this year and the report on 70 items suggests that the pesticide content in them was less. ""The quantity of pesticides in these samples is under the consumable limits and did not pose any health-related threat,"" it said. In addition to this, the government also submitted a report by the Agricultural Marketing department on 1,513 samples of fruits and vegetables containing pesticides within the ""prescribed range"". Sri Ram Khanna of Consumer Voice told Mail Today that ""major pesticide manufacturers have started discrediting our notion that pesticide residuals are high in content present in the vegetables and fruits and it also appears that the government's effort to whitewash our fight showing that there is indeed alarming presence"". He also claimed that the NGO was threatened with a Rs 25 crore legal notice, asking it to withdraw stories about pesticides from the media. But the high court seemed to agree with the NGO about the government's attempt to underplay the extent of pesticides and toxins in the fruits and vegetables and junked the state's plea. The court said ""…We find these pleadings surprising because the material brought on record before us shows a picture which is far from what is painted in the affidavit. Impermissible pesticides have been found in the vegetables in the national capital territory."" The court directed the government to test more samples and come up with definite ways to curb the use of harmful pesticides by February 5, 2014, the next date of hearing.","Delhi High Court orders the government to conduct toxicity tests again .

Mr Cameron, acutely conscious that the war is no longer supported by voters, later tried to play down the claim, insisting that British involvement would be restricted to non-combat roles after next year. A total of 444 British service personnel have lost their lives in the 12-year conflict. Thousands more have been injured. During his visit, the Prime Minister enjoyed breakfast with UK troops in Helmand, where he was shown bomb-detecting and pilotless drone technologies before flying to Kabul to hold talks with President Hamid Karzai. The admission that Britain could still have a troop presence in the country at the end of the decade comes amid increasingly intense diplomatic efforts to seek peace with the Taliban. Mr Cameron was shown a remote-controlled surveillance aircraft during his Camp Bastion visit today . Cameron was shown a map of the area by Major Jim Skelton during his Armed Forces day visit to Camp Bastion . One diplomatic figure said yesterday . that a substantial number of militants being held in British Army camps . in Helmand – many directly linked to terror attacks on troops – were . likely to be released as part of the process. It has already been announced that 170 British troops will remain after . December 2014 to run the Afghan officer academy at Qargha, known as . ‘Sandhurst in the sand’. But commanders now say that Nato’s mission will . also have to assist the Afghans on matters such as medical evacuation, . logistics and air support operations. The UK has 7,900 troops in Afghanistan. This will fall to 5,200 by the . end of 2013, while the number of bases will fall from 11 to four or five . by the end of the year. Soldiers showed Mr Cameron a remote-controlled IED detection unit used in regional operations during his visit to the base . British forces could still be in the war zone in December 2019 as they are needed to help with medical evacuation, logistics, planning helicopter operations and in integrating ground combat with close air support (file photo) The military source said:  ‘We will leave our combat role next year, but . we will still be needed for three to five years after that.’ Responding . to the claim at a press conference, the Prime Minister said: ‘There . will be no British combat troops at the end of 2014. British troops are . coming home.’ Senior figures involved in paving the way for negotiations with the . Taliban are concerned about the backlash from relatives of their . victims. One source said: ‘I cannot foresee a political settlement being reached . which does not involve the release of prisoners. This will often involve . putting a uniform on them and turning them into government soldiers. Today, a senior diplomat revealed that troops will have to work alongside their Taliban prisoners who will be released as part of peace negotiations and 'put in uniform' in the Afghan military (file photo) ‘We hope the families will appreciate that sacrifices need to be made . for peace.’ Yesterday, Mr Cameron announced £3.8 million of funding for . military charities, including £300,000 for an Afghan war memorial at the .

An Oregon woman who accidentally ran over two little girls playing in a pile of leaves in October - but failed to report the incident to authorities - was found guilty on Wednesday of two counts of felony hit-and-run. Now, 19-year-old Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros faces up to three years in state prison for fleeing the fatal wreck and not reporting it to the police. On October 20, Garcia-Cisneros was driving the SUV that struck and killed step-sisters Anna Dieter-Eckerdt, 6, and Abigail Robinson, 11, as the girls were playing in a leaf pile on Main Street in Forest Grove, about 30 minutes west of Portland.

Sentence: Judge Rick Knapp could sentence Garcia-Cisneros to any thing from probation to three years in prison . Dieter-Eckerdt died at the scene. Robinson was taken to a hospital in Portland where she later died. At trial, Garcia-Cisneros testified that she was driving home from picking up fast food with her brother and boyfriend when she saw the leaf pile and intentionally swerved to hit it. Garcia-Cisneros told the jury that she heard a bump when she hit the pile or leaves, but insists that she didn't realize that she'd hit the two girls. Even prosecutors agreed that Garcia-Cisneros didn't intentionally hit the girls, according to the Oregonian newspaper. But what she did after the fact is the reason she currently is looking at three years in prison. After she'd returned home, her brother hopped on his back and rode it back towards the pile of leaves. That's where he saw Tom Robinson - Abigail Robinson's father - standing over the two girls. To watch full report from Koin News click here.

A young woman who was raped by her father at the age of 12 has shared her story in the hope it will help other victims of sexual abuse. Gemma Schembri, now 21, from Lincolnshire, revealed her father, Mark, had always been controlling but took his abuse further after he split up with her mother. She said: 'He started to sexually abuse me when . I stayed with him and it went on for over a year. He was very . manipulative and controlled my thoughts to make me believe it was . normal. 'The first time he raped me he said afterwards, ""Well it was . better that it was with me than with some random person in a hotel"".' Gemma said she didn't realise what her father was doing was wrong and it took her years to pluck up the courage to reveal she was a victim of abuse. She explains: 'My mum hadn't spoken to me about sexual . abuse and what type of touching was acceptable and what wasn't. It took . me two years to tell someone I was being abused as I didn't realise it . was wrong at first and then, when I did, I didn't know how to broach the . subject with my mum.' As a result of her ordeal, Gemma is now supporting a campaign by the NSPCC - who supported her as she came to terms with her experiences. The charity have launched a campaign called PANTS that encourages parents to have simple, age appropriate conversations with their children to make them aware of the dangers of sexual abuse. PANTS stands for 'Privates are private', 'Always remember your body belongs to you', No means no', 'Talk about secrets that upset you' and 'Speak up someone can help'. Don't suffer in silence: The NSPCC campaign encourages parents to tell their children not to keep things that upset them secret (posed by model) They advise parents to tell primary . school children of the 'underwear rule' - that they shouldn't be touched . by anyone else in the areas their underwear covers. It's something Gemma wishes she had been taught at a young age. She said: 'I think for me to have known that what was . happening was wrong my mum would have needed to have said, ""You shouldn't . let people touch you in areas that your underwear would cover"" so I . knew what was acceptable and what wasn't. 'I'd had sex education at . school when I was younger but that was just about safe sex and I think a . girl should be told about what constitutes sexual abuse by her mum not . teachers.' Help: Gemma finally confided in her mother and the family were supported by the NSPCC and her father was jailed . It was after she finally confided in . her mother that Gemma's abuse at the hands of her father finally ended . and he was arrested, charged and eventually jailed for nine . years. Gemma explained: 'Telling my mum about the abuse was the . worst conversation of my life. 'I sat down with her and couldn't get it . out at first. Then I was just really blunt and blurted it out. Mum was . shocked and started crying and we all sat crying together.' But despite Mark being behind bars, Gemma's ordeal was far from over as she had to cope with the aftermath of his abuse, something she eventually learnt to deal with thanks to the NSPCC's help. She said: 'Mark was arrested and our family was . in bits. Mum blamed herself and there was lots of arguing. I felt . broken and suicidal and was self harming. I started acting out. I was . drinking constantly and didn't care what I did. 'I had lots of social . workers but they didn't stick around so when I was introduced to a . worker from the NSPCC I told her I didn't like her. But she stuck with . me and was always there for me. She made me realise a lot of things . about myself and helped me understand why I was acting out and helped me . work through it. 'I'm better now and love my life but I think that if . I'd spoken out and stopped the abuse earlier and gotten help earlier I . would have recovered more quickly.' Victoria, from Dewsbury, who has a seven year old daughter said following the advice of the PANTS campaign has given her more peace of mind. Moved on: But Gemma wishes she has spoken out earlier about the sexual abuse . She said: 'We . had a great discussion, without fear or embarrassment about The . Underwear Rule and what she must do should she ever find herself in that . position. I feel confident that should my daughter find herself in such . a position (which fingers crossed never happens), she'll be able to . address the issue in an informed manner and without fear of . repercussion.' Another mother, Gillian, from Clydebank, who has a son, aged five, agreed: 'It was a difficult subject to approach with my son, but using the Underwear Rule and the materials provided by the NSPCC gave me the confidence to start having these conversations with him.' Claire, from Swansea, who has two young girls added: 'I think this education campaign is a great idea. I have two daughters and when I watch the news I really fear for them. But I worry about spoiling their innocence; frightening them and making them feel they can't be normal around people. 'I know I have to prepare them for those times I am not with them and that they are more likely to be abused by someone they know, so I have tried to start talking to my girls but I worry that I might say the wrong thing or that they will start to ask questions I can't or don't want to answer! Any advice on what to say and how to cope with such a sensitive but important subject is great. 'I am going to start Talking PANTS to my girls, my goddaughter, nephew and all my friends with children - it's much better to talk to our kids about how they can be safe rather than how awful the last report about a child suffering abuse was on the news and now I have got some help to do it well.'

Dealer: Brian Mitchell, 37, was jailed for four years after he admitted supplying heroin and diazepam . A criminal who made heroin deals in an alleyway while his three-year-old son sat on his shoulders has been jailed. Brian Mitchell, 37, was part of a drugs gang in Blyth, Northumberland, who were caught by undercover officers dealing just yards from a children's Sure Start centre. The gang of eleven were led by 46-year-old Dawn Brown, who dealt wraps of heroin from a Kinder egg stashed in her bra. Brown, Mitchell and three others were jailed at Newcastle Crown Court this week, while another six gang members were sentenced for their crimes. Mitchell, who also dealt diazepam, admitted supplying drugs and was jailed for four years. The court heard how undercover officers arranged deals to catch the gang after making contact through a heroin addict they found rooting through bins. They arranged a meeting in a hotel, where the addict used a police officer's phone to set up a meeting. The gang then carried out a series of deals with the police officers next to the Sure Start centre in Blyth. Describing on of the deals, made on 1 July 2013, prosecutor Jolyon Perks said: 'She [Brown] arrived at the Sure Start cut, pulled a Kinder egg from her bra and handed over two £10 wraps of heroin. 'The police noticed the Sure Start cut was overlooked by a children's play area.' Referring to a second deal the next day, Mr Perks said: 'Children were playing next to the cut and she pulled out two wraps and provided them for £20.' Three . days later Brown again agreed to meet the undercover officers in the same place, before sending them to her home to finish the deal. Busted: Dawn Brown, left, and Mandy Cranson, right, both supplied undercover officers with heroin, which they had concealed in Kinder eggs kept in their bras . The met one more time a week later, and were later redirecting them to her home to do the deal. A final deal took place on 9 July, when Brown sent another gang member, Mandy Cranson, 38, to deliver the drugs. Mr Perks said: 'There were children playing again in the play area that overlooks the cut. 'Cranson pulled out a Kinder egg from the front of her bra and handed over two silver foil wraps of heroin.' During the sentencing, Judge Jogn Evans said: 'They were . willing to supply whoever asked for it and they also chose to do a lot . of the dealing in a place where one might have expected a lot of young . children. Raid: Michael Johnson, pictured, was another member of the drugs gang. He was arrested after police found heroin in his house . Closing in: Police in Blyth raided two properties in connection with the drugs gang . 'It may be they just didn't care or maybe they chose it deliberately thinking the police might not be attracted to that area.' Brown was given a sentence of three years and nine months for supplying heroin. Other gang members were jailed for between one and four years, though four received suspended sentences and one was given a community order. Defence barristers for the gang said they all had drug problems of their own and were dealing to fund their addictions. After . the case Chief Superintendent Gordon Milward of Northumbria Police said: 'The action taken was a direct response to concerns . raised by local residents and what followed was a thorough investigation . into the drug activity of individuals in Blyth. 'We're . pleased with the sentences passed, which ensure drug dealers are off . the streets of Blyth and Northumberland for a substantial period of . time. 'We are not complacent and we'll continue to respond to concerns and take proactive action.' A total of eleven gang members were sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court for drug-relating activities: .

Tradition: Lawrence Williams, 19, has moved 10,000 miles from Australia to Britain to become the fifth generation of his family to join the Royal Navy . A teenager has moved 10,000 miles to become the fifth generation of his family to join the Royal Navy - continuing a loyal service spanning a century. Lawrence Williams, 19, has moved from Australia to Britain to follow in the seafaring footsteps of his father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather. The five family members have served their country for a combined 68 years since Ebenezer Hancock signed up at the outset of the Great War in 1914. He retired in 1936 but inspired his son - Lawrence's great-grandfather, Edward Hancock - to embark on his own naval career three years later. Edward retired from the Navy in 1958 and his son, George Williams, continued the family tradition by enlisting in 1963 and serving for 23 years. George's son Gareth Williams - Lawrence's father - joined in 1993 and was a member of the Royal Naval Reserve with the Plymouth based HMS Vivid for four years. Gareth and his wife Helen emigrated to Australia last year, with their two sons and two daughters. However, son Lawrence decided to return home to join the Navy - and enlisted 50 years to the day that his grandfather signed up on October 15 1963. He finished his ten week basic naval training at the end of December at HMS Raleigh in Torpoint, Cornwall, and has begun active service as a trainee engineering technician. Lawrence said he joined the Royal Navy after being inspired by tales of his family's incredible adventures at sea - and his ultimate ambition is to become a Royal Marine. Family ties: Lawrence with his grandfather George Williams (left) and father Gareth Williams (right), who like him served with the Royal Navy . 'I've always wanted to be part of the Armed Forces and the Royal Navy was the most appealing because of the chance of a trade and the military engagement all over the world,' he said. 'I've enjoyed the whole experience of training. It was challenging, but completing each step individually or as a team gave me a great sense of achievement.' Lawrence was joined at his passing-out parade in Torpoint by grandfather George, grandmother Barbara and father Gareth - who flew from Down Under to surprise him. All at sea: Lawrence's father Gareth Williams (left) followed his father George (right) into the Royal Navy . Founding fathers: Lawrence's great grandfather Edward Hancock (left) embarked on a naval career in 1939, three years after his own father Ebenezer Hancock retired having signed up  at the outset of the Great War . Gareth revealed that Lawrence's younger brother Oscar, 10, is already keen to join the Royal Navy or its Australian equivalent when he's old enough. He said: 'I am so very proud that Lawrence had not only chosen to follow the family tradition of a seafaring career but also that he has chosen a branch that will give him skills for life. 'I was also very pleased to have been able to make the journey to see Lawrence pass out on the very parade ground that I and my father have both done in the past - a great family tradition is being maintained.' Proud: Lawrence's grandparents George and Barbara Williams said they were really pleased when he told them he would be joining the Royal Navy . Gift: George and Barbara researched the family's Naval history while Lawrence was in training and were able to present him with a book of photographs containing each relatives' service record . While Lawrence waited to join the Royal Navy, he lived with grandparents George and Barbara in Thornbury, Devon. George said: 'We were really pleased when Lawrence said he was joining the Royal Navy as an engineer. 'He waited so long to get in and then when we found out he would be joining on 15 October, exactly 50 years after me, it was really weird. Adventure: Lawrence, pictured with (l-r) grandparents George and Barbara, grandmother Marion Barrett and father Gareth,  said he joined the Royal Navy after being inspired by tales of his family's incredible adventures at sea .

As legalized marijuana sales take off in Colorado, more businesses are realizing the value of pot in their business model. Twenty states and the District of Columbia allow medical marijuana but voters in Colorado and Washington state went a step further in 2012, becoming the first in the nation to legalize small plant amounts for adult recreational use and to regulate it like alcohol. Although there are strict state guidelines, governing what can and cannot be said with regards to cannabis use, wise businesses are looking towards ambitious cannabis business strategies with the potential for big sales and profits. Spirit Airlines: The air carrier is veering into a product-pitching space long dominated by late-night, fast-foodies, hinting at legalized marijuana while beckoning flyers to 'get mile high' Spirit Airlines is hinting at legalized marijuana beckoning their fliers to ‘get mile high.’ The airline, playing  off the approved use and sale of cannabis in the Rocky Mountain State, and offering discounted fares to Colorado where, its ad informs, ‘the no smoking sign is off,’ with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge attitude using a sales niche called marijuana marketing. The tactic is now also being used by other well known brands Taco Bell, Jack in the Box, Denny's and Carl's Jr, running ads suggesting weed use, with code words like ‘munchies’ or ‘bake’. ‘Spirit operates in a cutthroat business. They get outshouted by the bigger brands so they have to make their marketing dollars work harder and go further. And the message needs to be disruptive,’ said Simon Williams, to CNBC, Williams is the founder and CEO of Sterling Brands, a brand consultancy with clients that include Google, Disney and Visa. Aimed at stoners: Companies like Jack In The Box have run ads intimating weed use, with code words like 'munchies' Target audience: The new marijuana economics means bigger business for some companies - but they have to be carefully worded . ‘One of the most effective ways of doing that is courting controversy. Another way is being irreverent. They appear to be doing both and adding some humor in the process,’ Williams added. ‘As long as Spirit is not alienating its core target, I think that the current messaging is fine.’ While customers may be lining up outside the pot shops in Colorado, many other companies are using the legalization of marijuana to spur conversation about their product as well. With two states (Colorado and Washington) having legalized adult cannabis use and 21 states having sanctioned some form of medical marijuana, the number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their TV pitches will only grow. Timothy Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management believes that this kind of marketing works for Spirit, but wouldn’t work for legacy characters such as United. Got the munchies? Companies are being careful not to make the direct link between cannabis and the 'munchies' even though everyone knows that's what they're doing . Carefully worded: The tactic has been delicately plied by other brands, including Taco Bell, Jack in the Box, Denny¿s and Carl¿s Jr. Trend: With two states (Colorado and Washington) having legalized adult cannabis use and 21 states having sanctioned some form of medical marijuana, the number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their TV pitches will only grow . ‘Many brands in this country aren't going anywhere near the legalization issue. For most brands, that's very smart,’ Calkins said. ‘Some brands, though, can push this. We're going to see more brands take advantage of this and use this as a way to define themselves.’ Referring to Spirit Airlines pot-inspired poster, said Kevin Sabet, a co-founder of Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) doesn’t think it’s a good idea.  ‘It's just part of trying to climb on the bandwagon of being edgy and trying to be cool to get a certain demographic. But most people will put two and two together and realize they don't want a company they rely on for safety, glamorizing and normalizing something that directly would result in an accident. I'm not sure it's best practice for an airline. And if you really think about it, it's unbelievable.’ Some food-focused entrepreneurs are betting adult recreational marijuana becomes an alternative to wine consumption. Although no mainstream companies that are experimenting with marijuana marketing use the word ‘marijuana’ in their ads, the companies are also unwilling to explain the thinking behind their productions – and leaving it for the public, or perhaps just pot heads to work out.","With two states (Colorado and Washington) having legalized adult cannabis use and 21 states having sanctioned some form of medical marijuana, more companies are hinting at pot use .

Friends of the former Lib Dem chief executive said he was being 'lined up against the wall' Lord Rennard, the peer accused of lewd behaviour towards female activists, could sue the Liberal Democrats, his lawyer said yesterday – as the party descended into open warfare. Friends of the former Lib Dem chief executive said he was being ‘lined up against the wall’ and insisted he should not apologise because none of the sexual harassment claims against him had been proven. They said if Nick Clegg attempts to remove the whip, or tries to get him thrown out of the Lords’ Lib Dem group, they will take the case to the High Court. But the Deputy Prime Minister is set to up the stakes by proposing a second inquiry into the peer’s failure to say sorry for the alleged incidents. Mr Clegg issued his own grovelling apology to Bridget Harris – one of the 11 women who made claims against the peer. She said he was ‘eating humble pie’ over his party’s failure to deal with the allegations, but that she no longer believed in his leadership. Lib Dem sources say they have been deluged by letters from angry members saying Lord Rennard’s refusal to apologise brings the party into disrepute. A new inquiry could be announced as early as today by the Lib Dem disciplinary committee, leading to the peer’s whip being suspended. If not, his fate will be decided by a vote of the Lords’ Lib Dem group on Wednesday. The Deputy Prime Minister said on Friday that Lord Rennard should not be allowed back into the party’s group in the House of Lords if he refuses to apologise. But the peer has strong support in the Upper House and the Lib Dem leadership fears Wednesday’s vote could go against them.

Mr Clegg issued his own grovelling apology to Bridget Harris ¿ one of the 11 women who made claims against the peer . Lord Rennard’s alleged victims were . incensed last week when party disciplinary proceedings were dropped. A . QC investigating the 11 claims decided that, although they were . ‘credible’, they could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. However, the report by Alistair Webster QC recommended that Lord Rennard should apologise and change his behaviour. The peer’s friend and legal adviser Lord Carlile warned the row could escalate. He told Sky News there was ‘no case’ against Lord Rennard and that he was ‘being lined up against the wall’. Lord Carlile added: ‘If he has the whip removed from him then I have absolutely no doubt that Lord Rennard will be taking formal legal advice and the matter could unfortunately end up in the public law courts.’ In an article for yesterday’s Mail on Sunday, Lord Carlile even said Mr Clegg and the Lib Dem leadership made North Korea’s judicial system ‘seem benign’. Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, pleaded with the Lib Dem Lords to refuse to allow Lord Rennard back into the party fold. The minister threatened a further inquiry, saying: ‘Party HQ has had a lot of complaints from party members about the fact that no apology has been made. ‘Of course the appropriate committee will … decide what action needs to be taken because these are very serious matters.’ Lord Rennard wrote on Facebook at the weekend to say he had no intention of apologising, because he had done nothing wrong. He added: ‘I tried to make/consider any apology years ago, but was totally rebuffed by the complainants.

The family of a young mother who died in suspicious circumstances say they know the killer and want justice. Maddison Murphy-West, 20, was found dead in her Melbourne home last October when police launched a homicide investigation. They suspect the crime scene in Pakenham had been tampered with so it would appear Maddy had committed suicide. Murdered: Police officers originally believed that Maddison Murphy-West had committed suicide but later discovered she had been killed . Relatives say the key clue to busting the case and nabbing the murderer is a $1,500 Christmas hamper for which Maddison had saved hard - following her death it was redirected to the 'murderer's' family, they claim. They also say money was withdrawn from her account after her death and that the person they believe has information about her death was seen selling drugs on the actual day Maddison died. The family are outraged that social media has been used to shift blame onto an innocent man and also say Maddy's car has disappeared. They are begging for those who have information to come forward and demand justice, at the very least, for Maddison's  adored 23-month-old son, Noah, who was in the home, in the out-lying Melbourne suburb, when Maddison was found dead. 'I want whoever did this to be punished,' Maddison's mother Paula Murphy told the Herald Sun. 'It's hard to describe. It's the worst place you could possibly be. All you do is get up every day and hope it's a dream.' Ms Murphy, said she had feared for some time for her daughter's safety. She said that in 2012 she had noticed marks on Maddison's neck where someone had tried to choke her. 'She would just say it was play-fighting. That she bruised easily,' Ms Murphy said. Maddison's uncle, Shannon, said that on another occasion he saw his niece with bruises on her upper body and wanted to do something about it, but she talked him out of it. 'I said, ""why don't you bring him around here and we'll do something about it,""' he said. 'There are people out there who definitely know what happened. They need to come forward and tell the truth for Maddy.' Ms Murphy said she knew as soon as police arrived at the door on October 23 that Maddison was dead. 'I said, ""What's he done to her? What's he done to her?""' she said. Mother and daughter were close and had met the day before Maddison was found dead. 'She said, ""I love you"". We said we loved each other every time we saw each other,' Ms Murphy recalled. 'She said, ""I'll see you tomorrow.""' Maddison's grandfather, Gil, said he had been changed by her death, and was even having dreams about killing the man he believes is responsible, or having him bashed. 'I'm not that sort of person,' Mr Murphy said. 'It's frightened me. We're the good people. They're the bad people. That's why we don't do that sort of stuff.' Those closest to the cheerful 'go-getter' said they immediately knew Maddy hadn't taken her own life. 'We all knew, the night we were told, it wasn't suicide,' friend Alicia Hill said. Another friend, Meaghan Vander Ree, described Maddison as an amazing mother and said Ms Murphy-West had lived with her boyfriend and their son in the Ahern Road home for three years. 'She always put her son first. If he looks over this when he's older, we want him to realise how amazing she was,' Ms Vander Ree said.","Police initially thought that Maddison Murphy-West had committed suicide .

A boy has suffocated in sand after the hole he was digging collapsed on him at Pataua Beach in New Zealand's far north. The bizarre accident happened at the beach, near Whangarei in Northland, on Sunday at 1.30pm. As he was digging, it's believed the boy poked his head into the hole. The family's day at the beach turned to tragedy when a team from St John ambulance service was unable to resuscitate the boy, reported Radio NZ. Buried: Pataua beach in Northland, New Zealand where a seven-year-old boy died in collapsed sand. St John Northland operations manager Tony Devanney said an ambulance and a rescue helicopter was called to the beach. Mr Devanney said it was unclear how long the boy lay buried in the sand and that it did not appear the hole was all that big. 'A little seven year old boy at Pataua South was digging a hole in the sand, and he stuck his head in the sand, as they do, and it collapsed on him,' said Mr Devanney, who praised bystanders for starting resuscitation. 'The family, friends or bystanders pulled him out and attempted CPR but he was pulseless at that stage.'A pilot, Russell Proctor of the Northland Electricity Rescue Helicopter, says emergency services and passersby did everything they could to try to resuscitate the boy. He said when the helicopter arrived, members of the public were performing CPR and were joined by four paramedics and three doctors who were at the scene.He added that there were about 30 people at the beach, some of whom were members of the boy's family . The area's beautiful beaches are  popular with holidaymakers at this time of the year and as the northernmost part of New Zealand's North Island, Northland has symbolic significance in Maori mythology as the 'end of the country'. Poignantly, for the grieving relatives of the boy, the indigenous stories maintain that it is from here that the souls of the dead depart on their journey to the afterlife .","Boy's head trapped in collapsed sand on Northland beach .

A Memphis mall exploded into chaos Saturday evening as five men carrying sledgehammers stormed in, bashed a jewelry case and stole nearly three quarters of a million dollars worth of watches. Witnesses described a total madhouse as the thieves made their way to the Reeds Jewelers in the Wolfchase Galleria after 7pm and sent terrified shoppers fleeing for the lives. The thieves clad in hooded sweatshirts made off with an estimated $715,000 worth of Rolex watches stashed in pillowcases and were believed to still be on the run as of Sunday afternoon. Heist: At a Reeds Jewelers just like this in the Memphis shopping mall Wolfchase Galleria, five men wielding sledgehammers swooped in Saturday evening, smashed jewelry cases and made off with $715,000 worth of Rolexes . 'We were just downstairs and heard two pops I think, and everybody just started running,' witness Darius Martin, who was at the mall with his brother Deonte Martin and friend Carlos Hunt, told WMCTV. But when the young men first heard the commotion, they actually ran toward it. 'We thought it was a fight or something,' explained Deonte. But the group didn't get much further. 'And my friend said just turn around turn around, because he heard somebody say they got a gun. So we turned around, ran back up the steps and ran out the door,' Deonte said. Chaos: The heist went down around 730pm and witnessed describe a madhouse as shoppers fled for their lives and the thieves stuffed all the watches they could carry into pillowcases and escaped through two different exits . Conflicting accounts were rampant following the heist but police eventually said no firearms were, in fact, seen by witnesses. But that didn't keep them from scattering as the culprits stuffed their sacks with all the watches they could carry and bolted through two different exits. The men had yet to see justice as of Sunday afternoon, which at least one witness found almost impossible to believe. 'It's crazy, it don't make sense,' said Hunt.

'A difficult and vulnerable position': Julie De La Haut, who was arrested drink-driving her boyfriend's car just after his arrest for the same offence . A woman was caught drink-driving her partner's car barely an hour after his arrest for the same offence had left her stranded with the vehicle. Julie De La Haut got behind the wheel in the early hours of New Year's Day after police left her alone and vulnerable in a dark car park in Oxford, with no cash for a cab. But after she set off without switching on her headlights, it took just moments for her to be intercepted by a police patrol. De La Haut, 24, and her 31-year-old boyfriend Patrick Ochila, who live together in Carterton, Oxfordshire, appeared in the dock at Oxford Magistrates Court minutes apart to admit the charges against them. The court heard that the couple had been out celebrating the New Year and got into their Nissan X-Trail in the early hours of the morning after drinking. 'Just before 4am on January 1, Mr Ochila was stopped by police,' said prosecutor Sarah Mackay. 'Police had received information about the defendant driving while under the influence and asked the vehicle to stop.' Breathalysing Ochila by the roadside, police found he had 67 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath - nearly twice the legal limit of 35 microgrammes. Officers took him to Oxford Police Station, leaving De La Haut stranded and also drunk with the vehicle in a car park. 'At 5.10am, police officers observed the Nissan X-Trail moving in the car park next to the ice rink on Oxpens Road,' Mrs Mackay went on. 'The vehicle drove on to Oxpens Road and went into Thames Street with the driver failing to use the lights on the vehicle.' When De La Haut was pulled over she gave an even higher roadside reading than her partner, measuring 81 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. Angela Porter, mitigating, said both defendants accepted they were over the limit and knew they would be banned from driving and fined. Ochila, who works for BT, and De La Haut both wrote letters in mitigation which were handed to the magistrates' before sentencing. 'You will see from the letter that she sincerely apologises for what has happened. The consequences for the family will be very severe as they will have to work out how they can manage with both of them being unable to drive,' said Mrs Porter. Presiding magistrate Roger Clarke described Ochila as 'a decent, honest, hard-working family man' and expressed regret at seeing him in court. Neither defendant had any previous convictions. Shame: De La Haut, 24, and 31-year-old Patrick Ochila, left, who live together in Carterton, Oxfordshire, appeared in the dock at Oxford Magistrates Court minutes apart to admit the charges against them . 'We are certain that nobody more than you is disappointed with your conduct. We are quite clear in our minds that you have learned your lesson,' Mr Clarke told Ochila, adding that he hoped BT would retain him despite his conviction. Ochila was banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay a £375 pound fine, £85 costs and a £37 pound victim surcharge, while De La Haut was banned for 20 months, fined £300 pounds and a £30 surcharge. 'You found yourself in a very difficult and vulnerable position in Oxford, in a dark area without funds for alternative transport - perhaps you didn't think straight,' Mr Clarke told De La Haut. 'But you drove on the road and you didn't put the lights on in the car, which alerted police.' 'You have both made a mistake, it is a great tragedy and shame for you as a couple. We all make mistakes in life, please draw a line under this and learn a lesson from it.'","Julie De La Haut was left stranded after police took away her boyfriend .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:39 EST, 17 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:02 EST, 17 January 2014 . One of the principal figures in New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's 'Bridgegate' scandal is willing to tell what he knows in exchange for immunity from prosecution, it was revealed today. David Wildstein, the Port Authority official who allegedly spearheaded politically motivated traffic . jams on the George Washington Bridge that backed up morning commuters on four days in September, said through his lawyer that he will testify only when he no longer faces the possibility of criminal charges. His lawyer, Alan Zegas, told The . Associated Press on Friday that 'if he . has immunity from the relevant entities, he'll talk.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . David Wildstein, the former NY/NJ Port Authority official at the center of the bridge flap, refused to answer questions during a Jan. 9 hearing in Trenton, but the state legislature's new investigative committee has issued a fresh subpoena to keep him on the hot seat . Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful internal email on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . John Wisniewski brought 18 names and 2 organizations to his bipartisan Special Committee on Investigations on Thursday, and all 20 subpoenas were approved in under two hours . Morning mess: Toll lanes on the George Washington Bridge, America's busiest span, were closed to local traffic in September for nearly a whole work week, causing delays for commuters, school buses and emergency responders . The New Jersey General Assembly's . transportation committee, chaired by the hard-charging John Wisniewski, . subpoenaed records and testimony from Wildstein in December. The . hundreds of pages of emails and text messages he turned over included . what some in the state capitol are calling a 'smoking gun' message. In . it, former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly – publicly fired last . week by Gov. Christie – wrote Wildstein that it was 'time for some . traffic problems in Fort Lee,' a New Jersey town where morning commuters . enter the busy George Washington Bridge. 'Got it,' replied Wildstein in the email. The result was a four-day rearrangement of traffic cones on the bridge's entry tollgates, choking off the flow of cars from Fort Lee and bringing the town to a standstill for hours on end. Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich declined to endorse Christie when he ran for re-election last year, and some observers believe the traffic jam was political payback. Zegas said the U.S. Attorney's office – which Christie ran before he became governor – has not stepped forward to offer him immunity. A host of current and former Christie aides and appointees were served subpoenas Thursday night and Friday morning. The unlucky list includes his chief counsel Charlie McKenna, former deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, former political campaign manager Bill Stepien, chief of staff Kevin O'Dowd – who Christie has nominated to be his state's attorney general – and his planned replacement Regina Egea, plus the governor's cantankerous longtime spokesman Michael Drewniak, and Drewniak's wife Nicole. Others who figure in Thursday's legal bloodbath are current and past officials inside the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the government behemoth that operates airports, bridges, tunnels, train and bus depots, and maritime ports throughout the nation's largest metropolitan region. Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye and chairman David Samson join Wildstein and former Foye deputy Bill Baroni, both Christie appointees. The avalanche of legal paper will follow 17 people in all, plus three New Jersey organizations that will come under the gaze of a bipartisan New Jersey legislative 'super investigative committee.' The 'Christie for Governor' political campaign organization is named in one subpoena, according to a source with knowledge of the documents crisscrossing the capitol building in Trenton. Christie himself is not among those personally targeted for document production or demands for testimony. 'There's no intention right now to subpoena the governor,' Select Committee on Investigation chairman John Wisniewski said Thursday after the panel's first meeting. 'We've seen nothing in the documents that has – you know – an email from the governor, or to the governor. We've not seen any kind of direct link.' Christie said Tuesday during his annual State of the State address that his administration would 'cooperate with all appropriate investigations,' Business as usual: Christie spoke to media and homeowners about the ongoing recovery from Hurricane Sandy in the town of Manahawkin on Thursday . Bill Baroni Jr. – Former deputy executive director of the NY/NJ Port Authority, appointed by Christie in 2010 and resigned in December 2013 . Maria Comella – Deputy chief of staff for communications and planning . Michael Drewniak – Christie's longtime press secretary who also served as his chief public affairs officer for six years in the U.S. Attorney's office . Nicole Davidman Drewniak – Christie's campaign finance director, married to Michael Drewniak since October 2012 . Regina Egea – Director of the governor's Authorities Unit, which oversees the Port Authority, and slated to become chief of staff after O'Dowd's departure . Patrick Foye – Executive director of the Port Authority, appointed by NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2011 . Bridget Anne Kelly – Christie's former deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, fired on Jan. 8 . Charlie McKenna – Chief counselor to the governor, the lawyer tasked with managing the legal end of government policy on a day-to-day basis . Matt Mowers – The Christie political operative who unsuccessfully sought a campaign endorsement from Fort Lee, N.J mayor Mark Sokolich . Kevin O’Dowd – Christie's chief of staff and nominee to become attorney generalColin Reed – Christie's deputy communications director . David Samson – Chairman of the Port Authority Board of Commissioners since early 2011, appointed by Christie following work as his campaign counsel . Bill Stepien – Christie campaign chief in both 2009 and 2013, lost consulting contract with the Christie-led Republican Governors Association on Jan. 8, along with a chance to chair the NJ Republican Party . David Wildstein – Former director of interstate and capital projects at the Port Authority, a position Christie reportedly created for him. He resigned in December . He . publicly announced a week ago that he had fired Kelly after he learned of her links to the bridge lane closures. The governor had softer words about Stepien, his former campaign manager, announcing only that he had lost a consulting contract with the Christie-led Republican Governors Association, and would not be permitted to run for the chairmanship of the state Republican party. O'Dowd, McKenna and Drewniak, however, are closer to Gov. Christie. Drewniak has served as his chief media relations man since his days as U.S. Attorney in the Garden State. McKenna, too, served in the U.S. Attorney's office as Christie's top senior prosecutor, and later joined his administration as director of the state's homeland security agency. But O'Dowd, said a Democratic assembly staffer, 'is the biggest slam-dunk of them all for the Democrats.' As Kelly's direct supervisor, the aide told MailOnline, O'Dowd is presumed to have known 'anything Christie knew about the whole bridge plot.' 'And if Bridget Kelly was following the governor's orders, there's no way O'Dowd wasn't the middle-man,' he said. News of Drewniak's subpoena was met by . knowing grins among New Jersey journalists who have come to know him as . a coarse, salty, and often vulgar gatekeeper to Christie. 'The . chickens are coming home to roost,' one such veteran reporter confided . in MailOnline, saying Drewniak is known for his 'vicious temper and a . vindictive nature that belongs in the Sopranos.' In one email revealed last week, sent . to David Wildstein from his personal account, Drewniak referred to a . Newark Star-Ledger reporter as 'such a f***ing mutt.' In another, . referring to the Star-Ledger journalist's request for a meeting between . the governor and their editorial board, Drewniak wrote WIldstein, 'F*** . him and the S-L.' Drewniak is unique among the committee's investigative targets, in that his wife, Nicole Davidman Drewniak, also appears on the . subpoena list. Mrs. Drewniak was Christie's campaign finance . director during his 2013 re-election bid. Wildstein's messages suggest that he was at the center of an effort to cover up the impact of the bridge lane closures, and to hide the reasons for the stunt. Among the small batch of emails and . text messages that the Bergen County Record was first to publish on Jan. 8 was an exchange between Wildstein and Bill Baroni, then both Port Authority . officials, after Baroni's contentious Nov. 25 testimony before . Wisniewski's transportation committee. In the back-and-forth, Baroni asks Wildstein for 'Trenton feedback,' likely referring to the governor's office. 'Good,' responds Wildstein. 'Just good? S**t,' Baroni curses back. 'No,' WIldstein assures him in reply, 'I have only texted Brudget [Bridget . Kelly] and Nicole[,] they were VERY happy ... Both said you did great.' Gov. Christie has forcefully denied having any knowledge of the bridge . traffic scheme, or playing any role in directing it. His unequivocal . statements have set up a political scenario where a single email, text . message or statement to the contrary could sink his chances of winning . the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.","Former official David Wildstein allegedly caused four days of George Washington Bridge delays as punishment for a Democratic Party mayor .
