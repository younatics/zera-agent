A lesbian intent on stopping her former lover seeing the children they had together with donated sperm has been warned by the UK's top family judge to stop poisoning them against their other mother. The former couple have spent 10 years and more than £200,000 battling eachother in one of Britain's most bitter custody battles, London's Appeal Court heard. Their children, 11 and 13, have no memory of their mothers not being at eachother's throats in an entrenched dispute that has been to the Court of Appeal three times and the House of Lords once. Referring to the 'lamentable history' of the case yesterday, top family judge, . Lord Justice Thorpe, said that every attempt by the courts and social . workers to make the former lovers see sense and agree reasonable child . contact arrangements had been doomed to failure. Row: The legal battle between the two mothers, which has cost more than £200,000 and lasted a decade is still going (file picture) The birth mother, who lives in Cornwall and was referred to in court as CG, has . spent all she has trying to keep her former partner – known as . CW –  away from their two girls, who were conceived using artificial insemination. Distraught about not being able to see her daughters, estranged CW headed to court again earlier this year to ask judges to force these girls to move to . her home in Staffordshire. Twist: Lord Justice Thorpe yesterday warned the birth mother not to poison her children against their other mother . But Judge Nicholas Vincent ruled this out saying her children no longer thought seeing her was 'valid or worthwhile' and said it was more important that they lived the way they wanted, in Cornwall. However, in a new twist, the Court of Appeal overturned that decision yesterday as Lord Justice Thorpe said that the girls' view had been tainted by their birth mother, stating there is warmth between the estranged mum and her girls, adding: 'There . is a clear mismatch between what these children say and how they behave.' He went on the children are 'no doubt well aware of their mother’s antipathy towards CW and their . wishes, although important, should not be taken too literally. 'She has always been a warm and loving parent who has never failed these children.' Social workers said there is 'natural warmth' between CW and the girls . and Justice Thorpe said: 'A subtle but familiar strategy is for the primary carer to declare . that it is for the children to decide, and they go whenever they please, . whilst at the same time projecting a clear message that she does not . wish or expect them to go. 'It is also my view that the judge (Vincent) did not sufficiently factor in the . crucial importance of the relationship between the children and CW and . her family and the damage that would be caused to them by its loss.' Relentless: The case has now been going since 2002 and has been to the High Court (pictured), Appeal Court and House of Lords as the lesbians battle for custody . Laying down a warning to CG of where her stubborness may take her, . the judge added: 'If she cannot sustain the relationship between the . children and CW then consideration would have to be given to moving them . to CW’s home'. But rather than settling the matter, it is hurtling headlong back to court, drawing comparison's to the the never-ending Jarndyce vs Jarndyce case at the heart of Dickens' Bleak House, as now CW's application for a residence order over the two girls will now go back for re-hearing by a High Court judge.","Their children, 11 and 13, have no .

Former servicemen are to be offered cash incentives to join the reservists, the Government will announce today. Defence . Secretary Phillip Hammond is proposing the scheme as part of a package of measures intended to improve the reserve forces and place them at the heart of the Armed Forces. In a speech today, he will set out plans to enable the Territorial Army (TA) - which will be renamed the Army . Reserve - to play a bigger role in future operations. With thousands of serving personnel being made redundant through defence cuts, the scheme will enable them to rejoin the Forces in a reservist capacity. The plans will also allow the 18,000 members of the Armed Forces who voluntarily leave . their jobs every year to serve again as reserves. Another proposal is to allow regular personnel to transfer to the reserves on . departure. Mr Hammond's announcement comes as 30,000 posts are slashed from the regular Armed Forces. The Army is . losing 20,000 soldiers and will be reduced to 82,000 by 2020. But the gap will be filled by a newly-expanded reservist force, which will be better integrated with regular troops. Under the plans, which will be subject to a consultation, the number of training days for reservists . will increase from 35 to 40 a year. Recruits would expect to serve a six-month tour of duty at . least once every five months. At work: The Territorial Army's London Regiment (file picture). TA battalions are to be better integrated with the regular Army . To bolster recruitment, they and their employers will be given more notice of . mobilisations, and companies will be encouraged . to hire and retain reservists. It is hoped the plans - to be published in a . Green Paper - will enable the TA to increase its size from 25,000 official members to 30,000. Calling for a 'radical shift' in attitudes to the so-called 'weekend warriors', Mr Hammond will say today: 'We're looking for people who are . going to turn out when they're required to turn out, who are going to do . the training they need to do and who are available for deployment. 'So the message to future reservists . is clear: promise us you will make the commitment; turn up regularly to . train and be prepared to deploy. And in return, we promise to equip you, . train you, fund you and use you as an integral part of the British . Army.' Mr Hammond will also pledge a 'fresh . start' in the Government's relationship with reservists, who will in . future be required to routinely share responsibility for 'activities . once the exclusive domain of regular forces'. Tough work: Territorial Army soldiers during an exercise at Sandhurst, Surrey . But shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy . said more support for non-regular forces was needed. He said: 'We support action to enhance the role of the reserves, but the . Government can go further to protect our reservists' patriotism. 'If more is going to be asked of . reservists, ministers must provide more support. Anti-discrimination . legislation, improved pre-deployment training and better mental . healthcare are vital. 'At a difficult time for many companies, employers must be given the support they need when their workers serve on reserve duty. 'Crucially, reserve units must be . integrated with regular forces rather than form stand alone units and . civilian skills must be maximised in military contexts.""","Government wants veterans to join the reservists .

A microlight pilot killed minutes into his first solo flight had had no formal training, air accident investigators reported today. Adrian Paterson, 49, from Clackmannan, Scotland, died when his craft plunged to the ground, probably after stalling following a steep climb, the Department for Transport's air accident investigation branch (AAIB) has revealed. The investigation concluded the crash, in which he is believed to have plummeted up to 300ft in his Gernini Flash IIA, happened because Mr Paterson had attempted a solo flight without the required training. The scene: Adrian Paterson, 49, from Clackmannan, Scotland, died when his craft plunged to the ground, probably after stalling following a steep climb . The investigation concluded the crash happened because Mr Paterson had attempted a solo flight without the required training . Microlight pilots are required to hold a licence that takes a minimum of 25 flight hours to achieve. The crash, in a field in the Carse of Clackmannan near Kennet on April 12, happened after Mr Paterson took off, leaving two friends on the ground. One of them was an experienced microlight pilot, although not an instructor, who helped taxi the aircraft into position. The AAIB said Mr Paterson had bought the microlight last autumn, but the Civil Aviation Authority was not notified and it was deregistered in December. The 23-year-old aircraft was in good condition, despite not having been officially inspected for three years. The AAIB also found no record of Mr Paterson taking a formal flying training course and he did not have the required medical declaration for flying a microlight. The AAIB said: 'There was some anecdotal evidence that the owner had taken lessons, but the provider was not traced and it is not known how many lessons were undertaken or if the person delivering them was a| qualified instructor.' Mr Paterson was also not a member of a microlight club. The AAIB said he may have had 'only limited experience of flying as a passenger'. He had flown in another microlight before buying his own, but had not operated the controls. The AAIB report stated: 'Immediately after takeoff, the weight-shift microlight entered a steep climb. 'The nose then dropped (probably as a result of a stall) and the aircraft struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude. 'It is probable that the owner did not vise the correct takeoff technique and allowed the wing to remain in a high angle of attack. 'The rapid nose drop probably occurred as the result of a stall, which may have been exacerbated by the reduction in power. 'The resulting nose-down attitude, with the possible subsequent addition of power so close to the ground, would have made recovery difficult.' The investigation also found no ballast on the rear seat, which is recommended by the aircraft manufacturer when the micro-light is flown solo. The report said a post-mortem examination found Mr Paterson died of multiple injuries, but there was no evidence of drugs, alcohol or natural disease. An ambulance spokesman said at the time of crash: 'Paramedics at the scene estimated that the microlight had come down from a height of between 200ft to 300ft.'","Adrian Paterson, 49, plunged 300ft to ground as he flew craft alone .

Killed: Claire O'Connor, 38, a mother-of-four, was allegedly battered and smothered to death by boyfriend Aaron Man, 31, in the early hours of New Year's Day in Nuneaton, Warwickshire . A bouncer killed his girlfriend in a fit of jealous rage in the early hours of New Year’s Day before driving around in her car for two days with the body hidden in the boot, a court heard today. Aaron Mann, 31, is accused of battering mother-of-four Claire O’Connor, 38, and smothering her with a pillow because he believed she was seeing another man. Her badly beaten body was found wrapped in her son’s sleeping bag and covered in a dirty sheet in the boot of her Ford Focus in Nuneaton, Warwickshire on January 2. Coventry Crown Court heard today that Mann dumped her body in the car and drove it around for two days before confessing to his parents what he had done. A post-mortem revealed Claire had been hit repeatedly with a blunt instrument and suffocated with a pillow. Mann denies murdering her on the grounds of dismissed responsibility. Simon Edwards, prosecuting, told the jury of seven men and five woman that Mann and O’Connor had met in February 2010 and had moved in together some time after that. They had gone to the Green Bear pub in Nuneaton to celebrate the New Year. Mann was due to be paid £100 to work on the door that night. Claire’s son Daniel O’Connor had also been in the pub that night, and said the couple seemed happy. However, others present said the defendant was complaining about Claire’s behaviour. Mr Edwards said: ‘Daniel O’Connor left the pub at around 10pm to go to a club with his then girlfriend. The couple returned to Claire’s home at around 1.30am on New Year’s Day. ‘When they returned they found no sign of his mother but met the defendant coming out of the bathroom, apparently having just had a shower. Dumped: O'Connor's body was found in the boot of her Ford Focus car, which Mann had driven around for two days . Search: Police forensics teams search a terraced house on Church Road in Nuneaton, Warwickshire in connection with Claire O'Connor's murder in January this year . ‘When Daniel asked him where his mother was he replied ‘we’ve had an argument, she’s probably with him.’ ‘’Him’ was a friend of Claire’s who she had previously had a relationship with called Christopher Denny. ‘When Daniel returned from his friend’s house later that day he noticed his mother’s silver car was not where it was usually parked outside the front of the house. ‘The next day the defendant took his daughters round to his parent’s house. They noticed he was acting strangely, in a more and more disturbed manner, he told them he was hearing voices. Quiet: A view of Montana Walk in Nuneaton, the road where O'Connor lived. Her body was discovered in the boot of her car on January 2 . ‘After the defendant told his parents that Claire had left, his father asked him what he had done to her. ‘He told his father than he hadn’t done anything but, refusing to believe him, his father asked again. ‘He told his father he had killed her. He told him voices had told him to do it and get rid of the body. ‘He then said he couldn’t bring himself to get rid of the body.’ His mother phoned the police and when they arrived, the defendant shouted ‘please don’t look in the boot’, said Mr Edwards. He added: ‘Police found her body wrapped in a green sleeping bag which belonged to Daniel. She was then wrapped in a painting sheet. ‘When he was interviewed by a psychiatrist to see if he was fit to be interviewed he told the doctor he had strangled her with a pillow over her face.’ The case continues.

Posing proudly for the camera, this is the moment Paul Griffith was finally able to hug son Kyle after being apart for 22 years. Six days later, his 25 year old son was killed by a drug-crazed driver. Chef Kyle, of Cardiff Bay, was walking . home from work in the early hours of January 11 when drug addict . Stephen Freye deliberately drove into him at around 60mph after snorting 70 lines of cocaine. Reunited: Tragic Kyle Griffith, 25 (right), was reunited with his father Paul Griffith (left). Just days later Kyle was killed . Now the young chef's father Paul, 46, has spoken about the plans the pair had made to make up for their years apart. The last time he saw his son before this poignant picture was taken was when Kyle was three, shortly before Mr Griffith split from his mother. He explained how it felt to lose his son, himself a father, for the second time after tracking him down on Facebook. Mr Griffith told the Mirror: 'We’d talked about him moving near me and I was jubilant at the prospect.'I was so looking forward to us doing things as father and son.' Freye claimed he was hallucinating after sniffing a bag of 10 grammes of cocaine over a weekend. Cardiff Crown court heard Freye confessed to police at the scene: 'I was told to kill a stranger.' Freye, of Roath, Cardiff, denied murder but was found guilty on Monday following a two week trial. A judge jailed him for life and said he would spend a minimum of 13 years behind bars. Devastated Mr Griffith said 'no sentence was long enough' for what his son's murderer had done. Mr Griffith, of Star in Pembrokeshire, said he had been trying to get access to his son for years before tracking him down on the social networking site. The builder who is now married to Helen, 49, said it had taken time for he and his estranged son to see eye to eye, before finally agreeing to meet up. He added: 'Then just days later he was killed.' Stephen Freye, left, snorted 70 lines of cocaine before he drove at and killed Kyle Griffith, 25, right, as he returned home from work . Sentencing Freye Mr Justice MacDuff said he had read victim impact statements from Kyle’s mum, step-dad and sister. He told Freye: 'They make for harrowing reading - Kyle was a thoroughly lovely and worthwhile man whose life has been wasted. 'He was an innocent man, a young man and father and was walking home after a night in town and minding his own business when you ran him down. 'You were in a psychotic state, hallucinating and hearing the voice of your drug supplier telling you to kill. 'You had voluntarily taken drugs over three days when you knew full well the effect they had on you. 'You were tempted by your addiction but the decision was yours and you bare the responsibility. 'Kyle was a fine young man, who was greatly loved and had a promising life in front of him. Killed: Kyle, a father, was described as a lovely man whose life had been wasted . 'He was hard working and bared no animosity to anyone, he had a young daughter who he adored and he touched many lives. 'His sister had to celebrate her 21st Birthday four days after her brother’s death. You turned that event, a celebration, into one of mourning. 'You told the jury you were truly sorry, you were sorry, but only for yourself. Your words were hollow and your attitude in the dock today shows no contrition. 'You will have to live with your actions for the rest of your life.' Prosecutor Huw Evans said: 'Freye had taken cocaine and had suffered hallucinations shortly before he drove straight into innocent Mr Griffith. 'He told police that at the exact moment he saw his victim, the voices told him his own family would die if he didn’t drive at him. 'He said he didn’t even think, he just assumed that if he ran him over, everything would be okay. 'He deliberately drove at him and his intention was to kill or cause serious injury.' Mr Griffith was a chef at Cardiff Arts Institute. The jury was shown home movies made by Freye in his flat taking cocaine and apparently searching for the voices he claimed he could hear. The films, made in the dark, show him sitting staring at the camera and looking around the room. Freye claimed he was driving to a police station in his Fiat Cinquecento to tell them about the voices when he saw Kyle on the roadside in January this year. He denied murdering Kyle but admitted manslaughter claiming he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time. Freye told the jury: 'The coke was so irresistible that when I got it from the dealer, I started snorting it from the bag on the way back. 'I was just totally a slave to it. 'The voices had complete control of me. As soon as I saw him, the voices spoke. 'And as soon as I heard them, I turned the car - I didn’t have time to think.' Speaking outside court a spokesman for the Kyle’s family said: 'No punishment given could ever bring Kyle back nor ease the pain of his tragic and sudden death. 'However we are pleased that some justice has been done today.'","Paul Griffith last saw his son when he was three. Just days after their reunion he was run down by drug crazed Stephen Freye .

French President Francois Hollande, pictured, will meet with Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt for talks tomorrow . The executive chairman of internet giant Google is to meet with French President Francois Hollande tomorrow for talks over a bill that would force search engines to pay for content, according to a government source. Eric Schmidt will also meet with French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti before meeting with Mr Hollande, said the anonymous source. The meeting follows threats from Google that it would exclude French media sites from its search results if the country's government passes the bill. Google sent letters to several French ministerial offices earlier this month saying that it 'cannot accept' such a move and that the company 'as a consequence would be required to no longer reference French sites', according to a copy of the letter obtained by news agency AFP. The company said that a law which would require it to pay media sites for displaying links to their content would 'threaten (Google's) very existence'. Top French newspaper publishers last month called on the government to adopt a law imposing a settlement in the long-running row with Google, forcing it to share some of the advertising revenue from user searches for news contained on media websites. That call came after politicians in Germany approved a draft legislation back in August that would see search engines pay commissions to German media sites. Culture Minister Filippetti said she was in favour of the idea last week, describing it as 'a tool that it seems important to me to develop.' Surprised by the tone of the letter from Google, she said: 'You don't deal with a democratically-elected government with threats.'

Reginald Davies, 78, was found guilty of abusing four girls between 1949 and 1973 at Kingston Crown Court in Surrey . A former soldier with the Royal Engineers has been found guilty of sexually assaulting four young girls in what is thought to be the oldest criminal case in UK history. Reginald Davies, 78, committed the attacks between 1949 and 1973 but was only extradited from Australia and brought to justice after two of his victims confronted him in 2008. The Welshman, who also served with the Royal Dragoons, was convicted of 13 offences, including the rape of a girl under the age of 12 all committed when he was aged between 15 and 39. Two of his victims were present at Kingston Crown Court in south west London and wept as the verdict was read out. He will be sentenced on Friday with Judge Susan Tapping warning him that he faced a 'substantial sentence'. During the trial, prosecutor Hanna Llewellyn-Waters said Davies 'preyed on the innocence' of the four girls, who were aged between nine and 16 at the time. She said: 'You relied on their fear that they would not be believed and told them that they would be taken away from everything they loved.' The former miner abused his victims in South Wales before moving to Australia in 1974. He was confronted by two of his victims in 2008 while they were on holiday in the country and a third victim later came forward to police, who found the fourth woman after an investigation was launched. Davies was arrested last July at his adopted home of Wanneroo on Australia’s west coast and extradited in September last year. Two of Davies' victims were present at Kingston Crown Court, pictured, and wept when the guilty verdict was read out . The pensioner was found guilty of two . charges of child rape, two charges of attempted rape, eight counts of . indecent assault and one count of indecency with a child. He was cleared of one charge of child rape and one charge of attempted rape. Judge Tapping said Davies - who was living in Hertfordshire with his wife during the trial - would have to sign the sex offenders register, and adjourned sentencing until Friday. Reginald Davies, pictured outside court, he will be sentenced on Friday,with Judge Susan Tapping warning him that he faces a 'substantial sentence' Mark Kimsey, defending, asked for bail to allow him to 'get his house in order' but Davies was remanded in custody. Following the verdict Hilary Ryan, senior Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer, said: 'This is one of the oldest cases of historic sexual abuse and rape ever prosecuted by the CPS, dating back to 1949. 'I hope this conviction serves as an important message to people who have been the victim of crimes such as these that they should come forward regardless of when the offence occurred.' Detective Inspector Tessa Philpott, of Scotland Yard’s Child Abuse Investigation Command, added: 'When Reginald Davies emigrated to Australia in 1974, he thought that he had left behind not only the UK, but also the horrendous catalogue of abuse he committed against four small children. 'I would imagine he thought his past would never catch up with him, and he would never face justice, but, thanks to the bravery of his victims, his past did catch up with him, and today he faces justice. 'I hope that this will go some way towards helping his victims, whose lives have been blighted by him, to move forward in some small way. 'I also hope that his extradition from the other side of the world and conviction give other victims the confidence to come forward and report their experiences to the police.'","Reginald Davies abused the girls when he was aged between 15 and 39 .

Detectives believe that the attack on Mr Power may have been an attempt to steal his £180,000 Bentley Continental, which was parked nearby. He suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. The attack happened after Mr Power drove to the park – seven miles from his home in Bradway, Sheffield – to look for his elderly brother because he was concerned for his welfare. His brother was later found safe and well. Mr Power, who was being treated in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, made his fortune as he went from selling bras from his garage to supplying lingerie across the globe. His rags to riches tale began in the early 1980s when he was made redundant from Playtex where he worked as a salesman. His commercial brainwave was to realise there was a gap in the market for lingerie aimed at curvier women and he set up his company, Panache, in 1982 with money from mortgaging his house.

He also had two daughters, Siobhan and Louise and a number of grandchildren. The business won a Queen's Enterprise award in 2002 and now has several separate brands - including Panache Superbra and Panache Swimwear. A spokesman for Panache said shortly after the attack on October 8: ‘As a close, family-run company, this . incident has come as a big shock and our thoughts and prayers are with . the Power family at this difficult and private time.’ Residents in Mr Power’s neighbourhood expressed their shock at the time.

Forget the blockbuster film Gone In Sixty Seconds - the nimble car thief takes just 10 seconds to nab your motor, more than six times faster than a decade ago. Angelina Jolie and Nicholas Cage's characters in the 2000 film would've been left trailing in the wake of today's fleet of foot thieves, according to a new report released yesterday. And Black Audis are top of car thieves’ shopping lists with 150,000 cars are stolen each year and two thirds of these taken with their keys. An AUDI A7 Sportback. Black AUDIs are the most popular car targeted by thieves . The study by criminologists for LV= car insurance reveals that forced ignition thefts have fallen massively over the past decade, with criminals now preferring to steal the keys and then drive away. This has drastically reduced the time it takes the average car thief to make a slick getaway by more than six times. The report, which includes interviews with car crime victims and convicted car thieves, shows that car thefts where the perpetrator steals the keys now account for nearly two thirds of all cars stolen. In just under half of the thefts the car keys are stolen from the owner’s home during a burglary, although six per cent of victims had their keys taken forcibly from them before the thief drove away in their car. Black or silver BMWs like the one pictured are also among the most sought after cars by thieves . Official figures show that 88,103 cars were stolen in 2011/12 but these do not account for car theft as a result of burglary, which goes undocumented. As a result, it is estimated that up to 4o per cent of car thefts go unreported as they are classified as burglary (because the keys were taken from the house), which would equate to an additional 58,735 motor thefts this year - bringing the total to 146,838. Modern car security functions have resulted in car thieves adopting more inventive means of stealing vehicles - some of which appear to be straight out of a movie script. Yellow Smart cars like the one pictured are avoided by thieves - they are the least likely to be stolen according to figures . Cases of ‘lifting’ - where the vehicle is lifted onto the back of a truck - have increased steadily since 2009, and accounted for around 12 per cent of car thefts in 2011 and 14 per cent of thefts so far in 2012. One criminal confessed: 'I’ve lifted cars in broad daylight. Flat bed truck and a luminous vest and people think you’re a clamper. They’re lifting more for tax and insurance now, so as long as you look the part no-one cares.' Many cars are now stolen to order, with criminals purposely targeting high-end makes and models, in popular colours. Angelina Jolie and Nicholas Cage's characters in the 2000 film Gone in Sixty Seconds are slow in comparison to the modern car thief who can steal a car in as little as ten seconds . According to thieves the most sought after cars are black Audis, silver and black BMWs with the least popular being yellow Smart cars. Thieves also keep their eyes peeled for features such as air conditioning, alloy wheels, CD players, metallic paint and integrated sat navs. The highest number of recorded car thefts by police force 2011/12: . The report adds that the majority of stolen cars are never recovered. A small number are sold directly to a UK buyer the thief knows or via an online auction site but most seem to disappear altogether. Many cars end up being stripped down into spare parts, 'a car is worth ten times more in bits than it is as a whole,' according to one criminal. Some cars are shipped overseas, mainly to Africa, in lead-lined containers that prevent tracker signals from working. John O’Roarke, Managing Director of LV= car insurance said: 'Improvements in car security mean that criminals now place a greater emphasis on stealing the keys rather than forcing the ignition. 'There are some basic things that motorists can do to try and prevent theft, such as parking in well lit areas, fitting the car with security devices, and keeping car keys out of sight and out of reach.'","New figures show that black Audis and black and silver BMWs are the most popular among car thieves .

Memorabilia belonging to hero British Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant Bob Poulton, pictured, who battled German Messerschmidts during the Battle of Britain in 1940 is due to be auctioned next month . A hero Spitfire pilot whose family were told he had been killed during World War 2 was actually in a POW camp - where he learned to paint, write poetry and kept a journal of his daily meals. Flight Lieutenant Bob Poulton was forced to parachute out of his cockpit as he fought with German fighter planes in 1944. British military officials informed his wife by telegram that the highly-decorated officer was dead and the family immediately went into mourning. But Bob had survived the leap and after he was found by the Germans with a broken leg he was taken to the notorious Stalig Luft 1 prisoner of war camp. During the next twelve months his family in Britain were distraught - while Bob made the most of his time in captivity in the camp in north Germany. He compiled a journal of his daily life listing every meal he had - including pancakes, toast, butter, coffee, spam, boiled potatoes, carrots, jam and lettuce. But he also began producing dozens of intricate pencil pictures - including sketches of planes flying overhead, watchtowers and fellow prisoners. Bob, of Liskeard, Cornwall, also began writing poems about his time at the camp which he kept throughout his incarceration. He was eventually released from the camp and returned home - to his overjoyed wife who had spent a year in grief. Bob was able to return home after Swiss officials brokered a deal for him to be exchanged with two German prisoners held in Britain. The family of Flight Lieutenant Bob Poulton, pictured (centre stradling plane) with airforce colleagues, were told that he had been killed while on a mission over France in 1944 . He was in fact alive in a POW camp where he learned to paint and write poetry and began keeping this journal of what food he ate and what the weather was like . Now a collection of memorabilia, including Flight Lieutenant Poulton's medals (pictured) are to be auctioned by his family . A collection of all his memorabilia including his medals, the telegram to his wife, his journal, pictures and poems are now being auctioned by the family. Bob’s son Jeremy, 51, of Caerleon, South Wales, said: 'The family had been told he was dead and obviously when he returned they were delighted. 'But he had clearly made the best of his time and drew pictures and wrote poems. Looking at the journal the food didn’t sound to bad either. A page from Bob Poulton's diary show how the POW learned to draw while in a German camp . Among the lots on offer at auction is this telegram addressed to the wife of Poulton falsely informing her of his death. The pair were reunited a year later when he was released and came home . 'He did say the camp was cold but he didn’t complain about it. He wasn’t tortured because they knew he didn’t have information.' Bob was born in Guilford, Surrey, in 1918, and was originally sent to the London Orphan School in Watford. Another page from Bob Poulton's journal which shows an illustration of the RAF crest will go under the hammer at Plymouth Auction Rooms next month . In 1938 he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve sharing a room with James Edgar Johnson, who later became the RAF’s best flying ace. Bob later became a top Spitfire pilot who won medals after downing four of the Nazi’s best Messerschmidt during the Battle of Britain in 1940. He was forced to parachute into German hands in March 1944 and he was taken to a Nazi interrogation centre and then Stalig Luft 1. Jeremy said his father was piloting a Spitfire escorting bombers on a raid over Fruges, Northern France, in 1944, when his plane’s engine started to overheat. He said: 'He turned to head back towards the coast, planning to bail out over the sea. 'But he had to parachute out at 800ft into a ploughed field. 'His leg got caught between his seat and his cockpit which left him with horrendous scars. And he broke his leg on impact. 'The Germans patched him up but his right leg didn’t heal properly and, until the day he died, it was one inch shorter than his left. He always had a limp.' Bob returned to his delighted wife Nancy in 1945 but sadly she later died of polio. He had son Jeremy with his second wife Anne. As well as drawing, Flight Lieutenant Poulton learned how to write poems, including this one, pictured, called Lest We Forget . His papers and medals will go under the hammer at Plymouth Auction Rooms on November 21 and are expected to fetch between £8,000 and £10,000. His medals include the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Battle of Britain Clasp, awarded to only 3,000 men. There is also a poignant album of photographs from 1939 to 1945, tracing his career and life from pets to colleagues. Auctioneer Paul Keen said: 'Bob Poulton was a remarkably brave man and we are privileged to handle and sell one of the finest sets of medals we have seen over the last 20 years.' Bob went on to be an air traffic controller for the RAF until he was 50, when he passed exams to do the same job at civilian airfields. He died, aged 79, at his home in Liskeard, Cornwall in 1998, leaving second wife, Anne who died last year, aged 86. Bob also left his three children with Nancy; Sally, 60, Penny, 65, and his now late son Anthony, 59. As well as Jeremy, Bob and Anne had a daughter, Amanda, 55. He had grandchildren and great-grandchildren, one of them named Nancy after his first wife. Bob Poulton's picture of a World War 2 plane taken from his diary.

Now you can as Britain's highest value car auction takes place next week. But it might set you back a pretty penny with 91 of the world's most coveted classic cars expected to fetch an astonishing £25 million when they go under the hammer at Battersea auction house RM Auctions' Automobiles of London. Britain's highest value car auction ever takes place in Battersea next Wednesday with 91 of the world's most coveted cars on sale. Pictured is the auction's most expensive lot, a 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Alloy Gullwing, worth £3.2 million. Among the lots on offer at RM Auctions Automobiles of London is this 1998 Ferrari F300 Formula One Racing car, worth £520,000 . On sale for an estimated £375,000 is this 1967 Aston Martin DB6 Shooting Brake produced from 1965 to 1971 . Among the dozens of motors on offer are top of the range Ferraris, Aston Martins and Mercedes expected to sell for mega money. Even a Ferrari Formula One car is up for auction and expected to fetch more than £500,000. The top lot is a very rare 1956 Mercedes 300 SL ‘Gullwing’, one of just 29 built, and one of the most iconic cars ever. Experts estimate the Mercedes, which has been fully restored, could fetch in excess of £3 million - PLUS a 12 per cent buyer’s premium. British made cars will also play a huge role at the auction with 11 classic Aston Martins including Paul McCartney’s old DB5 on sale at an estimated price of £380,000. It's not just classic cars on offer at the auction. This super rare 1926 Brough Superior SS100 Alpine Grand Sports is worth £300,000, one of 226 Brough Superior bikes produced that year . A 1967 Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman Limousine, worth £120,000 is up for grabs. Famous owners of the 600, though not necessarily this model, include Coco Chanel, Elizabeth Taylor and John Lennon . This stunning white 1952 Bentley Continental R-Type Fastback Sports Saloon by H.J. Mulliner & Co. could be yours for £675,000 . On top of that, there are also 11 Ferraris going under the hammer including a pristine 250 GT LWB ‘Tour de France’ with a £2.4 million guide price. This year has seen the classic car market continuing to show itself as an excellent prospect for investors with values of the finest motors up almost 19 per cent. Dietrich Hatlapa, from The Historic Automotive Group Index (HAGI), which monitors values in the classic car market has seen values skyrocket 63 per cent over the past five years. He said: 'Classic cars have been doing very well recently and this year there has been a double-digit increase in value. 'The increase doesn’t apply to all old models, but rare cars which are technically interesting and have a racing pedigree are doing well. Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney's old 1964 Aston Martin DB5 is on sale and is worth £380,000 . Pictured is a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT LWB Berlinetta 'Tour de France', worth £2.4 million, named after the 10-day Tour De France automobile race and not the bicycle event of the same name . This 1991 Citroen 2CV6 Charleston, is a snip at a mere £10,000. Versions of the 2CV were created by the French manufacturer from 1948 onwards . A real classic, this 1930 Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 GS Testa Fissa, is expected to be sold for £900,000 . 'But it is important to say though that the market is still dominated by enthusiasts rather than investors.' Some of the most interesting lots for sale at RM Auctions' Automobiles of London include: . Mr Hatlapa added: 'The Mercedes Gullwing, for example, is likely to sell considerably more than a normal Gullwing because it has an alloy body and there were just 29 made compared to more than 1,000 of the standard bodied cars.' The Battersea sale takes place on Wednesday with enthusiasts from all over the world expected to queue up to pay the £100 entry fee. This gets entry for two and a copy of the coffee table-style glossy book which lists every model from a £10,000 Citroen 2CV to £675,000 Bentley Fastback. Max Girardo, managing director, RM Europe said: 'The broad selection of marques and values represented in this year’s London sale is what really sets it apart from other collector car auctions. 'RM always succeeds in bringing together some of the world’s finest automobiles, and this year we have a large number of lots that represent a broad cross section of the collector car market and which have been drawn from every corner of the globe. 'This international capability is what really sets us apart in the marketplace.' Last year, the auction house sold 79 per cent of its 125-strong lot with sales totaling £13.3 million. In 2010, they managed £19.1 million with the Aston Martin DB5 driven by James Bond in Goldfinger selling for £2.9 million.","More than 90 of the world's most sought after motors go under the hammer in Battersea on Wednesday .

Make no bones about it, taxidermy enthusiast Alan Dudley has more than just the one skeleton in his closet - he has a jaw dropping collection of more than 2,000 skulls. Dad-of-three Alan has revealed his stockpile of animal skulls - thought to be one of the largest of its kind in the world - for a new book to be released later this month. The 55-year-old Jaguar Land Rover inspector's unassuming semi-detached house is home to a fascinating haul of taxidermy skulls and animals, with two rooms converted to showcase every weird and wonderful creature imaginable. Taxidermy enthusiast Alan Dudley has one of the world's largest collections of animal skulls displayed at his home in Coventry . The collection, pictured, includes more than 2,000 different skulls from animals as small as the common rat to much more exotic creatures such as a giraffe skull . He said: 'You name it, I’ve got it, I’ll take any skull - as long as it’s not human.' Glass cabinets proudly display Mr Dudley's morbid menagerie of beasts of all shapes and sizes, ranging from tiny rat and guinea pig skulls to more exotic creatures such as hippos, giraffes and crocodiles. A two-headed cow’s skull is among the collection on display, one of the many items donated by zoos in return for his work preserving animal skulls for their educational centres. He began assembling his collection 12 years ago after he became fascinated with nature and collecting bird eggs as a youngster. Alan's collection, which includes the skulls pictured, was nearly seized by police two years ago when his home was raided and he was charged with failing to have the proper licenses to trade in endangered creatures . Since the subsequent court case Alan's bizarre collection, pictured with its owner, has attracted the attention of a book publisher and TV producers . But his unusual hobby landed him in hot water two years ago when his home was raided and he wound up in court charged with failing to have the proper licenses to trade in endangered species. Recalling the night when officers raided his home, he said: 'It was terrifying. I was in bed when my son woke me up to say four police officers were at the front door - they had a warrant to search every room of the house.' 'I was scared because there was talk of them taking my entire collection. In the end they locked the room and took the key. Alan, pictured with his collection, began assembling the 2,000 plus skulls when he became interested in nature and animal eggs as a youngster . 'I think they realised how much there was and didn’t want the hassle of packing it away.' While they were at the property officers found a tiger cub carcass in his freezer. Alan was arrested but it was another two years before the high-profile case was heard at Coventry Crown Court and he received a £1,000 fine and a suspended jail sentence. He added: 'It was an honest mistake, but I know I should have had the licence. 'I was going through a difficult time because my wife had walked out and my head was all over the place. 'It’s a lesson I’ve learned but a lesson I learned the hard way.' The court case attracted the attention of a publishing firm who are now due to release an illustrated book based on Alan's collection and called Skulls: An Exploration of Alan Dudley's Curious Collection. A mobile phone app about his collection was also launched with some success and a television programme is in the pipeline. Alan said: 'Most of my family and friends think the collection’s fascinating. Some think it’s a bit strange. At the end of the day, the work I do is exactly what you’d find being done in museums. 'The only difference is I’m doing this in my house.' The book, An Exploration Of Alan Dudley’s Curious Collection, written by Simon Winchester, is available to order online and from book shops. Alan, pictured with a skull, says that his hobby is no different to what is done in museums around the world except that he does it in his own home .","Father-of-three Alan Dudley has been showing off his collection of skulls for a new book .

Hawaii has made history electing America’s first ever Hindu to the House of Representatives. Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, 31, defeated K. Crowley of the Republican Party by a strong margin in Hawaii’s second Congressional district. She is also the first female combat veteran to serve in Congress. Scroll down to see one of her first campaign ads . Making history: Democrat Tulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu to be elected to the US Congress . It is thought that as a practising Hindu, Ms Gabbard is likely to take her oath over the sacred text for her religion – the Bhagavad Gita – rather than the Bible. Proud of her Hindu religion, she is not Indian or of Indian heritage. Ms Gabbard was born in American Samoa to a Catholic father - Hawaii State Senator Mike Gabbard - and a Hindu mother. She moved to Hawaii when she was two and fully embraced her religion as a teenager. Ms Gabbard first ran for office at age 21 and then voluntarily served a 12-month tour of duty with Hawaii’s National Guard after her first term, and became the first woman in the history of the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy to be designated a ‘distinguished honor graduate’. Sacred text: It is thought Tulsi Gabbard will say her oath over the Bhagavad Gita, the holy scripture of Hinduism . In 2004 she was deployed to Baghdad as a medical operations specialist and was deployed to Kuwait in 2008 to train the country's counter-terrorism units. Her victory has been cheered by the Hindu-American community across the country. She also hopes her faith will help to encourage stronger ties with India, where the majority of the population is Hindu. 'It is clear that there needs to be a closer working relationship between the United States and India. How can we have a close relationship if decision-makers in Washington know very little, if anything, about the religious beliefs, values, and practices of India's 800 million Hindus?' Ms Gabbard asked, according to the Religion News Service news agency. Ms Gabbard said her faith helped her through Iraq, where there were daily reminders that she could be killed any time, according to the Huffington Post. 'First thing in the morning and the last thing at night, I meditated upon the fact that my essence was spirit, not matter, that I was not my physical body, and that I didn't need to worry about death because I knew that I would continue to exist and I knew that I would be going to God,' she said. While the Democrat has welcomed Indian-American support, her campaign pointed out that their contributions account for less than three per cent of the total it has raised. In a statement soon after her victory, Ms Gabbard said: 'On my last trip to the mainland, I met a man who told me that his teenage daughter felt embarrassed about her faith, but after meeting me, she's no longer feeling that way. 'He was so happy that my being elected to Congress would give hope to hundreds and thousands of young Hindus in America, that they can be open about their faith, and even run for office, without fear of being discriminated against or attacked because of their religion.’","Tulsi Gabbard, 31, is also the first female combat veteran to serve in Congress .

Unprovoked: Angela Gray, 44, was left permanently scarred in the unprovoked attack by 20-year-old Jade Daniels . A charity fund-raiser who was brutally smashed in the face with a brick has hit out at the justice system as her attacker walked free from court. Angela Gray, 44, was left permanently scarred in the unprovoked attack by 20-year-old Jade Daniels. Daniels, who has a string of previous convictions, initially pleaded guilty to wounding . with intent after she slammed a brick into Mrs Gray's face. But after Daniels was diagnosed . with ‘high-functioning autism’ the charge was downgraded to the less serious offence . of unlawfully causing grievous bodily harm. Now Mrs Gray, from Urmston, says she feels she has been attacked twice - ‘once by her, and once by the judicial system’. Mrs Gray was attacked while she was walking with her daughter Danielle, 28, in woodland near Dutton’s Pond in Flixton, in March last year. Daniels, of Arundel Avenue, Urmston, ‘slammed’ a brick into Mrs Gray’s face, breaking her nose and wrist, and splitting her lip leaving her with a permanent scar. But as she had already been in custody for around 15 months - longer than the statutory prison sentence for the assault - she was released following a hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Gray said the ordeal had been made worse by having to wait 18 months for her attacker to be sentenced. She said: 'It feels like you get attacked twice - once by her, and once by the judicial system. 'She has walked away from court but I will never be able to walk away from what happened. Never. I don’t feel safe knowing she’s out there and I don’t think anyone else should.' Reliving the attack, Mrs Gray said: 'We ran up a hill and saw that a large bush had been set on fire, and there was a girl and a boy just looking at it. 'The boy ran away but the girl just stood there and watched us trying to put it out. We managed to stamp it out and we called the fire brigade to let them know. 'There were matches on the floor so I picked them up. She started shouting at me to give them back. She followed us and at first we just ignored her. 'She picked up a brick and I told her not to be ridiculous and to put it down. 'She ran at me like a child would, as if to scare me, but I stood my ground. 'I turned away and I heard her coming at me again. As I turned back she hit me full in the face and knocked me off my feet.' Daniels was arrested after Mrs Gray and her husband later spotted her at a bus stop and called the police. Scarred and scared: The mother (pictured left) suffered permanent nerve damage to her face, and has had a number of operations since the attack. Right, her attacker Jade Daniels walks free from court. Daniels, who has convictions for harassment and criminal damage, had been released after attacking Mrs Gray, but was taken into custody for breach of bail conditions. Just weeks after the attack she carried out a campaign of harassment against a pensioner that included sending 13 takeaways to his home in one night. Mrs Gray, 44, who is fundraising manager at Beechwood Cancer Care in Stockport, also suffered permanent nerve damage to her face, and has had a number of operations. Judge Peter Lakin said it was clear Daniels’ autism was the ‘driving force’ behind the offence. He said: 'I must ensure as far as I can that no one else is subjected by you to the type of offence that Mrs Gray has suffered. 'This attack has had both a physical and psychological impact on Mrs Gray, and I suspect that she will live with the memory of what happened for the rest of her life.' He ordered that Daniels be made the subject of a three-year community order. The judge also ordered probation to provide him with regular reports on Daniels’ progress, and imposed an order preventing her from contacting Mrs Gray or her daughter. He warned Daniels she would be jailed without hesitation if she breached the order or failed to co-operate with treatment.","Angela Gray, 44, was left permanently scarred in the attack .

One of the other archived letters was . from Robert Baden-Powell who seven years earlier, when he founded the . Scout movement, selected their 15-year-old son for the first camp on . Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset. The pair later travelled to America to give talks on the Scouts before the outbreak of the First World War. Baden-Powell . wrote: 'I have felt as nearly as possible like a second father to him . and to read the little testimonies to Bob’s character...is the greatest . possible comfort. 'I am so glad he had made his mark already before he died. That must be some comfort to you and to his mother.' Another letter was from Lt Wroughton’s sergeant major who enclosed a photograph of his grave at Ypres with it. Sgt . Maj Lockyer wrote: 'He was such a brave young officer. Sgt Stone & I . carried him to a place of cover, his last words to me were ‘never mind . me Sgt Major, look after yourself.' The archive, that also includes Lt Wroughton’s identity tags, is now being sold at auction with a pre-sale estimate of £1,000. Richard . Westwood-Brookes, of auctioneers Mullocks of Shropshire, said: 'What . comes out of these letters is how this young man was a hero. 'He thought more of his servant and his horse than he did for his own safety. 'The . spirit of comradeship and self-sacrifice is the philosophy of the Scout . movement and clearly Baden-Powell instilled that belief in Bob . Wroughton.

Plan scuppered: Kim Collins staged a CSI style break-in to convince her boyfriend they should move house . A landlady sparked a huge police operation after binding and gagging herself in a staged ‘CSI-style' break in to persuade her boyfriend they should move house. Kim Collins was rescued by special officers and police dog team and a police helicopter was scrambled after a cleaner found her bound and gagged in the Big Club in Boldon Colliery, South Tyneside. South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court heard how Collins was tied to a chair with tape over her mouth, cable ties around her wrists and cuts to her arms and legs. She told the cleaner a masked man had woken her in the night, tied her up before snorting a bag of cocaine, emptying the safe and disappearing. But after detectives found holes in her story, she admitted to making the whole thing up to try to convince her boyfriend and business partner that they should sell the club and move away. Collins, from Boldon Colliery, claimed inspiration for the bizarre plan from watching CSI programmes. Paul Anderson, prosecuting, said: 'Last November, she called police to say she  was receiving abusive letters at the club which threatened to kill her. 'They were sent for forensic tests but nothing came back, though she said the letters were still being sent. 'Then on June 17, the police were called by the cleaner, who said she had found Collins tied up with a bag of cocaine near her. 'Collins had told her that someone had been in the loft waiting for her.' Mr Anderson told the court that 12 officers went to the club and were told by Collins that the intruder might still be there. A police dog team and scene of crime officers were sent to the scene and a helicopter scrambled to the area. Mr Anderson added: 'She had cuts to her arms and legs and said the man had cut her and ran the knife across her body. 'She was taken to hospital for treatment. Scene of the made up crime: Kim Collins claimed a marked man had tied her up and emptied the safe at the Big Club in Boldon Colliery, South Tyneside . 'The defendant told the Major Crime Team that she had been asleep in bed when a man had come in and dragged her along the corridor to turn off the alarm and black out the security cameras before tying her up.' But investigations revealed that the alarm had been deactivated just 40 minutes before the cleaner turned up and CCTV from outside the club didn’t show anyone else entering. Her saliva was found on the cable ties that had been used to bind her wrists and a pathologist said the injuries could have been self-inflicted. The court heard that Collins found a bag of cocaine in the club the night before and put it in the safe with the intention of telling the police about it later. Ideas: Kim Collins said she was inspired by the television series CSI. Here in an episode of CSI: Miami Ryan (Jonathan Togo) is kidnapped and bound with tape . She said the masked raider had brought it as an excuse for having it in the club. Collins was arrested in September and admitted she concocted the tale because she wanted to leave the club. Mr Anderson added: 'She said takings were down and she wanted out. 'She said she wanted to show her partner how bad things were so that he would agree to sell up, and so started to send herself the letters. 'When that didn’t work, she came up with the plan to stage a break-in after watching CSI. Viewer: Kim Collins said she had come up with the plan after watching an episode of CSI . 'She said she cut herself, tied her legs together then used her mouth to tie the cable ties before putting gaffer tape over her mouth and waiting for the cleaner. 'More than £1,000 was spent on the investigation but it is harder to quantify what the total cost was including launching the helicopter and the man hours put in.' Collins pleaded guilty to wasting police time and possessing a Class A drug when she appeared at court today. David Forrester, defending, said: 'This lady clearly thought this was a good idea in the short term but hadn’t realised how the police would deal with it.' Magistrates adjourned the case until November 16 for Collins to be interviewed by a community psychiatric nurse and be interviewed by the probation service. She was granted unconditional bail until then.

Jailed: Margaret Bailey, a dinner lady who worked her way up to secretary has been jailed after she cooked the books - and pocketed up to £90,000 of school funds . A former dinner lady who stole up to £89,000 by cooking the books at the primary school where she worked for 10 years has been jailed. Margaret Bailey, 51, deviously siphoned tens of thousands from school accounts over a six year period in order to fund a global property empire. She then used the cash, which had been set aside for school trips, meals and Christmas parties, to put deposits on houses in the U.S. and Bulgaria, as well as several UK properties. The mother, who was described as the 'life and soul' of Endon Hall Primary School in Endon, Staffordshire, started stealing cash in 2005 after she was promoted from dinner lady to office support manager, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. Bailey was jailed for two-and-a-half years after she pleaded guilty to four charges of theft, two of fraud and one of false accounting on Monday. Sentencing Bailey, Judge Granville Styler told her: 'The consequences of your dishonesty have been devastating for you. 'You’ve lost your job and family, and suffered humiliation in the community. 'But that humiliation is richly deserved.' Bailey worked at the tiny village school for ten years but used her position to access various accounts including PTA cash and money belonging to Staffordshire County Council. She wrote out cheques to herself and members of her family before moving money around the accounts to cover her tracks. Bailey was arrested last December after education chiefs spotted irregularities in the accounts. The court heard Bailey, from Brown Edge, Staffordshire, stole between £63,000 and £89,000 - although audits have been unable to determine the exact figure. Fiona Cortese, prosecuting, said: 'She said that everything was true and she was glad that it was all out in the open as it had been making her ill. 'She said she had bills to pay at home and it had just snowballed.' In an open letter to the court, Bailey said her crimes had caused her to 'lose everything.'

'I don’t ask the court or my family to forgive me because I do not forgive myself. 'I will live with the pain and terrible feeling of loss until the day I die.' Jason Holt, defending, said Bailey had become estranged from her family as a result of her actions. He said: 'Her children don’t want to know her. She’s lost her husband. 'They are separated and planning to divorce. 'She is left at 51 with no-one and has only herself to blame.' Headteacher Vicki Lewis condemned Bailey. She said:  'Margaret was well-liked and respected by everyone at Endon Hall. 'The whole school has been absolutely shattered by this betrayal of trust. 'During the 10 years that she worked here, Margaret was known as the ‘life and soul’ of the school, often giving up her own time to support fund-raising events and never taking a day off work. 'We now know she was systematically stealing sums of money, and meticulously covering her tracks, by switching money around so the accounts always appeared in order. ' 'Margaret not only abused her position of trust as an employee, but has also ruthlessly deprived pupils of the money raised by hard-working parents.'

A Royal Navy veteran who lost a leg says he has been turned down for more than 2,600 jobs in a year because of his disability. Former petty officer Mark Cock, 45, had his limb amputated following an horrific car accident and says that employers cannot look past the fact he is disabled. He lost the leg in 1995 and started his own business but was forced to start looking for work following the recession. Struggle: Navy veteran and amputee Mark Cock with some of his many rejection letters for the 2,600 jobs he has not got in the past year . But the father-of-four says since he stared looking last October he has been rejected from more than 2,600 jobs. He is trained in IT and has worked in the motorcycle industry and has applied for hundreds of different jobs directly and through work agencies. But he says employers are scared of recruiting him because they fear it could mean paying higher insurance premiums or making expensive modifications to offices. Mark, of Camborne, Cornwall, is calling for the Government to do more to help the disabled find work. Decorated: Mark Cock from his days in the Royal Navy but since then he has fallen on hard times . He said: 'This is a nightmare because I feel I am fitter than many able-bodied people and yet the door is being slammed in my face. 'I want to work and don’t like taking benefits because I have worked all my life. It makes me angry. 'They want people with a disability to get back to work but if the insurance is astronomically high, how can they do that? 'I am not blaming the companies just trying to keep their businesses in the black.' Divorced Mark lost his right leg after being in a car crash soon after he left the Navy in 1995. Since then he has worked in IT and most recently been running his own business importing motorcycles. But the recession forced him to seek new employment and since October last year Mr Cock says he has been refused over 2,600 jobs. He has applied for IT jobs nationwide and abroad with no luck and has now begun a two-year plumbing course. But he says he has also failed to find a job as an apprentice plumber because of his disability. He said: 'I wanted to add another string to my bow because I had so many knockbacks. 'Now I have been told by companies I have approached for apprenticeships that they cannot employ me because it would cost too much to insure me because of my disability. 'Without an apprenticeship, I will fail my course.' Passionate: Mark fears he and thousands of others with disabilities could be declared fit for work in the benefits overhaul, but will be unable to find jobs and lose their benefits . A spokesman for Disability Cornwall said the legality of potentially discriminating against Mr Cock should be investigated. Mark is now urging other disabled people to lobby with him against the imminent changes in disability benefits. He said: 'I want the Government to step in and do something about it before the disability pension is being taken away from some people in April. 'The more people can create noise the better so we can approach MPs and ask them to help us.'","Mark Cock, 45, lost his leg in a horrific car crash in 2005 .

The Prince was visiting the farm to learn how the Thornbury family produce highly-prized merino wool, used to make luxury knitwear, jumpers and cloth for Italian suits - and even tried his hand at fleece-throwing. He was sporting a grey pin-stripe double-breasted suit by Anderson & Sheppard, made, appropriately, from a rare quality of Australian Merino wool.

Alongside farm manager Brent Thornbury, the Duke of Cornwall watched as the sheep were moved along a narrow run into a pen before going into a shed where they would be sheared. One enthusiastic farm dog called Zig, an Australian kelpie, jumped up and ran on to the backs of the sheep, which then began leaping into the air. Give it some welly! Prince Charles throws a fleece onto the table during the visit to the sheep farm, remarking afterwards: 'I didn't do it well' Inside the shearing shed, which had a corrugated iron roof and smelled strongly of sheep droppings, the Prince and Mr Thornbury watched shearers expertly snip off fleeces in three minutes. Lucy Byers, 35, was gathering up the wool and skilfully tossing it on to a table to be graded by other workers.

Truffles will now put his paws up for retirement at the age of four, confident that his 48cm mark will finally prove too much for his competition around the world.

When they succeeded, Truffles' owner, Chloe Macari, 14, and her sister Nicole had to find a new delicacy that would encourage the guinea pig to jump further for. So the boring old cucumber that tempted Truffles to set the 30cm record was replaced by curly kale, a form of cabbage.

However in passing sentence Michael Gledhill told Scouler and Potter: 'The trust that society places in their police officers is vitally important to everyone. 'When that trust is broken by rogue officers as you became public . confidence is eroded, it makes the job of honest officers far more . difficult, and it seriously undermines society.' He said CCTV footage, which had been shown to the jury, clearly showed the 'thoroughly unprofessional' way the officers conducted themselves during the search. The judge added: 'Why did you steal the money? The answer, certainly in your case Ian Scouler, is simply greed, perhaps both greed and stupidity in your case Kenneth Potter.' He said the officers took the cash . believing the suspect, whose home they thought they were searching, was . an illegal immigrant who was unlikely to return to the flat or make a complaint. He added: 'The pair of you were or are bad apples who have tarnished the . reputation of the Metropolitan Police and the thousands of officers who . do their job honestly on behalf of the public they serve,' he said. 'It gives me no . absolutely pleasure to consider the consequences to yourselves, your . families, and your friends.' In passing sentence Judge Michael Gledhill described Scouler and Potter as 'bad apples' Potter also pleaded guilty to handling a mobile phone stolen during a search in 2010 belonging to Fadima Abhdoom. Prosecutor Nick Corsellis said Potter had 'used the phone for a short time thereafter, selling it online'. Mr Corsellis explained that Scouler was caught out after the mock crime scene was set up as part of an 'integrity test' The flat in New Eltham, was fitted with audio and video recording equipment and the pair long with PcThompson were told to search the flat in connection with a series of robberies. The recording of the search showed police officers playing music, using coarse language - and even stopping to browse a pornography magazine they found. After pocketing the cash, Scouler was videoed going into the kitchen where he spoke to Pc Thompson who had just discovered 200 Euros, which was also planted in the flat. They both paused and looked at each other before Scouler quipped: 'It's not divisible by three.' Under police procedural rules all discoveries should be announced, placed in an exhibit bag, logged, and then handed over to a superior. Mr Corsellis said that several items were bagged, logged, and passed on, but the cash was not. Scouler was arrested early the next day on suspicion of theft where officers discovered the £400 was still in his pocket. Scouler was sentenced to 12 months while Potter was given a five month jail term at Southwark Crown Court . In a prepared statement Scouler said he had believed that that there was approximately £200 in the jacket pocket, but had forgotten putting it in his own pocket until he had left to go home. He said: 'I considered going back to the police station so drove past my house. 'I then changed my mind and decided I would sort it out in the morning. 'It was a genuine error on my part. I completely forgot about the cash. There was never any intention to steal it.'","Ian Scouler targeted after complaints about alleged thefts by officers during searches .

Tragic: Andrew Holt had only married Lydia nine months before he collapsed and died from a rare heart condition while playing football . A newlywed husband collapsed and died aged just 23 from a previously undiagnosed heart defect whilst playing football with his friends. Andrew Holt was taking part in a five-a-side match when he suffered a cardiac arrest and fell to the ground. Staff at a leisure centre where the Stockport, Greater Manchester resident, was playing battled to save him but he died later in hospital. An inquest was told Mr Holt, an insurance administrator,  had only married wife Lydia nine months before his death on April 16. He never knew he had been suffering throughout his life from a rare condition which affects only one in 500,000 people. The condition known as anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) - meant a main blood vessel to one of the heart's chambers was not carrying oxygen-rich blood. The Stockport hearing was told inquest heard how Mr Holt, who worked for Swinton Insurance in Manchester, was a 'fit and healthy young man' apart from the ALCAPA. He loved football and would play up to three times a week. Tragedy struck when he was taking part with friends in a regular five-a-side match at Priestnall School in Stockport. Dr Mary Shepperd, a consultant cardiopathologist, told the court that the condition did not show any symptoms and usually became apparent when people suddenly died, often during childhood. She added that Mr Holt's heart had compensated over the years but the congenital defect meant one of the chambers had become scarred, eventually leading to cardiac arrest. Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Deputy coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'He lived a life for 23 years with a very serious condition, completely unaware and with no symptoms. It was a rare condition that was no doubt the cause of his death.' After the inquest Mr Holt's family said in a statement: 'We are still absolutely devastated and in shock and find it very difficult to carry on without him. 'He was a warm and very caring person, he really loved people and was always willing to help. 'He was held in high regard and with such warm affection by so many people.' At the time of his death, it emerged Mr Holt had become an uncle for the first time just a few hours before he died after his brother Nathan had a son. Mr Holt (top left) was an avid footballer and played up to three times a week. His heart condition only affects one in every half a million . Friend Liam Mcleod said: 'He will always be remembered for his loving personality and amazingly funny sense of humour, making everyone he knew laugh. 'Everyone who knew him will have a special place in their heart for Andy because of how loving, special and funny he really was. His unforgettable smile that was so cheeky and charming. 'He really was a loving and devoted husband, a treasured and affectionate son, an incredibly loved brother and an amazing friend to have. 'Anyone who knew him was blessed to have spent time with him. We miss you Andy and we will always love you. My personal love goes out to his friends, family and his wife.' In a joint statement, Stockport council said: 'Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of the young man following this tragic event.' Carolyn Callan, director of Swinton commercial where Mr Holt worked said: 'We are absolutely devastated. Andy was an all-round lovely guy. 'Nothing was ever too much trouble for him.

Seat belts on aeroplanes are pointless and will not save passengers in a crash, the chief executive of Ryanair has claimed. Michael O'Leary claims legislation forcing passengers to wear seat belts is unnecessary and wants to introduce 'standing room only' sections on flights. 'Seat belts don't matter,' O'Leary said. Outspoken: Michael O'Leary says seatbelts on planes are 'useless' and aviation authorities are using outdated thinking . 'You don't need a seatbelt on the London Underground. You don't need a seatbelt on trains which are travelling at 120mph and if they crash you're all dead,' he added. He told the Telegraph that the argument that seatbelts can stop injuries during turbulence doesn't apply as Europe doesn't have areas of excessive turbulence. According to the newspaper, O'Leary's remarks came as he attempts to make low-cost 'standing room only' cabins a reality. He says he is being obstructed by aviation authorities, who he branded 'plonkers'. He has suggested removing the back ten rows of seats in aircraft, allowing groups of less discerning travellers to commute to their destination on their feet for as little as £1. He added: 'The problem with aviation is that for 50 years it's been populated by people who think it's a wondrous sexual experience... when it's really just a bus with wings.'

Border chiefs were today accused of ‘camouflaging’ the true scale of an immigration backlog that was ‘spiralling out of control.’ The total number of immigration and asylum cases which have not been processed by the UK Border Agency now stands at more than 300,000 - the equivalent of a city the size of Sunderland - or the entire population of Iceland, the Home Affairs Committee said. And it has also emerged that the UK Border Agency is set to grant an ‘amnesty’ to some 80,000 migrants as it struggles with a spiralling backlog of immigration cases. Out of control: More than 300,000 immigration and asylum cases have not been processed by the UK Border Agency . Keith Vaz, the committee’s chairman,  yesterday demanded bosses at UKBA ‘get a grip’ on the scale of the backlog - and accused them of trying to disguise the problems from the public. Mr Vaz said: ‘Entering the world of the UKBA is like falling through the looking glass. ‘The closer we look the more backlogs we find, their existence obscured by opaque names such as the ‘migration refusal pool’ and the ‘controlled archive’. ‘UKBA must adopt a transparent and robust approach to tackling this problem instead of creating new ways of camouflaging backlogs. ‘They need to get a grip.’ 'Get a grip': Keith Vaz demanded bosses work on reducing the scale of the backlog . Mr Vaz added: ‘There are now about the same number of cases awaiting resolution by UKBA as there are people living in Iceland. ‘The backlog is spiralling out of control.’ The UK Border Agency is set to write off around 80,000 cases where they have been unable to track missing migrants for more than six years. The cases are what remains from nearly half a million found abandoned in boxes at the Home Office in 2006 in a major scandal. The controlled archive was created to hold what remains of Labour’s asylum backlog. It was intended to hold cases that had not been concluded, so they could be re-opened if the person was found. Since then UKBA officials have been tracking them down - but recently admitted they would abandon those they couldn’t find. In September, Border Agency chief executive Rob Whiteman said it was ‘not in the best interests of taxpayers’ to carry on looking for them, and the cases would be closed. Around 80,000 are expected to be written off in the New Year. The committee said they were ‘concerned’ that the closure of the 80,000 files would result in ‘a significant number of people being granted effective amnesty in the United Kingdom, irrespective of the merits of their case.’ At the end of June this year, the UK Border Agency had a total of 302,064 cases outstanding, today’s report shows. That includes 25,000 current asylum cases, 3,500 current immigration cases, and 95,000 archived cases. Worryingly, the numbers within the Migration Refusal Pool reached 174,057 - a rise of 24,057 in just three months. The pool is made up of legal migrants whose work or student visas have expired and who cannot be found. The Border Agency has awarded a £30million contract to outsourcing firm Capita to help track them down. It began work at the end of October. 'Not fit for purpose': Former Home Secretary John Reid thought the immigration system was not operating as it should six years ago . Also within the backlog are 3,954 foreign criminals who cannot be deported and have been released on bail by the courts. Overall, the backlog grew by nine per cent in the three months to June this year. Six years ago the asylum backlog scandal prompted then Home Secretary John Reid to brand the immigration system ‘not fit for purpose’. Border officials claim that in many of the cases which remain the individuals will have left the country. But the MPs said they were ‘not convinced that the agency’s limited checking regime will have picked up all of the applicants who remain in the country’. ‘For this reason we are concerned that the final checks made on these cases should be thorough and that they should not be rushed to meet an artificial deadline.’ Of the asylum archive cases that have been processed, fewer than one in ten have been removed. More than 180,000 have been given the right to stay in the country, while just 41,300 have been kicked out or left voluntarily. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘This report raises some legitimate concerns but we are taking robust action and it is working. ‘Every day it gets harder to live illegally in the UK - we are tracking people down and taking action against them. We are restricting access to benefits, free healthcare and financial products, and businesses can be fined up to £10,000 for every illegal worker they employ. ‘We are winning more deportation cases in the courts, exceeding visa processing targets and have introduced interviews to test whether foreign students are genuine - all of which are praised in this report.’","Total number of unprocessed cases stands at more than 300,000 .

Lady Rendlesham's grandson was found hanged in his family's London town house after reading Brave New World. Clare Rendlesham, pictured, was a former Vogue editor . The grandson of former Vogue editor Clare Rendlesham was found hanged after reading Aldous Huxley's Brave New World novel. Maximillian Bromage’s body was discovered in August after spending the weekend alone in his family’s London town house. The 19-year-old, described as a ‘deep . thinker’, died just a week after enjoying a weekend with his parents at . their home in Wales, an inquest heard today. His father, Charles Bromage, told . Westminster Coroner’s Court a copy of Aldous Huxley novel Brave New . World was found in Maximillian’s bedroom after his death. He said: ‘He had obviously been reading it that evening, and unfortunately it has a similar ending.' In the novel, John, dubbed 'the Savage' is found hanged in his lighthouse retreat. Maximillian’s grandmother, fashion pioneer Lady . Rendlesham, made her name working for Vogue during the Swinging . Sixties, and went on to open the first Yves Saint Laurent store in the . UK, in Bond Street. Her . daughter Jaqumine, Maximillian’s mother, followed in her footsteps, . working as a director for Yves Saint Laurent until 1999 before setting . up business with her husband. Mrs Bromage said this morning they . had hoped Maximillian, who had shown a flair for fashion and design, . would follow them into the family business. She said: ‘You always hope if you have a business your child goes into it, and the opportunity was there if he wished.' The family saw no signs Maximillian was unhappy, and they have been ‘deeply affected’ by his death. She added: 'We had absolutely no inclination whatsoever. ‘At the weekend, he was on very good form, helping me cook and running with my husband. ‘Looking back at things, we had absolutely no idea.’ Maximillian had been reading Brave New World just before he was found hanged. The main character is found hanging at the end . Maximillian, a student at Aberwysth, had visited the family home in Presteigne, Powys, the weekend before he died. A sports enthusiast, he enjoyed running, climbing, hunting, and kickboxing, and had been skiing since the age of three. ‘He was completely flawless and was prepared to stand his ground for whatever he felt was right’, said coroners officer Lynda Morris reading a family background statement. ‘He had every opportunity in life he could ever have wished for.’ Maximillian was due to do work experience with the family firm, Indigo Investment Services Ltd when he died, on August 6 this year. He had travelled back to London from Wales a few days earlier, and was due to go to a concert with his girlfriend Cammie the day after he was found dead. His father said the couple had a ‘volatile’ relationship, and Maximillian had spoken to her for 20 minutes just after midnight the night he died. ‘I asked her if she was going out with Max and she said yes’, Mr Bromage said of the call he made to Cammie shortly after learning of his son’s death. ‘I think if she had thought otherwise, she wouldn’t have made that statement. ‘She has been deeply upset by it.’ Maximillian had been staying his paternal grandparent’s London home in Knightsbridge, when he died. Decorator Nigel Hall, a family friend for 15 years, entered the home at 9.30am to collect some tools and found Maximillian’s lifeless body on the first floor. PC Cherelle Roberts, the first officer on the scene, said there was no suicide note, and his laptop and mobile phone did not have any significant clues. She added of two note books found in his bedroom: ‘The large note book contained many love letters between Maximillian and his girlfriend Cammie. ‘The small note book was more of a diary of Maximillian’s feelings over the last six months or so before his death.’ Fashion pioneer Lady Rendlesham, pictured, went on to open the first Yves Saint Laurent store in the UK, in Bond Street. Her daughter Jaqumine, Maximillian¿s mother, followed in her footsteps . ‘But there was nothing dated from that day or indications of how his mind-set was leading up to it.’ The inquest heard Maximillian grew up in Notting Hill Gate, west London, before the family moved to Wiltshire when he was eight-years-old. He was educated at Summerfield School in Oxfordshire and then chose to go to Shrewsbury School instead of Eton College. He was tutored for his A Levels at Oxbridge, getting the grades to go to university to study International Relations and Strategic Studies, but was hoping to retake his A Levels to get better grades when he died. He had spent months in Nepal teaching English to children in late 2011 before returning to the UK. Assistant Deputy Coroner Darren Stewart returned an open verdict, after ruling he could not be sure Maximillian had meant to kill himself. ‘He had a volatile relationship with his girlfriend, he was making plans into the future, and this was reflected in the mood swings he documented himself in the notebook’, he said. ‘All this suggests this is a case where other explanations are possible that might explain his actions on the day in question.’ The post mortem ruled Maximillian Bromage, of Powys, died of hanging.","19-year-old, described as 'deep thinker' died after spending weekend alone .

Barack Obama pictured with rock singer Bruce Springsteen at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin yesterday . Barack Obama pledged to be the champion of America’s embattled  middle class in a desperate last-minute pitch for votes before the country goes to the polls today in one of the closest ever presidential elections. His chances of a second term were boosted last night after a final Washington Post-ABC News poll gave him a three point lead, at 50 per cent of the national vote, ahead of his Republican challenger Mitt Romney on 47 per cent. Earlier yesterday, however, polls by Gallup and Rasmussen both put Mr Romney on 49 per cent and Mr Obama on 48 per cent. The President used a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, to deliver some of the soaring rhetoric which propelled him to power in 2008, but which now rings hollow for many voters. He promised that he would use a second presidential term to fight for a more equitable America against opponents who sought only to help the rich elites. ‘I’m not ready to give up the fight for the middle classes,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you have to fight, stand on principle.’ Mr Obama was joined on stage by rock star Bruce Springsteen, one of nearly 200 celebrities who answered an 11th-hour Democrat call to arms. With many Obama supporters feeling distinctly underwhelmed by his candidacy this time, the Democrats have relied on stars and public figures to help drum up excitement and get people out to vote. They include pop stars such as Lady Gaga and Jay-Z, and actors Anne Hathaway, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L Jackson. While many confined their aid to talking to radio shows some, such as actor Danny DeVito in Wisconsin, have been out canvassing, making phone calls and visiting local colleges. With the 17-month, £1.9billion election campaign – the most expensive ever – boiling down to the outcome in a handful of swing states and  one, Ohio, in particular, both candidates pulled out all the stops in the final hours.

Between the candidates and their two aspiring vice-presidents, they criss-crossed the country, taking part in 14 events across eight states. The President also visited Ohio and Iowa. Mitt Romney was in Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire as well as Ohio. Mr Romney rubbished Mr Obama’s economic record and his claim to have helped the middle class, which he said was ‘being squeezed’ with high unemployment as well as rising prices for everything from insurance to petrol. ‘Do you want four more years like the last four years?’ he asked a crowd in Lynchburg, Virginia. Ramming home his determination to create jobs and slash government spending, he said: ‘My vision is to limit government rather than limit the dreams of our fellow Americans.’ The election hangs on a knife edge. All predictions show there is barely any difference in support and this could be the closest contest since George W Bush took on Al Gore in 2000. However, the Obama camp has been buoyed by electoral number-crunching which gives him the edge in winning most of the crucial ‘battleground’ states. It is also becoming clear that Mr Obama may have benefited in the polls from Superstorm Sandy which not only showed him handling the devastation but also kept Mr Romney out of the public eye for three crucial days. What remains certain is that neither contender is going to receive a ringing endorsement from the electorate, as Mr Obama did four years ago. Both men will know that as many Americans will have voted against them as voted for them. The pair’s choice of stops on their final day of campaigning emphasised where they believe they might clinch the election, with Mr Obama concentrating on the Midwest and Mr Romney on the south. Neither passed up on a chance to re-visit Ohio – for Mr Romney, his 44th visit during the campaign. The industrial Midwestern state has picked the winner of the past 12 elections and no Republican has clinched the White House without winning Ohio. Visiting Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa yesterday Mr Obama concentrated on shoring up what he has called the ‘firewall’ of battleground Midwestern states which Democrats believe will dash Republican hopes. After a final event in Des Moines, Iowa, where he was introduced by First Lady Michelle Obama, the couple flew to Chicago where they will spend election day.","Rocker Bruce Springsteen is one of almost 200 celebrities who answered a Democrat call to arms .

Stacey Perkins outside Trafford Magistrates' Court where she pleaded guilty to common assault . A feuding mother started a catfight with another mum in a school playground over the death of a 17-year-old in a car crash. Blonde Stacey Perkins, 23, 'ambushed' 24-year-old Jemma Collis as she waited to pick up her son at Partington Primary School, near Manchester. The assault took place last September after Miss Collis began dating Nathan Rowe, who was jailed in 2005 for killing Perkins' cousin . Robert Morris in a car crash. The then 19-year-old had driven at speeds of up to 70mph before losing control at the entrance to Dunham Massey Park, near Altrincham, and hitting a tree. Robert, who was with him at the time, was trapped in the burning car and died at the scene. Rowe admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving without a licence and insurance and failing to stop after an accident. He was sentenced to eight . and a half years in prison but was released after four. Trafford Magistrates' Court heard yesterday how the two women, . whose children go to different schools, had a series of 'altercations' which led to Perkins vowing to 'verbally have it out' with Miss Collis . during school pick up time. Perkins was said to have yanked Miss Collis' hair back, and yelled: 'You think you are going to smash my face in?' As other parents and pupils looked on in horror, Perkins pulled Miss Collis to the floor, punched her about the head and then stamped on her chest. The victim was only able to escape when the head teacher emerged from her study and pulled Perkins off, ordering her from the school yard. At the court in Sale, Greater Manchester, Perkins sobbed as she apologised for her conduct, saying: 'I'm really sorry for doing what I did and the fact it was in a school.' She pleaded guilty to common assault. Robert Morris (left) died in a car crash in 2004. Nathan Rowe (right) was convicted for causing his death . Prosecutor Eileen Rogers said Miss Collis had walked through the school gates with Mr Rowe, 26, and they were in the playground waiting to collect her six-year-old son. She added: 'Jemma immediately recognised a voice as that of Stacey Perkins saying ""you think you are going to smash my face in?"" 'A hand grabbed the back of Jemma's long hair and she looked up and saw Stacey Perkins. She started to punch her.' The court heard how Miss Collis tried to release herself from her petite attacker's grip but was continually being hit as Mr Rowe tried to separate them. 'Stacey used her foot and stamped on Jemma's chest,' Miss Rogers said. 'She was unable to stand up due to the continued punching to her body.' In a victim impact statement, Miss Collis said: 'I heard a booming voice I immediately recognised as Stacey and felt a hard ram to the back of me. 'The force was such that my head was forced forward and I hit the ground. I looked up and saw Stacey. Incident: Partington Primary School - the scene of the playground attack . 'I was shocked and terrified. She was holding me down I was really struggling to escape because I was being continually punched to the head and body. ""I managed to get to my feet but I was still being held down by her. After around 60 seconds it stopped.' During the attack, Miss Collis sustained a two-inch scratch to her forehead and grazes to her knees, elbow and chest and Mr Rowe suffered a bruise to the back of his head. She added: 'I have been left feeling very sore, aching and I have visual injuries which I don't know how to explain to my son. 'I have been left emotionally upset at the fact it took place in a school playground. It was a total shock and unprovoked and I have been left in fear that it will happen again.' Tragic: Robert Morris died aged 17 . After the catfight Perkins wrote a letter to the school's head teacher apologising for her behaviour. She also printed 50 letters and asked that they be distributed to the school's parents.

Three siblings quarrelling over their late mother's will are risking spending every penny they were about to inherit in the vicious court battle. Julia Hawes claims that there is no evidence that her mother lacked the mental capacity to change her will and cut her brother, Peter Burgess, out of her £120,000 estate. Mr Burgess and his other sister, Libby Burgess, insist the will is invalid and are fighting Mrs Hawes at the Court of Appeal. United: Siblings Libby and Peter Burgess contests their sister Julia Hawes' appeal against an earlier ruling their their mother was not of sound mind when she excluded Peter from her will . Their mother Daphne Burgess changed her will in the presence of her daughter Julia and a solicitor in January 2007, two years before she died; . Lord Justice Patten presiding the case commented on the huge legal costs already run up in the dispute, saying: ‘There is going to be nothing left in this estate. ‘One of the sadnesses about this case is that Libby - who was a beneficiary in both wills and was in most need of her mother’s bounty - gets nothing. I mean, it is just appalling.’ Mrs Burgess, who died 80 years old in May 2009, changed her will shortly after moving from her home in Bradville, Milton Keynes, to a bungalow which was bought for her by her son,  a managing director of a recruitment company. The reason why she had excluded her son Peter from her will, according to the documents, was that she intended to reward him ‘lifetime provisions’ by making improvements to the bungalow. Peter and Libby Burgess, challenging the will, gave evidence about their mother’s deteriorating health, in particular memory loss and confusion. An Oxford psychiatry professor also gave evidence, concluding it was likely Mrs Burgess was suffering from a ‘moderate’ disorder of the mind at the time. Expensive squabble: Judges at the Court of Appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice have yet to pass judgement on the case, but lamented the fact that there will be little to no money left to inherit due to the legal costs . Following a hearing at Central London County Court in January, the will excluding Peter Burgess was struck in favour of an earlier document. In the first will Mrs Burgess divided her assets equally between her three children and was favoured after a judge found that she ‘loved all her children very much and in equal measure’. Mrs Hawes, who was also ordered to pay £18,000 back into her late mother’s estate, is now appealing against the ruling. Her lawyers argue there is no evidence to justify the judge’s conclusion that Mrs Burgess lacked the mental capacity to make a valid will and approve its contents. They also point out that the will was drawn up by an experienced solicitor who described the pensioner as being ‘compos mentis’. Piers Hill, for Mrs Hawes, said: ‘None of the evidence suggests an inability of Mrs Burgess to appreciate and comprehend the claims to which she ought to give effect in her will.’ Legal representatives of Peter and Libby Burgess say that the there was ‘serious falling out’ between Mrs Hawes and her brother in the background of the creation of the 2007 will. Their counsel, Penelope Reed QC said: ‘The judge found that Daphne did not intend to exclude her son from the will. 'She further found that, if Daphne had intended to cut her son out of the will, she would have told him.’ Reserving judgment on Mrs Hawes’ appeal, Lord Justice Mummery said it was ‘of importance’ because of the rights of older people to have their wishes honoured. He added: ‘When a person, towards the end of their life, makes a will, they ought to have their wishes respected unless it is very clear that it wasn’t what they wanted.’","Two sisters and brother in vicious court battle over Daphne Burgess's will .

An Iowa man renovating his basement has found what police believe to be the skeletal remains of its former occupant who went missing three years ago. Police in Sac City say the new homeowner of six months discovered the human remains on Monday with 58-year-old Mark Koster having vanished in July of 2009. 'All signs point to believe that it’s probably Mr Koster, but you never know,' Sac City police Chief John Thomsen told the Sioux City Journal. Scroll down for video . Human remains: A man renovating his home made a horrific discovery when finding human remains believed to belong to its former owner, Mark E. Koster, pictured, who vanished in 2009 . No one had lived in the home since Mr Koster's disappearance with it being sold to its new owner in May of this year. Sandra Dierenfeld who lived next door to Mr Koster said the last communication she had with the man was through a note on his door. It said he and his roommate, a man from Florida whom police say could be suspect, were going on a trip. 'Yeah they were just gone. They left a note saying they were going to Florida, they'd see me in the spring, please take care of the property,' she said. Grave site: The homeowner had purchased the property in May of this year after it sat unoccupied for three years after Mr Koster's disappearance . Ms Dierenfeld says Mr Koster was a smoker and in noticeably bad health. She thinks if the remains are his, Mr Koster's death may have been a suicide. 'His accounts were never touched; everything was left intact in the house. I think it was what he wanted,' she said. Daniel Koster, his brother, was the first to report him missing having received notice that his brother's utility bills weren't being paid. Final note: The last anyone heard from Mr Koster was a neighbour who said he left a note on his door saying he was going on a trip with a friend, the property's basement pictured . After his brother's petition, Mr Koster was declared dead as of October 10, 2011. An autopsy is currently underway to confirm the identity with its results expected Thursday or Friday.

The appointment of the new leader of the Church of England turned to farce and suspicion yesterday amid allegations of a betting coup. As the BBC joined the ranks of those naming the Bishop of Durham as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, bookmakers accused churchmen of using insider knowledge to make money and suspended betting on the appointment. The odds on the Rt Rev Justin Welby dropped from 7/4 to an odds-on 1/2 in one day. There were said to have been several betting accounts opened by  people in South-West London, who then put money on Dr Welby . 'Insider knowledge': Major bookmaking firms closed their Canterbury books following a flood of bets backing the Right Reverend Justin Welby (left) to replace Dr Rowan Williams (right) as Archbishop of Canterbury . Graham Sharpe, of William Hill, said: ‘Heavens above, if it does turn out to  be Justin Welby, we won’t be surprised, but we will be left wondering whether  anything is sacred. ‘This race always seems to end with a betting coup. In the space of less than an hour we had to cut the odds three times, so took the decision to close the book.’ He added: ‘I don’t know the motives of those who opened a new account just to bet on the new archbishop but I’ll be looking up to see how many churches get new roofs in the coming months.’ Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: ‘Punters were backing Welby like defeat was out of the question.’ He added: ‘The money we’ve seen suggests an announcement is only moments away. ‘Perhaps people thought we’d be too preoccupied with events in America to spot a gamble on the next Archbishop of Canterbury.’ Labour MPs demanded an inquiry, with one describing the appointment as ‘a shambles’. Among those already congratulating Dr Welby this week was Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who heads the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, of which Dr Welby is a member. Newcomer: Lambeth Palace is the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury . The BBC reported that Downing Street has confirmed an announcement will be made today and sources have told the Mail that Dr Welby is the new archbishop. Yet Church officials insisted the rumours were ‘speculation’. Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It’s pretty shabby if someone had knowledge that Bishop Welby was on his way to becoming the archbishop and put a bet on it. ‘The whole system for appointing an archbishop is a complete shambles. I don’t see why there has to be this secrecy around it. ‘It should be an open and transparent process. Then you would not have a situation where people know about the appointment and do this kind of insider trading.’ Bookmakers William Hill and Ladbrokes stopped taking bets on the appointment following a flood of money backing the Right Reverend Justin Welby . Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, called for an inquiry. There has been growing frustration in the Church at the secrecy and length of the appointment process. A committee to pick Rowan Williams’s successor, the Crown Nominations Commission, was set up in April. Its failure to produce a name in public seven months later has led to rising criticism.One senior figure in the Church’s inner ruling group complained yesterday of being left in the dark while Dr Welby’s name was freely circulated outside the CofE.","Bookmakers accused churchmen of taking advantage of insider knowledge to make money on the appointment of a new Archbishop of Canterbury .

Friends of a 13-year-old boy who drowned after leaving them playing in fields near his home have written him an anguished note saying: 'Wish we followed you'. Schoolboy Lewis Eddleston was playing just a mile from his home in Doncaster, South Yorks., on Sunday when he told friends to look after his phone while he used the toilet at around 4pm - but never came back.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:13 EST, 22 June 2011 . A U.S. nuclear submarine came within feet of running aground as it left Plymouth naval base, a report has found. The drama unfolded as the USS Minneapolis-St Paul entered rough seas and tried to take evasive action resulting in five crewmen being swept overboard, two of whom died. Chief Petty Officer Thomas Higgins and Petty Officer Michael Holtz were attached to the submarine with safety lines and had been helping the habour pilot to disembark when the submarine changed direction. They died as they were repeatedly pounded 'like rag dolls' against the hull by the force of 20ft waves. The three other crew members were later rescued. Sailors: Chief Petty Officer Thomas Higgins, left, and Petty Officer Michael Holtz, were repeatedly pounded 'like rag dolls' against the hull and died . The 2007 Royal Navy report into the incident, released this week under the Freedom of Information Act, said that the 110m-long, 6,000 ton vessel, 'came within less than her own length' of hitting rocks and becoming stuck with 'catastrophic consequences' as she turned to get back into protected waters. The report said that the incident, which came as the Devonport harbour pilot was trying to disembark the submarine, was largely the fault of the vessel's commanding officer Commander Edwin Ruff. But it also criticised a lax safety culture at the naval base, the largest in Western Europe, including failing to heed warnings after a similar but non-fatal accident involving British submarine HMS Sovereign the previous February. Near miss: Attack submarine USS Minneapolis-St Paul. The 110m-long, 6,000 ton vessel came within metres of hitting rocks and becoming stuck . The report said that the incident was largely the fault of the vessel's commanding officer Commander Edwin Ruff, pictured right, in 2004 . 'This was a severe incident with multiple loss of life. There was a very real possibility of the boat grounding in very rough seas and on an ebb tide 500 yards south of Plymouth breakwater,' the report said. 'In addition the crew's mess hatch remained open in these conditions allowing a considerable volume of water into the submarine. 'Tragic as the loss of the lives of Holtz and Higgins was, the outcome could have been so much more catastrophic and thus must be regarded as at the less serious end of the potential spectrum of consequences.' The report describes how the harbour pilot tried to leave the submarine too late as, at nine knots, it started to pass west of the Plymouth Sound breakwater and faced the open sea, which had a swell of up to four metres in height and wind speeds of up to 35 knots. Attack submarine USS Minneapolis-St Paul was leaving Plymouth Sound after visiting Devonport Naval base, pictured, when the 2006 tragedy happened . Rough seas: Plymouth Sound which had 20ft waves in December 2006 when USS Minneapolis-St Paul was leaving Plymouth . The report said the crew of a nearby vessel became alarmed at the submarine's speed as it approached the open water. USS Minneapolis–Saint Paul is a Los Angeles-class submarine and the first vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the metropolitan area of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota . She was launched on March 19 1981 after the contract for her to be built was awarded in 1973. She was inactivated in June 2007 and finally decommissioned in August 2008 and transferred to Peal Harbour Naval Shipyard. She was 360 feet long and weighed 6,000 tons and has one nuclear reactor on board. The vessel took part in Operation Desert Shield in the Gulf War and was the first submarine to carry Tomahawk missiles designed for strikes against Iraq in the Gulf War . As the harbour pilot tried to leave through the mess hatch, the commanding officer swung the sub round into the waves, exposing the men on the desk 'casing', who were there to help the harbour pilot to the waiting boat, to the full force of the sea. The two men who died were moored to the submarine with safety lines. As the submarine turned to return to the safety of protected water, she came close to the rocks of the Panther Shoal, which would have been enough in the conditions, the report said, to ground her. The mess was already around 18in deep in seawater which had come in through the open hatch. The report said 'human failure lay at . the heart of this incident' and although saying responsibility for the . incident lay with the submarine commander, it also recommended changes . to the safety culture within Devonport to make it easier and quicker for . concerns to be reported and acted upon. The harbour pilot was also later dismissed, a decision upheld by the Civil Service Appeal Board. An MoD spokesman said: 'Naval Base Commander Devonport (NBCD) commissioned a review of the findings from the reports into the investigation to identify lessons learned. This was done in parallel with an ongoing safety culture review across the Naval Base. 'As a result, there have been improvements in the dissemination of lessons learned more widely, not only those resulting from the Minneapolis-St Paul accident. 'NBCD and (civilian contractor) Babcock have also instigated the safety initiative 'Time out for Safety' which is designed to encourage openness and improved safety culture across naval base and dockyard operations.'","USS Minneapolis-St Paul almost ran aground leaving Plymouth Sound .

The election may be over but contest continues to drag on in Florida, where the presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney was still too close to call - a full day after polls opened. More than 24 hours after polls closed in Florida, election officials said votes were still being counted in a handful of counties and final results may not be known before this weekend. 'Every county must report their unofficial results to us by Saturday at noon,' said Chris Cate, a spokesman for Florida's Secretary of State, who is responsible for elections. Scroll down for video . Stacked: Absentee ballots are pictured at the Miami-Dade Elections Department in Doral, Florida . Keeping count: A Florida campaign worker marks absentee ballots as the vote count continues in the state, 24 hours after polls opened . Waiting: Voters stand in line outside a Fort Myers, Florida church, where some had to wait six hours to cast their ballots . He declined to predict when the race in the fourth most populous U.S. state would be called. Twelve years ago, when the key battleground state was a toss-up that left the presidential race unsettled, Florida was the cause of electoral gridlock. This time, it hardly seemed to matter. President Obama handily won re-election without Florida's 29 Electoral College votes, which was the biggest prize up for grabs in any of the U.S. swing states. As of Wednesday evening, Obama had 49.87 per cent of the statewide vote versus 49.27 per cent for Romney, with just 49,963 votes separating them, according to the Florida Division of Elections. Waiting game: Florida officials could not predict when the votes would be counted, but some suggest results would not be revealed until this weekend . Long lines: Florida election law says that anyone who was in line when the polls closed at 7pm could still have their votes counted . Frustration: Hundred of voters waited in long lines to cast their ballots on Election Day in Miami on Tuesday night . Officials throughout the state blamed an unexpectedly high number of absentee ballots and the length of the ballots, which included 11 proposed state constitutional amendments, for long lines at polling places and delays in tallying final results. But Republican Governor Rick Scott's decision not to extend early voting ahead of Election Day, after it was cut back from 14 to eight days by Scott and the Republican-controlled Legislature, was also cited as causing exceedingly long voter lines at many precincts on Tuesday. Democrats have said repeatedly that the cutback was a part of an unsuccessful attempt to blunt turnout in Florida by Obama supporters. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez apologized for the long lines in his county on Wednesday, after acknowledging that some voters had been forced to wait up to six hours to cast their ballots. Chaos: An aerial view above a polling place in Miami shows the line of voters that extended into the parking lot . Queues: In Florida, polling places that closed at 7pm remained open, as hundreds of people lined the streets in some areas, waiting to get in . 'That should not have happened,' said Gimenez, whose county accounts for about 10 percent of Florida's nearly 12 million registered voters. As for the glacially pace of the vote count, Gimenez said: 'We had a very long ballot. It was the longest ballot in Florida history.' The final margin of victory in Florida may be less than a percentage point. Some political pundits say the delays highlight Florida's seeming inability to hold elections that are free of controversy and public mockery. 'There are so many different potential sources of interference and conscious efforts to muck it up, we won't know for a while yet who to point the finger at,' said Seth Gordon, a former political consultant based in Miami. 'We could have been there in the bulls-eye of the whole works looking idiotic just like last time,' he said, referring to 2000, when George Bush won Florida by 537 and captured the White House. 'We may be just as idiotic this time, but it doesn't matter because no one is watching,' Gordon said. 'Last time, we held up the entire country.'","Official results may not be known until the weekend .

Timothy Rowland, 18, was taken into police custody after his little brother told police ‘Timothy did it’. The abuse was uncovered when the 4-year-old's father visited their home in Yelm, Washington and found the burn on the young boy’s arm. Arrested: Timothy Rowland, 18, has been charged with child assault following his little brother's accusations . A sergeant in the Army, the boy’s father had returned home from deployment in Afghanistan three days earlier. He was alarmed by the child’s decaying teeth and noticed a significant 'cigarette burn' underneath the left forearm. When the father, who is divorced from the mother, called police, the 4-year-old told them his half-brother had ‘set him on fire’ with a cigarette. Danielle Hathaway, mother of the two boys fervently denies the claims made by the father of her youngest son. ‘He [Timothy] has been very good to him,’ she told KOMO news. ‘I don't believe that he would have done that. He loves him.’ Injuries: The 4-year-old photographed by police showing the injuries on his arms allegedly inflicted by his half-brother Timothy Rowland . Burn: The reddish area on the boy's arm shows a large burn which his mother claims is from an accident involving an iron . However, when the police spoke to the child, the boy told police ‘they’ had been mean to him, although it has not been specified if ‘they’ means his mother and half-brother. ‘He was afraid of them and they liked to hurt him. He also mentioned that he had been kicked in the stomach,’ Chief Todd Stancil, Yelm Police, told KOMO news. Ms Hathaway says the boy was not afraid to be in her house and blames her ex-husband for her oldest son’s arrest. 'Lies': Mother Danielle Hathaway says the 4-year-old's father has made up the story in an attempt to get revenge on her since their divorce . Accusations: The young boy told police he was afraid of the house and that 'they were mean' ‘I have an ex-husband that has been after me since our divorce in regards to trying to take the children away from me,’ Ms Hathaway said. She says there are no cigarette burns on the boy and another larger burn on his arm is from an ironing accident with her. She admitted to leaving the boy’s teeth in a bad state, but said it was because she cannot afford to take him to the dentist. ‘This is nothing but lies,’ she said.

Miss Diamond did not respond to MailOnline's requests for a comment.

In November last year she tweeted a . picture of them together at a Jay-Z concert making his famous 'diamond' hand gesture - actually a symbol for his Roc-A-Fella Records company. Her tweets came after Mr Diamond fell on his sword amid intense pressure from on the bank to force . him out, it was claimed. As he announced his resignation, Mr Diamond said he was standing down because: 'The external pressure placed on Barclays has reached a level that risks damaging the franchise.'

He apologised as he admitted there . had 'clearly been mistakes' and 'reprehensible behaviour' at the bank, . while adding that he had stepped down to prevent anymore damage to the . bank. But he declared 'I love . Barclays', and added: 'History will judge Barclays as an incredible . institution because of its people. We need to get through this and best . way was for me to step down.' The millionaire banker, 61, came . under pressure from visibly angry MPs as he swerved questions, . repeatedly saying that it had been 'wrong' for a 'handful' of traders to . fix the rate at which Barclays borrowed from other banks - potentially . affecting millions of homeowners. All a Twitter: She took down her offensive tweet minutes after posting it, but not before it was retweeted by Times journalist David Rose . Sense of humour: She also retweeted cutting messages about her father Bob Diamond . Mr Diamond admitted his shame over . damming emails between staff who were fixing the interest rate. In one, a trader . at a different bank wrote to 'Trader G' at Barclays: 'Dude. I owe you . big time! Come over one day after work and I’m opening a bottle of . Bollinger.' Mr Diamond said he was ‘physically ill’ when he read emails. Other emails revealed how they would . ‘shout’ across the desk at each other to ‘beg’ for the interest rate to . be fixed at a certain level in the hope of making millions for . themselves. Another said: ‘Coffees will be coming . your way either way, just to say thank you for your help in the past . few weeks.’ His colleague replied: ‘Done...for you big boy.’ Expensive taste: Nell made an appearance at Paris Fashion Week, left, and New York Fashion Week, right . Family: Nell is the only daughter of Bob and Jennifer Diamond .

Mr Diamond said: ‘That behaviour was . reprehensible, it was wrong. I’m sorry, I’m disappointed and I’m also . angry. There is absolutely no excuse for this type of behaviour.' But he pointed the finger at '14 . or 15' other banks - including government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland, . Lloyds and Halifax Bank of Scotland - suggesting that they were lying . about their rates. Mr Diamond is said to be furious that . he and the bank have been blamed for ‘lowballing’ the rates at which . Barclays said it could borrow from rivals. Bankers insist the authorities knew . these rates were inaccurate but did not act because they feared the . truth would destabilise the markets. It is also claimed that regulators . possessed evidence of rate-fixing. Snap happy: Nell appears to be a prolific social networker, posting numerous pictures of herself at various events . Mr Diamond is in line to pocket 13.2million shares worth $35 million - which he . is entitled to because he has served for more than 15 years - as part of . a golden pay off. Barclays said the terms of Mr Diamond's severance package are 'still under discussion'. Shareholders will reportedly attempt . to force the banker to surrender $30 million worth of unvested shares . awarded to him in previous years. However, he will receive a minimum of at least a year's salary worth $2.1 million. Mr Diamond, who joined the . bank 16 years ago, said in his resignation statement: 'I am deeply . disappointed that the impression created by the events announced last . week about what Barclays and its people stand for could not be further . from the truth.'

A gay couple have told of their shock after they were subjected to a bigoted tirade from a waiter for sending back food in a Greek restaurant. Markus Busuttil, 28, and his husband Steven, 24, were sharing a romantic meal at a Birmingham restaurant to celebrate a wedding anniversary. But they were left stunned when a staff member at city centre restaurant Athens starting abusing them when they tried to send back a dish. The couple recorded the alleged outburst, in which the abuser refers to gay people having their legs cut off - and brands them 'F****** queers'. Markus Busuttil, 28, and his husband Steven, 24, were left stunned when a staff member at city centre restaurant Athens starting abusing them when they tried to send back a dish . West Midlands Police have confirmed they are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the restaurant told the Birmingham Mail he did lose his temper and called the couple 'queers', but claimed he was provoked after they made 'inappropriate advances' to his waiter - which they deny. Markus and Steven, who live in the city centre, had visited the restaurant on Halloween to mark their first month of marriage. But they claim a furious row started when they tried to return food, which they claim they recorded on their phone. In one exchange, an alleged staff member is heard to say: 'F****** queers. You should be ashamed of yourselves. 'We don’t like people like you in Greece. We cut off your legs. You are an embarrassment to the world. 'Your mum is a s***. I will f****** kill you. After the police, I will deal with you.' In another section of the conversation, the alleged member of staff is recorded speaking to police on his own phone. He tells officers that he fears for his own safety and adds: 'They are very aggressive for gays.' Markus, a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, chose the Paradise Circus Queensway restaurant after spotting an online offer. The student, who has been studying engineering since 2009, said the argument started when the couple returned their 'dried up' and 'salty' main courses. Markus, who met web developer Steven five years ago while studying in Wales, said: 'I have never been subjected to abuse like that before in my life. 'We have never experienced anything like this before in Birmingham, or anywhere else. It was bizarre and surreal. 'After about 15 minutes of this terror he started to claim that we had attacked him. I thought he was a liar, so I called police and I also started to record the conversation on my phone, and I am glad that I did. 'We love how open and friendly and multicultural this city is and that is why we think this kind of behaviour should be exposed.' Markus said problems started when the main courses arrived 20 minutes after they had starters of Greek Salad along with Tzatziki and meatballs. He added: 'We ate half of the salad and meatballs and when the main course of lamb and chicken arrived we told the waiter we were not happy with the food. 'I do not usually complain, but it was just not very good. West Midlands Police have confirmed they are investigating the incident at Athens restaurant in the heart of Birmingham as a possible hate crime . 'The first waiter was quite professional and apologetic and insisted that we had something else. We said we did not want anything else, but would pay for what we had already consumed. 'But when the second person came out we were subjected to the most awful abuse. He started to ask us if we were Greek and told us we knew nothing about food. 'That is when we decided to get up to try and leave, but we were blocked in the doorway. 'I want to see the man brought to justice and confronted about what he said. If this is the way he deals with any kind of complaints then I fear for the safety of other people. 'We are still in a state of disbelief that this happened and I am thankful that I recorded what was said.' When the Birmingham Mail contacted Athens restaurant an employee, who refused to give his name, admitted being involved in the row and said: 'We know about the complaint and have made our own complaint to police concerning inappropriate advances that were made to a waiter. I did scream at them because I felt intimidated. 'I lost my temper, I did call them queers, but they were teasing me and laughing about the whole situation. 'I told them that in Greece they would cut their legs, but I did not say I would do it. 'We have served homosexual couples in the past without a problem and had a gay couple here on Saturday night. We have been in business here for 24 years and have never had anything like this before. If you eat something you should pay for it. 'They tried to run off and I did stop them from leaving and I also called security to block the door, but they were not held hostage.' He added: 'I did not expect them to be so strong. They pushed me quite hard and were very mean people. 'We told them straight. It was not about money and in the end they only paid £7 for the two bottles of beer and refused to give us their names. 'But we are planning to pursue the matter with police.' A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'We can confirm that we are investigating reports of a hate crime at the Athens restaurant on October 31.

A mother-of-two has revealed how she leaves a trail of skin behind her due to a rare condition that causes her to shed 14 times more skin than normal. Melanie Bradley suffers from the rare disorder Bullous Ichthyosis. In a cruel twist of fate her  21-month-old daughter Rebecca suffers from the same condition. Mrs Bradley, from Atherstone, Greater Manchester, said: 'My skin sheds rapidly, so overnight I can shed the equivalent of what a person with ‘ordinary’ skin sheds in two weeks. 'I'm covered in scales from head to . toe. It's can be so thick to the point that I can barely move, but at . the same time it's so delicate that the slightest knock can break the . skin. 'It can be quite awkward, because you leave a trail of skin behind you. A lot of vacuuming goes on in my house.' Melanie Bradley and her daughter Rebecca both suffer from a rare disorder that causes them to shed their skin far quicker than normal . Medics gave Melanie a 50 per cent chance that her children might be born with Icthyosis. Although older sibling Daniel, three, was born free from the condition, his younger sister was not so lucky. Mrs Bradley said: 'As soon as Rebecca was born it was obvious she had it. I'd had an emergency C-section so didn't see her straight away, but I overheard the doctors discuss it and obviously I was devastated. 'When I first saw her, and how her skin looked I just felt numb. It was the last thing I wanted. 'But I knew that I had to cope and get over it - and who better to raise a child with Ichthyosis than a fellow sufferer. I worry for mums that haven't been through it themselves but Rebecca is already starting to understand her condition, which is great. 'She's already rubbing cream into herself, and she notices when she has lose skin. She'll just have to learn her limitations.' Advancements in medicine mean that doctors are able to recognise Ichthyosis as soon as possible. But when Melanie first began to suffer from the condition she was not so lucky. 'When I was born the doctors were totally baffled. The top layer of my skin had been stripped off during birth and the doctors had no clue what was going on. 'My skin was so thick - I couldn't bend my knees until I was about three, and I had to wear slippers to school because they were the only shoes that didn't hurt. 'Fortunately, things were different for Rebecca.' When Mrs Bradley was born (left and as a child, right) doctors were baffled by her skin disorder. Now they can recognise Ichthyosis quickly . Close-ups of Melanie's skin: Is it not waterproof and very susceptible to infection . The stay-at-home mother must follow a strict care routine to ensure that her and her daughter's skin is properly hydrated. 'Our . skin is very susceptible to infection, so we have to be very clean, but . we also have to bathe and shower a lot to get moisture into the skin,' she said. 'My daily . routine starts with a bath or shower using emollients, which I do twice a . day. It then takes a minimum of around 30 minutes just for my skin to . dry off, then I have to liberally apply creams all over my body. 'I . then have to let the creams soak into my skin for at least a further 20 . minutes or so before I can get dressed. It takes up to two hours for me . to just get ready in the morning and ready for bed at night. 'I then have to do the same for Rebecca.' The 34-year-old says the blisters that come with the Ichthyosis are the most painful part of the condition. 'The blisters can appear anywhere and be of any size. I once got one from my elbow to my wrist - it was awful. 'They make getting around very difficult, and antibiotics and dressings are always needed when you get them. 'During my childhood Mum had to burst the blisters herself using sterile needles. Even now I sometimes have to do the same.' Melanie with her husband Vincent, son Daniel and daughter Rebecca: I just want people to know that, even though it's difficult to live with, you can cope . A further bizarre symptom of Ichthyosis is that the skin is not waterproof. 'We lack a specific protein, so the the skin absorbs water. It leaves the skin white in colour and very soggy.' Mrs Bradley now runs the Friends of Ichthyosis website and charity, which has been successful in giving advice and support for fellow sufferers. The mother added: 'I just want people to know that, even though it's difficult to live with, you can cope.' 'I . never thought I'd marry or have children with skin like I do, but I . have a wonderful husband, Vincent, 30, and two beautiful children. The skin condition can cause painful blisters . 'I . am living proof that anything is possible, and there is still so much . more I’ve yet to achieve. There are lots of people in this world who are . far worse off than myself.' Bullous Ichthyosis affects less than 1 in 100,000 people. Hermoine . Lawson, of The British Skin Foundation, said: 'Bullous ichthyosis, is a . rare form of inherited ichthyosis. At birth the baby's skin seems to be . fragile and may show blisters. 'Skin . infections are quite common and can lead to a characteristic odour. There may be a reduction in sweating in childhood, which improves later . in life. 'It is . transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that one of . the parents may be affected. However, in at least half of affected . children, neither parent is affected; therefore the child has developed a . new gene fault while growing in the womb.'

A study found that run-off of pesticides and fertiliser from farms near the Queensland coast clouded the waters of the reef, killing off its natural coral and drastically changing its ecology. The change was disastrous for many of the animal species that lived in the reef, and for the nearby coastline since the native species had weakened the surf as it came crashing in from the Pacific Ocean. Under threat: An aerial view of the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland, Australia. A new study suggests the reef has suffered from human activity for as long as 90 years - longer than previously thought . The study, published yesterday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, suggests that humans had disrupted the ecology of the Great Barrier Reef decades before climate change and reef tourism. 'There was a very significant shift in the coral community composition that was associated with the colonisation of Queensland,' study co-author John Pandolfi of the University of Queensland told LiveScience. The European colonisation of Queensland began in the 1860s, with settlers hacking down forests to make space for farming. By the Twenties, rivers were pouring huge quantities of fertiliser and pesticides into the ocean. To find out the impact that this early European colonisation had on the Great Barrier Reef, Professor Pandolfi's team drilled sediment cores 6.5 to 16.5ft deep into the reef off Pelorus Island, off the Queensland coast. The professor told LiveScience that when coral dies, new coral sprouts on the skeletons and ocean sediments eventually bury them in place. The story of the reef can thus be reconstructed by dating the sediment layers. A snorkeller swims with a turtle in the Great Barrier Reef: Reef tourism has had a detrimental impact on the ecology of the area, but the new research suggests that run-off from farms has had a far worst effect . Global warming is causing aquatic animals to shrink the most, according to new research. British scientists found warmer temperatures cause greater reduction in the adult sizes of aquatic animals than in land-dwellers. The study by researchers from Queen Mary College, University of London, and the University of Liverpool shows that the body size of marine and freshwater species are affected disproportionately by warmer temperatures. The findings could have implications for aquatic food webs and the production of food by aquaculture. Lead author Dr Jack Forster, also from Queen Mary's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, added: 'Given that fish and other aquatic organisms provide three billion people with at least 15 per cent of their animal protein intake, our work highlights the importance of understanding how warming in the future will affect ocean, lake and river dwelling species.' The team found that for a millenium . prior to the arrival of the European colonists, the reef was dominated . by the massive, three-dimensional Acropora coral. This species grows up to 16ft high and 65ft across, forming a labyrinthine network of nooks and crannies for marine life to inhabit, Professor Pandolfi said. 'They're like the big buildings in the city, they house a lot of the biodiversity,' he told LiveScience. However, from the Twenties onwards, the impact of humans on the environment began to stifle the Acropora and sometime before the mid-Fifties it had stopped growing altogether - replaced by a slow-growing, spindly coral called Pavona. The University of Queensland team believes that the polluted run-off from the new farms over time clouded the pristine waters off the coast, poisoning the native species. They also believe that same pollution fed an algae that smothered the native coral species' attempts to regenerate. Several recent studies have shown that climate change and snorkellers have proved catastrophic for coral, with one finding that half the Great Barrier Reef has died off in the past 50 years. But Professor Pandolfi and his colleagues' findings suggest that man has been damaging that reef and others for much longer than previously thought. The professor, however, says his work also suggests that the problem has a straightforward solution - reduce polluted run-off into the ocean. 'Any kind of measures that are going to improve the water quality should help those reefs to recover,' he added.","Run-off of pesticides and fertiliser from Queensland's farms have strangled native species of coral .

Sales of new cars to private buyers soared by nearly a quarter last month in a 'resilient' market –  pushing overall sales up by 12 per cent, official figures reveal today. But there is strong evidence of motorists and families 'down-sizing' from bigger cars to smaller, more frugal, fuel-efficient  and environmentally vehicles – with the Ford Fiesta 'super-mini' the biggest seller. It means new car sales for the year are now on course to burst through the 2 million mark – higher than previously expects, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The Ford Fiesta was the top selling car for October this year . Vauxhall Astra: cars such as the Astra have become popular as householders downsize . People's car: The VW Golf continues to be a strong performer in motor sales . The influx of household consumers' cash in particular into the motor industry gave an encouraging boost of confidence and glimmer of hope amid the economic gloom. A  total of 151,252 cars were registered in October 2012 - a 12.1per cent rise on the October 2011 figure. But private sales last month rose by almost 24per cent –  with households buying 68,191 cars compared to 55,043 last October. Sales of alternatively-fuelled 'green' vehicles soared almost 39per cent – but still remain relatively low at 2,206. The private-sale boom took the year-to-date total sales figure to 1,771,861 - a 5per cent rise on the January-October 2011 total. As a result of the  private-buyer boost, the SMMT has revised upwards its forecast for full-year sales to more than two million vehicles - compared with 1.94 million in 2011. However, the year-to-date figure for 2012 is still some 16per cent - or 335,000 vehicles -  below the 2007 pre-recession volume. The SMMT report said: 'Against a backdrop of weak European demand for cars the UK market has proved remarkably resilient. 1. Ford Fiesta2. Vauxhall Corsa3. Ford Focus4. Vauxhall Astra5. Volkswagen Golf6. BMW 3 Series7. Nissan Qashqai8. BMW 1 Series9. Mini10.Volkswagen Polo . 'It has increased in every month this year, apart from February, which is traditionally a low-volume month. 'The growth in 2012 reflects an improvement in private demand, while fleet demand has sustained the volumes recovered in 2011.' It adds: 'Demand for small cars has risen rapidly, in part due to new models.' The 'Mini' segment has grown by 52.0 per cent  over the year-to-date and the Supermini segment by 5.8 per cent. Collectively these two segments account for close to 40per cent of the market. The Ford Fiesta – which falls into the 'super-mini' category – was the best-selling new car in October and the year-to-date. The report adds: 'The SMMT has revised up its full year 2012 forecast to 2.013 million units from 1.97 million forecast in July and 1.92 million at the start of the year. The iconic Mini remains one of the top ten small cars in the UK . Compact style: BMW 1 Series is at the high end of the 'super-mini' cars . 'The market is forecast to be stable in 2013 at 2.015 million units.' SMMT chief executive Paul Everitt said: 'Despite uncertainty in the European economy, the UK new car market continues to grow. 'It is encouraging to see the alternatively-fuelled vehicle market performing strongly. 'Although this sector represents only a small share of the overall market, it is vital that the Government sustains its consumer incentive programme and maximises the benefits available through the vehicle taxation system.'","Sales of new cars on course to break the 2million mark for 2012 .

A crocodile which has terrified residents in Gaza after escaping from a zoo two years ago has finally been captured. After searching on the internet for advice, police and fishermen teamed up to trap the six-foot-long deadly reptile with shark nets on Tuesday. They sat in a boat in the sewage pit for eight hours a day, for two weeks, as they tried to apprehend their foe. Caught at last: This crocodile has been at large for two years and was finally caught on Tuesday by fishermen and police . Boxed in: Known as 'Rock', the crocodile is said to have eaten animals belonging to locals . But eventually they resorted to draining the sewage out, leaving the crocodile with nowhere to run. Locals revealed they had been scared to leave the house in the evenings for fear of encountering the creature which ate their goats and ducks. The crocodile escaped from his zoo enclosure in 2010 and crawled half-a-mile to a large sewage pit in the northern Gaza Strip town of Umm al-Naser. Lt Col Samih al-Sultan was in charge of hunting down the reptile. He said: 'He had a lot of spirit in him. He wanted to be free.' Home sweet home: The crocodile has been put back in the zoo after escaping in 2010 . Nicknamed 'Sakher' (Rock), for his resilience, strength and determination, the crocodile now lives with four other of its type in the zoo in nearby Beit Lahiya. 'We hope he lives a good life here with his wives,' said Al-Sultan, who said he grew to both like and respect the animal. 'He’s a beautiful troublemaker,' added police spokesman Ayman al-Batniji. 'We really sweated to take him alive.' Feared and respected: The crocodile grew to be liked by many, even though it caused great worry to local people . Around two months ago wastewater workers discovered the animal in one of the sewage basins, having grown considerably since its escape. 'We were afraid he would eat us,' said farmer Hassan Mohammed of Umm al-Nasser. Even the crocodile's arrival in Gaza was complicated according to zoo worker Emad al-Qanoua. He said it had been drugged and brought into blockaded Gaza through a smuggling tunnel under the Egypt-Gaza border four years ago.

Ali, undefeated in his professional career but now in the role of challenger, taunted Frazier at weigh-ins and even traveled to his training camp to bait him - angering the reigning champ and making him even more driven to succeed. Ali had been out of professional boxing for three years after he refused the draft for the Vietnam War and was stripped of his heavyweight belt in 1967. He was sentenced to five years in prison but while the case was on appeal, he was granted a boxing license for Atlanta in 1970 - knocking out Jerry Quarry in three rounds.

American Express is suing Aruba murder suspect Gary Giordano who was . detained for months at the resort after his traveling partner disappeared. The federal lawsuit seeks to void a . travel insurance policy that Giordano, of Gaithersburg, took out in . Robyn Gardner's name before their trip. The suit says the policy is . void because Giordano and Gardner aren't married, aren't related and . weren't business partners. 'Cashing in': Gary Giordano (left), the sole suspect in the disappearance of Robyn Gardner (right) in Aruba, has filed a lawsuit to claim $3.5 million in a life insurance policy he took out on her before the trip . Giordano was taken into custody after . Gardner went missing in Aruba last year. He has said she was swept out . to sea while the pair was snorkeling. A judge ordered him released in . November because of a lack of evidence. He is being represented by Jose . Baez - who became famous after representing Casey Anthony in the murder . trial of her daughter Caylee. Giordano has already sued an American Express subsidiary to collect on the policy. The very existence of the accidental death insurance policy made police suspicious of Giordano, who was named as the beneficiary. It was also deemed unusual to take out a policy for a week-long trip. Gardner's live-in boyfriend at the time of her disappearance, Richard Forester, branded the lawsuit 'disgusting', according to the Chicago Sun-Times. 'Nobody knows whether she is dead or not,' he said. 'It goes to [Giordano's] character… he is just trying to make money off of this.' Last sighting: The pair went to Aruba after meeting on a swingers website. Gardner, seen here in surveillance footage before her disappearance, has not been seen since a snorkelling trip with Giordano . Return: On footage taken two hours later, Giordano is seen returning to the shore without Gardner . Gardner and Giordano, 50, had traveled with each other on July 31 after reportedly meeting on a swingers' website called Adult Friend Finder. They were last seen leaving a restaurant on Baby Beach at about 4pm on August 2. Two hours later, Giordano was seen alone on a security camera. Witnesses claimed he had been sweating profusely and there was a scratch on his throat. He reported Gardner missing - claiming she had been pulled out to sea - and initially assisted the search but was later detained and arrested at the airport as he tried to flee the country. Shocking CCTV footage later emerged showing Gardner having a violent fight with Giordano hours before her disappearance. He reportedly grabbed her by the neck and shoved her into an elevator. Gone: Gardner was last seen 10 months ago. The insurance company said when someone is presumed dead a claim cannot be made until 365 days after the incident . Grief: Gardner's boyfriend Richard Forester, pictured, branded the lawsuit 'disgusting' Her body has never been found despite extensive searches, leaving . investigators with only a circumstantial case that a crime was even . committed.

Police also investigated a National Enquirer report that she was buried . alive in a dog's grave dug up by her lover, who had taped a plastic bag over . her head. After four months in jail, Giordano was released when investigators said they did not have enough evidence to charge him. He returned to the U.S. in November last year.

He also denied claims that he and Gardner were diving in an remote area and said he thinks she likely drowned while they were snorkeling.

A former female Minnesota police officer will receive more than $1million in multiple lawsuit settlements after learning that dozens of her former co-workers illegally accessed her driver’s licence record just to gawk at her picture. The Minneapolis City Council has agreed last week to pay Anne Marie Rasmusson $392,000, on top of a $280,000 settlement she reached with several other cities whose officers violated the law by accessing her record for personal reasons. Rasmusson will also be awarded $385,000 from the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, for a total of $1,057,000 that taxpayers will have to pay, Wired reported. That figure could be even higher if the retired officer wins her suit against the state. Violated: Officers used their private database to look up Anne Marie Rasmusson's driver's licence photo, right, more than 400 times since 2007. She's seen pictured with her husband, left . Toned: Rasmusson began entering body building competitions after she was forced into medical retirement, losing more than 70 pounds . The case marks one of the largest . data breaches committed by law enforcement officials in history, . according to the Minneapolis independent paper City Pages. An investigation into Minnesota’s . Dakota County Sheriff’s office, as well as state troopers and . Bloomington police show that more than 100 officers  - from chiefs on down - were using the . database as their personal Facebook. Rasmusson, who was known by colleagues . as Bubbles because of her cheerful personality, first became aware that . other officers were looking up her photo when a former police academy . colleague mentioned to her in 2009 that she looked great and that he and . his partner had used their squad car computer to view her driver’s . license image. In August 2011, she contacted the . state’s Department of Public Safety asking if it was possible to . restrict access to her driver’s license file. Following an . investigation, a DPS worker revealed that her record had been accessed . by officers numerous times as far back as 2007. Ms Rasmusson, a 37-year-old retired cop, stands at a petite five feet two and has her hair trimmed short. Officers are only supposed to look someone up for official reasons. That said, the incredible misuse of the database is astounding – City Pages found that 104 officers in 18 different state agencies accessed her driver’s licence record 425 times. There were 24 police officers in Minneapolis who accessed her record 133 . times, and 42 officers in St. Paul who looked her up 175 times. The 37-year-old woman told City Pages: ‘There is nothing that I would say about this driver’s licence photo or any of my previous ones that in any way would deserve the attention that they’ve gotten.’ Breech of trust: Rasmusson, right, said she felt her privacy was violated and got sick after she found out how many times her personal data was accessed . Ms Ramusson told the paper that she feels her privacy has been violated. When she found out to what degree, she actually became ill. One officer, who requested that he not be named, said that every cop – regardless of rank – had looked at her file. In the lawsuits Rasmusson filed, she alleged that the officers violated, among . other things, the federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act,  which prohibits states from disclosing . personal information that drivers submit to obtain a license. The city of St. Paul denied Rasmusson’s invasion-of-privacy allegations and any liability for her . claims, but said it agreed to settle with her in order ‘to avoid the uncertainties . and costs associated with continued litigation of this matter.’ Under the settlement, Rasmusson’s name, picture, address and other personal . information will be removed from the city and police department’s internal . directory and website. In the aftermath of the case, most of the officers who looked up Rasmusson’s . record got away with warning letters and additional training. An officer who accessed the woman’s file record 13 times received the harshest . punishment in the form of a demotion and a five-day suspension. In Minneapolis, however, none of the 24 officers who looked up Rasmusson’s . photo have been disciplined, while St. Paul absolved four of its officers. When she was 24 and new to the St Paul police force, one of her co-workers suggested a bet – who could lose the most body fat in three months. The once overweight officer dropped 15 pounds in three months, and continued her regimen of exercise and healthy eating until she dropped an additional 70lbs. Questions: She became suspicious after several acquaintances called her up out of the blue and asked her out on dates . An injury in 2003 forced Ms Ramusson to go into early retirement, but the determined fitness guru continued working out, and began entering body building competitions while her husband – another Minnesota officer – went to work. She became suspicious when a former academy friend said she looked great in her driver’s licence photo. Then unsolicited texts from other officers trickled in, requesting her company on boating excursions. Tired of the texts, she insisted on an audit, and the results were shocking. Her personal data – including her address, phone number, and driver’s licence information – had been accessed repeatedly by officers since 2007. If federal privacy laws swing in her favour, all 104 officers who viewed her profile could lose their jobs.","Officers used private database to look up Anne Marie Rasmusson more 425 times since 2007 .

However, over the past decades scientists have simulated this process and hit major problems known as the 'lunar paradox' - finding the moon appears to be made up of material that would not be expected if the current collision theory is correct. Researchers have shed new light on the collision which they believed caused the moon 4.5 billion years ago, when a massive collider known as 'Theia' collided with the earth. A recent study published in the journal Icarus proposes a new perspective on the theory in answer to the paradox. If current theories are to be believed, analyses of the various simulations of the Earth-Theia collision predict that the Moon is mostly made up of material from Theia. However, studying materials from both Earth and the Moon, shows remarkable similarities. In fact, elements found on the Moon show identical isotopic properties to those found on Earth. Given it is very unlikely that both Theia and Earth had identical compositions, scientists say this paradox casts doubt over the dominant theory for the Moon formation. A group of researchers from the University of Bern, Switzerland, have now made a significant breakthrough in the story of the formation of the Moon, suggesting an answer to this Lunar Paradox. They used simulations to examine different geometry of collisions. They also examined the so-called 'hit-and-run collisions', where a significant amount of material is lost into space on orbits unbound to the Earth. The researchers believe their simulation could finally solve the 'lunar paradox' which has baffled scientists . 'Our model considers new impact parameters, which were never tested before,' said lead author Andreas Reufer. 'Besides the implications for the Earth-Moon system itself, the considerably higher impact velocity opens up new possibilities for the origin of the impactor and therefore also for models of terrestrial planet formation, . 'While none of the simulations presented in their research provides a perfect match for the constraints from the actual Earth-Moon-system, several do come close,' adds Alessandro Morbidelli, one of the Icarus' Editors. 'This work, therefore, suggests that a future exhaustive exploration of the vast collisional parameter space may finally lead to the long-searched solution of the lunar paradox.'","German researchers believe a 'hit and run' collision far more violent than previously thought could explain how the moon came into existence .

An Amber Alert has been issued for two children whose home was destroyed by an intense fire but their bodies never found. Authorities in Unionville, Tennessee issued a state-wide alert for the half-brother and sister on Friday after spending a fifth unsuccessful day searching the fire's debris for any sign of their remains. Police say Chloie Leverette, 9, and Gage Daniel, 7, were living with their grandparents at the house roughly 40 miles south of Nashville when it caught fire on Sunday night from causes currently unknown. Scroll down for video . Missing: Gage Daniel, 7, and Chloie Leverette, 9, were believed inside their grandparents' home that caught fire last weekend but their bodies have not been found . Both of their grandparents perished in the flames that were at first believed to have engulfed the home while all four slept. 'The fact that we don't have sufficient evidence from fire investigators right now to positively conclude that they died in this fire, makes us want to make sure that they are not somewhere else,' Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Kristin Helm told ABC. 'I don't know what to think. I don't know what to think,' Christopher Daniel, Gage's father, told The Associated Press in a brief telephone interview. 'They don't think that they burned up in the fire, the way I took it they don't.' Daniel, his voice breaking, said he had no idea what could have happened to the children, who have not been seen since before the fire on Sunday evening. Mysterious blaze: Seen on Sunday, firefighters worked to battle the blaze that took over the children's grandparents' home with its origins currently unknown . 'Their mother has been spoken to, she does not have the children,' Helm said. 'There are other family members that we are looking to speak with today.' Two bodies tentatively identified as 72-year-old Leon 'Bubba' McClaran and his wife, 70-year-old Molli McClaran, were recovered Monday and have been sent to the Nashville medical examiner's office for autopsy. She was the children's maternal grandmother, he their step-grandfather. Helm said the alert has not been sent to other states having no indication they could be outside. Multiple fire experts had processed the debris of the incinerated farmhouse and no trace of the children was found, the TBI said in a news release announcing the alert. On Wednesday, when officials still had not found evidence of the children's remains in the debris, TBI issued an endangered child alert. Investigation: Workers continue to sift through the debris for any sign of the children's bodies with no suspects or evidence of foul play reported . Helm said the TBI does not have any direct evidence that the children are victims of foul play. She said there are no persons of interest in the case and that investigators are following all leads, but would not elaborate. 'In most of these situations, statistically, children this age, over 90 per cent of the time, are taken by their own parents or a close relative,' Former FBI Agent Brad Garrett told ABC. The Associated Press reports that between 2006 and 2010 the Tennessee Department of Children's Services investigated the children's mother and Christopher Daniel. Forensic teams from Middle Tennessee State University and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville were brought in to help in the search. Forensic anthropologist Steven A. Symes, who formerly worked in the medical examiner's office for Shelby County, said it was a smart decision for authorities to bring in these teams because they have the expertise. 'It just takes some screening and some close looking and understanding that a piece of drywall and piece of skull bone burned look about identical,' he said. Symes said the recovery of remains from fires has advanced as the forensic anthropology field grows, but he acknowledged it is still a slow process. He said the length of time to recover remains depends on the scene and how detailed the search is. 'Unfortunately sometimes a case that you least expect to be suspicious or difficult turns into that type of case,' he said. Christopher Garrett, a spokesman for the State Fire Marshal's office, said he did not have any information on a cause of the fire. Watch the video here: .

The chances of Kenni Wenna's old demo being discovered were like finding a needle in a haystack. The builder thought he had hit the big time when he was spotted busking in the mid-1990s  and offered a life changing contract by Cargill Bruce, the boss of independent Manchester record label Global I. But the 57 year old's singing career stalled when the now-defunct label hit financial problems. His recording deal fell through and the father-of-two was forced back to his day job as a builder. Amazingly, 15 years later Cargill found Kenni’s demo while he was rummaging in his . garage and knew the songs could still be a hit. Busker Kenni Wenna, had lost all hope of hitting the big time, but 15 years later he has been given a record deal after an old demo was found in a garage . Kenni was facing eviction from his flat after struggling to find work for two years when just a week later he received a record deal offer worth £250,000. Stunned reggae star Kenni, from Walthamstow, London, called Cargill and accepted his offer to record an album, which is due to hit the shelves in time for Christmas. Kenni said: 'It all happened really quickly when I was spotted back in 1997. 'I went to meet the guy from the label and recorded a demo. 'But then I heard nothing from them and I went back to working as a welder and builder. 'I had been unemployed for about two years and was really struggling to find any work. Kenni Wenna's demo languished in a garage for 15 years until record label boss, Cargill Bruce found it and offered him a record deal worth £250,000 . The demo was buried amongst files and hidden by bikes and old benches since the mid 1990's . 'I was facing eviction and had bailiffs on my case as I was struggling to pay my bills. 'I was shocked when I received a letter from them asking me to call and discuss working with them again. 'It is a brilliant opportunity for me - especially at my age. 'You could say the letter from the record company was very good timing. Kenni was spotted by a Manchester based record label, but it hit hard times and the father-of-two went back to his day job as a builder . 'My children think it is exciting that their dad is a popstar. 'They are over-the-moon for me. It is good for them too.' Kenni’s interest in music began in church with his mother who was a talented church organist and choir singer. His influences include Bob Marley, James Brown, Fela Kuti, Lonnie Johnson, Curtis May, Ray Davis, U2 and Bob Dylan. Kenni’s reggae inspired album Real Lite will be released in time for Christmas under the new label The Wenna Project. The label is run by Cargill Bruce, who believes his songs will still be a hit today. Cargill Bruce, 45, said: 'A friend of mine spotted Kenni busking in Camden and I loved what he did. He writes great songs and is a really nice guy. 'We ran out of funds so all the demos were in the garage for 15 years before we got ourselves together to start up again.

OpCapita, then Merchant Equity Partners, acquired the flat-pack furniture retailer MFI for £1 in 2006. When MFI collapsed into administration in 2008 OpCapita reported that it made a 'small profit' from the chain. Alan Johnson, Hull Labour MP, where Comet said it will close its call centre at the cost of 240 jobs and move it to Bristol, said: 'Comet's employees seem to be the unfortunate victims of a short-term investment strategy which is not untypical of this kind of private equity company.

Vlad the Impaler, who inspired Bram Stokers Dracula, is tied to Britain's royal family both genealogically and through a medical condition that gives sufferers a thirst for blood. It is believed that Queen Mary, consort of George V, was related to the 15th Century slayer Vlad the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula. Vlad is said to have dispatched more than 100,000 Turkish warriors in battle. The vampire legend was fed by his predilection for eating bread dipped in his victim's blood.And it is known that porphyria, an iron deficiency, which is thought to lie behind the vampire myth and may have spurred Vlad's taste for blood, has run in the Royal Family.

A longtime suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz will be freed on Wednesday from a Pennsylvania prison where he spent more than 20 years for molesting other children. Etan, 6, vanished May 25, 1979, after leaving his Lower Manhattan home to go to a bus stop two blocks away. It was the first time his parents had let him go off to school alone. Jose Ramos, a convicted pedophile whom authorities have called the prime suspect in the case, is set to be released Wednesday from the State Correctional Institution at Dallas, in northeastern Pennsylvania, prison spokesman Michael Goyne said. Mystery: Jose A. Ramos, left, was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz, right, but never convicted in connection to the case . 'He will be released probably sometime in the morning,' Goyne said. 'That's all the information there is.' Ramos, 69, has been incarcerated at a prison at Dallas in northeastern Pennsylvania for molesting two other boys. Investigators in Etan's case have long been focused on Ramos, who had been dating Etan's baby sitter at the time the boy disappeared. Etan's disappearance prompted a massive search that stretched as far as Israel and spawned the national movement to publicize the cases of missing children. Tribute: Etan's parents never moved from their New York City apartment, pictured in May, or changed their phone number in case he returned . Empty: Police have searched new suspect Pedro Hernandez's home since he confessed but still haven't found evidence to tie him to the crime . The blond, blue-eyed boy's photo was among the first put on milk cartons, and his case turned May 25 into National Missing Children's Day. His parents never moved or changed their phone number, in case he returned. In 2001, they obtained a court order officially declaring their son dead. That same year, they brought a successful wrongful death suit against Ramos in 2001, but there . wasn't enough evidence to make a criminal case. Ramos was declared responsible for Etan's death in a civil court in 2004 but the Manhattan district attorney's office has said there wasn't enough evidence to charge him criminally. Tipped: Police were lead to Hernandez after a resurgence in press on Etan's disappearance prompted an anonymous tip . Ramos has denied any involvement in Etan's disappearance. He has declined interview requests while incarcerated, telling reporters . he may make a public statement after his November 7 release. In the . early 1980s, Ramos was arrested but not convicted on charges he tried to . lure children to a drainage pipe he was living in. New suspect: Pedro Hernandez's attorney says his client is mentally ill and has only convinced himself he killed Etan Patz . At the time of his arrest, photos of young blond boys, similar to Etan, were found in his backpack. After his release, Ramos traveled the country attending gatherings of the Rainbow . Family of Living Light, a loose collection of peace activists. Then . in the mid-1980s he again faced child molestation charges when he was . accused of luring three boys into his bus and assaulting them at two of . the group's gatherings in Pennsylvania. 'He had . thousands of dollars in 'Star Wars' toys on his bus. He had videotapes, . and he had all kinds of materials he used to lure children inside,' Barry Adams, a longtime Rainbow member, recalled last month from his . Montana home. 'It was a horrendous circumstance from A to Z.' Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Etan's father Stan Patz sends him a copy of the missing child poster twice a year with the words 'What have you done with my little boy?' written on the back. Earlier this year, a new suspect named Pedro Hernandez was charged with Etan's murder after police said he confessed this spring. His lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, has said that Hernandez is mentally ill, and authorities have not cited any additional evidence to implicate him beyond his own admission. Prosecutors are expected this month to announce whether they believe there's evidence enough to continue pursuing a case against Hernandez, who worked at a convenience store near Etan's home when the boy disappeared and told police he strangled the boy and stuffed his body in a trash bag. Since his . confession, an extensive probe has found no hard evidence that could . link Hernandez to the crime and his attorney has raised even more doubts . about the case saying that his client suffers from schizophrenia, . bipolar disorder, and has heard voices. 'He either did it, or he really believes he did it,' a source in the district attorney's office told the New York Post.

Jesse Jackson Jr., the Chicago lawmaker who took medical leave from Congress in June and has receiving treatment for bipolar disorder, last night coasted to easy re-election. However, his only campaigning has been by automated phone calls to voters. His celebration location, too, is a bit unorthodox – rather than revel in an upscale hotel room, Jackson Jr. remains in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Easy win: Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.has won re-election to his Chicago-area congressional seat while on a months-long medical leave . Mum's the word: The Rev. Jesse Jackson, pictured last month, has been tight-lipped about his son's condition . Jackson, 47, has served in the House of Representatives since 1995, and beat out Republican Brian Woodworth and Independent Marcus Lewis. Jackson Jr.’s win was generally expected, though the son of the Civil Rights activist hasn’t been seen in public in months while he’s being treated for bipolar disorder. In his robo-call, which was sent out last month, Jackson Jr. said that the recent events in his life were ‘difficult to sort through.’ ‘I am human,’ the representative said in the automated call. ‘I am doing my best. I am trying to sort through (all of my problems.)’ Competition: Republican Brian Woodworth lost the seat for the 2nd Congressional District . He has been compared to another absentee Chicago politician, John Stroger, who also won a primary without actively campaigning. Jackson Jr., who is the son of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, left Congress with a vague statement this summer. 'Recently, we have been made aware that he has grappled with certain physical and emotional ailments privately for a long period of time,' said Jackson's staff in the statement. 'At present, he is undergoing further evaluation and treatment at an in-patient medical facility. 'According to the preliminary diagnosis from his doctors, Congressman Jackson will need to receive extended in-patient treatment as well as continuing medical treatment thereafter.' Senator Durbin compared Jackson's disappearance to the marked contrast with the Republican Senator for Illinois, Mark Kirk, who kept the public updated following his stroke in late January. 'I thought Senator Kirk’s video talking about his rehabilitation answered hundreds of questions that I was facing, and I think to the satisfaction of Illinois voters told them what his current situation is and what his hopes are about recovering,' said Durbin. Others questioned A profile appearing last month in the Washington Post about the reclusive lawmaker revealed a more erratic side of Jackson Jr. Political operative Frank Coconate speculated that Jackson Jr. ‘had a problem with reality,’ adding that the Chicagoan enjoyed hanging out at Turkish baths ‘prancing around in the nude.’ He also boasted that he was a reincarnated Chariot driver, sources told the Post. Winning: Jackson Jr. and his wife Chicago Alderman Sandi Jackson . thank family members at his election night party in March of this year in Chicago after his Democratic primary win over challenger Debbie Halvorson . Since Jackson disappeared from public life, speculation has increased as to the possible reasons. The congressman has endured trying times over the past several years. A . House Ethics Committee also is investigating allegations that Jackson . was involved in discussions about raising money for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's campaign in exchange for Blagojevich appointing him . to President Obama's vacated U.S. Senate seat.

'On something': Ammon Jacob Woodhead allegedly tried to break into four homes with wielding an axe . A man has been arrested after allegedly terrorising a neighbourhood with an axe in an early-morning rampage while high on drugs. Ammon Jacob Woodhead, 27, allegedly broke into a home near Salt Lake City, Utah while wielding the weapon and attacked two residents inside, before trying to break into three other homes. He eventually clambered onto a roof of a house on the street - Vinecrest Drive - where an hour-long stand-off with police ensued before he finally surrendered. 'I am traumatized. I am shaking still,' the homeowner told KSL after the bizarre attack. Woodhead allegedly drove to the neighbourhood in a car he stole from the city, before breaking into a home at 4.30am by kicking down the front door - while carrying the hatchet. He went to a bedroom inside the home and attempted to hit a person sleeping the bed with the blunt end of the axe, police told KSL. The person escaped without injury. When Woodhead tried to leave, a man confronted him inside the house and allegedly tried to attack him - but the man chased after him with a flashlight and a golf club, police said. He scarpered to another house and tried to break in by hacking at the door and its lock with the hatchet - waking the family inside. 'You couldn't even make that noise with a . fist,' Minya Alisa said. 'It sounded like someone had a big sledgehammer and was trying to . bang through the door. We were so scared, we were freaking . out.' Scroll down for video . Scene: Woodhead allegedly jumped on the roof of one home, pictured, where an hour-long stand-off with police ensued. He threatened to kill himself while police used Tasers and bean bag guns with no effect . Woodhead was unable to get inside the home and ran to another, where he knocked on the door, police said. The homeowners did not answer and he ran to a fourth house, where he rang the bell. He ran to the home's workshop and smashed its windows, police said. 'The next thing I knew I heard somebody on my roof,' the resident, who did not want to be identified, said. 'And then I came down and looked out the blinds and there was a whole bunch of cops and people with flashlights up and down the street. 'And I can hear the guy on my roof trying to chop the air conditioner off to get into my home.' Terror: He broke into one home at 4.30am and tried to hit a sleeping resident with the axe . Rampage: He was chased away and failed to break into other houses - but allegedly smashed windows . Alisa said she watched the scene from her home next door. 'From . our backyard we saw his shadow on the roof,' she told KSL. 'Police were . just yelling, ""Put the axe down, put the axe down!"" It was so scary . to see his shadow and swinging the axe on the roof.' Witnesses recounted how the man said: 'I'm not going back to jail' and asked police to shoot him. Woodhead eventually dropped the axe before holding a knife to his throat, witnesses said. Police used a water hose, a bean bag gun, a Taser and even took a police dog on to the roof in attempts to subdue him, yet they did not have any effect. Stand off: Witnesses took this picture as police tried to get him off the roof. He finally surrendered and is in jail . Woodhead eventually surrendered after he became too cold, police said. He was taking to a local hospital and then booked into the Salt Lake County jail. He faces charges of of aggravated burglary, aggravated assault, criminal mischief, among others.

The creature then scuttled down an alley and has not been seen since. It is not known where the ferret came . from or if it was wild or kept as a pet. The . grandmother of ten, from Bingham, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘It was the . last thing I expected after popping down the shops. It just came out of . the blue and sank its fangs into my leg . 'My shoe was full of blood. It was . very scary - I just didn't know what to do. I gave it a hefty whack with . my walking stick but it didn't do much good.

An army veteran and his daughter are finally back together 21 years after his German wife had sent her to a foster home while he was in Iraq. Kimberly Miller, 22, is now with father Robert and his new wife Karyn at their home in Guffey, Colorado. The pair met for the first time in over two decades in July but it was not until October that Kimberley could secure a visa to live in America. Gulf war: Robert Miller (not pictured) was activated for Desert Storm and while he was gone his wife left him and sent their daughter to live with foster parents . Robert, 48, now a correctional officer, had been stationed in Germany during the first Gulf War, when he had Kimberly, before he was activated for Desert Storm in Iraq. But when he returned his wife had moved away and Kimberly had been given to foster carers. In 1999 Robert was moved back to the United States - but he did not stop searching for his daughter even though the only thing he had to remember her by was an old photo. Kimberly was taken back by her mother but then given up three more times to foster parents over the years. 'When I came back to Germany she was gone,' Robert told the Canon City Daily Record. 'I didn't know where she was,' he said. '(Kimberly's) mother just (disappeared). She wouldn't talk to me - they said I'm an American soldier, she's German - so I had no rights.' He continued: 'I would write (my former wife) and I would never hear anything - nothing,' he said. 'But my (current) wife, Karyn, wrote her and she started answering back. I don't know why she would talk to her and not me.' Robert and Karyn tried to get Kimberly to visit them when she was 13 but her mother refused to let the girl come without her. The call was suddenly ended and communication between them was blocked off again. But Kimberly was still searching, knowing her father lived in Colorado and earlier this year her maternal aunt and uncle helped her find details of a Robert Miller in Guffey. She left a message at Rita's Cafe in the spring where Robert picks up an iced coffee on the way to work at the Canon Minimum Centers. 'A girl named Valerie was working there,' said Robert. 'I went in and she said ""someone from Germany called here"".' But Valerie lost the note and it was not until a week later that the cafe owner Rita found it. 'A few days later I went by and she had the piece of paper,' explained Robert. 'It said ""daughter looking for you"" - and then the phone number.' He continued: 'I did the easy thing and asked Karyn to call. But she told me I had to call.' Eventually he picked up the phone and spoke to his daughter. 'I couldn't believe I was talking to her,' he said. They began speaking via email and eventually she flew out to Denver International Airport to meet him and Karyn on July 13. 'Unbelievable,' said Robert. 'Twenty-one years later, I didn't think it was possible.' He is delighted with the young woman that she has become over the past two decades. 'Very proud - very,' he said. 'She makes a father happy. Robert continued: 'Sometimes I look at her and I think she's a little 12- or 14-year-old kid. Other times she's a grown woman.' Kimberly said: 'I'm happy to stay here and I will come back as fast as I can. 'It is a good feeling to know where I came from. My dad and Karyn are nice people and I love them very much. I'm happy to see them again.' She spent a week in the States before flying back home, determined to  live in America permanently. Robert and Karyn hired a lawyer to help them secure dual-citizenship and after a visa struggle they eventually sorted out the paperwork. 'It makes me angry that we tried everything to come here and nobody helps you,' Kimberly told the Denver Post. 'They said ""there's nothing we can do - it's your problem, not ours."" But finally, I'm here.' She bought a one-way ticket to the United States and arrived on October 7. In the weeks since then she has spent time on the Miller ranch, assisting with work on cars, splitting wood, driving a tractor and even firing Robert's guns. Kimberly is not planning on staying at the ranch - she is currently looking for a job and house in Colorado Springs. 'The main thing is I have a job and earn some money to start,' she explained. 'We will see.'","Robert Miller left for Iraq when his then wife moved away, leaving Kimberly, nearly one, with carers .

A man has been sentenced to eight years in prison for online messages criticising the ruling Chinese Communist Party and trying to form an opposition party to it. The court in the southwestern city of Kunming sentenced Cao Haibo, 27 for 'subversion of state power'. Cao had called for democracy and had tried to form a party called the 'China Republican Party'. Security: Chinese paramilitary policemen stand guard near Tiananmen Gate . The charge is more serious than one of incitement of subversion, which is more typically used against party critics. Cao's lawyer Ma Xiaopeng believes the sentence was too harsh. 'Cao Haibo does not understand politics in China,' he explained. 'We think he's an immature child; he really did not know that the party would take it this seriously.' Ma said that Cao's party had only . existed for one day online. Cao, who was running an Internet cafe, is . not a prominent dissident. The sentence signals the party's . resolve to crack down hard on dissent, especially as it readies for a . power handover at the Communist Party congress. The congress begins on November 8 and . will see new leaders appointed to run China for the next decade, the . country with the world's biggest population and second largest economy. President Hu Jintao is due to hand over his party chief position to anointed successor Xi Jinping. Removed: The handle used for the window has been detached (bottom left) The party has always moved swiftly to crush opposition to its 63-year monopoly on power. Defendants facing subversion charges in China's party-run courts are almost never acquitted. An extreme set of rules has . been put in place as Beijing tightens security measures before the congress. Some of the more bizarre include not . rolling down taxi windows, not purchasing a remote-controlled plane . without the permission of a police chief and not releasing your pigeons. China is notorious for tightening . security measures before large events, for instance restricting air . traffic during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This once-a-decade transition has often caused unrest. Declaration: Banners proclaiming 'Build the Party for the Public, make policy for the People' are displayed on a Beijing overpass . Human rights groups report that activists and petitioners are being rounded up ahead of the congress. And these broader security measures illustrate how China is trying to leave absolutely no room for disruptions. Kitchen knives and pencil sharpeners reportedly have been . pulled from shop shelves, and there's even a rumour that authorities are on the . lookout for seditious messages scribbled on ping pong balls. The government has blocked searches for the phrase 'party . congress' on websites including China's popular Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Internet posters manage to get around that by using . characters that sound like 'party congress.' Taxi drivers have been told to remove window handles and . require passengers to sign a 'traveling agreement' promising to avoid sensitive . parts of the city and not to open their windows or doors if they pass . 'important venues.' A man who answered the phone at Wan Quan Si taxi company in . the south of the capital said the rule applies to all taxi companies in . Beijing. He declined to give his name. Stand in line: Chinese citizens line up for security checks before entering Tiananmen Square . Beijing investment company worker Li Tianshu said she didn't . believe colleagues' claims that window handles had been removed until she got . into a taxi herself the other day. 'There were no handles for three of the four windows,' she . said. 'The driver told me that their company asked them to do it to prevent . passengers spreading leaflets. 'The driver complained that if they don't take the handles . away or the passengers throw leaflets out of the taxis, they will be fired.' Citizens have taken to Weibo to post photos of doors with . handles crudely ripped off. Liu Shi, a client manager in a mass communication . company, wrote that the taxi driver had told him that power to electronic . window buttons would also be cut. A memo circulating on Weibo warned taxi drivers to be on . guard against passengers who may want to cast balloons with slogans or throw . 'ping pong balls with reactionary words.' It was unclear who issued the memo and its authenticity . could not be confirmed. Police in the capital are asking that Chinese citizens show . their ID cards and foreigners their passports when buying remote-controlled . model aircraft over safety concerns, The Global Times reported on Tuesday. Hold on to your pigeons: Keeping birds at home is just one of the strange rules . One toy store owner said authorities had told him to stop . selling medium and large-sized planes. 'This kind of plane can't fly over long distances and it can . hardly carry anything,' said Chen Ziping, holding up a model about half a yard . long. 'They just told me to stop selling it and I have to follow . the order.' The Global Times reported an unnamed police officer from . Aoyuncun station in Chaoyang district said people wanting to buy . model planes during the congress should go to the vendor's local police station . to register. Only when the buyer receives approval from the station's police . chief can he make the purchase. You are not allowed to fly model planes in the city and . balloons also are on the blacklist. The newspaper cited another officer from . Chaoyang district Public Security Bureau saying pigeon owners must keep . their birds in their coops during the congress. Standing guard: There is a strong security presence in the city . Chen Jieren had a run-in with the security rules Sunday . after the handle of his knife broke while he was cooking dinner. He took his ID . card to the supermarket, knowing that people must show identification when . buying knives during sensitive periods. 'Well, it didn't work this time,' Chen said. 'I was told by . the police that no more knives can be sold, not even pencil sharpeners. 'And I . don't think the shopkeeper was kidding, because several days ago I saw myself . that police were asking the sales assistants in the stationer's not to sell . pencil sharpeners. 'I went back and got an old knife and tried to sharpen it. I . guess I have to live with it until the congress finishes,' he added. Wang Ye, an engineer from Beijing who lives in Shanghai, was . planning on returning to his home city to run a marathon, but it was postponed . with no word on when it might be held. The date of a marathon in the eastern city of Hangzhou, near . Shanghai, was also changed. 'There is no official explanation, but we all know that it is . due to the 18th Congress,' he said. History: The congress has been troublesome in the past . 'I guess I will give up running competitions in China and . try to attend more abroad,' said Wang. 'At least they tell me the schedule one year before the . event.' On Thursday the process begins with the opening of the . Central Committee, the roughly 370-member body that is finalising preparations . for the congress. Past examples of trouble surrounding the congress include Bo . Xilai, once a candidate for the all-powerful Politburo's Standing Committee, . suffering a spectacular fall from grace in which his wife was convicted of . murder. One of President Hu Jintao's closest aides was also forced . to step down after his son was killed alongside two partially dressed women in . an accident in his Ferrari. Meanwhile, protests over pollution, land seizures and local . corruption continue across the country.","Chinese fears of disruption ahead of Communist Party congress see extreme security measures implemented .

'We are a very desperate, morally bankrupt culture and that's where demons operate.' Cynthia, who did not wish to provide her surname, was undergoing her third exorcism in Scottsdale. She believes 'Jezebel,' among other demons, was inside her tortured soul. The girls set to work in a conference room, calling out the demon alongside Reverend Larson.

Amazingly, at the end of it all, Cynthia requested one more thing - to marry her partner Ricky there and then.

"By . Rik Sharma . PUBLISHED: . 04:59 EST, 3 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 3 November 2012 . A scientist who claimed he was sacked by Nasa because he believed in intelligent design has been tentatively ruled against in court. David Coppedge was fired from the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, because they thought he was too combative and did not keep his skills up to date. Superior Court Judge Ernest Hiroshige issued a tentative ruling on Thursday saying he was leaning toward finding in favour of the lab. Dismissed: David Coppedge has worked at the Nasa lab for 15 years . Hiroshige, who presided over the civil trial in April, ordered a final ruling drawn up and distributed within 30 days. Coppedge, a self-described evangelical . Christian, had worked on NASA's Cassini mission to explore Saturn for . 15 years until he was dismissed in 2011. The labs' attorney Cameron Fox said . Coppedge was a stubborn and disconnected employee who decided not to . heed warnings to get additional training, even when it became clear the . Cassini mission would be downsized and computer specialist positions . eliminated. He also claimed Coppedge often was . confrontational and insensitive to customers and colleagues, who had . complained about his behaviour and his advocacy of intelligent design. 'What happened to David Coppedge — . really what David Coppedge did to himself — had nothing to do with . intelligent design or religion but with his own stubbornness,' said Fox. Experienced: Coppedge worked as a 'team lead' on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons before being demoted and sacked . William Becker, Coppedge's attorney, argued his client was sacked because he advocated for intelligent design in . the workplace, handed out DVDs on the theory and argued with a colleague . about Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in California. Becker claimed that a supervisor told . Coppedge to 'stop pushing your religion,' and that his client was . retaliated against for disputing a written warning and filing a lawsuit . against the lab. 'Imagine if employees were told, ""Stop . pushing your gay agenda or stop pushing your feminist agenda, your . civil rights agenda,""' Becker said during the closing arguments. His main duties at JPL were to maintain computer networks and troubleshoot technical problems for the mission. In 2000, he was named 'team lead', serving as a liaison between technicians and managers for nearly a decade before being demoted in 2009. He was stripped of his title and responsibilities but his salary stayed the same. Coppedge filed suit in 2010 and then was sacked the next year as part of large cutbacks. NASA: The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California has landed robotic explorers on the surface of Mars and sent probes to outer planets . Coppedge said he believes his support . for a state ballot measure that sought to define marriage as limited to . heterosexual couples and his request to rename the annual holiday party a . 'Christmas party' were factors in his demotion and sacking. 'David had this reputation for being a . Christian, for being a practising one. He did not go around . evangelising or proselytising,' Becker said at the start of the case. 'But if he found out that someone was a Christian he would say, ""Oh that's interesting, what denomination are you?"" 'He's not apologising for who he is. He's an evangelical Christian.' The trial was followed closely by intelligent design adherents who believe life is too complex to come from evolution alone. They distinguish themselves from creationists by not connecting their beliefs to the Bible specifically. The Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian civil rights group, and the Discovery Institute, a proponent of intelligent design, both supported Coppedge's case. Space agency: Coppedge began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003 . 'There is basically a war on anyone . who dissents from Darwin and we've seen that for several years,' said . John West, associate director of Center for Science and Culture at the . Seattle-based Discovery Institute. 'This is free speech, freedom of conscience 101.' Becker said the one-paragraph tentative ruling should not be seen as a referendum on the theory of intelligent design. 'It does not specify the court's . reasoning and it would be foolhardy to discern from its general language . that the court had anything to say about the validity of intelligent . design as a scientific theory or as a religious belief,' Becker said. 'We don't believe it was about . religious belief, but David's co-workers perceived it as one and that's . equally offensive under the law.' Coppedge is active in the intelligent . design sphere and runs a website that interprets scientific discoveries . through the lens of intelligent design. His father wrote an anti-evolution book and founded a Christian outreach group. Coppedge also is a board member for . Illustra Media, a company that produces video documentaries examining . the scientific evidence for intelligent design. The company produces the videos that he was distributing to co-workers.","Tentative ruling backs space organisation who fired David Coppedge because he was too combative .

Switzerland will have a national referendum on immigration after an environmental group collected enough support to force it through. The Ecopop group gathered 120,700 certified signatures which is well over the 100,000 required to bring about the nationwide poll. They are concerned that natural resources are under pressure from overpopulation, in a country of eight million people of whom over a quarter are foreign. Overpopulated: The environmental group want to limit immigration . Ecopop claim they are opposed to xenophobia and racism but say they need to limit the intake of new people to avoid urbanisation and help preserve agricultural land. The Swiss People's Party, a right-wing group, have also collected enough signatures to force a refendum on toughening immigration quotas. They believe immigration is to blame for rising rent costs and busie prublic transport systems. The environmental group demand that annual population growth through immigration to be capped at 0.2% and a tenth of foreign aid money to be spent on birth control measures abroad. Switzerland's population has risen over 15 per cent since 1990. It was shown to be an attractive place to work in March with a low unemployment rate and comparatively high salaries. Overcrowded: Immigration is to blame for public transport being busy, claim the Swiss People's Party . Former director of the Swiss environment department and current Ecopop member Philippe Roch told the BBC: 'The pressure on land, nature and the countryside is considerable, and quality of life is continuously deteriorating due to a lack of living space.' Referenda can take place up to four times a year in Switzerland's system of direct democracy. Switzerland's government has urged voters not to back the initiative because it would bring the country into conflict with its treaty obligations with the European Union. Until last year Switzerland had a quota of 2,000 residency permits a year for citizens of the 'A8' nations, who joined the EU in 2004 - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Despite criticism from European Union officals the Swiss reinstated the immigration quota in April.","Group say they are not racist but need a limit to curb urbanisation and preserve agricultural land .

Nearly two-thirds of young people were unable to say that the First World War ended in 1918, as shown by a new survey. The poll results, released in the run up to Remembrance Day, discovered 54 per cent of the same age range, 16-24, also did not know the war began in 1914. Astonishingly 12 per cent of young people thought that the battle of Waterloo, fought in 1815 as part of the Napoleonic Wars, was part of the Great War. Lack of knowledge: Too many of us do not know our history - one person even thought the First World War began in 1800 . The teenagers also seem less interested in history than previous generations, with only 48 per cent visiting their local war memorial, whereas 59 per cent of respondents across all ages had done so. Although the survey arranged by British Future showed up how ignorant the nation's youth is of history, they are not alone. When asked by YouGov, members of the public hazarded guesses as wildly out as 1800 and 1950 for the start of the Great War, and 1910 and 1960 for the end date. One in three of the public could not name the year that the war started.  The best informed age group were the over 60s. What year did the First World War start?

'The centenary (of the war) is a huge opportunity for schools and museums to do more to help our kids and all ages learn more about our nation's history. 'That's why British Future and the Citizenship Foundation hopes to work with schools on how to use 2014 to make history matter.

But, at the Court of Appeal, lawyers . for the father-of-three said Lindsay had now confirmed that she had been . having an affair with Mr Child, which caused her husband to flip.

Andrew Wilkie, 42, blew his family’s £90,000 savings and £70,000 by remortgaging the family home - then drained his primary school of funds for a new extension. Wilkie turned to online poker while depressed and suspended from work over a child’s accusation of sexual misconduct, of which he was cleared. Following a full police investigation, no action was taken against him - and he was allowed to return to school. But Wilkie was hooked on internet gambling and regularly played online poker into the early hours of the morning. After he gambled away the funds the planned extension to the school hall at Southdown Primary School in Buckley, North Wales, had to be put on hold. Wilkie, who had already been convicted of fraud, was been struck off the teaching register indefinitely after admitting unprofessional conduct at a disciplinary hearing. The General Teaching Council for Wales said Wilkie cannot teach in schools in England or Wales. But he can apply to register again in two years. Representing Wilkie Colin Adkins Mr Adkins, of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), said the decision was 'totally disproportionate'. He said it had failed to consider that Wilkie’s gambling addiction meant he wasn’t in control of his actions.

The Prime Minister takes the card and responds . with firm words warning of a 'witch hunt' that meant prominent people . were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay . Rob Wilson, a Conservative MP, . reported the ITV1 programme to Ofcom and urged it to investigate whether .

The broadcasting regulator is . understood to have had around 100 complaints by today and it will make a . decision about whether it should look into the matter within 15 working . days. A spokesman for Ofcom said: 'We can . confirm that we have received complaints about this issue, which we are . assessing. No decision has been made at this stage to investigate.' After being handed the list, which . Schofield had assembled after trawling the internet for three minutes, . the Prime Minister warned that internet discussions of an alleged . paedophile ring could degenerate into a 'witch-hunt' against people who . are gay.

An Indian woman has passed the 12-year milestone of her hunger strike and shows no signs of stopping. Irom Sharmila, of Manipur in the north east of the country, is refusing to eat in protest against a law which gives armed forces the power to kill without any ramifications. The 40-year-old is imprisoned in a secure hospital and force-fed through her nose twice a day because she refuses to eat until the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is repealed. Staunch protest: Irom Sharmila (centre) is on a hunger strike which has lasted 12 years, in protest against a draconian law which afflicts her state . This act grants armed forces immunity for any actions they carry out while operating in an area affected by rebellion. On November 2 2000 a group of soldiers from the Assam Rifles, protected by this law, shot and killed 10 civilians standing at a bus stop in Malom. They were angry after one of Manipur's rebel groups attacked one of their patrols but the people killed in retaliation were innocent and had nothing to do with the initial incident. Since then she will not eat, drink or even brush her teeth - causing her to be charged which attempting to commit suicide. Incident: Malom, where 10 innocent civilians were killed by armed forces, is in the north east of India . Unrelenting: Shamila says she has not starved herself for 12 years only to relent before her demand is met . 'That was a Thursday, the day I used to fast every week. I was so shocked by the massacre at Malom that I just decided to continue my fast unless the draconian law was repealed,' she told Al Jazeera. Suicide - which her hunger strike was tantamount to - carries a prison sentence of a year - so she is imprisoned then released and then arrested again. Known as the Iron Lady of Manipur, Sharmila holds the record for the world's longest hunger-strike. 'We are observing the spirit of Sharmila by holding a candlelit vigil,' said Sharmila's brother Singhajit on November 5, speaking to The Independent from Imphal, the capital of Manipur state. 'I last was able to see her on 9 October. She expressed to me that she would not accept any award from any organisation until her demands have been fulfilled.' She is refusing to accept any awards for her activism - instead hoping to collect them after she is released if her strike is successful. Locked away: Sharmila is kept in a guarded hospital because she refuses to eat and drink . Her brother told local media: 'After Sharmila comes out winning, she will collect it [an award] herself.' Over the past year authorities have stopped parts of Manipur from being covered by the act. Sharmila, though, will not cease her hunger strike until it is removed entirely from the state. 'I fast until the AFSPA goes. I have not wasted 12 years of my life to back off. Either my people live with respect or I don't eat,' she explained. Despite her action the issue is largely unknown among the Indian public - meaning there is no end in sight. An expert on the north east of the country, Sanjoy Hazarika, said there had not been any change. He explained: 'The cabinet has not even considered a proposal on this issue from the home ministry that was sent two years ago.'","Irom Sharmila is locked away in a guarded hospital as she continues her protest .

Training day: Mario Swain, 33, was convicted of murdering Lola Nixon, 44, during a break-in at her Texas home in 2002 . A man described by a prosecutor as 'a serial killer in training' was executed Thursday in Texas for a woman's slaying during a break-in at her home a decade ago. Mario Swain, 33, received a lethal injection for killing Lola Nixon at her home in East Texas' Longview two days after Christmas in 2002. When asked by a warden if he had a final statement before his punishment, the condemned prisoner shook his head, closed his eyes and took several barely audible breaths. Within a moment, all movement stopped. Swain was pronounced dead 30 minutes later, at 6:39 p.m. CST. No family members or friends of Nixon were at the execution. Swain also had no relatives among the witnesses. Swain's attorney, James Volberding, said no late attempts were made in the courts to block the execution, the 13th this year in the nation's busiest capital punishment state. The U.S. Supreme Court last month refused to review the case, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last week rejected an appeal that contended a prison expert's testimony during the sentencing phase of Swain's 2003 capital murder trial was false and misleading. Swain declined media interview requests as his execution date neared. Evidence showed Swain threw the 46-year-old Nixon's body into the trunk of her BMW after killing her, drove to a remote area outside of the city about 120 miles east of Dallas and dumped it in the back seat of an abandoned car. Nixon missed a dinner engagement with friends on the night she was slain. Her friends called police when they couldn't reach her the next day, and officers who went to her home found the back door jimmied. Once inside, they saw blood throughout the house. A neighbor reported seeing an unfamiliar truck parked on the street the night before, and police tracked the vehicle to Swain. He initially blamed friends for the burglary, then led police to Nixon's body. Authorities determined she'd been beaten with a tire iron, stabbed and strangled. Big house: Swain was given a lethal injection at Huntsville Prison at 7pm Thursday evening . The tire iron was recovered from a trash container where Swain said he had thrown it. Evidence showed he used Nixon's credit cards and gave a piece of her stolen jewelry to a friend. Nixon's blood was found on Swain's clothing in the truck, along with her car keys and garage door opener. According to evidence and testimony at trial, Swain gathered information about women he wanted to rob and then would attack them, forcing them to inhale the anesthetic halothane and hitting them over the head with a wrench or shooting them with a stun gun. Lance Larison, a prosecutor at Swain's trial, described Swain as 'a serial killer in training.' 'A girlfriend told us he kept a list in notebooks of names and license plates of girls he would follow,' Larison said. 'I think he was working up to something.' It's not clear if Swain knew Nixon. She managed a Longview telephone call center where Swain once worked. One of Swain's trial lawyers, Rick Hagan, said the evidence and vivid testimony from those who say Swain robbed and attacked them hindered the defense's efforts to convince jurors to spare Swain from the death penalty. Larson said blood evidence in the case was 'consistent with a struggle' inside Nixon's home, where she lived alone. Deborah Hancock told the Longview News-Journal she and her husband were to have dinner with Nixon that Friday night after Christmas 2002. They stopped by Nixon's house with a carry-out package when she didn't arrive to eat with them. When their knocks went unanswered, they left the food at her front door. 'I can't believe it's been 10 years,' Hancock said. 'She was very outgoing and very direct, fun, lively. She was just one of a kind.' Swain's execution is to be followed by two more next week in Texas.","Mario Swain, 33, died of a lethal injection at 6:39pm CST .

Great Briton: Joseph Stenhouse, who died in action in 1941, was at the forefront of British exploration of the Antarctic and later fought valiantly against the Germans in both wars . He was one of Shackleton's key men during his Antarctic adventures and went on to be a decorated hero in both World Wars. But at last the incredible life of great British sailor Joseph Stenhouse has been brought to the fore with the sale of his vast collection of medals. The impressive artefacts, which includes his OBE and Distinguished Service Order, are now being sold at auction in London and are expected to fetch £25,000. They have spent the last 30 years in the private collection of an unidentified ‘connoisseur’ of British naval history. Stenhouse catapulted himself from his life as a shipbuilder's son in Dumbarton, Scotland, to one of the last century's most impressive men, helping lead British exploration and later protecting our shores from German attack. His qualities were first recognised when he joined Ernest Shackleton’s legendary expedition to the Antarctic in 1914 where he commanded the supply ship Aurora which spent 283 days drifting in . pack ice having been wrenched from its moorings in the harsh and . freezing conditions. According to Shackleton, Stenhouse ‘accomplished one of the most . difficult journeys on record’ by sailing the ship 1,000 miles to New . Zealand and saving the crew. Upon his return to Britain, the First World War was in full swing and . Stenhouse went on to serve on the secretive Q-ship PQ61 that was famous . for its concealed weaponry. Hero: His medals are expected to fetch £25,000 when they go under the hammer at Dix Noonan Webb saleroom in London on Wednesday . In September 1917 the vessel engaged and sank a U-boat in the Irish sea for which Stenhouse was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He was duly promoted and later joined Shackleton on a mission to . Murmansk to equip and train the north Russian, anti-Bolshevik army. At the age of 52, Stenhouse signed on for active service after the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940 in the Gulf of Aden his ship was mined and 11 men were killed but he risked his own life to save a crew member. He was killed the following year after his ship, HMS Sheba, exploded in the Red Sea. Original: This telegram from Shackleton to Stenhouse is to thank him and his crew for their heroic efforts in the Antarctic . Christopher Hill, from Dix Noonan Webb auction house, said: 'This group of medals . encapsulates one of the great British stories of pluck and luck - with . all the key ingredients of heroism, leadership, exploration and that . essential British character of “never say die”. 'And those who saw that wonderful BBC programme of Shackleton’s 1914-16 . expedition to the Antarctic starring Sir Kenneth Branagh will remember . just what a truly amazing bunch of men they were. 'And to think that having survived all that, many not only went on like . Stenhouse to be heroes again in the latter part of World War One, but . then lost their lives also. 'These men’s memories deserve to be remembered and told through their medals.'","The collection of honours handed to Joseph Stenhouse is expected to make £25,000 on Wednesday .

When officers arrived they found the 28-year-old with multiple stab wounds to her leg and upper body. Lister Primary School in Liverpool, where an eight month pregnant woman was attacked and stabbed on school premises . The expectant mother was taken to hospital in a 'serious but stable' condition, where doctors carried out tests on her unborn baby. Ultrasound scans appeared to show the baby was not harmed and the victim was said to be much improved, sitting up in bed just hours after the incident. It was understood the depth of the wounds did not appear to have injured the baby and the woman was kept in hospital for observation. Her condition was today described as 'stable'. A shocked parent whose son attends the nursery at the infant school said: 'When I heard what had happened I felt sick. I’ve never seen anything like it, it’s a brilliant school. I’m praying that she’s OK and the baby as well.' The woman was attacked on a walkway within the grounds of the school but well away from classrooms. Officers are still working to recover the knife and no weapons were recovered at the scene. Police are also checking to see whether the stabbing is linked to an argument at the school involving two mothers in the past month.

Jean McEwan, headteacher at the school which has more than 200 pupils on roll, moved quickly to reassure parents no children were caught up in what she termed a 'domestic incident'. The school also contacted parents ahead of home-time warning they would have to use an alternative entrance to collect their children as the main access point was cordoned off by police. In a letter given to parents yesterday Mrs McEwan said: 'There was an incident at school at lunchtime involving a parent. 'This was a domestic incident which did not involve any of the children. I would like to reassure you that all the children are safe and the matter is being dealt with.'

Stricken electrical retail chain Comet is axing 330 staff at its headquarters and support centres. Administrator Deloittes  across made the announcement today but stressed there had been no redundancies of shop staff and that all Comet's 236 stores remain open. The bulk of the staff cuts have been made in the company's head office in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire as well as at its site in Hull and a call centre in Clevedon, Somerset. Deloitte added that it was holding talks with a number of potential buyers for Comet, which fell into administration a week ago. Economic woes: As shoppers searched for bargains today administrator Deloitte announced 330 job losses at Comet . The news came as bargain hunters . descended on stores across the country in the hope of picking up a . discount product ahead of planned closures next week. However, although the electrical . retailer's website announced a 'massive stock liquidation' in its 236 . stores, many dismayed shoppers were greeted with price cuts of just 10 . per cent. Many of those who dashed to visited the sale today described it as 'nothing special' and a 'waste of time'. Another added: 'Even with a massive liquidation sale, they're still a massive rip off!' Comet is being run by administrators Deloitte, who are moving to wind down the failed retailer ahead of closures. Customers are only able to get the reduced prices in shops, with the website providing just a question . and answer page, store locations. It also confirms that gift cards will . be accepted during the sale, after they initially announcing that all vouchers had been suspended. There were a few bargains to be had in some places, however, with one Twitter user reporting that he had bought a 14 megapixel camera for £50. But @RyanEsq echoed many shoppers' sentiments when he tweeted: 'Comet liquidation sale, rather underwhelming! 10% here odd 20% there. Very poor! Can see why they got into trouble!' Spree: Others were more successful and were seen leaving the store in Royton, Oldham with cut-price electrical goods . Opportunity: Customers picked up TVs and kitchen appliances at the liquidation sale . No refunds: Families in North Tyneside buy what they can before Comet shuts up shop . Big promise: Comet's website is directing shoppers to stores for the sale, but any ordered items that are not in stock may never arrive . Price reductions were 'meagre' today, warned inquirer.net, and the most attractive items were only discounted by 10 per cent. It added: 'In the 15 per cent discount bin we found mice, 20 per cent included fat fryers, printer ink and DVD players, and the 30 per cent lot included TV stands.' Martin Lewis, the creator of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The Comet sale is not earth shattering – certainly there are no once in a lifetime deals. 'Where it does scrape a few quid off are for branded goods that are rarely discounted such as iPads and Kindles. If you're looking for TVs or washing machines, you'll still find cheaper using comparison sites. 'It's also worth asking the question: what will happen if goods go wrong?

A death row inmate has been saved from execution just hours before he was scheduled to die today by lethal injection for the murder of a teenage girl. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today sent the case of 56-year-old Hubert Lester Michael Jr back to a district court . judge for additional proceedings. The Pennsylvania inmate had faced a 7pm (EST) execution for the 1993 killing of 16-year-old Trista Elizabeth Eng in York County. Stay of execution: Hubert Michael Jr, 56 (pictured left) was set to be executed by lethal injection tonight in Pennsylvania after he murdered teenager Trista Eng (right) in 1993 . He would have been the first person . executed in the state since 1999 and the only one in the past 50 years who had not voluntarily given up . on his appeals. His defense . lawyers welcomed the decision and said their client has 'compelling . legal claims which have never been reviewed by any court'. The attorney . general's office declined to comment over the killer's stay of execution at Rockview Prison in Pennsylvania. Michael pleaded guilty to murdering . Eng after kidnapping her in York County. At a 1997 hearing, his former . public defender testified that Michael told him how he picked up the . girl hitchhiking, bound her with electrical cord, . raped her and killed her on state game land. He was not charged with rape due to a lack of physical evidence, though prosecutors suspected it. Michael . confessed to his brother, who located her remains about a month after . she disappeared and called police. Miss Eng had been shot in the head and . chest. Stay of execution: Michael Jr was 37 years old when he was convicted in 1993 . Attorneys for Michael have previously argued that his Asperger's syndrome prevented him from accepting a life sentence he was originally offered. The disorder can cause sufferers to have trouble with social situations, be uncomfortable with changes in routine or have heightened sensitivities to certain situations. Since he was sentenced to death, . Michael had abandoned his appeals but later resumed a legal fight, . saying he had been confined under circumstances at Graterford State . Prison that worsened mental health problems. Those problems got better . after he was transferred, his lawyers have . argued. At Wednesday's pardons board hearing, . the victim's mother, Suzanne Eng, set the tone for relatives and . friends who made emotional pleas to keep the execution on track. Mrs Eng said: 'He kidnapped her, he raped her and . then he executed her. 'As she begged him not to kill . her, he shot her three times.' With regards the stay of execution, the circuit court panel directed the . district court to address, among other things, whether Michael's appeal . should be considered a successive petition that is subject to stricter . rules, whether 'extraordinary circumstances' existed and whether a . district court proceeding is needed to consider the merits of Michael's . claims. In a filing on Thursday, the attorney . general's office said Michael is pursuing a 'successive' federal appeal . that is subject to more strict court rules. Halted: The murderer's execution at Rockview prison in Pennsylvania was stopped by judges at the eleventh hour today . Prosecutors wrote: 'Michael's entire argument was that, . since the time of his voluntary waiver, the circumstances of his . confinement have improved and effected some concomitant amelioration of . his spirit. He has developed relationships ... and he has changed his . mind. 'Even if true, this argument is in no way . similar to a complaint of error at the district court proceeding based . on failure to exhaust, procedural default, or the relevant statute of . limitations.' Pennsylvania has more than 200 people on death row, the greatest number after California, Texas and Florida. The lack of executions has been . attributed to a number of factors. Prosecutors claim an anti-death penalty bias on the part . of appeals' judges, while defense attorneys note many of the sentences . have been proved to be flawed and overturned on legitimate legal . grounds.","Hubert Lester Michael, 56, was scheduled to be first person executed in Pennsylvania for 13 years .

Bearing up: James Sullivan, 26, first became ill on his wedding day when he began feeling sick and suffering an upset stomach. He felt significantly worse by the end of the longed for trip . A groom and his new wife are suing holiday giant First Choice after their family contracted salmonella while on their dream wedding holiday in Cuba. Their baby daughter, the only one who was officially found to have the potentially fatal bacteria, was rushed to hospital after she began to fit. At first James Sullivan, from Sheffield had put his jittery stomach down to pre-wedding nerves as he prepared for the big day at the Playa Pesquero hotel, in the Cuban resort of Holguin. But 11 days into the holiday and on the morning of his wedding to partner Collette, he and his two young children's symptoms descended into diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. When the couple returned from the nightmare trip, their baby daughter Ava's condition took a turn for the worse. Mrs Sullivan said: 'James was ill on the wedding day but you grin and smile through it for a photo. 'He, my son Cole, four, and Ava were all ill. 'But Ava was the worst. 'It's not how you imagine your wedding to be. 'I was completely fine as I stuck to chips, and I didn't eat many of them as I had to get in my wedding dress. 'But on the plane home, Ava became very ill. She soiled her dress and we had to keep constantly changing her. 'She developed blisters around her nappy and bottom. It was horrible.' Once the family were home in Sheffield the little girl became so desperately ill she began to fit and had to be rushed to hospital in an ambulance. While there, it was confirmed . little Ava had contracted salmonella, a disease which if the immune . system is already low, can prove fatal. Mr and Mrs Sullivan said they feared at one point their daughter would die. Mrs Sullivan, a housewife, added: 'She overheated and started convulsing as if she was having febrile convulsions. 'She was boiling hot. 'I am epileptic, and it was just like an epileptic fit. 'Their main concern was cooling her down. 'Once they stabilised her and got her test results, they confirmed salmonella. 'It was just terrifying.' The mother of two now fears her husband and son may have had the same bug that her young daughter was just too weak to fight off. The Sullivan family said they . expected the four-star Playa Pesquero to be a dream resort after seeing . it listed as a ‘premier’ hotel on the First Choice website. Smiling through: Collette Sullivan with daughter one-year-old Ava putting on a brave face at the dream Cuban wedding which was ruined when groom James Sullivan and daughter Ava fell ill .

Ruined: The couple say their dream wedding was ruined at the hotel. Pictured, Playa Pesquero as it appears on the agents website . But they claim the hotel had poor food hygiene standards with 'birds and stray cats roaming the outdoor restaurant'. They also became convinced staff were serving up leftovers after they were served 'peas and sprouts for breakfast'. The Sullivan family have now instructed travel law experts at Irwin Mitchell to pursue a case against tour operator First Choice. Sorry: First Choice said it was sorry the couple had not had a nice stay but insisted the hotel was a 'popular' destination . The firm successfully represented holidaymakers who were ill at the hotel in both 2008 and 2009. She said: 'We know you get tummy bugs abroad. 'We're not scroungers and have thought hard about taking any action at all. 'If anything does come of this, all of the money will be put in a fund for Ava. 'We still don't know what the long term effects of the poisoning will have on her. 'She was so ill, she may never be the same again.' She added: 'This was supposed to be the most perfect day of our life but the . illness completely ruined our holiday and wedding celebrations. 'It was heartbreaking to see my daughter so ill and to find out she had contracted salmonella is terrifying.' Mr Sullivan said: 'The food was sometimes undercooked, we saw some food uncovered so flies were buzzing around, and we suspected they were re-using food between meals - which became pretty obvious when they served up peas and sprouts for breakfast one morning.' Jatinder Paul, a travel law solicitor at Irwin Mitchell representing the family, said: 'Instead of enjoying the first few days of married life, the Sullivans had to deal with the hugely stressful situation of caring for their very poorly family.' A First Choice spokeswoman said: 'We are sorry to hear the family did not enjoy their holiday.

The days of wives receiving multi-million pound divorce payouts from wealthy husbands could be numbered after one of the country's top family judges slammed such claims. Lord Justice Thorpe said payouts in 'big money' divorces, where wives feel it is 'reasonable' to ask for millions to maintain the lifestyle they are accustomed to, should be consigned to history, adding: 'We only talk about ""needs"" when there isn't a lot to go round.' The judge made the comments when presiding over a case in which multi-millionaire hotel boss Andrew Morris Davies, is battling to get a £2.75million divorce payout awarded to his ex-wife Debra Ann Davies cut. Debra Ann Davies (left) leaving the Appeal Court. She is involved in a bitter divorce battle with her multi-millionaire hotelier ex-husband Andrew Davies (right) Mr Davies was 'in love' with his business, The Cardiff Hotel, in exclusive Norfolk Square, Bayswater, West London, and described himself as 'a force of nature' to Judge Martin O'Dwyer who made the award to his ex-wife. She helped run the hotel for 13 years before the couple split, and in August last year, Judge O'Dwyer recognised her contribution to the success of the business when he awarded her a £2.2million lump sum, plus the £550,000 former matrimonial home, in Friars Way, Acton. That payout was largely made up of a one-third share in the £6m value of the hotel building and business. Mr Davies reacted angrily to the award, insisting that - whilst his wife was 'the second best receptionist' he ever had - she should not get a share of the hotel's value because she was just a paid employee who 'simply did her duties'. Today he asked Lord Justice Thorpe, Lord Rimer and Lord Justice Elias sitting in London's Appeal Court to slash her payout. Mr Davies, 50, married his Australian wife, 39, in 2005, and they had two children, but the couple had been together- with Mrs Davies working up to 17 hours-a-day helping run the hotel business - since 1997. However they split after just four years of marriage. Lord Justice Thorpe said payouts in 'big money' divorces should be consigned to history . The court heard the hotel had been passed to Mr Davies and his two sisters by their parents, and Mr and Mrs Davies bought out his siblings' shares during their marriage. Having heard that Judge O'Dwyer had assessed Mrs Davies' claim, 'in terms of pure need', at £1.55million and had then upped her payout to £2.7million because of her contribution to the success of the hotel, Lord Justice Thorpe said: . 'Any mention of needs is completely inappropriate in a case of this scale. We only talk about needs when there isn't a lot to go round. 'In a case like this, which is loosely categorised as 'big money', needs should not make much of a contribution to judicial reasoning. 'The bigger the family fortune, the less relevant needs became. In big money cases, the wife will often get twice what she needs. I don't see what bearing needs have in this case.' Peter Duckworth, for Mr Davies, argued that the hotel had been a 'gift' by Mr Davies' parents, Morris and Gwyneth, to their children, and the judge had over-estimated the value of the ex-wife's contribution. 'The affairs of the Cardiff Hotel were at all times kept separate. The wife had no say in how the business was run, or any share in the profits - rather, she was paid a wage,' the barrister said, adding that judge O'Dwyer had been wrong when he found that the business was 'entirely valueless' in 1997 before Mr and Mrs Davies began working there together. Saying that, before the wife had any input, the business had produced a post tax profit of £250,000, the barrister said: 'The judge found that the hotel was wholly valueless in 2007. In reality it was a cash generator.' Insisting that the couple had done no more than take advantage of the valuable gift provided by Mr Davies' parents, the barrister added: 'They didn't add value to the business- they just took what was there and exploited it. 'Judge O'Dwyer accepted the wife's evidence that she had basically turned the business around - She takes credit for the great rise in company turnover. Mr Davies asked Lord Justice Thorpe, Lord Rimer and Lord Justice Elias sitting in London's Appeal Court to slash his wife's payout . 'But the value of the hotel business . has varied in relation to the state of the economy, and there was . nothing to suggest that the wife contributed to the value of the . business,' Mr Duckworth said. In . her evidence to Judge O'Dwyer, Mrs Davies said she and her husband had . 'worked ceaselessly' to transform a 'dowdy and unwelcoming' hotel with . 'no sense of customer service' into a successful and lucrative business. 'We . threw ourselves into it wholeheartedly,' Mrs Davies told the court, . explaining why she felt she was entitled to a share of the value of the . business. 'Mr Davies was burning to make the hotel . work. He was in love with the hotel. His characterisation of his wife . was as a good employee. He said she had been the second best . receptionist he had.' Judge O'Dwyer . She said she had . built and designed the hotel's first website and transformed its . advertising, as well as working extremely long hours, whilst living with . Mr Davies in a 9'x8' room on the premises before they bought their . home. Jonathan Cohen QC, . for Mrs Davies, said: 'The husband in his case was seeking to diminish . the wife's contribution and in that he failed squarely.' He added that, by virtue of her hard work at the hotel, as well as raising a family, the wife deserved every penny of her award, regardless of whether or not her 'reasonable needs' had been over-estimated. 'When one comes to look at fairness, which is the touchstone of all these cases, this award is at the low end, bearing in mind that this was a lady who made a very active contribution to the business for 13 years and when the marriage broke down was left with two children,' said Mr Cohen. Judge O'Dwyer, in his ruling last year, had acknowledged Mr Davies' fierce love for his business, and observed: 'There is a third party in the relationship- the Cardiff Hotel.' 'Mr Davies was burning to make the hotel work. He was in love with the hotel. His characterisation of his wife was as a good employee. He said she had been the second best receptionist he had.' Although Mr Davies had at one time been 'head over heels in love with her', the judge said there was now 'no real acknowledgment by him of her commitment to him both before and after the marriage.' 'He has a great love of the hotel and a strong sense of entitlement to it.' Dealing with Mr Davies' view of his ex-wife's role at the hotel, the judge said: 'It was his case that, because she had been paid as an employee, she had simply done her duties.' Lords Justice Thorpe, Rimer and Elias reserved their decision on Mr Davies' appeal, to be delivered at a later date.","Lord Justice Thorpe said 'big' payouts should be consigned to history .

Beckham was wrapped up after he was substituted out of the game in which Los Angeles Galaxy claimed a 3-1 victory over San Jose. Treatment: It is thought the clingfilm could be used to hold an ice pack, cold gel or heat rub in place .

Shame: Guy Marsden, nephew of the late Jimmy Savile, says his uncle's body should be exhumed and cremated . The nephew of paedophile Jimmy Savile has said that his uncle's body should be exhumed from its grave overlooking the North Sea. Guy Marsden, son of Savile's sister Marjorie, thinks that the pervert should be removed from Scarborough cemetery and cremated. Mr Marsden says other family members probably agree with him, adding it would spare anguish for victims or others who have loved-ones buried at Woodlands Cemetery, he told Sky News. Mr Marsden said: 'If it is causing heartache and pain we would definitely go along with the people of Scarborough and the people whose loved ones are buried there. 'My own personal view, and I could say that of a lot of my family, would be that if it comes to it where he has to be moved, let's get it moved. Let's get it done.' He has already told the Mail that his celebrity uncle attended ‘paedophile parties’ when he was 13 and Guy and his friends went to numerous events where he . believes men sexually abused girls and boys as young as ten. At the moment Savile is lying in an unmarked grave after his family requested his giant ornate headstone be removed out of respect for the hundreds he sexually abused. All its inscriptions have been ground away and the stone smashed up and sent to landfill. Several families of people buried in the council-owned cemetery say they do not want his body to remain in its prime position above all the other graves at the top of the hill. Scarborough Cemetery isn’t a churchyard . but Scarborough Borough Council officials have confirmed that the area . where Jimmy Savile is buried is consecrated. Permission to remove the body of the disgraced showbiz star would have to be granted by Church of England Judge Canon Peter Collier QC, who would have to weigh any 'potential benefit' against the 'Christian theology of the permanence of burial'. Scarborough councillor, Colin Haddington, has also called for Savile’s corpse to be exhumed and then cremated at a nearby crematorium. The Tory councillor said he had been contacted by a constituent whose . granddaughter was buried close to Savile, which had caused her enormous . concern and her family a great deal of distress. 'I was approached by one of my . constituents who informed me that her granddaughter is buried in . Woodlands Cemetery and unfortunately Jimmy Savile has been buried very . close by this lady's granddaughter,' he said. 'This has caused a great deal of distress to her constituent and her family. 'I put it to the council today if Jimmy Savile's body could be exhumed or cremated.' Grave: Bunches of flowers mark the grave of Sir Jimmy Savile after his headstone was removed in the middle of the night - and shows its view over the town and sea . Gone: The headstone was only put in place three weeks before it was removed last month - and he was buried at a 45 degree angle encased in concrete - his dying wish . Relation: Guy says that his family will agree that his uncle's body should be removed and cremated . He added that the response from the council was 'disappointing' but . acknowledged the decision could only be made by Savile's family. Savile's dying wish was to be encased in concrete and buried at an angle so he could 'see' the sea from his final resting place. Memories: Guy, now 59, pictured at 8, says that his 'Uncle Jimmy' took him to parties where children were used for sex . But days after the details of his abuse broke, the gates of Woodlands Cemetery were locked at the dead of night and police stood guard for the two-hour operation to remove Savile's Scarborough grave. His loved-ones did not attend and while they had ordered the removal of the grave they were not aware of the undertakers’ decision to do it in the middle of the night. They were to wait until 7am before removing the six foot wide by four foot tall  headstone with Savile’s now inflammatory epitaph: 'It was good while it lasted.' The Savile family said in a statement: 'Members of the family of Sir Jimmy Savile have decided to remove his headstone from the grave in Scarborough. 'The family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery. Meanwhile West Yorkshire Police confirmed today that Savile 'may' have been questioned by Ripper detectives. A former detective who helped catch . the Yorkshire Ripper made the shocking claim. Former . West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar . News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the . public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible . killer. The late Jimmy Savile, pictured in the 1970's working as a porter at Leeds General Infirmary, has been accused by his nephew of attending parties in London attended by children as young as ten . Mr Stainthorpe, who . worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who . spent years trying to catch Peter Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When . the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put forward by members . of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may seem. Lawyers representing the disgraced DJ’s alleged victims said they have now notified his estate executors, the BBC and three hospitals that they plan to launch damages claims against them. Three more cases are likely to be pursued against the BBC in the coming weeks, one lawyer said. The former presenter’s £4 million estate has already been frozen by executor NatWest. Law firm Pannone, which has been contacted by 46 of his alleged victims, says it has received 'firm instructions' to proceed with eight claims.Seven will be made against Savile’s estate and one will be launched against the BBC and his estate jointly. All victims were aged between 10 and 13 when the alleged abuse took place in the late 1960s and 1970s. Pannone lawyer Alan Collins said: 'I anticipate around three more against the BBC in the coming weeks. 'It’s very serious stuff. If Savile was alive and convicted, he’d be looking at a very long stretch in prison, if not life.' He said they were receiving new complaints by the day, around 40% of which have been made by men. And the West Yorkshire force did not rule it out. 'As with thousands of other men in Leeds at the time, he may at some time have been approached by detectives on the investigation. 'What is without doubt is that Savile was clearly not the Yorkshire Ripper.' It came as an up and coming radio star says he lost his spot on the BBC after reporting vile Jimmy Savile’s abuse of young girls to bosses. David Hardwick was a regular guest on Savile’s Speakeasy radio show in the early 1970s but that came to an abrupt end when he said he thought the DJ was a paedophile. Mr Hardwick reported he had witnessed young teenage girls leaving Savile’s scruffy motor home in an isolated area of a service station more than 40 years ago. But the power of Savile was such that David was told by BBC top brass to never mention the allegation again through fear that 'we could all lose our jobs.' David, now 67 said: 'I told my friend and producer Roy Trevivian who passed it  up to the head of religious cultural programming at the time. 'I was called by Roy, who has since died, a few days after the allegation. I was told ‘we will not be looking into this because they are only suspicions and  because it is Jimmy Savile, it would be dangerous to do so, as we could all  lose our jobs.’ 'That to me says Savile could do what he wanted while at the Beeb but they certainly can’t say they didn’t know about his abuse because I told them.'","Guy Marsden, son of Savile's sister Marjorie, says it would spare anguish for victims and families with loved ones buried in same Scarborough cemetery .
Local Council has received complaints from people who want his body removed .
Request for body to be exhumed can only be made by Savile's own family, who already had his headstone removed out of 'respect' for victims .
Meanwhile West Yorkshire Police admit Savile may have been questioned during Yorkshire Ripper investigation ."

By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:35 EST, 9 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:59 EST, 9 November 2012 . The flamboyant Jason Brock's departure was overshadowed tonight by canny Simon Cowell's decision to reveal the contestants rankings for the first time. It came as a surprise - especially to the frontrunner himself - to hear that the audience favourite is 37-year-old road worker Tate Stevens. Scroll down to watch Jason and CeCe sing for survival... Shock: The X Factor revealed that America gave Tate Stevens the most votes this week, it came as a surprise to the stetson sporting 37-year-old road worker . The cowboy-hat wearing singer pulled in more votes from viewers than any of the other, younger, contestants. On learning the news he joked: 'Wow, obviously people in America don't get out a lot! Thank you so very much. This is huge.' But another thirty-something was not so admired, and Jason, 35, was forced to say goodbye. 'I did for the gays and Japan!' Jason was gracious in defeat after his lovely version of Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart . He was forced into a sing off against fellow contestant CeCe Frey for the final spot in the top 12 of the show. But . when the judges couldn't decide who to send home, it was revealed that . because Jason had got the fewest votes from TV viewers, he wouldn't be . going any further. For the first time ever viewers got to see who were the most, and least popular, acts as their rankings were revealed following the public vote. Forever's not going to start tonight: Not in terms of Jason's career . Singing for survival: But it didn't count as CeCe was saved by the public vote... just . The show opened with a bang - and the screams of dozens of female fans in the audience - as British boyband One Direction performed new single, Live While We're Young. 'How hot is One Direction?' asked Khloe Kardashian Odom as she touched both Liam and Zayn. The previous night judge Simon Cowell pulled a stunning U-turn when he brought back teenager Diamond White, who had already been kicked off the show. That left 13 finalists instead of the usual 12. Big night: The judges got unprecedented feedback by learning the position of their acts in America's esteem . Surprise: Tate could barely take in the news that he'd garnered the most votes . Loyal: L.A stuck by his 'entertainer' Jason after he received the least votes . No.2: Carly Rose Soneclar was tonight's runner up . Khloe Kardashian added: 'There was a whole lot of drama on stage last night.' Britney Spears, wearing a shimmery silver top that exposed her midriff and back, then walked onstage with her Teens category - Arin Ray, Beatrice Miller, Diamond White and Carly Rose Sonenclar. Demi Lovato, in a flowery skirt that showed off her toned legs, then appeared with the acts she has been mentoring - the young adults, CeCe Frey, Jennel Garcia and Paige Thomas. LA Reid, in a smart suit, then walked on with his over-25s acts - Jason Brock, Tate Stevens and Vino Alan. And finally Simon Cowell, wearing a trademark sweater and jeans, appeared with the Groups - Emblem3, Fifth Harmony and Lyric145. Looking the part: CeCe is the image of a pop star but she's still proving unpopular . Safe... for now: CeCe sobbed as she realised she was staying in the competition . A night of two halves: Simon enjoyed watching his UK find One Direction sing to screaming hordes but was shocked that Emblem3 ranked so low . Mario Lopez said: 'We're going to reveal who's made it through to the top 12. They will ALL be back next week. Good luck!' He added: 'By the way, these results are in no particular order. Safe and through to the top 12 is… ""' Arin Ray, Paige Thomas, Diamond White, Vino Alan, Jennel Garcia and Emblem3 were all put out of their misery quickly and told they were here to stay. 1.

CeCe Frey . Carly Rose Sonenclar clasped her hands to her face as she found out she will be going straight through. Also getting the good news were Tate Stevens, and Beatrice Miller - meaning all four of Britney's acts were voted into the next round. Beatrice hugged Britney at the news. Also through was Lyric145, leaving CeCeFrey, Jason Brock and Fifth Harmony to battle it out for the final guaranteed spot. Mario Lopez then said: 'The next act through to the top 12 is Fifth Harmony!' The bottom two acts - CeCe and Jason - were then told they would have to sing before the judges decided who would be leaving the contest for good. As she introduced her back on stage, Demi added: 'Please welcome the amazing, and talented and very beautiful CeCe Frey.' The hopeful, dressed in Madonna-esque cream trousers and a cream top that showed off her arms, then belted out Cher's You Haven't Seen the Last of Me, which featured on the soundtrack of 2010 movie Burlesque. After another ad break Jason Brock took to the stage to sing for survival. He performed a stripped-down version of Total Eclipse of the Heart as he made a last-gasp bid to win over the judges. The two acts then appeared on stage as Lopez explained how the judges would vote in turn on who they wanted to send home. If there was a deadlock the act with the lowest number of original viewer votes would be the one to get the axe. Time to rethink: Simon says he will possibly be restyling Emblem3 . Relief: We haven't seen the end of Fifth Harmony yet, and Simon is pleased about it . Through! Britney hugs Beatrice Miller in joy . As the tense announcements began, Demi Lovato was the first to send home Jason Brock, to boos form the audience. LA Reid said: 'I'm sorry, I'm going to have to send CeCe home.' Britney Spears also revealed she would be sending home CeCe, but Simon opted for Jason. That meant the two acts were tied with two strikes each - leaving the decision in the hands of the audience who originally cast their votes. Mario Lopez said: 'This truly is up to America.' Keeping her girl: Demi didn't have to say goodbye to CeCe . No need to say goodbye: Paige Thomas is through but wasn't as high up in the ranks as Demi thought she should... or would be . Nine lives: Diamond White was brought back last night after her shock elimination, and she's No.4 with fans . Opening an envelope with the results on it, he added: 'The act with the lowest number of votes and who is going home tonight is Jason Brock.' Jason appeared to be holding it together as he said: 'I want to say, I did it for the gays, and for Japan. But I'm really happy to have been here.' Mentor LA Reid said: ""I'm still proud of him, every time he sings. It really does make me sad to see you go. Keep doing it."" 'I will keep singing,' Jason vowed. At the end of the show it was revealed who got the most votes, in what was claimed to be a first for American reality TV.","Full disclosure of results 'first for American reality TV'

Protest was right: Andrew Haldane, from the Bank of England, said the Occupy protests were right to attack the financial system . The Occupy protesters who camped at St Paul’s Cathedral were morally and intellectually right to attack the financial system, says a Bank of England official. Andrew Haldane, a member of the financial policy committee at the bank, said the movement was successful in attacking the problems of the global financial system and ‘helped stir’ improvement in financial services. Protesters staged considerable protests in London and New York against economic inequality and the influence of the financial services industry. Hundreds of movement members camped outside St Paul’s for more than three months after they were prevented from entering nearby Paternoster Square, where the London Stock Exchange is located. Police forcibly evicted them in February this year after the protesters lost a court battle with the local authorities. Mr Haldane spoke to Occupy Economics, a branch of the movement, at a London event last night. He said: ‘Occupy has been successful in its efforts to popularise the problems of the global financial system for one very simple reason; they are right.’ ‘Occupy’s voice has been both loud and persuasive and policymakers have listened and are acting. ‘In fact, I want to argue that we are in the early stages of a reformation of finance, a reformation which Occupy has helped stir.’ Influential: Mr Haldane said the movement, whose members camped outside St Paul's Cathedral for more than three months, 'helped stir' improvement in financial services . Loud voice: A protester at the High Court after demonstrators lost a court battle with the local authorities to evict the protesters camping outside St Paul's . He said that protesters had been right about the consequences of high salaries and bonuses in the financial sector. Mr Haldane said: ‘I do not just mean right in a moral sense. It is the analytical, every bit as much as the moral, ground that Occupy has taken. ‘For the hard-headed facts suggest that, at the heart of the global financial crisis, were and are, problems of deep and rising inequality.’ Mr Haldane told activists that Occupy played an instrumental role in improving and reforming finance services. 'Popularise problems': Mr Haldane said Occupy were persuasive and 'policymakers have listened and are acting' He said: ‘If I am right and a new leaf is being turned, then Occupy will have played a key role in this fledgling financial reformation. ‘You have put the arguments. You have helped win the debate.’ The Bank of England official made no mention of Occupy’s use of controversial protest techniques which included claims that they desecrated the church and spoiled the grounds.

"By . Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 12:00 EST, 8 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:15 EST, 9 November 2012 . Fears are growing that giant Asian hornets are headed for Britain by 2014 as the killer insects sting a man to death in France. A 54-year-old married father-of-three died in the village of Coron on Monday after disrupting a hornet’s nest while pruning a hedge. The species, Vespa velutina, is four times the size of our native honeybees and has decimated the bee population in France. Deadly pest: This Asian hornet species has decimated the bee population in France, even killing a 54-year-old man after he disrupted a hornets nest, and it is predicted to reach Britain by 2014 . The dark invaders with yellow feet are thought to have arrive in south west France in a delivery of Chinese pottery from the Far East in late 2004. The insects have colonised huge swathes of France, spreading along waterways, and with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in a couple of hours, honey production has plummeted. It has colonised 39 of France’s 100 administrative departments. Just last month a nest was discovered just 10 miles from the Paris city centre in Jouy-en-Josas, south of Versailles. Recently, Franck Muller from Paris’ Museum of National History predicted that by 2014, the hornets would be in Britain. Impede the plight: Paris town hall has launched a strategy to stop the hornets, with beekeepers at the Jardin du Luxembourg (pictured) ready with traps . He was quoted by The Telegraph saying: ‘We have modelled its potential spread by cross-checking data from France and Asia, and concluded it is capable of living anywhere in Europe and certainly in Britain.’ The hornets pick on honeybees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted that the hornets can move in and ransack it. Groups of Asian hornets hover in front . of a beehive, picking off single honeybees, decapitating them and . stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the 'meat . ball' to feed their young. The Asian hornet is nearly 2in long with a 3in wingspan - slightly smaller than the European hornet but much more aggressive . One Asian hornet can kill 40 bees in a minute; a handful can destroy a hive of 30,000 beeds in a couple of hours . They build rugby ball-shaped nests in trees, housing some 500 hornets . They scare off intruders by sending a lone worker hornet to 'warn' them. If that fails, the workers attack en masse . Worker hornets have lifespans of 30-55 days . It is a further problem for the British honeybee, which is struggling to cope with changes in farming and climate and already has one Far Eastern invader to contend with - the varroa mite, which feeds on the bees and makes their hives more vulnerable to disease. To impede their plight, Paris town hall has launched a strategy to trap the hornets. Ready with traps, beekeepers at the Jardin du Luxembourg and positioned on the roofs of the Opera Garnier and other Parisian landmarks are prepared as well as possible human sentries to warn of attacks. The deputy mayor of Paris, Fabienne Giboudeaux warned against panic. She told Le Parisien: ‘While the hornet is dangerous, one sting is not deadly for a human. But we need to be prepared and be able to locate the nests and think about prevention.’ In Asia, honeybees have learned to encircle an intruder and, by flapping their wings, cause it to overheat and die. But the French bees have not had enough time to evolve an effective tactic. The hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans and has been compared to a hot nail being hammered into the body, but like bee stings, it is likely to kill only if the victim has a severe allergic reaction.","A man, 54, died after disrupting a hornet's nest while pruning a hedge .

A policewoman was 'bullied and victimised' by male bosses who cancelled the leave she had booked for her wedding after labelling her a 'trouble-maker', a tribunal was told. Shocked Police Constable Rachel Garrett, 47, only found out that her line manager had ordered the cancellation when her now husband, a police sergeant, checked her leave dates on the Thames Valley Police system while she was signed off work sick. PC Garrett is suing the force for sexual and disability discrimination after she accused her bosses of turning against her because of previous complaints she filed against senior colleagues. 'Victimised': PC Rachel Garrett claims her bosses at Thames Valley Police cancelled leave she had booked for her upcoming wedding without informing her . The newlywed - who suffers from asthma and carpal tunnel syndrome along with a depressive condition - also claims she was taken off some of her Olympic duties, ordered to perform a role she was not trained to do, and was 'over-scrutinised' by Inspector Roy Atwell and Superintendent Gez Chiarello. In 2007 PC Garrett was awarded £2,000 as compensation for injury to feelings, after she took the force to an employment tribunal on similar discrimination accusations relating to the provision of body armour to female officers, and the allocation of on-call duties. A year later the officer, who has worked for Thames Valley Police since 1985, was elected as a Police Federation representative and tasked with helping other officers - particularly in disputes with their bosses. But in 2011 she was told that her ability to represent her colleagues had been affected by her own employment tribunal claim, leading her to lodge a second complaint in which she named Supt. Chiarello. Newlyweds: The officer's now husband Sergeant Nick Garrett noticed her pre-booked leave had been cancelled while she was off sick . 'He commented to me that because of my previous employment tribunal claim he didn’t know if I was ""whiter than white"",' she said in a statement given to the Reading Tribunal Centre in Berkshire, as part of her third and most recent hearing. That claim went to a judicial mediation process and she was again awarded compensation for injury to feelings, this time for £1,500 pounds. PC Garrett has claimed that since her second complaint she was 'bullied' by Supt. Chiarello, who then turned her line manager Insp. Atwell against her. Her role with the Federation was downgraded to a three day a week post and she was told to also work as an Enquiry Officer, working on road traffic collisions while other representatives were retained full-time. PC Garrett said that she had come up with a list of different posts she could take on as she wanted a 'fresh start', but was returned to work with the criminal justice department. She had been an Enquiry Officer before working with the Federation, but claimed she felt undertrained to take on the role due to changes in the way the job was done - including carrying out interviews on DVDs instead of tapes. The 47-year-old was moved from the police headquarters in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, to Witney Police Station, closer to her home in Ducklington. But PC Garrett said she found her new office dirty and unkempt, and her colleagues unwelcoming. 'I felt under pressure to start the Enquiry Officer role without any training and before arrangements had been put in place to allow me to perform the role from Witney Police Station, as agreed,' she said in her statement. PC Garrett said that Insp. Atwell had wanted her to start her new role without being trained, or even being able to access the computer systems, while she was still trying to balance her work as a representative 'looking after damaged and needy officers' - which she still considered a full-time post. She said that he then ordered that a duties manager gain access to her Outlook Calendar and she felt he had become 'distrustful and wary' of her, as well as being 'over scrutinising'.The officer also discovered that Insp. Atwell was copying their email correspondence to Supt. Chiarello, leading her to feel 'micro-managed by Insp. Atwell and bullied by Supt. Chiarello'.'I believe that Insp. Atwell had been directed in his actions by Supt. Chiarello and that Supt. Chiarello was victimising me as a direct result of my previous employment tribunal complaint against the force, and him,' she said. 'I believe from the treatment I have received and the conversations I have had with Insp. Atwell that he and Supt. Chiarello had formed the view that I was a ""trouble maker"" and needed to be more closely managed than other officers. 'I believe that Supt. Chiarello had wrongly formed the view that I was deliberately not starting the Enquiry Officer role, which had been agreed at the judicial mediation and that he directed Insp. Atwell to supervise me closely as a result.'Pc Garrett, who also suffers from asthma and carpel tunnel syndrome as well as having a 'depressive condition', was signed off with work-related stress in November 2011. While she was off work, she claimed that Insp. Atwell had ordered her previously approved leave - including time off for her wedding in March of this year, and subsequent honeymoon, to be cancelled. Her partner Nick Garrett was able to re-apply for her leave, which was granted with just weeks to spare until their big day. She refuted an argument from the force that her leave was cancelled because she had not applied for it properly, through Insp. Atwell. PC Garrett has since returned to work, but an occupational health therapist has recommended that she remain on non-confrontational duties until after the tribunal, meaning that she has not yet returned to her Enquiry Officer post. The tribunal, in front of a panel chaired by judge Richard Barrowclough, continues.

Mario Swain, 33, was convicted of murdering Lola Nixon, 44, during a break-in at her Texas home in 2002 . A man described as a 'serial killer-in-training' is set to die tonight in Texas after he bludgeoned a woman to death during a burglary at her home almost a decade ago. Mario Swain, 33, was convicted of murdering Lola Nixon, 44, during a break-in at her home in 2002. When Nixon returned home in Longview, Texas, he bludgeoned her with a tire tool, stabbed her and likely strangled her, according to an account by the attorney general's office. Swain put Nixon in the trunk of her car, drove her to a field and left her barely conscious. He later led investigators to an abandoned car with Nixon's body inside. Investigators connected Swain to a truck parked on Nixon's street the night she went missing. Swain first accused two other men of the crime, but both had alibis. Swain's execution by lethal injection is scheduled to take place after 7pm (EST) at the state prison in Huntsville. Thirty-six inmates have been executed this year in the United States, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The U.S. Supreme Court declined on October 15 to review Swain's case. Swain's attorney, James Volberding, said no late attempts were made in the courts to block the execution, which will be the 13th this year in the nation's busiest capital punishment state. Swain declined media interview requests as his execution date neared. Ms Nixon was supposed to go to . dinner with friends that Friday night after Christmas but didn't show . up. When she couldn't be reached the next day, friends called police who . found the back door of her home jimmied and blood throughout the place. A neighbor who saw an unfamiliar . truck parked on the street the previous night reported that to police . and the truck was tracked to Swain. Dead man walking: Huntsville Prison in Texas is where Swain is scheduled to died tonight at 7pm . He initially blamed friends for the burglary, then led police to Nixon's body. Authorities determined she'd been beaten with a tire iron, stabbed and strangled. The tire iron was recovered from a trash container where Swain said he had thrown it. Evidence showed he used Nixon's credit cards and gave a piece of her stolen jewelry to a friend. Nixon's blood was found on Swain's clothing in the truck, along with her car keys and garage door opener. According to evidence and testimony at trial, Swain would gather information about women he wanted to rob and then attack them, forcing them to inhale the anesthetic halothane and hitting them over the head with a wrench or shooting them with a stun gun. Lance Larison, a prosecutor at Swain's trial, called Swain 'a serial killer in training'. 'A girlfriend told us he kept a list in notebooks of names and license plates of girls he would follow,' Larison said. 'I think he was working up to something.' It's not clear if Swain knew Nixon. She managed a Longview telephone call center where Swain once worked. One of Swain's trial lawyers, Rick Hagan, said the evidence and vivid testimony from those who said Swain robbed them hindered the defense's efforts to convince jurors to spare Swain of the death penalty. Larson said blood evidence in the case was 'consistent with a struggle' inside Nixon's home, where she lived alone. Deborah Hancock, a friend of Ms Nixon, said: 'I can't believe it's been 10 years. She was very outgoing and very direct, fun, lively. She was just one of a kind.' Swain's execution is to be followed by two more next week in Texas.","Mario Swain, 33, set to die in Texas tonight at 7pm .

He was delighted and honoured when the Russian Embassy wrote to him to tell him they intended to honour him and other veterans with the Medal of Ushakov, as a symbol of the country’s gratitude. But the Foreign Office has blocked the Russian government’s plans because it said it would break rules surrounding the acceptance of medals . 'After all these years I was honoured when the Embassy contacted me to say I was going to receive the medal as a token of thanks for what I and others did for their country in the Second World War,” said Mr Wilson, from Chesterfield. 'The British Arctic convoy was often described as the worst journey in the world and that about summed it up. 'The conditions were terrible , it was unbelievably cold, like working in a freezer and the sea was ferocious. Once you started on a convoy you didn’t have a wash for six weeks because you couldn’t get your clothes off, it was too cold. 'The journey was fraught with danger. It’s a part of the war that isn’t mentioned and seem to have largely been forgotten. I don’t think people realise what an important job we did and the difference it made to the war. 'We kept Russia supplied with food and arms and there is no doubt in my mind that without the convoys the outcome of the war would have been very different. 'The Russians would have been crushed and the Germans would have taken this country too and we would be all be speaking their language. Frank Wilson was a seaman on the HMS Activity and endured torpedo infested waters and sub zero temperatures to assist Russian soldiers . Those who took part in the British Arctic convoy ran a gauntlet of U-boats and vicious weather conditions to bolster efforts on the Eastern Front . 'Thousands died, I saw comrades killed. I was shot through the cheek and the bullet shattered all my back teeth. I had to stay on the ship for a fortnight until I got any proper treatment but I was one of the lucky ones.” Added Mr Wilson: 'I feel proud that the medal is being awarded but I feel let down that I cannot receive it. I think its ridiculous and typical of this Government. 'The Foreign Office need to have a serious re think about it. This is a medal for valour but that doesn’t seem to matter much these days.' Russia has already awarded the Ushakov Medal to veterans from Australia, Canada and America.A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'Wer appreciate the Russian Government’s wish to recognise the brave and valuable service given by veterans of the Arctic Convoys. 'But permission to accept a foreign award cannot be given unless there has been specific service to the country concerned within the previous five years.” The spokesman added that the Arctic Convoy veterans were eligible for the World War II Atlantic Star but the veterans argue that men who served in the Arctic Convoys had already earned the Atlantic Star before being conscripted on to the dreaded ‘Russian Run’. A Russian Embassy spokesman said the situation was 'regrettable. but added they would continue to make the case for the award to the British authorities.","Frank Wilson, 88, was gunner on HMS Activity, part of the British Arctic convoy .

A German-language folk band have been asked to return 13 awards after it emerged that they have been 'faking' the music on their albums. The seven-man Kastelruther Spatzen used studio musicians to create their famous Alpine brass-band sound, their former producer claims. The revelations have made the headlines in Germany echoing the scandal surrounding early 90s lip-syncing pop-sensation Milli Vanilli. 'Fake': Folk music favourites Kastelruther Spatzen are being accused of 'faking music' after it emerged they use studio musicians . Kastelruther Spatzen, from the German-speaking . province of South Tyrol in northern Italy, were defended by their . manager who said using studio musicians were 'common practice'. 'The success of this band is based on a . giant fraud,' former producer Walter Widemair told Bild newspaper. He said that only the lead singer's voice was genuine on the albums and called for the group to return their prices. 'The band of fakes must give back their Echo awards,' he said. Kastelruther Spatzen's manager Helmut Brossmann said that  it was common practice for folk music bands to use studio musicians for their albums. In his defence of the popular folk-music band, he said Kastelruther Spatzen had even listed the studio musicians on their albums. Retro fake: Late 80s German pop duo Milli Vanilli were discovered to have been lip-syncing to others vocals and were forced to return their 1990 Grammy Award . Real thing: Their former producer said lead singer Norbert Rier, seen here accepting a Folk Music award in Germany earlier this year, was the only 'genuine' voice on the albums . In a statement on the band's website Mr . Brossmann said Widemair had been responsible for the studio recordings . for nearly 30 years and was now betraying the band for commercial . reasons - to help promote his own book. 'The names of the studio musician and everyone who contributed to the chorus of songs was mentioned in every CD that they were involved in,' said Brossmann. 'In nearly 30 years of concert tours, they always played and sang everything live.' Praised: Kastelruther Spatzen after winning Best Folk Music at the Echo Awards in 2007, an award which may now be taken from them . The dispute has received much media attention in Germany, with newspapers recalling the scandal of their fellow countrymen in pop duo Milli Vanilli. German producer Frank Farian turned two young Munich models, Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, into the group known as Milli Vanilli. The group had great international success in the late 80s and early 90s with songs such as 'Girl You Know It's True' and 'Blame It On The Rain', but were disgraced when it emerged that they had been miming to other people's vocals. They were stripped of their 1990 Grammy Award and their management faced over 20 lawsuits.","Folk music band Kastelruther Spatzen are accused of being frauds .

The flamboyant multimillionaire who said he would be forced to lay off some or all of his 8,000 employees if Barack Obama was reelected hasn't followed through with his threat. Instead, David Siegel says he gave all of his workers a raise this week, to help them cope with new taxes and regulations that he believes the president will heap on in his second term. Mr Siegel, a Florida real estate and timeshare magnate, is perhaps known for his ambitious attempts to build the largest house in the world outside Orland, Florida. Modeled after the Palace of Versailles in France, he hopes it will be worth $100million when it's completed. Threat: David Siegel has threatened to downsize Westgate Resorts if President Obama is re-elected . Lavish: Mr Siegel's wife Jackie outside their multi-million-dollar home modelled on the Palace of Versailles . The founder of Westgate Resorts wasn't the only business owner reeling from the loss of Republican Mitt Romney on Tuesday night. A man claiming to own a business that employs 114 people in Nevada called into a CBS radio show and said he laid off 22 of his workers on Wednesday -- a preemptive move because he fears an economic downturn and more regulation. In Bedford, Virginia, Lyons Jewelers posted a massive sign in the store window saying: 'Closed to mourn the loss of the America that our forefathers endowed to us.' WDBJ-TV reports that the store also had a sign that said 'Shame on the U.S. and Virginia' and one that read 'Lyons will reopen tomorrow to continue the fight against a president who seeks my demise.' The president won the battleground state by about 112,000 votes. Mr Siegel emailed all his employees last month claiming that Mr Obama would introduce new taxes, which would force him to downsize -- or even retire. Romance: The Siegels were featured in a documentary entitled Queen of Versailles earlier this year . Political: Mr Siegel took credit for the success of George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential election . The day after President Barack Obama won the election, a man who claimed to own a business in Las Vegas called into a local radio station to announce he had fired 20 per cent of his staff. The man, who called a talk radio program on KXNT, gave his name only as 'Dave' and said 'elections have consequences.' He claimed that Tuesday night's victory for the Democratic president was the tipping point for him to decide that he needed to cut back his business to save money. He said that he had 114 employees and that he sacked 22 of them. “I explained to them a month ago that if Obama gets in office that the regulations for Obamacare are gonna hurt our business, and I’m gonna have to make provisions to make sure I have enough money to cover the payroll taxes, the additional health care I’m gonna have to do, and I explained that to them and I said you do what you feel like in your heart you need to do, but I’m just letting you know as a warning this is things I have to think of as a business owner,' he said. Obama handily beat Republican Mitt Romney in the election and also won the state of Nevada. 'I can’t wait around anymore, I have to be proactive. I had to lay off 22 people today to make sure that my business is gonna thrive and I’m gonna be around for years to come,' he said. 'I have to build up that nest egg now for the taxes and regulations that are coming my way. Elections do have consequences, but so do choices.' The property magnate's 1,400-word rant was largely copied from a chain email which circulated around the time of the 2008 presidential election. Mr Siegel told Bloomberg BusinessWeek on Wednesday, the day after the election, that he hadn't laid off anyone -- yet. 'I’m going to work my hardest to keep the company going and expand the best I can. We’ll see what happens,' he said. He added that he had given all employees in his company a raise, at least five percent, to 'help them handle the additional burdens the government will put on them.' Last month, Mr Siegel told his workers that the company was performing well, saying: 'The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job. 'What . does threaten your job however, is another 4 years of the same . Presidential administration. Of course, as your employer, I can't tell . you whom to vote for, and I certainly wouldn't interfere with your right . to vote for whomever you choose. In fact, I encourage you to vote for . whomever you think will serve your interests the best.' He added: 'So where am I going with all this? It's quite simple. If any new taxes are levied on me, or my . company, as our current President plans, I will have no choice but to . reduce the size of this company. 'Rather . than grow this company I will be forced to cut back. This means fewer . jobs, less benefits and certainly less opportunity for everyone. 'So, . when you make your decision to vote, ask yourself, which candidate . understands the economics of business ownership and who doesn't? Whose . policies will endanger your job? 'Answer those questions and you should know who might be the one capable of protecting and saving your job.' The 77-year-old starred alongside his wife Jackie, 46, in a documentary film titled 'Queen of Versailles,' chronicling the construction of the 30-bedroom house and the struggles of Mr Siegel's company during the financial crisis and recession. The flamboyant businessman has previously boasted of using his employees for political ends. He apparently surveyed his 8,000 workers before the 2000 election, and encouraged only those who supported Mr Bush to vote - an act which he believes brought the Republican victory in Florida, and therefore in the race as a whole. Clan: The family on a private jet with their children and some of Mr Siegel's partners in the real-estate business . Grand: The unfinished ballroom at the couple's Florida home, which they hope will be worth $100million . Mr Siegel's latest intervention in . the political process came in the form of an email sent to every . Westgate employee on Monday afternoon, which was later leaked to Gawker. He claimed that Mr Obama had . initiated class warfare pitting the 'one per cent' against the rest, and . argued that in fact the interests of the wealthy were vital to the . middle class too. Mr . Siegel continued: 'Sure, you may have heard about the big home that I'm . building. I'm sure many people think that I live a privileged life. However, what you don't see or hear is the true story behind any success . that I have achieved.' After an account of how he made his millions, he added: 'When you leave the office, you are done and you have a weekend all to yourself. I unfortunately do not have that freedom. I eat, live, and breathe this company every minute of the day, every day of the week. There is no rest. There is no weekend. There is no happy hour.' He then launched into several paragraphs arguing that high business taxes were strangling the economy, and arguing that tax cuts for the rich helped stimulate the rest of the economy. Huge: The home is modelled on the ancestral palace of the French kings outside Paris . Mr Siegel concluded that if taxes are increased, 'you can find me in the Caribbean sitting on the beach, under a palm tree, retired, and with no employees to worry about.' Many online commenters were initially sceptical about the authenticity of the letter, pointing out its similarities to an anonymous 2008 chain email expressing the same sentiments. However, Mr Siegel told Gawker that he had indeed sent the message, saying that he 'used the letter that had circulated before as a guideline'. He added: 'It gives [employees] something to think about when they go to the polls.'","David Siegel had told all 8,000 of his employees he would have to cut back his company if president stayed in the White House .

Firestarter: Casey Fury pleaded guilty to starting a fire on a nuclear sub that caused $450 of damage . A former shipyard worker has pleaded guilty to starting a fire that caused $450 million in damage to a nuclear-powered submarine so that he could get out of work after troubles with an ex-girlfriend. Casey James Fury, from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of arson on Thursday under a plea agreement that could send him to federal prison for nearly 20 years. The 24-year-old painter and sand blaster pleaded guilty to starting the fire, which carries a maximum of life in federal prison - but the defense and prosecution agreed to recommend a sentence of between 15 and 19 years. Fury told Navy investigators that he started the fire on the USS Miami - and another outside the submarine - on May 23 as he was suffering from anxiety and having problems with his ex-girlfriend. Flames ripped through the submarine which was dry docked at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and it took more than 100 firefighters 12 hours to bring the fire under control. The fire had spread to spaces within the submarine that were difficult to reach, making it challenging for firefighters to combat to blaze, but the nuclear reactor remained in tact throughout. Five people were hurt while putting out the fire and the Navy faces years of repairs on the near-destroyed submarine. After an initial investigation, the . Portsmouth Naval Shipyard said the fire started in a vacuum cleaner used . by shipyard workers. It had been stored in an 'unoccupied space', they . said. Danger: Smoke can be seen rising from the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine on May 23 . Inferno: The yard still smoulders the next day after it took 100 firefighters 12 hours to control the flames . At first authorities thought they would have to scrap the submarine, but the military concluded the USS Miami can carry . enough of a workload in the future to make it worth carrying out the repairs. Navy Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of . Naval operations, estimated they will cost about $450 million. It is expected to return to service in 2015. Damage from the fire was limited to the forward compartment spaces, which include crew living and command and control spaces, Rear Admiral Rick Breckenridge said in a statement at the time. There was no damage to the submarine's nuclear . reactor, located at the rear of the vessel. It had been shut down for . more than two months while work was carried out on the submarine. Selfish: Fury told investigators he wanted to finish work early as he was having problems with an ex-girlfriend . Damage: Officials thought they would have to scrap the USS Miami (file picture) as they estimated repairs would cost $450 million. But they concluded they will eventually get enough use from it to justify the cost . The submarine, which is based in Croton, Connecticut, arrived at the shipyard in March. It typically carries a crew of 13 officers and 120 enlisted personnel. According to the Navy's Vessel Register, USS Miami, an attack submarine, was commissioned in 1990, is 362 feet long, and is nuclear powered. Fury also pleaded guilty to setting a second fire in the dry dock area below the submarine, which was quickly extinguished and caused no injuries. David Beneman, Fury's attorney, said he anticipated that sentencing would occur in March.","Casey James Fury started fire aboard USS Miami in Kittery, Maine in May .

A confused old man was found wandering in the cold ten miles from home after his council carer forgot all about him. Ernest Hignett, 73, was discovered shivering with his clothes soaking wet near a rural farm after he went missing from his flat in an inner city district of Manchester. The pensioner who suffers from dementia and diabetes and lived alone in sheltered accommodation should have been checked on a daily basis to be given his medication and usually wore an electronic tracking device if went for a walkabout. Council carer Trevor Williams forgot about dementia sufferer Ernest Hignett who then wandered off and was found wandering in the cold ten miles from home. Williams admitted a neglect charge and was given a suspended jail term . But council carer Trevor Williams, 57, failed to turn up to look after the old man who then wandered off into the night having earlier said he wanted to visit a local day care centre. Williams eventually arrived at Mr Hignett’s home the following morning over 12 hours late only to find the old man was gone. Instead of alerting police he tried to cover up his mistake by leaving a note at his sheltered flat saying: 'given him his meds.' He then went on to lie further, writing he had even taken Mr Hignett for a drive and made him tea. Police were called in and staged a manhunt for Mr Hignett after another carer who arrived at Mr Hignett’s home and reported him as missing. The hunt was called off a few hours later when staff from Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne called to say he had been admitted after being found by members of the public at Kershaw Hey Farm in Mossley. It emerged the old man had been found cold and wet and laying down on the ground and was rushed to hospital in a confused state. Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, where Mr Hignett was admitted after being found by members of the public at Kershaw Hey Farm in Mossley . He so bewildered he was unable to say how he got there or where he lived. It is not known how he got to the farm. He has since moved into a care home. Details of the blunder emerged as Williams, from Swinton, near Salford, admitted a charge of ill treatment by neglect and was sentenced to a six month suspended sentence, a 12 month community order and 18 hours unpaid work. He has lost his job since the incident. Manchester Crown Court was told Williams who worked for Manchester social services had started looking after Mr Hignett in August last year. The old man who lived in Moss Side relied on the care of Williams to help him get up and dressed, make meals as well as give him his medication, due to his severe confusion and tendency to wander off. Manchester Crown Court heard that Williams - who Mr Hignett had classed as a friend was paid by social services for his 18.5 hours per week working in his home and taking the elderly man out. Williams, from Swinton, near Salford, admitted a charge of ill treatment by neglect and was sentenced to a six month suspended sentence, a 12 month community order and 18 hours unpaid work . Prosecuting Miss Lindsay Thomas said: 'Mr Hignett had a history of wandering about in a confused state and so he was provided with a tracker. 'Trevor Williams looked after him for 18.5 hours per week and saw him three hours in the evenings of Tuesdays, Thursday and Friday and was with him 30 minutes on a Saturday evening and from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. on Sunday.' The incident occurred when Williams was due to visit Mr Hignett over the weekend of April 7th and 8th this year. Miss Thomas said: 'On Saturday, another carer had been with Mr Hignett. 'At about 5pm. before she left Mr Hignett, he said he wanted to go to the Cornerstone Day Centre in Mosside but was told that it would be closed. She left and informed that she was going to be on holiday and arranged for another person to attend.' On Monday the carer arrived but Mr Hignett was not there, his bed was made and his curtains were not drawn. His tracker was in the kitchen on charge and she also noticed that his medication was missing for both 7th and 8th April. Miss Thomas said: 'The form had been completed by the defendant and read ‘given him his meds’ and another ,’Ernie was out, he was back later, I was up and down Cornerstone looking for him, we went for a drive, got back made something to eat then gave him meds’.'. The police were alerted on Monday that Mr Hignett was missing and could not be found and was declared a missing person. But later a social worker rang police to say the old man was in hospital having been admitted the previous day after being found by members of the public near a farm. Miss Thomas added: 'He was pale and cold, his clothes were wet and he was lying on the ground for an amount of time. He appeared confused and did not know how he got there and did not know where he lived.' Williams was arrested and confessed to police that on the Saturday evening he did not go because he had 'forgotten.' Mr Hignett, 73, was discovered near a rural farm after he went missing from his flat in an inner city district of Manchester . He said that the following day he attended the home at 9 am. but Mr Hignett was not there and rang his friends who also had not seen him. Williams took the pensioner’s tablets and went out looking for Mr Hignett but could not find him, adding that he failed to call the police because he was 'scared to tell the truth'. In mitigation, defence Mr Martin Callery said: 'This was an isolated incident. Fortunately no significant injury came to him although he was found by himself and some considerable distance from his house. 'Clearly he was in a poor condition. He was living alone but has not suffered any on-going harm or physical harm. It is neglect but over a very short time over the course of the weekend when he should have visited Mr Hignett.' The court heard Williams was suspended and later lost his job. Passing sentence the judge Mr Justice David Mackay: 'It is a very sad thing to see you here at your age, a man of good character who had won good opinion from people you worked with. 'I do not know what went wrong with you that day but you did neglect that elderly gentleman and put him at significant risk. 'He was found a long way away, cold and confused. This was a serious breach of obligation and worthy of a prison sentence but because of you good character and for the reasons argued by your counsel I feel able to suspend the sentence.'","Ernest Hignett, 73, was found shivering and soaking wet near a rural farm .

The Orlando, Florida, woman was acquitted in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, but her legal troubles are not yet over. She has been sued for defamation by a woman with the same name of a babysitter that Anthony told police kidnapped Caylee shortly after the toddler’s disappearance. Zenaida Gonzalez says her life was ruined when police began questioning her, as she lost her house, her housekeeping job and received numerous death threats. The Orlando Sentinel reported that Gonzalez’s lawyers originally submitted a witness list of about 90 people who would be called to testify at the trial, which begins in January. Anthony’s lawyers later argued that so many people was far too many, so Gonzalez’s lawyers cut the list to about 24. The witnesses making the final cut include Anthony’s parents, George and Cindy, her brother Lee, police officers that led the investigation into Caylee’s disappearance and local reporters like Michelle Meredith of WESH and Kathi Belich of WFTV, according to the Sentinel. Her parents, George and Cindy, have reportedly not seen Casey since she was found not guilty in the murder of Caylee, whose remains were found in December 2008.

At the very least, America is dead. Or that's what you'd assume scrolling through this Tumblr blog dedicated to chronicling the misery of Mitt Romney supporters in the aftermath of the election. It may be schadenfreude but there is plenty to enjoy on the undiplomatically named blog - White People Mourning Romney - which gathers together Facebook posts, tweets, pictures and news clippings. White people mourning Romney: The lady on the left looks disgruntled with proceedings while this girl's (right) hopes and dreams were crushed as Mitt didn't make it . Closed (for one day): This shop was shut by its owner in order to mourn the loss of America as it should be - but don't worry, it will be open again tomorrow . Half mast: To mark a dark day for Republicans this family lowered their flag . No stars in her eyes: This Romney fan appears distraught and dazed, gazing into the middle distance . Many on the web certainly think so and it has since gone viral, being shared at volume via emails and on Twitter. The blog title itself has stoked up controversy for various reasons. One being that millions of Caucasians supported Obama and wanted nothing to do with Romney. 'I'm white and I voted for Obama. How am I supposed to feel about threads like this?' one girl complained on an online message board discussing the blog. And no doubt the Republicans also had some backing from Americans from ethnic backgrounds too. Superhero salute: Even Captain America can't raise a smile from this lady upset about the result . Misery guts: This woman looks decidedly sulky while another girl (right) weeps into an American flag . Better luck next time: These right-wingers were hoping to see Romney replace Obama at the helm of America . Cry baby: A picture posted on Facebook of a grandmother holding her grandson along with her promise to continue to fight for him because his liberty and freedom is in jeopardy . But it's difficult to get away from the fact that a large percentage of Romney's supporters are indeed Caucasian. The Washington Post report that President Obama captured 93 per cent of the African-American vote and 71 per cent of the Latino vote in this election. See you in 2016: A sad photo of a Romney supporter carrying off a cardboard cut-out . When republican Artur Davis spoke at the Republican National Convention in the summer 98 per cent of the delegates were white.

'The Democrat Party voted God out and replaced Him with Romans 1. In the good vs. Evil battle... today... Evil won.' Earlier she wrote in three successive tweets: 'I can't stop crying.' 'America died.' 'I can't stop crying. America died.' Later she was back at it, asking: 'Why can't we have 2 countries? America Red and America Blue - only Blue people aren't allowed to ask us for money when free phones run out.' Jackson eventually said she was going to take a break, but not before getting one final dig at the president in: 'The power of the tweet is going to my head, i better take a break... or I might get as arrogant as Dictator Obama.' Now even Romney fans have to crack a smile at that. Then again, maybe not. Wackier than Michael? Charlotte Jackson took to Twitter to showcase a flood of emotion, all of it negative .

The Society of Black Lawyers hit out at Tottenham and the Football Association after repeating its threat to go to the police over what it regards as anti-Semitic chanting at White Hart Lane. Spurs fans sent an open message of defiance to the SBL on Thursday night when they chanted 'We'll sing what we want' and 'Yid Army' throughout the club's 3-1 home win over Maribor in the Europa League. Despite being a club with a traditionally large Jewish following, Tottenham fans often refer to themselves as 'Yids' or the 'Yid Army' in chants during the club's matches. 'We'll sing what we want': Spurs fans were in defiant mood on Thursday . Although Spurs claim otherwise, the . SBL say the phrase is anti-Semitic and they have vowed to complain to . the police under the Public Order Act if supporters continue to use the . chant beyond the November 20 deadline it has set. The SBL had monitors at the north . London ground on Thursday night who heard the chants and this morning it . reiterated its commitment to report any such action to the police . should fans continue their actions. 'We are not going to let go on this,' SBL chair Peter Herbert said. 'After November 20 there is a potential that people will get a criminal conviction. If they want to run that risk then fine. 'We are serious. We aren't in this . for sensationalism. We think the vast majority of Tottenham fans are . sensible and do not engage in anti-Semitism. 'It's a very small minority who obviously don't care about any offence. 'Their love of football is greater than their desire to deal with anti-Semitism.' Tottenham refused to comment on the . matter. The London club stick by the statement they released on . Wednesday which read: 'Our guiding principle in respect of the ""Y-word"" is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing factor is the . intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the deliberate . intention to cause offence. This has been the basis of prosecutions of . fans of other teams to date. Flying the flag: Herbert has launched another attack on Tottenham supporters . 'Our fans adopted the chant as a . defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect . anti-Semitic abuse. They do not use the term to others to cause any . offence, they use it as a chant amongst themselves.' Herbert believes the club have been . misguided over the issue and claims fans can be prosecuted regardless of . whether the songs are intended to cause offence. 'Under Section Five of the Public . Order Act it doesn't matter what the intent is of the individual or the . crowd, if the words cause harassment, alarm, or distress to anyone . watching then that is sufficient,' Herbert said. Three and easy: Defoe scored a hat-trick in Tottenham's win on Thursday . 'If a crowd of men were walking down . Tottenham High Road singing the Y-word causing offence they would be . arrested. It doesn't make sense that they can make White Hart Lane a . no-go area for law.' Herbert ridiculed Tottenham's . statement and claimed the SBL has widespread support for its campaign . from within the Jewish community. 'We have no doubt there will be complaints (to the police),' Herbert added. 'If the Met Police say they are going to look at prosecutions then there is a good chance it will stop. 'Tottenham's statement is . indefensible. I think if you went to the United States, Canada or South . Africa and you made a statement like that you would face ridicule and . condemnation. 'It is a very sad day for English football when clubs feel they have to defend a term of abuse.' Herbert also accused the FA of a lack of interest in the Tottenham matter. 'This is an appalling abdication of . responsibility by the FA,' he said. 'It's a complete disgrace that they . have stayed silent on this. 'There is an inertia from the FA over racism and anti-Semitism.

The Australian government has abandoned its five-year pledge to introduce a compulsory filter blocking child pornography and other objectionable internet content. Instead, internet service providers have agreed to block 1,400 child abuse websites on Interpol's 'worst of' list, said Communications Minister Stephen Conroy. Three of Australia's largest telecommunications companies - Telstra, Optus and Primus - have been blocking the listed sites anyway since 2010. Compromise: The Australian government downgraded strict internet restriction proposals to just concentrate on banning child abuse sites . 'We've actually reached agreement with the industry to block child pornography and we think that is a significant step forward,' Conroy told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio. Critics had argued the proposed compulsory filter would have put Australia in the same censorship league as China and the US State Department had been among those who expressed concerns at the proposed draconian regulations. The revised plan has a narrower focus on child abuse, as opposed to the original list which also wanted banned sites that carried extreme violence or detailed instructions on crime, drug use or acts of terrorism. Opponents also argued that the filter would slow internet speeds, erroneously block harmless sites and restrict free speech. Anti-censorship campaigner Geordie Guy welcomed the government's reversal but claimed it wouldn't have much impact. Banned: The new proposals will compel internet service providers to ban child porn websites listed by Interpol . 'While this is a much better result than any of the previous proposals that the government came up with, it's still really unlikely to do much good,' he told ABC. The Internet Industry Association of Australia chief executive Peter Lee said he was 'pleased that the government has now moved on' from the filter and has narrowed the focus to just child abuse sites. However, the Australian Electoral Lobby said the agreement with ISPs fell short of the pledges made during the 2007 election campaign. 'The government's decision not to legislate to the full extent of the commitment is a great disappointment,' the Lobby's managing director Jim Wallace said. In reality, the government never had a hope of getting the full filter legislation through parliament because The Green party, a key government ally, joined the opposition in condemning the plans as a serious restriction of free speech.","Compromise reached to block 1,400 child abuse website instead as set out on Interpol banned list .

Accused rogue trader Kweku Adoboli sobbed in court today as he insisted he did not act fraudulently while working at UBS . Accused rogue trader Kweku Adoboli sobbed in court today as he insisted he did not act fraudulently while working at UBS. Adoboli, 32, is accused of gambling away £1.5billion of the Swiss bank's money and wiping £3bn off its share price while working at its London headquarters. Prosecutors claim the trader ignored financial controls, including trading limits, and invented phantom transactions to disguise his 'naked gambling' from bosses in order to boost his ego and career prospects. It is alleged he was 'intimately aware' of how UBS's trading controls worked after moving from the back office to trading floor and was able to play the system a result. But Adoboli hit back at allegations he took advantage of his knowledge of the bank's inner workings today, saying he just wanted to 'do my job to the best of my ability'. He said: 'It was the ability to understand the interaction of systems and accounting processes that allows you to do your job. 'It is not fraudulent; it is finding a way to do your job.' He told the court he did not believe his 'rare skillset' had made it 'easier' for him to exploit the bank. 'The reality is systems and processes evolve, number one. 'Number two, the reality is every single trader, and salesperson, trade support advisor, and settlement person has a duty to understand the system, the tools that we use. 'So I do not think it is fair to say that my experience in settlement and trade support enabled me to more easily do something that has been characterised as fraud. 'Those experiences enabled me to do my job to the best of my ability.' In an at times emotional start to his evidence Adoboli wept twice when asked about his father, who sat in the public gallery, and his 'mentor' at UBS Mike Foster, the former head of the ETF desk. Mr Justice Keith told him he should not be embarrassed as it gave the jury a chance to 'see the man behind the name'. Adiboli described UBS as his family, adding: 'Every single bit of effort I put in to that organisation was for the benefit of the bank, the people around me, and the book I worked on. The bank for which was so proud to work. He told the court he had begun to trade off the book in a bid to generate enough profit to offset annual $40m losses being made by the ETF desk. He said that for three years from 2008 to 2010 the desk had lost £24m, and that in the first six months of 2011, before his arrest, it had lost £12m. The trader said the losses had come about from balance sheet costs, client execution costs, dividend slippage, and being unable to hedge certain equities. Adoboli said his life had become overcome by his efforts to make the ETF desk profitable. He told the jury he had missed his grandmother's funeral because of the work he was putting in to his job. 'Every moment of every day spent thinking about ""How do I make this book work?"". 'Nothing else was important enough to overcome that.' He said that through his constant market-watching he had begun to develop a 'gut instinct' for how it would move. Adoboli told the court that when he spoke to John Hughes, his 'supervisor and go-to person' he was 'not really interested' in off-setting the losses. 'He said: 'You begin to have to consider if I was committing a fraud because I was doing it for my own benefit, ultimately, my intent in every trade I was doing was to generate profits which would offset the costs which we could not find a way to hedge. 'In the process of doing so I began to learn more and more about how the market worked. 'I was growing more confident in my ability to call the market, to understand what might happen next in the market. 'As a result of that extra confidence by the end of 2009 I had made £3.5m profit for the book. 'My end goal was to generate £24m of profit that I could then release in to the book to offset the costs that I thought the book would incur in the period of a year.' Adoboli, 32, is accused of gambling away £1.5billion of UBS's money and wiping £3bn off its share price while working at its London headquarters . Adoboli went on to deny the prosecution suggestion that he was a 'gambler'. He . said: 'It's not ""I will just do a gamble on the market because that's . fun"" and the outcome I will hide away in a cash trade, absolutely not. Actually the cash trade is the end goal.' He . said the 'Umbrella', which prosecutors have suggested was a secret . 'slush fund', was nothing more than an 'accounting mechanism' to help . the ETF desk offset its losses, adding that his colleagues Hughes, Simon . Taylor, and Christophe Bertrand, were all aware of its existence. Adoboli . went on to describe Mr Foster, who left UBS before the period in which . Adoboli is alleged to have begun his fraudulent activities, as having a . 'lot of strong relationships' and being 'good at managing' both him and . his desk colleague John Hughes. After Foster left, Hughes took over as 'supervisor' of the ETF desk, said Adoboli, leaving two young men in charge of a '$50bn book'. Hughes, who gave evidence earlier in the trial, was described by Adoboli as 'quite maverick' and 'gung-ho'. He said: 'He did not really care about the book as a whole. He cared about being profitable as a trader.' Adoboli worked in the back office at UBS from September 2003 until December 2005 when he was employed as a trader. In September 2006 he was moved to the global synthetic equities division on the exchange traded funds (ETF) desk buying and selling ETFs, which track different types of stocks, bonds or commodities such as metals. At the start of today's hearing two additional charges of false accounting were added to the indictment. Mr Justice Keith, outlining what he described as the 'sensible reasons' for adding the charges, told the jury: 'It's been decided to add two additional counts to the indictment. 'Those additional counts do not add to the allegations which have already been made against Mr Adoboli. 'They have been inserted to clarify the allegations which are being made.' Adoboli, from east London, denies two counts of fraud by abuse of position and four counts of false accounting. The case continues.

The source said officials had ‘never searched for texts in general’. Labour MP Chris Bryant, who has been submitting repeated questions to Mr Cameron over the extent of his contact with Mrs Brooks, said yesterday: ‘The Prime Minister is putting up a public image of being transparent but I think voters would want to see the full extent of his messages.

Jessica Ennis became the poster girl of the Olympics and her toned body earned her a legion of male admirers. But the gold-medal winning heptathlete reveals she worries that her muscles make her look masculine. In fact, she thinks her arms look ‘butch’ and, away from the track, often covers them up. Last night was no exception as she chose a sheer cream blouse with long sleeves for her appearance at a Christmas concert. Covering up: Jessica wore a long sleeved top for a book signing in Sheffield last night after admitting that she worries her muscles make her look masculine . Miss Ennis, 26, a picture of understated glamour, joined boy band The Wanted and X factor semi-finalist Misha B for a charity concert to celebrate the Christmas lights switch-on at Meadowhall, in her home city of Sheffield. She has kept a low profile since winning gold for the heptathlon in spectacular style in August, but made a rare public appearance to attend the charity concert and sign copies of her autobiography, Unbelievable: From My Childhood Dreams to Winning Olympic Gold. In it, she admits she has body hang-ups like many other women. She says: ‘I don’t look in the mirror and think, Oh God yeah. I don’t think I’m anything special.’ She admits she avoided weight training when she began competing because ‘I felt big muscles were unattractive and none of my friends at school had them’. ‘As a teenage girl I was more self-conscious,’ she said. ‘I would not wear certain things and, to some extent, I am the same now and will usually cover my arms. I look at myself in the mirror and think I am a bit butch, but you get to a point where you finally understand that looks do not matter so much.’ Despite her concerns, she has posed for a number of risqué photo shoots, including one in lacy black underwear. She said: ‘I did some sexier shots for GQ magazine wearing some hot pants and pouting. I would never do topless or nude pictures or even be body-painted. That is where I draw the line.’ Poster girl: Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis admits she has body hang ups like many other woman . Miss Ennis also admitted her irritation at her nickname, Tadpole, which was created by fellow English heptathlete and rival, Kelly Sotherton. At 5ft 5ins tall, Miss Ennis is often dwarfed by other competitors and she admits that the nickname fuelled her insecurities about her size. During the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, she recalls Miss Sotherton returning to the athletes’ village after talking to the media and boasting: ‘Guess what. It’s so funny. I’ve just called you Tadpole to the press.’ Miss Ennis said: ‘I knew it wasn’t malicious but I also knew there was a slight edge to it. She knew the name would stick and it’s not the most flattering.’ Skin deep: The heptathlete confesses she was more self-conscious as a teenager but now understands that 'looks do not matter so much.' Frank talk: Jessica Ennis made the confessions in her autobiography, in which she also admitted that the nickname, Tadpole, given to her by Kelly Sotherton bothered her . She later returns to the subject, saying: ‘The truth is I was hurt by it and did not like it.’ Sotherton retired this year after she failed to recover from a back injury in time for the London 2012 Games.","Gold medallist admitted she avoided weight training because she thought big muscles were 'unattractive'

Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, Margaret Hodge is 'astonished' at Circle's deficit . The UK's first privately run NHS hospital generated a deficit more than twice as high than planned, it emerged today. Circle, the company in charge of Hinchingbrooke Health Care Trust in Cambridgeshire, had projected that the Trust would be in a £1.9 million deficit after six months under its stewardship, but in September it reported a deficit of £4.1 million. The National Audit Office (NAO) said that while the private provider has made improvements in clinical areas a number of financial challenges remain. Circle began it's 10-year management franchise at the struggling Huntingdon-based hospital in February in what is seen as a potential model for other hospitals across the country. But the NAO said that before any more NHS hospitals are run by private providers, the Department of Health must do a 'lessons learned' exercise to make sure there are no weaknesses in the procurement process. David Moon, director of health value for money studies at the NAO said: 'There are potential other franchises, currently George Eliot in Nuneaton is under review by the Department as to how their management arrangements are going and this is one potential option. 'But we believe that before any other franchises are entered into, the Department should do a lessons learned exercise to make sure that any weaknesses in the process are ironed out for any future tenders.' In a report about the franchising of Hinchingbrooke, the NAO said that during the procurement process, the East of England Strategic Health Authority assessed the reasonableness of the bidders' savings proposals but it did not fully consider the relative risks of the saving proposals. 'This is a first for the NHS - the NHS hasn't done this before - so to an extent they were covering new ground,' said Mr Moon. 'Moving forward, if they are to have to do this again they need to assess the risk of the bids in a more defined way. 'Both bidders, Circle and Serco, were asked to come up with a whole range of saving schemes to deliver a minimum of £228 million of savings over a 10-year period which they duly did. 'While the schemes were evaluated for: 'Does this look a sensible scheme? And is it clinically safe? etc' they weren't evaluated to a financial level so they didn't check whether the level of savings that were going to materialise from those proposals were actually going to happen. 'Circle plans to achieve £311 million in savings over the 10-year contract. That is an unprecedented level of savings,' Mr Moon continued. 'That's more than 5% a year which probably has not been done in the NHS to date.' In the past decade, the hospital has not made an annual surplus of more the £600,000, he added. Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire was taken over by Circle in February . If Circle does not deliver a surplus, they get no franchise fee. But the first £2 million of any in-year surplus is retained by the private provider and any surplus above £2 million is split - some to pay off the Trust's historic deficit of £38 million and the rest to Circle. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said she was 'astonished' that Circle takes profit ahead of addressing the hospital's deficit. She said: 'The purpose of franchising Hinchingbrooke hospital to a private company was to turn around the financial fortunes of a failing NHS Trust, yet after just eight months under Circle's stewardship, the Trust has drifted a further £4.1 million into the red. 'Circle struck a 10-year deal under which it can earn £31 million if it can deliver unprecedented annual savings of more than 5%. 'While there have been welcome clinical improvements since Circle took over, it is essential that pressure to make savings does not simply lead to cuts in services in the future. Safety and quality of care must always come first. 'Before handing Circle the contract, the Strategic Health Authority failed to test properly whether the required savings are even achievable. 'There is no clear and common view as to what would constitute a successful outcome or how that would be measured. 'Above all, I am astonished that the contract allows Circle to pocket any profit ahead of addressing the Trust's deficit. Worse still, Circle suffers no penalty if at the end of the 10 years the deficit is not paid off in full. 'Getting this deal right has huge implications for this hospital's sustainability and for the 160,000 members of the public it serves.' Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, added: 'While Circle has made early improvements in some clinical areas, the company will have to generate savings at an unprecedented level. 'The final judgment on the value for money of the franchise will depend on how successfully Circle makes the projected savings and repays the cumulative deficit, while maintaining clinical quality. 'This franchise agreement is the first of its kind in the NHS and it is important that lessons from this procurement process and early operational experience are used to improve future contracts.'","The firm had originally predicted a £1.9million deficit .

North Creake Airfield opened on November 23 1943. Seventeen aircraft were lost during operations from the airfield, eight Stirling and nine Halifax. Although proposed as a Very Heavy Bomber airfield for future advanced aircraft these plans were dropped in the spring of 1944. The airfield’s isolated location, however, made it perfect for the radio countermeasures work and bomber support carried out by squadrons of the RAF’s new No 100 Group. In May 1944 No 199 Squadron flew Short Stirlings to confuse enemy radars by using ‘Mandrel’ jamming equipment which proved vital to the bomber offensive. On D-Day the squadron played a crucial role by simulating a large collection of ships heading towards the Pas-de-Calais area, so drawing enemy forces away from the actual Allied invasion area in Normandy. The simulation was achieved through the flying formation which gave the impression of a large convoy, showing up as huge ships on enemy radar screens. ‘C’ Flight of No 199 Squadron was detached to form the nucleus of No 171 Squadron in September 1944, mainly using Handley Page Halifaxes for yet more countermeasures operations, also dropping ‘Window’ tin foil strips to jam enemy radar. The airfield was later used by No 274 Maintenance Unit to store and then scrap many de Havilland Mosquitoes until closure in September 1947. Source: Airfields of Britain .

They couple plan to remove the post-war alterations - shingles, its pitched . roof, various sheds from the woodyard days. Even its contemporary kitchen will go eventually, to be replaced by a 1950s-style version with metal and Formica fittings.

The U.S. Army soldier charged with providing WikiLeaks with hundreds of thousands of classified documents, has offered a partial guilty plea in a bid to avoid prosecution for some of the most serious charges against him. Last year, the military slapped Pfc. Bradley Manning's with 22 charges, including alleging that he caused ‘intelligence belonging to the United States government’ to be published on the internet. Manning's civilian defense attorney, David Coombs, says his client is offering to take responsibility for some of the less serious offenses that are encapsulated within the charged crimes. Manning is willing to plead guilty to providing data to WikiLeaks, but not to the government's charge that he 'aided the enemy' It is understood Manning is willing to plead . guilty to providing the data to WikiLeaks, but not to the government's . charge that he 'aided the enemy' or 'exceeded authorized access' on his . computer. Even if the court accepts the offer, military prosecutors could still try to prove Manning guilty of the more serious charges. They include aiding the enemy, punishable by life imprisonment. Coombs revealed the offer Wednesday during a pretrial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland. The hearing continues Thursday. He stressed that the plea is not part of any agreement or deal with prosecutors. Manning's court-martial is set to begin in February 2013, he has elected to be tried by a military judge rather than a jury. The military's 2012 Manual for Courts-Martial  allows defendants to offer hybrid pleas to judges, including 'not guilty to an offense as charged, but guilty of a named lesser included offense' and 'not guilty of the exceptions, but guilty of the substitutions.' Manning was hailed as a 'hero' by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in August. Speaking from a balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, he called Manning 'one of the world's foremost political prisoners.' Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has hailed Manning as a hero and 'one of the world's foremost political prisoners' A gaunt looking Manning is escorted to court in June for his pretrial hearing .

The once-round-faced soldier looking dramatically gaunt and frail when he appeared in court in June for his pretrial hearing, compared to photos released following his arrest in May 2010.

Peninsula by allegedly causing hundreds of thousands of classified war . logs, video clips and diplomatic cables to be published on the . secret-sharing website WikiLeaks. The Oklahoma native allegedly gave the anti-secrecy website more than 700,000 documents and video clips. Authorities say he downloaded the . files from a Defense Department network while working as an intelligence . analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010. Emotional turmoil: Manning's lawyers say he was a gay soldier at a time when homosexuals were barred from serving openly . Defense lawyers have previously sought to portray Manning as a troubled young soldier whom the Army should never have . deployed to Iraq or given access to classified material while he was . stationed there from late 2009 to mid-2010. At . a preliminary hearing last December, military prosecutors produced . evidence that Manning downloaded and electronically transferred to . WikiLeaks nearly half a million sensitive battlefield reports from Iraq . and Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables, and video . of a deadly 2007 Army helicopter attack that WikiLeaks shared with the . world and dubbed 'Collateral Murder.' Manning's lawyers countered that . others had access to Manning's workplace computers. They say he was in . emotional turmoil, partly because he was a gay soldier at a time when . homosexuals were barred from serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. Campaign: The Bradley Manning Support Group has described his prosecution as 'fundamentally unjust' The . defense also claims Manning's apparent disregard for security rules . during stateside training and his increasingly violent outbursts after . deployment were red flags that should have prevented him from having . access to classified material.

Broadband users in one road suffer a download speed 500 times slower than those in a street enjoying the UK's fastest speed, a study has found. Cromarty Road in Stamford, Lincolnshire, has an average speed of 0.132Mbps, while Willowfield, in Telford and Wrekin, has registered speeds of 70.9Mbps over the past six months, uSwitch.com found. Lincolnshire has three of the top 10 slowest streets for broadband in the country with speeds around 37 times slower than the national average of 9Mbps, the survey revealed. Cromarty Road in Stamford, Lincolnshire, has an average speed of 0.132Mbps making it Britain's slowest street for broadband . The five slowest streets for average broadband speeds are: . Essex has four of the slowest streets in the UK but also boasts the third fastest - Cromwell Road in Southend-on-Sea. According to the study, it would take Willowfield residents two minutes and 49 seconds to download a two hour film, and 11 seconds to download a music album, while Cromarty Road residents would need 25 hours and 15 minutes to download a two hour film, and one hour and 41 minutes to download the same album. Lincolnshire's Burghley Road in Lincoln and Woodlands Drive in Colsterworth also registered 'negligible""' speeds of 0.259Mbps and 0.346Mbps respectively. And uSwitch found those who live on Ledbury Road in Wellington Heath, Herefordshire, 'would probably be better off sending snail mail than an email' with an average download speed of 0.192Mbps - the second slowest in the country. The third slowest is Halsey Drive in Edzell, Aberdeenshire, where speeds of 0.25Mbps mean that downloading one song would take two minutes and 40 seconds. The study found a wide variation in London speeds, with South View Road in Haringey having an average speed of 0.639Mbps. Julia Stent, uSwitch broadband spokeswoman, said: 'The massive discrepancy between the fastest and slowest streets in Britain shows what the Government is up against in its fight to drag Britain into the broadband fastlane. 'These results show just how ambitious it is being in its bid to overtake the rest of Europe and haul Britain in line with the likes of South Korea and Singapore by bringing super-fast broadband to 90% of the UK. In the fast lane: Willowfield, in Telford and Wrekin, has registered speeds of 70.9Mbps . The five fastest streets for average broadband speeds are: . 'Rural parts of Britain in particular are still experiencing broadband speeds so slow that they might as well have no broadband at all. 'But worryingly, the Government's superfast broadband rollout is heavily geared towards urban areas, which will only widen the rural-urban broadband gap. 'It's concerning that the main aim isn't providing a decent broadband service to those areas still lacking basic broadband infrastructure and bringing acceptable average speeds to those in rural areas who have been forever languishing in the slow lane. 'However, most of Britain's slowest streets for broadband are not in particularly remote areas, but in small towns, nearer to exchanges and where we would expect to see higher download speeds across the board. 'Part of the problem is that Government funding for superfast broadband is being dished out to councils, who don't necessarily have a full view of the big picture.' She added: 'Ultimately, anyone frustrated with their broadband service should test their speeds regularly online and compare the results to those of other broadband users in the same area.

The development of 'high tech' long range weapons 71,000 years ago in Africa gave humans the killing edge which helped make us the dominant species, a new study suggests. Finds in South Africa suggest that by the time our ancestors began to spread across the planet they had developed advanced weapons that made them more than a match for Neanderthal rivals. Research on stone tools and Neanderthal anatomy strongly suggests that our now-extinct sister species lacked true projectile weapons. Neanderthals watch out: This reconstruction of a Homo sapiens hunting party from the BBC documentary Planet of the . Apeman shows how our ancestors might have wielded their 'high tech' weapons . 'When Africans left Africa and entered Neanderthal territory they had projectiles with greater killing reach, and these early moderns probably also had higher levels of pro-social (hyper-cooperative) behaviour,' said Curtis Marean, project director and Arizona State University professor in the Institute of Human Origins. 'These two traits were a knockout punch. Combine them, as modern humans did and still do, and no prey or competitor is safe. 'This probably laid the foundation for the expansion out of Africa of modern humans and the extinction of many prey as well as our sister species such as Neanderthals.' The findings at Pinnacle Point, near Mossel Bay, also suggest that modern man may have evolved in this region as the Stone Age technology found only took hold in other areas of Africa and Eurasia about 50,000 years later. 'Every time we excavate a new site in coastal South Africa with advanced field techniques, we discover new and surprising results that push back in time the evidence for uniquely human behaviours,' said Professor Marean. These microlith blades show a flat side and a . rounded 'cutting' edge: It is believed they were used in light . armaments for use as projectiles, either as arrows for bows, or as spears for throwers known as atlatls . The dig: The excavation site preserves about 14m . of archaeological sediment dating from approximately 90,000 to 50,000 . years ago. Almost 200,000 finds have been plotted to date, and . excavations continue . The study, published in today's issue . of the journal Nature, found that the technology focused on the careful . production of long, thin blades of stone that were then blunted on one . edge so that they could be glued into slots carved in wood or bone. This . created light armaments for use as projectiles, either as arrows in bow . and arrow technology, or more likely as spear throwers, known as . atlatls. They provide a significant advantage by increasing the killing . reach of the hunter and lowering the risk of injury. Sub-Saharan Africans are the only modern humans whose ancestors apparently did not interbreed with Neanderthals, new research suggests. Scientists studying human genetic ancestry have found that, like modern Eurasian peoples, modern North Africans also carry genetic traces which suggest some Neanderthal ancestry. Neanderthals were a closely related species of humans who thrived in Europe and the near East during the last Ice Age but died out around 30,000 years ago. Genetic evidence published in 2010 suggests they interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans, with as much as 1 to 4 per cent of modern Eurasian genomes containing Neanderthal DNA. The . stone used to produce these special blades was carefully transformed . for easier flaking by a complex process called 'heat treatment,' a . technological advance also appearing early in coastal South Africa. 'Good . things come in small packages,' said Kyle Brown, a stone tool . replicator and co-author. 'When we started to find these very small . carefully made tools, we were glad that we had saved and sorted even the . smallest of our sieved materials. 'At sites excavated less carefully, these microliths may have been discarded in the back dirt or never identified in the lab.' This microlithic technology appear briefly between 65,000 and 60,000 years ago during a worldwide glacial phase, and then was thought to vanish, showing what many scientists accept as a 'flickering' pattern of advanced technologies in Africa. This pattern was thought to result from small populations struggling during harsh climate phases, inventing technologies, and then losing them due to chance occurrences wiping out the artisans with the special knowledge. 'Eleven thousand years of continuity is, in reality, an almost unimaginable time span for people to consistently make tools the same way,' said Professor Marean. 'This is certainly not a flickering pattern.' The appearance and disappearance is more likely a function of the small sample of well-excavated sites in Africa. Because of this small sample, each new site has a high probability of adding a novel observation. Birthplace of the first humans? Pinnacle Point . on the southern coast of South Africa. It is thought modern man may have evolved in . this region as the technology found here only emerged elsewhere about 50,000 years later . The African sample is a tiny fraction of the known European sample from the same time period. 'This is why continued and well-funded fieldwork in Africa is of the highest scientific priority if we want to learn about what it means to be human, and where and when it happened,' said Professor Marean. The excavation site preserves about 14m of archaeological sediment dating from approximately 90,000 to 50,000 years ago. Every observed item related to human behaviour was plotted directly to a computer using a 'total station' - a surveying instrument that digitally captures points where items are found to create a 3D model of the excavation. Almost 200,000 finds have been plotted to date, and excavations continue. 'As an archaeologist and scientist, it is a privilege to work on a site that preserves a near perfect layered sequence capturing almost 50,000 years of human prehistory,' said Mr Brown, who codirected excavations. 'Our team has done a remarkable job of identifying some of the subtle but important clues to just how innovative these early humans on the south coast were.'","Archaeological finds in South Africa dating back 71,000 years are the earliest evidence of humans making projectile weapons .

I nearly fell off my chair when Foxy Bingo invited me to the launch of their Bingo Speed Dating concept – where I’d get to date eight gorgeous celebrity men in just one evening. I Google searched each name straight away to check them out. While I was excited to meet gorgeous Romeo Dunn, Waterloo Road’s Lucien Laviscount, TOWIE‘s Charlie King and James ‘Arg’ Argent, it was hunky canoeist Richard Hounslow who caught my eye, as well as Made in Chelsea new boy Sam Cussins, cute 400m athlete Jack Green and Geordie Shore’s bit of rough Gary ‘Gaz’ Beadle. The dates would take the shape of three minute chats with each man, and I would date all eight across the evening. It was a hard job, but someone had to do it... The eligible bachelors: The boys of TOWIE, Made In Chelsea and Team GB lined up with Foxy and prepared for their speed dating . Here come the girls: Deni posed with Foxy and her fellow speed daters . FIRST DATE: Jack Green . Confident and intense, as soon as I sat down he hit me with the line ‘You were the first girl I noticed in this room’. After that, Jack jumped from third to top place. At the end of our three minutes he asked me to be sure I was around after. Wahey! After dating though, he spent a lot of time chatting to other girls. I didn’t feel like hanging around for too long and, once we eventually got talking, the spark had fizzled slightly. SCORE: 5/10 Hot, but the air-con’s a bit nippy . BEST FEATURE: Good initial demeanor and eye contact . CONVERSATION: How Jack just turned 21, got fourth place in the Olympics and has just bought his second house. FIRST IMPRESSION: Charmer. LASTING IMPRESSION? Bit young. He says he likes a girl to be hard work. In reality, he probably needs someone who likes being led around. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? Maybe as friends. Going in for the kill: Jack wasted no time in pulling out the chat-up lines . ................................................................................................................................................Second date: Sam Cussins . Charming and handsome. What more could you want? With the same refined accent as the rest of the Chelsea crew, he . presented himself impeccably. He clutched his drink a little tightly, . though. Was he waiting to get somewhere? A good sport, he stayed for a . few bevvies after. Banter. SCORE: 8.5/10 Hot stuff . BEST FEATURE: Nice hair and dress sense. CONVERSATION: His job outside the TV show and the fickle notion of fame. FIRST IMPRESSION: Posh boy. LASTING IMPRESSION? Cool guy. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? Yes. Maid in Chelsea: Deni was impressed by Sam Cussins' posh boy behaviour . .....................................................................................................................................................................................................Third date: Richard Hounslow . I didn’t know quite what to expect from this accomplished hunk of a man. What I got was a down-to-earth, cheeky Essex chappy with fame as far away from his head as possible. He let people take pictures with his winning silver medal but he didn’t flash it around. This was a guy I didn’t feel inferior to. Which is funny, because he impressed me most. SCORE: 9/10 Red hot . BEST FEATURE: Sense of humour. CONVERSATION:  You know when you have a chat with someone you really fancy and you don’t remember any of it? That’s what happened. FIRST IMPRESSION: Lovely eyes. LASTING IMPRESSION? He’s great company. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? Yes. Going for gold: Deni gave Richard a whopping 9/10 . ..................................................................................................................................................................................................... Fourth date: Lucien Laviscount . Smooth operator Lucien was appropriately tactile and a gentleman. With a kiss on each cheek and a naughty smile, had I fancied him (and he is very fanciable, girls) I may have fainted. SCORE: 6.5/10 Warm by the fire . BEST FEATURE: Not afraid to charm the pants off a girl, and those pearly whites. CONVERSATION: The perfect date, what he’s looking for in a girl, and he asked a lot about me, too. FIRST IMPRESSION: Baby face. LASTING IMPRESSION? He’ll treat you like a princess. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN?  As friends. Million dollar smile: Deni was impressed by Lucien's pearly whites . .............................................................................................................................................................................................. Fifth date: James ‘Arg’ Argent . This TOWIE star gets his fair share of grief for being the butt of the joke among his friends on the hit show – it can’t be helping his luck with the ladies or first impressions. Having said he just wants to meet a ‘nice, well-spoken girl’ who likes musical theatre, I hope he does as he was very sweet on our ‘date’. SCORE: 3/10 Cool beans . BEST FEATURE: Good manners. CONVERSATION: A good balance of each others hobbies and interests – which were not dissimilar. That signature Arg giggle crept its way in a couple of times. FIRST IMPRESSION: I don’t fancy him. LASTING IMPRESSION? He’s more attractive after having met him, but still not my type. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? As friends. The Only Way Is Arg: The reality TV star's signature giggle crept in at times . ..................................................................................................................................................................................................... Sixth date:  Romeo Dunn . While I was growing up, this big piece of So Solid Crew eye candy was present on every teenage girl’s wall in the shape of a poster from Mizz magazine. Having identified me as a ‘baby’ on the offset, my chance with him was doomed. I couldn’t tell nor did I care that Romeo was over a decade older than me (when did that happen?) – but, sadly, it wasn’t meant to be. SCORE: 8/10 Hot ‘n spicy . BEST FEATURE: Sexy voice. CONVERSATION: How he feels a little old next to me, and how he’s calmed down since the So Solid days. FIRST IMPRESSION: Bad boy. LASTING IMPRESSION? Nice boy. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN?  As friends (with a secret crush). You used to be my Romeo: The So Solid Crew member was a little too old for Deni . ..................................................................................................................................................................................................... Seventh date: Gary ‘Gaz’ Beadle . I hadn’t seen Geordie Shore before, but I’d heard about this guy. A notorious womaniser who gets way over and above his fair share of ladies, was there any point in competing for the apple of his eye? He was perfectly pleasant (and honest), but I couldn’t quite tell if he was after a girl to date or a girl for the night. SCORE: 7/10 Too hot to handle . BEST FEATURE: Love the accent. For some reason I didn’t expect him to sound like that. CONVERSATION: After posing him with the notion that he’s a ‘player’, Gaz defended with the fact he’s honest with the girls. His usual line is something along the lines of, ‘I’m in town for one night: do you want to come home with me?’ He may have been asking me, actually… . FIRST IMPRESSION: Naughty boy. Can’t wait to grill him. LASTING IMPRESSION? What you see is what you get. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? As friends. Tashin' on: Gaz showed Deni how an introduction is done in Newcastle . ....................................................................................................................................................................................................... Eighth date: Charlie King . A lovely way to end the date marathon, Mr King was sweet and genuine. He had lots of good conversation, great manners – and my gaydar didn’t go off once. I didn’t really fancy him but he had the sort of face to brighten up your day. This boy just needs to meet a nice girl. SCORE: 6/10 Hotcake . BEST FEATURE: Well groomed. CONVERSATION:  Those annoying gay rumours and how TOWIE is filmed and staged. FIRST IMPRESSION: Smiley. LASTING IMPRESSION? Lovely, but not for me. WOULD YOU MEET AGAIN? As friends.

Under threat: A key ingredient used in Chanel No 5 may be banned if found to cause allergies . Famously, it was the only thing Marilyn Monroe wore in bed, and it has been synonymous with style and sophistication for more than nine decades. But now, for the first time in its 91-year history, Chanel No 5 perfume is under threat. The reason? One of its key ingredients — a naturally occurring type of tree moss — has come under the microscope of a team of EU scientists who believe it may cause allergies. It may seem bizarre that the top-selling perfume in the world — a bottle is sold every 30 seconds — could potentially be so damaging when tens of thousands of women across the globe wear it every day. But it’s just the latest in a long line of restrictions imposed on the scent industry in the past few years. Under rules implemented by the European Commission in 2006, 26 common ingredients including the now-infamous tree moss and eugenol (found in rose oil), must be declared on the packaging of perfume because they are potentially allergenic. Now it has emerged that the Commission’s Scientific Committee of Consumer Safety, charged with protecting citizens from harmful substances, has extended the list to cover 100 ‘unsafe’ materials. While they recommend that some must be declared on packaging or the amount used in a perfume be restricted, they want some — including the tree moss used in Chanel No 5 to help give it its distinctive smell — banned entirely. And while these are only guidelines and not law, it is likely that perfume manufacturers will feel pressure to comply. The industry watchdog, the International Fragrance Association, is taking it so seriously it has decided to conduct further research into the potential skin allergens on the back of the recommendations. Scroll down for video . The world's favourite perfume: A bottle of Chanel No 5 is sold every 30 seconds around the world . This doesn’t affect only Chanel; a host of other well-loved perfumes — from Miss Dior to Guerlain’s Shalimar and Angel by Thierry Mugler — could be caught up, too. For the new list calls for restrictions of many commonly used ingredients such as citral, found in lemon and tangerine oils, and coumarine, which comes from the spicy South American tonka bean — all naturally sourced ingredients, it should be pointed out, which have been used for decades in perfume-making without causing serious harm. It is even feared that jasmine and rose — some of the most common ingredients in the world’s favourite scents — could be put on future lists. But back to Chanel. What is this . innocuous-sounding tree moss, and how important is it to Chanel No 5? According to Francis Pickthall, director of UK-based international . fragrance house CPL Aromas, tree moss has always been an important . ingredient in high-end fragrances thanks to its distinctive earthy, . woody scent, which No 5 fans would immediately recognise. 'Unsafe': The European Commission's Scientific Committee of Consumer Safety wants to ban the tree moss ingredient . ‘It’s created by scraping moss from the bark of Northern hemisphere trees, often in former Yugoslavian countries, which is then steam-distilled,’ he says. ‘But it has already started to be phased out of many perfumes and replaced with similar-scented synthetic mosses or oak moss, though only if it is low in atranol, the component of moss which is a known skin-sensitiser’. Oak moss, it must be mentioned, is also in Chanel No 5, and also on the future ‘forbidden’ list. But Mr Pickthall argues that ingredients being banned or restricted is nothing new to the industry, and that perfumers are expert at phasing out problem materials while finding alternatives. That is clearly not how everyone feels, though. Chanel spokeswoman Francoise Montenay declared: ‘It would be the end of beautiful perfumes if we could not use these ingredients’; while the French Perfumer’s Society said it would lead to ‘the death of perfume if this continues’. One wonders what Coco Chanel herself would have thought of being told by EU scientists that her beloved fragrance had to be updated before it had even reached its 100th birthday. Because the story leading to its creation is just as captivating as the scent itself. Until Chanel No 5 emerged in 1921, perfumes had tended to be thick and rich with animal musk. Having already taken the Parisian fashion scene by storm, Gabrielle ‘Coco’ Chanel decided to turn her hand to a beauty product that had so far eluded her, a fragrance that was light, fresh and reflected the liberated spirit of the new decade. Her mother had been a laundry woman in rural France, so she loved the smell of soap, but for years she was unable to find a perfumer who was up to the task, because citrus fragrances such as lemon, bergamot and orange just didn’t last on the skin. Then, in 1920, she heard about a daring perfumer Ernest Beaux, who had worked for the Russian Royal family and lived in the capital of perfume, Grasse. He took up her challenge, spending months creating ten samples for her to try. They were numbered one to five and 20 to 24. And, you guessed it, she picked number five. Testing: The International Fragrance Association is now conducting further research into potential skin allergens . She is said to have told Beaux: ‘I present my dress collections on the fifth of May, the fifth month of the year, and so we will let this sample number five keep the name it has already — it will bring good luck.’ And it did. The scent combined jasmine, rose, sandalwood and vanilla with other background notes, and it is said that when Chanel sprayed the perfume around her table in an upmarket Paris restaurant, women passing by literally stopped in their tracks to ask her what the fragrance was and where it came from. She declared later: ‘It was what I was waiting for. A perfume like nothing else. A woman’s perfume, with the scent of a woman.’ French fashion designer Gabrielle Coco Chanel released No 5 in 1921 . Time would show that millions of women from all walks of life agreed with her, from the American war-time wives who had it brought back from Europe by their GI sweethearts, to the one-in-ten modern women who were wearing Chanel No 5 when they met ‘the One’, according to a study in 2009. So will all these women really fail to notice if the formula is changed? Perfumer Roja Dove is not so sure. While he admits that it has been necessary to remove certain common components of fragrances over the last century — both for health reasons, such as when benzene was phased out when it was discovered to be a potential carcinogen, and ethical ones, like the disappearance of musks taken from slaughtered animals — he says it is never easy to recreate a well-known scent with different raw materials. ‘It’s impossible to reformulate without making a product smell different — that is why the original ingredients were used in the first place,’ he says. Dove, as a leading figure within the British perfume industry, is more than a little troubled by the ‘Big Brother’ restrictions that are gradually taking hold. ‘While I do think the consumer’s health and wellbeing should always be our first priority, imagine if Brussels authorised for all nut products to be banned or restricted because a few people are allergic,’ he says. ‘There’s huge inconsistency. Just look at basil. I have to list it on the back of packaging if I use more than a certain percentage because it’s one of the original list of 26 the European Commission decided must be declared. ‘But a chef can take a huge bunch of basil, chop it up and sprinkle it over food, and their hands will be covered with basil oil. There are no guidelines there.’ He does make a valid point. Many of the ingredients that are now being considered dangerous are even edible.So what does Roja Dove suggest for the future? ‘As an industry, we are very responsible. We would never want to use ingredients that were scientifically proven to be a major problem, but I do believe consumers should have freedom of choice. ‘There are scents around that people have loved for centuries, so is it right to do away with them entirely? I’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions.’","A bottle of Chanel No 5 is sold every 30 seconds around the world .

There is an 'urgent' need to reduce the number of teenagers taking up smoking, after experts estimated that the cost of lung cancer to the UK economy is £2.4 billion each year. The figure, which is to be presented at the NCRI Cancer Conference in Liverpool later today, is higher than the cost of any other cancer, researchers said. The economic cost, which includes healthcare costs and the potential wage loss of patients who have died, for bowel cancer is £1.6 billion and £1.5 billion for breast cancer, according to the new study. Researchers at Oxford University calculated that the total annual cost of all cancers to the UK economy is £15.8 billion - £5.6 billion of which is for healthcare costs and £7.6 billion is attributable to premature deaths and time off work. Each lung cancer patient costs the UK healthcare system £9,071 annually, the NCRI said. Research author, Dr Jose Leal, at the Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford, said: 'Lung cancer costs more than any other cancer - mainly because of potential wage losses due to premature deaths from people in employment - about 60 per cent of the total economic costs - and high health care costs. 'The death rate from the disease remains high at 56 deaths per 100,000 people in the UK population annually, and almost a quarter of these occur before retirement. 'Our research shows that cancers impact the economy as a whole - and not just the health service.' 157,000 children aged 11-15 start smoking in the UK each year (posed by models) The NCRI said that each year in the UK, 41,500 people are diagnosed with lung cancer, and eight in 10 cases are caused by smoking. Data from the Office for National Statistics show that last year, 30,000 people died from lung cancer. It accounted for 5.3 per cent of all deaths in women and 7.2 per cent of all deaths in men in 2011. The NCRI said 157,000 children aged 11-15 start smoking in the UK each year. Dr Jane Cope, director of the NCRI, said: 'These figures remind us that cancer has a cost, not just in professional healthcare but also in loss of earnings for patients, and for loved ones who give up work to look after them. 'Since 86 per cent of lung cancer deaths are linked to smoking, we can reduce these financial and societal costs by helping people to stop smoking.' Jean King, Cancer Research UK’s director of tobacco control, added: 'This research highlights the stark economic impact of different cancers. But it’s important to remember the very real human impact of cancer - the lives lost to, and affected by the disease. 'It’s vital we prevent more young people from becoming addicted to a product that will kill half of all long term smokers. 'Putting an end to the silent salesman of the slickly-designed, colourful tobacco packaging is a crucial step towards making cigarettes less appealing to children. 'Stopping young people taking up this deadly addiction in the first place will not only reduce the number of lung cancer cases in the future but a range of other illnesses that continue to blight the lives of so many people.'","Cost is higher than other common cancers, such as bowel or breast .

The long lines and frayed nerves at gas stations in New York and New Jersey has revived memories for some of the crippling Arab oil embargo of 1973, the last time that gasoline was rationed in New York. That crisis started in October 1973, when the Arab oil-producing states imposed an embargo against nations supporting Israel in the Fourth Arab-Israeli War, also known as Yom Kippur. The oil embargo, and the cut in production that accompanied it, doubled the price of crude and reduced overall supply. That forced gasoline prices to skyrocket at the pump and led to rationing and prompted Washington to question its reliance on Arab oil in a region known for its instability. Long gas station lines and frustrated motorists became iconic images of the early 1970s. The embargo eventually end in March 1974.","Gas rationing started at 6am in New York City, 5am in Long Island .

But many music fans covet the pure sound of records, pushing up the price of the rarest gems. Old favourites The Beatles and Sex Pistols dominate the new top-10 list of the most expensive records, taking up nine places in the top 10 countdown. Only Queen break up their stranglehold with a rare version of Bohemian Rhapsody, coming in at number eight in the list compiled by Record Collector magazine. All you need is love: The Beatles dominate the top-10 in three positions, with two songs by their earlier band The Quarry Men also appearing. Top, Ringo Starr, left, and Paul McCartney and bottom, George Harrison, left, and John Lennon . The Quarry Men pianist John 'Duff' Lowe when he was a friend of George Harrison, left, and with the most valuable record in the UK, right, before he sold it to former bandmate Paul McCartney . Anarchy in the UK: Sex Pistols records appear in an impressive four places, with the price of God Save the Queen shooting up in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year . Topping the list for a second year is a unique acetate copy of That'll Be The Day/In Spite Of All The Danger by The Quarry Men - a pre-Beatles group featuring John Lennon, Sir Paul McCartney and George Harrison. Their 1958 demo recording is valued at . £200,000, while at number two is a 1981 reproduction of the single - on . seven-inch and 10-inch vinyl - which goes for a more modest £10,000. He has no regrets about not making the transition from John Lennon and Paul McCartney's first band to The Beatles - but John Duff Lowe, who later became a stockbroker, might rue one missed opportunity. A vinyl record that Mr Lowe, from Yatton, Somerset, kept at the bottom of a drawer in his home for more than 20 years is today named as the most valuable in the world by industry bible Record Collector. Mr Lowe - known simply as Duff - played piano for The Quarry Men, the forerunners of The Beatles, and had kept the first record cut by Lennon and McCartney, which is valued at £200,000. Duff absentmindedly put the original acetate disc, recorded in a Liverpool studio in 1958, in the bottom of a drawer and forgot about it until the early 1980s, when he sold it back to McCartney for an undisclosed sum. The recording later appeared in the Beatles' Anthology series, which was released in the 1990s. McCartney later recalled: 'We shared the record. I kept it for a week, George kept it for a week, John kept it for a week, [drummer] Colin Hanton kept it for a week, then Duff kept it for 23 years.' The magazine, which publishes its list . today, places the Pistols' God Save The Queen/No Feelings at number . three. A rare acetate version would fetch roughly £10,000. Originally released in 1977, prices appear to have shot up around 60 per cent as the Queen celebrates her Diamond Jubilee year, with one copy fetching £12,630 in recent months. The tracks were pressed to help manager Malcolm McLaren secure a new deal for the group after they were axed by EMI. Another version of the same record, when the group were briefly on A&M Records, is valued at £8,000. Although 20,000 copies were made, most were destroyed, making it a collector's item. The punk idols are also at number five with the acetate copy of Anarchy In The UK, with No Fun on the B-side, its price estimated at £7,000. Only three copies are known to exist. The Quarry Men recording at the top of the list was created in July 1958 by the Beatles trio plus John 'Duff' Lowe on piano and drummer Colin Hanlon, who headed into a studio after shelling out a few shillings. The acetate version ended up in Lowe's hands and he eventually sold it to Sir Paul, who is still thought to own it. He had it restored and it was used to make the handful of 1981 copies. The lower reaches of the top 200 in the magazine show growing prices for UK heavy metal acts such as Iron Maiden, at 189 with a rare brown vinyl 12-inch version of Twilight Zone going for £800, and Holocaust's Slay That Dragon at 191, valued at a similar amount. Ian Shirley, editor of the Rare Record . Price Guide who compiled the list for Record Collector, said: 'When it . comes to collectable rare vinyl, the Beatles remain the blue chip . investment, and no doubt the recent 50th anniversary of the release of . their debut single Love Me Do has helped focus collectors' minds on the . longevity and power of their music as well as inflate prices for mint . copies of their albums, singles and EPs. Test of time: Records made by UK metal acts are beginning to climb the chart as collectors spot lasting classics . 'The appeal of Fab Four collectables is worldwide. I was in Japan last week and when I asked the head buyer of one of the biggest dealing shops in the country what artist or genre was the most collectable in Japan, although he did not speak any English, he had one word for me, ""Beatles"". 'The Quarry Men acetate is now, in musical terms, a holy tablet equivalent to the Ten Commandments that Moses brought down from the mount. 'It is ironic that, despite the fact that back in the 70s the Sex Pistols were the epitome of anti-establishment attitude, today they are one of the most collectable bands in the world with mint copies of rarities being seen as a safe blue chip investment. The Queen's Diamond Jubilee not only crowned her longevity as a ruler but also their own as the top collectable punk band in the world.' Mr Shirley said little-known bands who made little impact or money in their careers can now command huge prices. 'There is a real hunger for mint copies of collectable late 60s and early 70s LPs, with obscure acts like Leafhound, Pussy, Grannie, July and Red Dirt, to name a few - whose records only sold a few hundred copies at the time - now fetching four-figure sums.'

(Posed by model) The fight for an automatic block on online porn will begin in earnest today, with a bid to bring in new laws. A senior peer will launch a bid to change the law obliging Britain’s internet giants to impose a filter to block access to all pornographic images. The private member’s bill from Baroness Howe - the wife of former Tory Chancellor Geoffrey Howe - would bring in a system whereby adults will only be able to see porn if they specifically ‘opt in’ after a strict age verification check. But the legislation faces opposition . from Liberal Democrat peers, who claim that an opt-in system is not the . best way to protect children online. Lady Howe, an independent Crossbench . peer who chaired juvenile courts earlier in her career, said action was . needed because of the ‘dangerous’ effect that sexual content was having . on relationships between boys and girls. She . warned that access to porn was giving children the wrong idea about . relationships and could lead to teenage boys treating girls as sex . objects. Baroness Howe told the Daily Mail that ISPs should take action because porn was such a ‘lucrative’ source of revenue for them. ‘The duty is on those who make extra profit from this sort of material to do all they can to protect under 18s,’ she said. She . added: ‘The amount of pornographic material which is now available . through all these new methods on the internet is really quite dangerous . for young people. ‘A lot of children now are far more savvy about the internet than their parents, so they are much more likely to come across this sort of material by mistake. ‘An opt-in system would rule out any concern people have about their children getting access to adult material by mistake.’ 'Dangerous': Baroness Howe said easy access to porn was affecting young people's relationships. (Posed by model) Her ‘Online Safety Bill’, received its first reading earlier this year but its second reading today is the first chance for debate. The legislation only has a chance of becoming law if it receives the support of ministers. Only when the Government grants enough Parliamentary time to debate a private members’ bill does it have any hope of passing into law. Lib Dem sources last night insisted they were keen to protect children online, but were still considering the results of a Government consultation on whether an opt-in system was the best way forward. The Daily Mail is campaigning for an ‘opt in’ system which would protect children from adult material on the web by restricting it to those over the age of 18 who specifically ask to see it. But ministers and the internet giants would prefer a less stringent ‘opt out’ scheme under which parents are offered the option of imposing a filter. In July, a huge petition calling for an opt-in system - containing 115,000 names - was handed in to Downing Street. And a government consultation on the issue attracted 3,500 responses by the time it finished in September. But despite the high response, ministers have not yet responded to the consultation or even revealed what the majority view was. Some campaigners claim the government is dragging its feet on the issue. Baroness Howe said her bill was an attempt to force ministers to act. The explanatory notes of the bill state that its objective is to ‘reduce the ability of children and young people to access inappropriate material online’. Under her plans: . Lady Howe said easy access to porn was affecting young people's relationships. ‘I am concerned about proper loving relationships between boys and girls, and that they have proper respect for one another,’ she said. ‘I am concerned about the harm that this sort of stuff can do.’ Baroness Howe said she hoped ISPs would take action voluntarily - but the bill would force them to impose filters if they do not ‘stir themselves to action’. ‘[Online porn] is quite a lucrative source of income for ISPs, who want to allow people to do what they like over the age of 18,’ she said. ‘If you’re over 18 then of course is your own business, but there are real concerns about the under 18s.‘The duty is on those who make extra profit from this sort of material to do all they can to protect under 18s,' she added. From knives to films to gambling, there is an age verification process... so why can't there be one for the internet? By BARONESS HOWE . The internet has opened up a communication and information highway making Skyping our children at university, booking a holiday and finding homework answers all possible within a few keystrokes. However, with its ascendancy there has also been the more disturbing element of unfettered access to explicit material for internet users. Young people and children can unwittingly stumble across pornographic material from an innocent Google search or be presented with multiple videos about how-to self-harm whilst viewing YouTube videos. With only 39 per cent of parents of children aged 5-15 using internet controls or filtering software we can be sure this is a widespread problem. Accessing the internet from the privacy of your own room as an under-18-year-old can cause unwarranted problems from harmful exposure to age-inappropriate material to cyber-bullying. When 66 per cent of young people aged 7-16 say that they use their laptops or other portable devices tucked away in their bedroom, the low take-up of filtering software is a significant cause for concern. Current legislation on online child safety is clearly deeply unsatisfactory. Children and young people are frequently viewing material which is not appropriate for them. There are no effective legal safeguards in place to protect them. In 2010, 11 per cent of UK children aged 9-16 had encountered sexual images online in the previous year. This heightened exposure has been found to impact conceptions of sexual norms, body image and behaviour within relationships amongst young people. The Government recently consulted with the public on three models of internet safety, one of which mirrored the system I propose in my Online Safety Bill – the opt-in model. The opt-in model would block pornographic adult content unless the user can demonstrate that they are 18 or over and they opt-in to access the content. It would also require device manufacturers to provide means of filtering other content (e.g. violence or gambling) at the time of purchase. By supporting my Bill, the Government could make it law for the industry, including internet service providers, mobile phone operators and device manufacturers, to help parents protect under-18s from exposure to harmful material. I was extremely concerned that the Government’s consultation did not even mention age verification. Every school in the country operates a default filter on age-inappropriate content for its pupils so we are in no doubt that the technology is available. There would be no technical obstacles to performing age verification online at 18. Mobile phone companies have been operating age verification since 2004 and we see many products and services from knives to films or even gambling restricted by age in our supermarkets, cinemas and on our high streets. Online gambling has been restricted by a system of age verification since the Gambling Act 2005 and this has proved to be a successful method to protect children and young people who are vulnerable to the risks that come with access to gambling. My Online Safety Bill therefore seeks to migrate to the online world practices which are commonplace, well understood and accepted in the real world, and have been for years. The industry has shown itself not willing to take all the necessary steps to provide protection for vulnerable minors off its own back. Now we need to get tough and force all those who provide internet services to act decisively on this issue. The law must be changed. We have a responsibility to future generations to do this today.","Proposed law change would oblige Britain's internet giants to impose a filter blocking access to porn .

Adult subscribers would be able to opt in to receive adult content. They would have their age verified by the service provider.

The idea behind this additional filtering level is so that parents can choose to exclude material they deem inappropriate for their child at different ages.
Mobile phone operators and ISPs would also have to provide prominent, easily accessible and clear information about online safety at the time of purchase - and to make such information available for the duration of the service."

A form of Alzheimer's disease has been found in some teenagers - more than 20 years before symptoms even develop, according to a new study. Research on a group of young adults found about 30 per cent have a mutation of a gene called presenilin 1 (PSEN1), which makes them more likely to develop Alzheimer's at an unusually young age. Although the inherited form of the disease is rare, the researchers say it offers them a critical opportunity to look for early signs of the disease before clinical symptoms appear. U.S. scientists found that around 30 per cent of young people had a mutation of a gene called presenilin 1 (PSEN1), which makes them more likely to develop Alzheimer's at an unusually young age (posed by models) Disappointing results in recent drug . trials of prospective Alzheimer's treatments is thought to be down to . timing - once the symptoms of the disease are apparent, damage to the . nervous system may already be too extensive for drug treatments to have . their greatest impact. As a result, if scientists could identify signs that an individual is likely to get Alzheimer's before symptoms appear, this could lead to more effective clinical trials, and result in advances in prevention of the disease. In the new study, published  in the journal Lancet Neurology,  the researchers performed brain imaging, blood tests and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on 44 adults aged 18 to 26. Results showed 20 of the participants had the PSEN1 mutation, and were therefore certain to develop Alzheimer's; 24 did not carry the mutation. Researchers at The Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Arizona, Boston University and the University of Antioquia also found none of the participants showed any evidence of cognitive impairment at the time of the study. They discovered notable differences in brain structure and function between the two groups, with the PSEN1 mutation carriers experiencing greater activity in regions of the brain called the hippocampus - involved in memory - and the parahippocampus, as well as having less grey matter in certain brain areas. Results also showed CSF of those with the mutation had higher levels of a protein called amyloid beta, which appears to be over-produced. A healthy brain (top) and one ravaged by Alzheimer's. The worry is that symptoms of the disease often appear too late to be treated . Amyloid beta is involved in the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain, identified as a key biomarker of Alzheimer's - usually being present around 10 to 15 years before clinical onset. As 45 is the average age people with the PSEN1 mutation start showing cognitive impairment, the results show the biomarkers for Alzheimer's are evident at least 20 years before symptoms start. Dr Eric Reiman, of the Banner Alzheimer's Institute, said: 'These findings suggest that brain changes begin many years before the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease, and even before the onset of amyloid plaque deposition. 'They raise new questions about the earliest brain changes involved in the predisposition to Alzheimer's and the extent to which they could be targeted by future prevention therapies."" Another study using a technique called florbetapir PET to track amyloid plaque in people with the mutation found the plaques began accumulating when the individuals are in their late 20s. Dr Adam Fleisher, of the Banner Alzheimer's Institute, said the study will 'help set the stage for the evaluation of treatments to prevent familial Alzheimer's disease, and hopefully aid our understanding of the early stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, which is more widespread.' Professor Nick Fox, of University College London, said: 'These findings question our models of Alzheimer's disease on several fronts. 'They suggest that neurodegenerative changes occur over 20 years before symptom onset and somewhat earlier than was suggested by previous brain imaging studies of individuals at risk of inherited Alzheimer's disease. 'Further research is needed, but one interpretation of these results might be that they add to the accumulating evidence that Alzheimer's disease is characterised by a long pre-symptomatic period of slowly progressive changes that can potentially be tracked, thereby opening up a therapeutic window for early intervention.'","Study found 30% of youngsters have a mutation of a gene .

It wouldn't usually be the kind of thing Her Majesty would approve of - but when a bonfire designer asked her permission to burn a massive effigy of Buckingham Palace, the Queen gave her seal of approval. Edward Heath, 63, was inspired for his latest November 5th creation by this summer's Diamond Jubilee celebrations and set about building a 93ft wide, 26ft tall replica of the London landmark from 1,000 wooden pallets over five months. But cautious of offending the Queen in her special year by burning down her home in a spectacular display of pyrotechnics, he wrote and asked for approval first.

Mr Heath, from Dilhorne, near Stoke-on-Trent, was stunned when a palace secretary replied with her best wishes for his charity fundraising efforts. 'It was absolutely fantastic,' he said. 'She wished me all the best for the future and my adventures raising funds for charity. I read this as a seal of approval.' The letter said Her Majesty had been 'interested to learn' about his charity bonfire but it was not a 'matter she could give or withhold her permission' to. He was then given her 'very best wishes' for the future. Raising the flag: Mr Heath, 63, puts the finishing touch to the Palace, which is behind the (appropriately-named) Royal Oak pub in Dilhorne, Staffordshire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:03 EST, 26 October 2012 . As Sherry Marino made her way to the cemetery on Wednesday to tend the grave marked with her son’s name, she got a call from her lawyers - the body wasn't his. It was the news she had been waiting more than 30 years to hear. Tests had confirmed that the remains of one of . John Wayne Gacy’s victims which police told her in 1980 were her missing son Michael Marino did not match her DNA. In 1978, police identified one of the . bodies found on Gacy’s property in Norwood Park Township, Illinois as . her son. He was 14 when he disappeared in 1976 and investigators had used dental . records to identify him in 1980. Michael Marino disappeared in 1976: His mother was convinced that the body police told her was her son wasn't and more than 30 years later DNA proved her right . Killer: John Wayne Gacy murdered 33 people and became known as the Killer Clown as he would dress as a character, Pogo the Clown, at  parades and children's parties . Between 1972 and 1978, John Wayne Gacy killed 33 teenage boys or young men at his Chicago, Illinois home. He occasionally lured the men for sex by impersonating a police officer or promising them construction work. He stabbed the first victim, 15-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy, and strangled the others. Most were buried in a crawl space under his home. Four others were dumped in a river. Investigators were alerted to Gacy after a boy went missing who he had been talking with him about construction work. On searching his home, they found a series of odd items - such as clothes too small for Gacy - and the smell of decay. Gacy was executed by lethal injection in 1994. His last words were 'Kiss my ass.' Gacy became known as the Killer Clown as he would dress as a character, Pogo the Clown, at  parades and children's parties. For years Marino had fought to have the grave exhumed and now almost 36 years after her son first disappeared her long-held misgivings were proved to be well-founded. Scientists at a North Carolina . laboratory compared bone DNA of the victim to that provided by Sherry Marino and determined that they could not be related. 'We are very happy that we followed . through because her suspicions were 100 percent correct,' Steven Becker, who represents Sherry Marino, told the Chicago Sun-Times. 'She hopes the information . about his misidentification will bring more leads to find Michael.' After years of tending the grave, but convinced that it wasn't Michael, Marino approached Becker and Robert Stephenson of Becker Stephenson, who agreed to work on her behalf, pro bono. After fighting bureaucracy, they succeeded in finally having the body unearthed. Late last year, Sherry Marino requested . that the body, one of more than two dozen found in the crawlspace of . Gacy's home in late 1978, be exhumed to determine if the remains buried . at the cemetery were her son's. Days later, the Cook County . Sheriff's department said it had exhumed the remains of several young . men believed to be, but never identified, as Gacy victims. During . last year's hearing, Sherry Marino's attorneys said she wondered why . the clothes on the remains did not match the clothing she remembers . seeing her son wear the day he disappeared. Further, they said she never . understood why it took more than three years to identify her son, . despite the fact that she provided dental records shortly after the . bodies were discovered. Even her attorneys has acknowledged that there . was strong circumstantial evidence that the remains - identified as 'body 14' - were those of Michael Marino, including that the remains . were found in Gacy's crawl space next to those of Marino's friend, . Kenneth Parker, who disappeared the same day. Murdered: This undated photo shows the remains of one of Gacy's unidentified victims . Grim discovery: Forensic investigators sorting the jaw bones and teeth of victims exhumed last year into buckets . The orthodontist who initially examined Gacy's victims remains convinced his findings are correct. 'The dental identification is just 100 percent solid, absolutely no . question,' said Dr. Edward Pavlik. 'We compared 32 teeth, probably half a . dozen of them had very distinct fillings and every tooth was consistent . with the dental records of Michael Marino.' The attorneys said . Thursday that the lab's findings do not necessarily mean Marino was not . a Gacy victim, but that it raises questions, such as whether other . victims may have been misidentified. 'We don't know where Michael . Marino is but what we do know is he's not buried in Queen of Heaven . Cemetery under a tombstone that says ""Michael Marino,""' Becker said. Gacy, a building contractor and amateur . clown, was convicted of luring 33 young men and boys to Chicago-area . home and strangling them between 1972 and 1978, sentenced to death and . executed in 1994.","Michael Marino, 14, went missing in 1976 .

"A family friend has been arrested after admitting to the crime . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:15 EST, 26 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:42 EST, 26 October 2012 . A family friend charged with killing a baby girl and her grandmother told police he dropped the baby as he wielded a knife and the grandmother charged at him during a botched kidnapping, authorities said Friday. Raghunandan 'Raghu' Yandamuri, a native of India, targeted the family for a $50,000 ransom because he knew both parents worked, and he left copies of a ransom note, according to a police affidavit filed in suburban Philadelphia. 'It's up to you to decide, do you want your one-year-old or five months of your income?' the lengthy note said. Tragic ending: Satyavathi Venna holds her granddaughter, Saavni Venna . Raghunandan 'Raghu' Yandamuri, a native of India, targeted the family for a $50,000 ransom because he knew both parents worked . Ten copies of the note were left at the family's apartment, but no one ever contacted the baby's parents, both software engineers, after the grandmother was found dead Monday and the baby went missing. Authorities instead found the body of 10-month-old Saanvi Venna in a bloody white dress early Friday beneath a bench in a basement fitness room at the sprawling apartment complex where Yandamuri and the victims lived. The 26-year-old Yandamuri, interviewed Thursday as police canvassed the family's friends, had told officers where to find the body, District Attorney Risa Ferman said. Investigators had hoped to find Saanvi alive even as the week wore on. But she may have been dead before she left the apartment, Ferman said. Yandamuri told police that he put a handkerchief in her mouth to quiet her, tied a towel around her head and put her in a suitcase before he left, according to the affidavit. Yandamuri was being held without bail on two counts of murder, kidnapping, robbery and other charges pending a preliminary hearing next week. He does not have a lawyer and did not enter a plea at a brief arraignment Friday afternoon. The murders occurred at this apartment block in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County . He told a judge he is not a U.S. citizen and was given time to make a private call to the Indian consulate. The baby's father, Venkata Konda Siva Venna, and mother, Chenchu Latha Punuru, moved to the United States from India in February 2007 and moved into the apartment in June. The ransom note referred to them by family nicknames, leading police to hone in on friends and acquaintances. The paternal grandmother, 61-year-old Satyavathi Venna, arrived from India in July and was scheduled to return home in January. She opened the door to Yandamuri on Monday morning only to see he was armed with a kitchen knife, authorities said. She retreated to the kitchen, while he picked up the baby from the couch, the affidavit said. Investigators believe Saanvi may have been dead before she left the apartment . Yandamuri told police he dropped the . baby and the grandmother came toward him and walked into the knife, . leaving a deep gash in her throat, the affidavit said. Yandamuri, . who lived in a different building than the parents, told police that he . had printed nearly 200 missing-child posters at work, distributed them . and attended a vigil for the baby. But . he later detailed the botched crime to police and said he had stolen . jewelry, some of which he threw in the nearby Schuylkill River, the . affidavit said. A throng of . people jeered at him, shouting 'Hang him!' and other taunts, as he was . led into court Friday afternoon in a bulletproof vest. 'We had been hopeful that Saanvi was still alive,' said Ferman, the prosecutor. 'Tragically, that is not the case.'","10-month-old Saanvi Venna's body was found in a suitcase in the basement of the apartment block where she lived .

A couple have been banned from keeping pets after RSPCA officers discovered they were living with almost 100 cats and dogs. RSPCA inspectors were stunned at the squalor the couple lived in at their Cumbria farmhouse - amongst dozens of dogs, cats, cattle, sheep and pigs. Carlisle Magistrates' Court heard that Robert Park, 54, and his 57-year-old wife Linda Faulder-Park, were living with 70 dogs as an 'indoor feral pack' when the house was raided. Squalor: A couple have been banned from keeping pets after RSPCA officers discovered they were living with almost 100 cats and dogs . Dozens of sheep, cattle, and pigs owned by the couple were in such poor condition they had to be destroyed. But it was conditions inside the couple’s home that most shocked vets and the team of RSPCA inspectors who were called in to investigate. They found that the farmhouse had been transformed into a foul-smelling kennel for dozens of dogs, with the walls, floors and furniture covered in dog excrement. Living as an indoor 'feral pack,' the dogs - a mixture of collies and terriers - were left to fight over food, and 21 were in such poor condition that the RSPCA had to destroy them on welfare grounds. Of the cats found in the house, two were already dead and a further 16 also had to be put to sleep. The discovery of so many animals in the house and pigs, cattle, and sheep in dreadful conditions triggered a huge joint investigation by Cumbria Trading Standards and the RSPCA, which drafted in 10 inspectors from across the north west. Describing the house, prosecution barrister Alison Whalley told district judge Gerald Chalk: 'The conditions could only be described as appalling, and fit for neither man nor beast.' At Carlisle Magistrates’ Court, the couple entered guilty pleas to animal welfare charges but the court accepted their crimes were the result of neglect, rather than a desire to cause suffering. They were given suspended 160 day jail sentences, banned from keeping any animals for life, and told to pay legal costs totalling £12,000 each. Carlisle Magistrates' Court heard that Robert Park, 54, and his 57-year-old wife Linda Faulder-Park, were living with 70 dogs as an indoor feral pack when the house was raided . RSPCA inspectors were stunned at the squalor the couple lived in at their Cumbria farmhouse - amongst dozens of dogs, cats, cattle, sheep and pigs . Describing the house, prosecution barrister Alison Whalley told district judge Gerald Chalk: 'The conditions could only be described as appalling, and fit for neither man nor beast.' Speaking after the case, RSPCA inspector Chris Towler told of the day in January this year when he and his fellow inspector Martyn Fletcher were called to the couple’s dilapidated Bridge Farm, at Low Row, Scales, near Aspatria. He said: 'The police had visited the farm on an unrelated investigation. Nothing could have prepared us for what we found inside this farmhouse. 'It was one of the worst scenes I have come across in my 27 years with the RSPCA. It wasn’t just the deprivation; it was the sheer number of domestic animals in there. 'There were 91 in total. As well as the 20 cats and 73 dogs, we found a duck, a cockerel, and a cockatiel. 'The conditions inside the house were appalling: Filthy and in a state of disrepair.' The dogs - which included five puppies - were living in groups in various rooms. Only one of the rooms in the house, said Mr Towler, was fit for human habitation. This cat was among the 100 found living in the Cumbria farmhouse . The discovery of so many animals in the house triggered a huge joint investigation by Cumbria Trading Standards and the RSPCA . The couple admitted six animal welfare offences relating to their 35 sheep, 36 pigs, and 45 cattle, all of which had to be destroyed . The weaker of the dogs were unable to compete for the food and water the couple were putting out. The couple were unaware two of their cats were lying dead in one room. Four dogs were found locked in a dark barn, its floor covered in what Mr Towler described as a sludge of faeces and mud. One of the dogs had learned to clamber up a fence so that it could drink water from a lopsided gutter. Most of the cats were being kept in what RSPCA officials said were shocking conditions in a makeshift pen, its floor soaking wet. In court, the couple’s barrister Keith Thomas explained that they had got into the habit of taking in stray dogs, some of which bred with others already in the house. Linda Park suffered a disability and was unable to help her husband on the farm and because he worked elsewhere milking cows, had less time to care for the animals. Judge Gerald Chalk described the couple¿s offences as 'truly shocking' Angela Jones, trading standards service manager with Cumbria County Council, said: 'This has been a distressing case for all involved.' Mr Thomas conceded there were far too many animals for the couple to care for. Mr Towler said he accepted that the Parks had not intentionally set out to cause suffering to their animals. He added: 'The whole situation was very sad in pure human terms. The house was generally filthy, and in my view not fit for habitation, for either this couple or their animals. 'They should have asked for help. Hopefully now they will get the help they need.' The couple pleaded guilty to 10 charges brought by the RSPCA - two of causing unnecessary suffering, and the remainder of failing to provide adequately for the needs of their animals. They also admitted six animal welfare offences relating to their 35 sheep, 36 pigs, and 45 cattle, all of which had to be destroyed. Judge Gerald Chalk described the couple’s offences as 'truly shocking,' saying: 'I’m of the view it was due to you closing your eyes to the obvious and you chose to ignore it but it was not deliberate. 'I don’t think it safe for you to care for animals in the future.' Angela Jones, trading standards service manager with Cumbria County Council, said: 'This has been a distressing case for all involved, not least Robert and Linda Park who were struggling to look after both themselves and their animals during the bitterly cold winter of 2011/12. 'It gives us no pleasure to see anyone lose the privilege to keep livestock or pets. 'But the severity of this sentence reinforces the clear duty on all owners to ensure the welfare of animals.' The couple must also observe a 9pm and 6am curfew for the next six weeks. Robert Park will be allowed to continue working as a milker on a local farm.","RSPCA also find dozens .

Barack Obama took to the campaign trail with former President Bill Clinton last night as he appeared to take the lead with early voters in key states just days before the election. Both former presidents and Virginia governor Tim Kane took tot he stage in the Virginia clad in matching black jackets  in front of 24,000 supporters as Election Day forecasters give Obama early voters' weight in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio. With Virginia being one of the most closely contested battleground states, the sky was the limit for his supporters and those left to be swayed. Scroll down for video . Hand-in-hand: In the final hours of a four-state campaign day, President Barack Obama was joined by former President Bill Clinton, left, and former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine on Saturday . President Barack Obama, right, is introduced by former President Bill Clinton, left, at a campaign event at Jiffy Lube Live, in Bristow, Virginia yesterday . Early lean: With just days to go early voting in key states shows Obama having a lead against his challenger Governor Mitt Romney which could prove crucial in the election's outcome . 'As you see, I have given my voice in . the service of my president,' Clinton told the crowd with a hoarse . voice but same twinkle in his eye according to NBC. 'He has been traveling all across the . country for this campaign. He's been laying out the stakes so well that . our team basically calls him the ""Secretary of Explaining Stuff,""' Obama said back on the former president. 'He was a great president; he has been a great friend,' he added. Despite a presumptive advantage in early voters, it isn't as big as the one he had over John McCain four years ago. That swap has given Republican . challenger Mitt ROmney's campaign hope that the former Massachusetts . governor can erase the gap when people vote on Tuesday. More than 27 million people have . already voted in 34 states and the District of Columbia. No votes will . be counted until Election Day but several battleground states are . releasing the party affiliation of people who have voted early. So far, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio - five states that could decide the election, if they voted the same way. Republicans have the edge in Colorado, which Obama won in 2008. Final push: With just days to go before the election President Obama is seen rallying a crowd at a campaign event in Milwaukee on Saturday . Fight on: Seen also on Saturday but in Englewood, Colorado Romney fought for his own footing with his campaign estimating themselves being stronger than Obama's first opponent of John McCain in 2008 . Obama dominated early voting in 2008, . building up such big leads in Colorado, Florida, Iowa and North . Carolina that he won each state despite losing the Election Day vote, . according to voting data compiled by The Associated Press. 'In . 2008, the McCain campaign didn't have any mobilization in place to . really do early voting,' said Michael McDonald, an early voting expert . at George Mason University who tallies voting statistics for the United . States Elections Project. 'This time around the Romney campaign is not . making the same mistake as the McCain campaign did.' McDonald . said he sees a shift toward Republicans among early voters, which could . make a difference in North Carolina, which Obama won by the slimmest of . margins in 2008, only 14,000 votes. The Republican shift, however, . might not be enough to wipe out Obama's advantage in Iowa and Nevada, . which Obama won more comfortably in 2008. In Colorado, Florida and Ohio, get ready for a long night of vote counting on Tuesday. Romney's campaign aides say they are doing so much better than McCain did four years ago that Romney is in great shape to overtake Obama in many of the most competitive states. 'They are underperforming what their . 2008 numbers were and we are overperforming where we were in 2008,' said . Rich Beeson, Romney's political director. 'We feel very good heading . into the Tuesday election.' Forecast: More than 27 million people have already voted in 34 states and the District of Columbia, with Obama's team claiming to hold the majority of votes in key states . Obama's campaign counters that Romney can't win the presidency simply by doing better than McCain. 'It's . not about whether or not they're doing better than John McCain did,' said Jeremy Bird, Obama's national field director. 'It's about whether . or not they're doing better than us.' About 35 per cent of voters are expected to cast ballots before Tuesday, either by mail or in person. Voters always can cross party lines when they vote for any office, and there are enough independent voters in many states to swing the election, if enough of them vote the same way. Still, both campaigns are following the early voting numbers closely, using them to gauge their progress and plan their Election Day strategies. A look at early voting in the tightest states: . Colorado: . About . 1.6 million people have voted, and Republicans outnumber Democrats 37 . per cent to 35 per cent. Those numbers are a reversal from four years . ago at this time. Inevitably, Obama won the early vote by 9 percentage . points in 2008, giving him a big enough cushion to win the state, . despite narrowly losing the Election Day vote. Early . voting in Colorado is expected to account for about 80 per cent of all . votes cast, giving it more weight than in other states. Check list: Democratic voters currently outnumber Republicans in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio but different from 2008's election, are without Colorado . Florida: . About 3.9 million people have voted, and 43 per cent were Democrats and 40 per cent were Republicans. For years ago at this time, Democratic early voters had a 9 percentage point lead over Republicans. Obama won Florida's early vote by 10 percentage points in 2008, getting 400,000 more early votes than McCain, enough to offset McCain's advantage on Election Day. Tight race: With a potential close call in ballots, Colorado, Florida and Ohio can soon get ready for a long night of vote counting on Tuesday . In Florida, Republicans have . historically done better among people who vote by mail, while Democrats . have done better among people who vote early in person. For 2012, . Florida's Republican-led Legislature reduced the number of in-person . early voting days from 14 to eight. The Obama campaign responded by encouraging more supporters to vote by mail, and Democrats were able to narrow the gap among mail ballots. Democrats quickly took the lead among all early voters, once in-person early voting started. But the margins are slim. The Obama campaign acknowledges it must do better among Florida's Election Day voters than Obama did on 2008, when McCain won the Election Day vote by 5 percentage points. Iowa: . About 614,000 people have voted, already exceeding Iowa's total number of early votes in 2008. So far this year, 43 per cent of early voters were Democrats and 32 per cent were Republicans. Four years ago, Obama won the early vote in Iowa by a whopping 27 percentage points, 63 per cent to 36 per cent. McCain, meanwhile, won the Election Day vote by about 1,800 votes - less than a percentage point. Together, they added up to a 10-point victory for Obama. Romney's campaign argues that Democrats always do better among early voters in Iowa while Republicans do better among Election Day voters, even when President George W. Bush narrowly carried the state in 2004. Obama's campaign counters that with early voting on the rise, Romney will be left with fewer Election Day voters to make up the difference. Strategics: Both campaigns are following the early voting numbers closely, using them to gauge their progress and plan their Election Day strategies . Nevada: . About 628,000 people have voted, and 44 per cent were Democrats and 37 per cent were Republicans. Four years ago, Obama won Nevada's early vote big, 59 per cent to 39 per cent. Obama also won Nevada's Election Day vote on his way to a comfortable 13-point win over McCain. The Romney campaign argues that Obama isn't doing nearly as well among early voters in Nevada as he did in 2008. The Obama campaign argues that it doesn't have to. North Carolina: . About 2.5 million people have voted, and 48 per cent of them were Democrats and 32 per cent of them were Republicans. Four years ago at this time, Democrats had a slightly larger lead over Republicans, and Obama won the early vote by 11 percentage points. Obama lost the Election Day Vote by 17 percentage points in 2008. But the early vote was much bigger than the Election Day vote, resulting in Obama's narrow win. Obama's campaign cites the big lead for Democrats among early voters, while Romney's campaign argues that even a small shift toward the Republicans could flip the state to Romney. Ohio: . More than 1.6 million people have voted, and 29 per cent were Democrats and 23 per cent were Republicans. Forty-seven per cent were unaffiliated, more than enough voters to swing the state to either candidate. Ohio may once again be pivotal in the race for the presidency. Unfortunately, Ohio's early voting data is limited. Party affiliation in Ohio is based on the last primary in which a voter participated, so new voters and those who don't vote in primaries are listed as unaffiliated. In 2008, Obama won Ohio by 5 percentage points.","Forecast of early voters in key states of Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio show a lean toward President Obama .

"Pratt alleges the TV star took teenage girls to the hospital in early hours . By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 04:22 EST, 31 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:00 EST, 31 October 2012 . Jimmy Savile was given the keys to a private hospital block where he would regularly take teenage girls, a former porter has claimed. Former Leeds  General Infirmary porter Terry Pratt claims late Jim'll Fix It star was handed a key to the nurses' accommodation building at the hospital  'by a lad on the front desk' several times a month during the late 1980s. The ex-worker told the BBC that Savile would arrive with the girls in the early hours of the morning and then leave before dawn. Scroll down for video . Fresh revelations: Former hospital porter Terry Pratt claims Jimmy Savile was given the keys to nurses' accommodation at Leeds General Infirmary where he would take teenage girls in the middle of the night . Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the television and radio star's activities, and he is now believed to have been of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims. Mr Pratt said he became suspicious when Savile began arriving in the middle of the night with different girls who seemed 'star-struck' and were 'not streetwise'. He told the BBC: 'He would go up and see the lad on the desk [and he would say] ""Here's the key Jim, make sure I get it back"". 'He'd take the key and the two of them would look through the doorway... he would walk out and the two women would follow him towards the nurses' home.' 'He was going into a property he had no right to go into. He wasn't a doctor and he wasn't a nurse.' He added that the celebrity, who was a volunteer and fundraiser for the hospital, would make several late-night visits a month where he would ask for the key to the accommodation block, spend a few hours there and then leave at 5am. Volunteer: Sir Jimmy Savile did shifts as a porter at the Yorkshire infirmary from 1968 . 'Shocked': Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it was shocked at the new allegations at Leeds General Infirmary, pictured above . Mr Pratt said he became suspicious when . Savile began arriving in the middle of the night with different girls . who seemed 'star-struck' and were 'not streetwise'. 'You'd see their eyes watching him - everything he did,' he said. But nobody questioned the late presenter's behaviour at the time, he . said, adding: 'We looked at him as a sort of film star, a cult figure.' But Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it believed Mr Pratt was wrong because he was not working at Leeds General Infirmary at the time referred to. It said: 'We are concerned to hear the allegations which have been made by Mr Pratt and have been quoted widely in the media. Regular visitor: Jimmy Savile pictured visiting the patients and staff at Leeds General Infirmary in 1972 . 'We have investigated his claims today with other staff who were around at Leeds General Infirmary at the time and we believe he is mistaken in his comments. 'Mr Pratt appears to have been talking about a period in the 1980s before he started work at the hospital in 1990 and not from first-hand knowledge. 'The assurance we have been given is that the porters did not have a key to unlock the nurses' home. The building had a warden on duty 24 hours a day and we understand access was very strictly controlled to protect the staff living there. 'The accusations against Savile are serious and naturally are of great concern. The police are continuing their national investigation and anyone with evidence should speak to them.' It comes as a close friend of Jimmy Savile today said . he feels guilty for failing to notice the abuse as police investigate 300 potential victims who may have . fallen prey to Savile. DJ . Dave Eager, who worked with Savile in the 1960s, wore a ‘Jimmy’s eager . helper’ jumper and ‘Jim fixed it for me’ badge to Savile’s funeral last . year. But the 64-year-old . has confessed that he blames himself for failing to notice any of the . alleged abuse during their 40-year friendship. Mr Eager told The Sun that he knew nothing of the abuse allegedly done by Savile. He said: ‘I just don’t recognise this so you end up blaming yourself. ‘I just don’t know what’s going on. I feel I should be punished. I’m very distressed about the whole thing.’ Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry as part of the investigation while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse. It is also looking at the decision-making process that saw a Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities shelved. 'Eager helper': Dave Eager was so distraught at Savile's funeral in November last year he wore a 'Jim fixed it for me' badge and jumper but has since said he feels guilty for failing to notice any of the alleged abuse done by Savile during their 40-year friendship . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said 'heads will need to roll' at the BBC if it is discovered that abuse was ignored. 'Serious questions need to be asked . and if after we find out what's happened, it's clear that people have . turned a blind eye or, worse still, connived with it, then of course . they're going to have to be held to account and - if that turns out to . be the case - heads will need to roll of course,' he told ITV's The . Agenda. Earlier this week it emerged that Savile was barred from any involvement with the BBC's Children In Need charity. In connection: Former pop star Gary Glitter returns home after he was arrested and questioned by police over the weekend in connection with the Savile investigation . Sir Roger Jones, a former chairman of . the charity, said he had been uncomfortable about allowing Savile to . have any association with their work. Although he had 'no evidence' that . Savile was up to anything, he said he behaved strangely, adding: 'I . think we all recognised he was a pretty creepy sort of character.'

"By . Sam Adams . PUBLISHED: . 06:36 EST, 9 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:08 EST, 9 November 2012 . Iraq has seen its fair share of violence in recent years - but the rape and murder of two young girls has provoked a fresh wave of shock and revulsion across the country. The children, aged four and five, were kidnapped, . repeatedly sexually assaulted and then bludgeoned to death in two separate incidents . near the southern city of Basra. The brutal crimes have struck a nerve, even in a nation that has seen a horrific amount of bloodshed during the past decade. Killer: Akram al-Mayahi, has been convicted of raping and killing four-year-old Banin Haider in the town of Zubair, near Basra in Iraq . Horror: Four-year old Banin Haider (left) and Abeer Ali, 5 (right), were raped and murdered in separate incidents during a two-month period . Despite a conviction in one case, a . handful of arrests in the other and beefed up police patrols in the . city, families in Basra remain on edge following the murders of four-year-old Banin Haider and five-year-old Abeer Ali during a two-month period. Many parents in and around the . city will not let their children go to school alone or even play outside because of fears for their safety. Others are making plans to . leave Basra altogether, saying they have lost confidence in the security . forces' ability to keep children safe. 'These inhuman crimes make me think of . the safety of my children,' said Hazim Sharif, 38, a government . employee and father of four. 'I do not trust the security forces any . more. I have to protect my family by myself.' To many in Iraq, the murders mark a . new, more menacing type of violence than the country has previously . encountered — at least in public. Crime: A member of Zubair city council inspects a destroyed checkpoint building formerly belonging to the Iraqi army, where four-year old Banin Haider was raped and murdered . Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, is . considerably safer than Baghdad, and the recent attacks are seen as a . particularly dark spot on an otherwise relatively quiet and stable . province. The city of about 1 million and its surrounding province, . which goes by the same name, is Iraq's main oil industry hub. The region . is generally poorer and shabbier than the capital, but it is slowly . beginning to flourish as international companies move in, attracted by . the region's lucrative oil fields. Banin was kidnapped on August 16 in Zubair, . a rundown town just outside the city of Basra. Her family, from the . nearby province of Dhi Qar, had come to town to visit relatives. Police later found her body in a . derelict area with her hands and legs bound. She was raped multiple . times, and her head was smashed by what was believed to be a large . brick, according to authorities. Fearful: Hazim Sharif escorts his daughters to school in Basra following the murders. Many parents in the area are now worried for their children's safety. (Neither Mr Sharif or his family have any connection with the crimes) An off-duty soldier assigned to a . nearby army base, Akram al-Mayahi, was arrested in connection with . Banin's murder. He was found guilty on October 22 and sentenced to death . for abusing and killing the girl, said judge Jassim al-Moussawi, the . spokesman for the Basra Federal Appeals Court. Banin's family wants al-Mayahi to be . executed publically at the scene of the crime as a deterrent, according to reports. The sentence has yet to be carried out. The other young girl, Abeer, also came . from Dhi Qar province, a relatively poor part of Iraq that many . residents travel from in search of work, often for weeks at a time. She . was abducted on October 11 while her family attended a wedding not far from . the scene of Banin's murder. Her body was found 12 hours later bearing similar signs of trauma to the previous victim, . though Abeer was also strangled with a shoelace, officials said. Industry: Many Iraqis travel to the oil-rich Basra area from other parts of the country to work in the lucrative oil industry . Authorities later determined that the . suspected kidnapper phoned nine friends and invited them to take part in . the rape. So far, eight people have been arrested and have confessed to the crime. The case has yet to go to trial because the investigation is still under . way. Authorities believe the soldier convicted in Banin's killing is . not connected to Abeer's murder. 'I cannot rest or sleep while these . criminals are still eating, drinking and sleeping in prison. They should . be executed immediately,' said Abeer's father, Ali Abid, a 30-year-old . construction worker and father of four other daughters. 'Iraq has become . like a jungle where monsters maul the bodies of the poor people.' Reports of the two cases have sent a wave of fear through the streets of Basra. In an attempt to calm public opinion, security forces have started deploying more police patrols, particularly near schools. Some officials blame a rise in drug . use for the crimes, although many Basra residents see the focus on . drugs as misplaced. They instead criticize Iraq's government and . security forces for failing to provide adequate security.","Four-year old Banin Haider and Abeer Ali, 5, raped and killed in separate attacks over two-month period .

A Republican dissident who has been cleared of five murder charges in 19 years was arrested yesterday over the assassination of Northern Ireland prison officer David Black. Colin Duffy was one of two men held in the Lurgan area of County Armagh by detectives investigating the shooting of the 52-year-old father-of-two as he drove to work on Thursday morning. Since 1993 Duffy, 44, has faced five murder charges, including the shooting of two uniformed British soldiers collecting pizzas outside their barracks in Antrim. It comes a few months after Duffy was found not guilty of the murders of soldiers Patrick . Azimkar and Mark Quinsey, who were gunned down in March 2009 at the . gates of their barracks in Antrim. Arrested: Dissident republican Colin Duffy, left, was today detained by police investigating the murder of  Northern Ireland prison officer David Black, right, who was shot dead in an ambush on his way to work . Being questioned: Colin Duffy and another man were both detained by officers in Lurgan, Co Armagh, situated just a few miles from where Mr Black was assassinated . A leading Republican for more than 20 . years, Mr Duffy has been a target for loyalists. He has accused the . police of waging a vendetta against him. The family of Mr Black have . appealed for no retaliation ‘from any quarter’. Yesterday, both Duffy and a 31-year-old man were detained by officers in Lurgan, Co Armagh, just miles from where Mr Black was assassinated. Mr Black was on his way to work at the high security . Maghaberry Prison in County Antrim - where extremists have been involved . in protests against jail conditions - when he was ambushed. Several shots were fired at close range and Mr Black’s car veered into a ditch. He is believed to have died immediately. It is understood his service stretched back as far as the 1981 IRA hunger strike inside the Maze prison. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers condemned the 'cowardly and evil' attack when she addressed the House of Commons this morning. She told the Commons that yesterday's killing showed the threat posed by dissident republicans, adding: 'The . numbers involved in terrorism activities are small, but these groupings . have the capability and they have lethal intent. 'They can still ruin lives despite their lack of support in the community, so we remain vigilant in the face of this terrorist threat'. She added that the Government will do 'whatever we can' to help bring prison officer David Black's killers to justice. 'Vigilant': Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers told the House of Commons the Government will remain 'vigilant in the face of this terrorist threat' And Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams today spoke out against the killing . He said: 'Whatever position individuals may hold on the efficacy or . otherwise of armed struggle in the past, there is no rationale for it in . the present circumstances. 'There is no rationale now for the existence of armed groups or for . carrying out armed actions in any part of this country. Those involved . have no popular support or political strategy. 'There may be a small number of people who tolerate the existence of . militarist groups or their violent actions or who provide shelter, . resources or facilities to them. They need to reflect on what they are . doing. These groups are not the IRA and nobody should be under any . illusion about that. 'Those organisations that are politically associated with armed groups . have failed to outline how these actions advance republican objectives. 'On the contrary, they play into the hands of those in the British . system who are opposed to the peace process and to its potential for . achieving a united Ireland.' 'Murdered': Police at the scene on the M1 in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, where prison officer David Black was shot dead by suspected dissident republicans as he drove along the motorway . 'Hallmarks of dissident republicans': The gunman drew up alongside Mr Black's Audi and fired shots which sent him careering off the motorway and into a deep drainage ditch . His statement comes after widespread . condemnation of the attack last night with First Minister Peter Robinson branding . those responsible ‘flat earth fanatics’ and ‘deviants’. His deputy, . Martin McGuinness, called it a ‘pointless and futile killing’. Northern Ireland Chief Constable Matt . Baggott said the attack – on the M1 between Portadown and Lurgan at . 7.30am yesterday morning – was ‘completely senseless’. He added: ‘It demonstrates the . recklessness and the ruthlessness of those who still oppose peace. We . cannot allow these people to succeed and we won’t.’ David Cameron paid tribute to Mr Black and insisted that his killers would be brought to justice. He said: 'First and foremost, this is . a dreadful tragedy for the family and friends of David Black, who has . been so brutally murdered as he went about his work keeping the people . of Northern Ireland safe. My heart goes out to them. 'The Government I lead will do whatever we can to help the PSNI bring the perpetrators to justice. 'These killers will not succeed in denying the people of Northern Ireland the peaceful, shared future they so desperately want.' 'This . has all the hallmarks of dissident republicans. This was just a brutal . attack and we need the public's support to be able to solve it as . quickly as possible. 'David was dedicated, a person keeping people safe, and we need to respect that and recognise that.' Friends of Mr Black – a long-standing member of the Orange Order – also spoke of their revulsion at the killing. Reverend Tom Greer, who spent most of . the day at the Black family home near Cookstown, County Tyrone, said: . ‘David Black was a true gentleman… totally devoted to his wife, children . Kyle, 20, and Kyra, 17, and elderly parents who live close by. His wife . is absolutely broken and devastated.’ Mr Black was one of hundreds of officers who had applied for the Prison Service redundancy scheme. There has been a general threat . against prison officers for a number of years and it was clear from . intelligence that some individual prison officers were being targeted. Finlay Spratt, the head of the Prison . Officers’ Association, criticised the security provisions offered to . prison officers since the Troubles ended. ‘They have stripped away all . the security around prison officers,’ he said. 'They treat us now as if we live in normal society.' Assistant Chief Constable Drew Harris . said the gunman who shot Mr Black was in a Toyota Camry with a Dublin registration. 'From that car, it appears that shots were fired at Mr Black,' he said. 'Almost immediately his car veered . off the motorway and into a pretty deep drainage ditch. Mr Black appears . to have sustained very serious and probably fatal gunshot wounds.' Mr Harris added: 'The motive behind this is sheer terror.' 'Motive of killing was sheer terror': Mr Black (not pictured) worked at top-security Maghaberry jail (above) near Lisburn, where dissident republicans have been involved in long-running protests against jail conditions . 'A very good officer': Mr Black had more than 30 years' service in the Prison Service and was approaching retirement. Pictured is Maghaberry Prison . The shooting happened at the same time as a major security alert further along the . motorway at a shopping centre at Sprucefield, near Lisburn, where bomb . disposal experts were called in to check a car. It is believed this vehicle might have been linked to the shooting, according to some sources. 'Dreadful tragedy': David Cameron has paid tribute to Mr Black and insisted the killers will be brought to justice . Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa . Villiers warned just two days ago that the threat from dissident republicans in Northern . Ireland remained severe. Forty-one dissident republicans are in . Maghaberry Prison. The majority are involved in a no-wash protest . against the practice of strip searching at the jail. Some prisoners are . not shaving, some are not washing and some are throwing human waste out . on to the corridor rather than using toilets. Since the Provisional IRA ceasefires . of the 1990s, hard-liners have coalesced into various factions. Only . months after the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998 one . of the radical groups – the Real IRA – killed 29 people in a bomb in . Omagh. In July this year the Real IRA and . Republican Action Against Drugs announced they had joined forces along . with a number of unaffiliated individuals and would now be known as the . ‘IRA’. Security chiefs believe the new group was responsible for two failed bombing bids in Londonderry in September. The last security force member  murdered was 25-year-old policeman Ronan Kerr in April 2011. The recently qualified Roman Catholic . recruit to the Police Service of Northern Ireland died in a booby trap . car bomb attack at his home in Omagh. The attack was claimed by individuals . who said they were former members of the Provisional IRA.

A match between two church sides in a Christian football league set up to promote peace and understanding ended in a mass brawl after a row over a penalty. Five footballers are now facing year-long bans from their clubs after the match had to be called to a halt for the first time in the West Midlands Christian League's history. Troubled flared in the 47th minute of the game between teams Zion Athletic and Common Ground United last weekend. Scene of the match: Football teams not connected to the incident pictured playing on Churchfields Playing Fields where a match between two West Midlands Christian Football league ended in a mass brawl . A Common Ground player was sent off for what the FA described as ‘serious foul play’ when his team were trailing to Zion. But when Zion, who were leading 5-1, were then awarded a 60th minute penalty the Common Ground players saw red and fighting broke out. A Zion player is said to have smiled and ‘made a remark’ about the penalty decision before being struck by his Common Ground opponent. And the Common Ground player who had been sent off just minutes earlier ran back on to the pitch from the changing rooms to join the fight. Five Common Ground players in total were put on ‘violent conduct’ charges with one Zion player also booked over ‘improper conduct’. Boys in blue: One member of the Zion Athletic football team, part of the West Midlands Christian League, has been booked for 'improper conduct' Strict rules: Five team members from Common Ground United have been charged with violent conduct during a football match . Birmingham County FA discipline manager Mike Fellows said he could not recall there ever being a game in the Christian League called off for bad behaviour. He said: 'I cannot recall a game ever being abandoned in the Christian League, certainly not due to violence. It’s so strict that even swearing is banned. 'Referees are under instruction to send players off if any of them swears. 'A Common Ground player was sent off for serious foul play in the 47th minute, but the game carried on without problems. 'But then, in the 60th minute, the score was 5-1 to Zion and a penalty was awarded to them. An incident happened between one player and another where one received a few punches. The trouble kicked off. 'The referee reported that Common Ground players started throwing punches at Zion Athletic players. It got to the situation that the two official assistant referees agreed that they would have to abandon the game.' The league has strict rules that state players are expected to behave both on and off the pitch in a manner ‘morally, decently and ethically sound of action and speech, honouring the name of Jesus Christ’. Waiting game: The Church of Zion Athletic, which will have to wait to find out if it will receive the full three league points for the match . Punishment: The Common Ground United football team's bus, pictured outside their church embassy, as the team waits to find out if they will have league points deducted after the game . Bad language in the league leads to an automatic red card and ungentlemanly conduct, such as spitting or arguing, is frowned upon. Players are expected to turn the other cheek if confronted. Mr Fellows added: 'It ended with five Common Ground players facing violent conduct charges, one of them also on a serious misconduct charge for violence. 'The player had already been sent off but when this all cracked off, he came back onto the pitch from the changing rooms and got himself heavily involved.' All the players involved in the fight face at least a three-match suspension. An FA panel will convene to decide on sanctions against the footballer on the most serious charge. Mr Fellows said Zion Athletic had one team member charged with improper conduct although the referees report indicates that their players were largely defending themselves and trying to break it up. He said: 'The West Midlands Christian League has a reputation as a good league, which is well run and very strict.' The league will now decide if Zion are given the full three points for the match and if Common Ground will have points deducted. Common Ground founder Tony Sadla, a deacon at Living Stones of Christ Embassy church, in Perry Barr, Birmingham, claimed he players had been provoked. Ethos: The West Midlands Christian Football League was set up to honour 'the name of Jesus' Tough game: Common Ground United had been given five red cards before the fight kicked off (stock image) He said: 'It’s devastating and shocking and we don’t condone this sort of behaviour. But Common Ground got the raw end of the deal with five red cards whereas Zion Athletic seemed to be the ones who escaped. 'When a penalty was awarded to Zion, their player started smiling and laughing, and made a remark. 'The guy who was involved in hitting him made a remark back and smiled and laughed. From there it just kicked off, we tried to stop it and pull them apart. 'Some of our players have had a bad course in life. By going to church, you don’t expect it to change overnight. Sometimes they go off the rails.' But Mr Sadla said the club would accept whatever punishment was doled out by the FA and the league. Zion Athletic manager Jonathan Allen said neither he or Mr Sadla were proud of what happened. He said: 'We are just thankful no one was seriously hurt. As a manager I was pleased by my players’ response to the aggressive and violent behaviour of the opposition, by not fuelling a situation that could have been far worse. 'Violence has no place on a football pitch and we hope that the league will do all that they can to prevent a recurrence of this incident and ensure the very good discipline we have to come to enjoy each Saturday continues.” Christian League secretary Neil Kovacs said: 'It is very much unprecedented, I’m meeting on Tuesday with both clubs, and actions will be prompt and severe, I would imagine. I would think the league ban for the players will be a minimum of a year.'","Fight over a penalty forced football match to be called off for the first time in the West Midlands Christian League's history .

In the spotlight: John Obi Mikel leaves Chelsea training on Tuesday as the row hangs over the club . Clattenburg, who has been taken off . the Premier League match list this weekend, has protested his innocence . since his controversial handling of Chelsea’s 3-2 defeat by Manchester . United on Sunday. Serbian police have charged two England footballers with 'violence' following an under-21 international between England and Serbia that led to ugly scenes. No charges were levelled against Serbian fans making racist chants at England players or for causing a brawl. Kevin Miles of the Football Supporters' Federations said the 'racial abuse of England players was disgraceful' and he called on Serbia to deal with those responsible with 'vigour'. A further two officials from Stuart Pearce's backroom staff were also said to have been charged after the match erupted following the final whistle. 'Further to the Serbian police announcement regarding charging English Under-21 players and staff, the Football Association can confirm it has not received any formal notification of any charges filed,' the FA said. Players and officials from both teams clashed on the pitch after Connor Wickham's late goal secured England's passage to next year's finals. The unsavoury scenes were played out amid allegations of racist chanting from the stands directed at England Under-21 full-back Danny Rose. Video footage appeared to reveal the crowd targeting Rose, who was red-carded after the whistle, and who has subsequently complained about the treatment he received. Now it has emerged that Chelsea are . fearful of the backlash if the players have misheard or misjudged . Clattenburg’s conversations during the stormy clash against United. Chelsea will proceed with the case . against the referee only if they are satisfied the claims made by the . players after the game will stand up to the FA’s burden of proof. It means they will . need to satisfy an FA commission ‘on the balance of probability’, but . they also have to negotiate the complexities of the Metropolitan . Police’s investigation into the affair. If the case breaks down, it will . reflect badly on Chelsea, who made their claims of inappropriate . language against Clattenburg in a strongly worded statement on Sunday, . two hours after the final whistle. Earlier it emerged that the club and . Mikel could be charged with misconduct by the FA after the midfielder . had to be restrained from manhandling the referee in his dressing room . following the clash. Clattenburg did not mention the . behaviour in the ‘extraordinary incident’ report he filed on Sunday, but . he now has to make a detailed statement to the FA. Clattenburg’s . assistants, Michael McDonough and Simon Long, and fourth official Mike . Jones have filed reports in which they say they did not hear the Durham . official say anything inappropriate. All four were in the referee’s room when Mikel burst in with Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay and manager Roberto Di Matteo. Mikel’s aggressive manner, along with . the behaviour of other Chelsea officials, raises the possibility of FA . action against the club. All smiles: Mikel was back with his team-mates in training amid the race row . Focus: Juan Mata drives into Chelsea's Cobham HQ ahead of Wednesday's clash with United . At the wheel: Fernando Torres was also among the players training on Tuesday morning . Both Mikel and Mata claim they have a . witness to Clattenburg’s comments, and PFA chief executive Gordon . Taylor, who has assessed both complaints, told Sportsmail the . pair have his ‘100 per cent support’. However, it has emerged that the . allegations about the referee’s comments were made only after a debate . in the Chelsea dressing room. Mikel and Ramires were discussing the . alleged use of racist language and were then quizzed by senior Chelsea . players about what they had heard before the matter was taken further. Sunday’s controversy is also the . subject of a police investigation and Clattenburg will be interviewed by . them as well as the FA, who are conducting a separate inquiry into his . handling of the clash. The PFA had a delegate at the game . and he has discussed the matter with Taylor, who said: ‘The main thing . is that the police investigation will not affect the process at the FA. ‘We are supportive of the players and . they have our 100 per cent backing. I find it difficult to believe that . Chelsea’s players would make something like this up. At the same time I . find it hard to conclude that a referee could say something of this . nature.’ Clattenburg found an unlikely ally in . Leeds manager Neil Warnock, who said he was disgusted with Chelsea for . ‘trying to kill’ the official. Warnock, preparing for Leeds’ Capital . One Cup win over Southampton last night, was critical of the . accusations against Clattenburg, who enraged Chelsea by sending off . Fernando Torres for diving when replays showed he had been fouled. Warnock said: ‘You know my . relationship with referees but I have to say I am disgusted with what’s . gone on. I’m on Clattenburg’s side. We ask referees to man-manage and . that’s what he does. I’m sure he might have said a few things but are . you telling me if Chelsea had won that game that there would have been . one iota of a complaint? ‘I hope if it is proved wrong, that . the players, whatever they alleged Mark to have said, get done as well.

An Indian woman has passed the 12-year milestone of her hunger strike and shows no signs of stopping. Irom Sharmila, of Manipur in the north east of the country, is refusing to eat in protest against a law which gives armed forces the power to kill without any ramifications. The 40-year-old is imprisoned in a secure hospital and force-fed through her nose twice a day because she refuses to eat until the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is repealed. Staunch protest: Irom Sharmila (centre) is on a hunger strike which has lasted 12 years, in protest against a draconian law which afflicts her state . This act grants armed forces immunity for any actions they carry out while operating in an area affected by rebellion. On November 2 2000 a group of soldiers from the Assam Rifles, protected by this law, shot and killed 10 civilians standing at a bus stop in Malom. They were angry after one of Manipur's rebel groups attacked one of their patrols but the people killed in retaliation were innocent and had nothing to do with the initial incident. Since then she will not eat, drink or even brush her teeth - causing her to be charged which attempting to commit suicide. Incident: Malom, where 10 innocent civilians were killed by armed forces, is in the north east of India . Unrelenting: Shamila says she has not starved herself for 12 years only to relent before her demand is met . 'That was a Thursday, the day I used to fast every week. I was so shocked by the massacre at Malom that I just decided to continue my fast unless the draconian law was repealed,' she told Al Jazeera. Suicide - which her hunger strike was tantamount to - carries a prison sentence of a year - so she is imprisoned then released and then arrested again. Known as the Iron Lady of Manipur, Sharmila holds the record for the world's longest hunger-strike. 'We are observing the spirit of Sharmila by holding a candlelit vigil,' said Sharmila's brother Singhajit on November 5, speaking to The Independent from Imphal, the capital of Manipur state. 'I last was able to see her on 9 October. She expressed to me that she would not accept any award from any organisation until her demands have been fulfilled.' She is refusing to accept any awards for her activism - instead hoping to collect them after she is released if her strike is successful. Locked away: Sharmila is kept in a guarded hospital because she refuses to eat and drink . Her brother told local media: 'After Sharmila comes out winning, she will collect it [an award] herself.' Over the past year authorities have stopped parts of Manipur from being covered by the act. Sharmila, though, will not cease her hunger strike until it is removed entirely from the state. 'I fast until the AFSPA goes. I have not wasted 12 years of my life to back off. Either my people live with respect or I don't eat,' she explained. Despite her action the issue is largely unknown among the Indian public - meaning there is no end in sight. An expert on the north east of the country, Sanjoy Hazarika, said there had not been any change. He explained: 'The cabinet has not even considered a proposal on this issue from the home ministry that was sent two years ago.'","Irom Sharmila is locked away in a guarded hospital as she continues her protest .

A man has been given a record sentence for poaching rhinoceros horns in an elaborate fraud involving ‘fake hunts’ with Thai prostitutes in South Africa. Thai national Chumlong Lemtongthai was sentenced to 40 years in jail by for shipping large quantities of rhino horns to Asia for ‘selfish financial gain’. Mr Chumlong, 44, paid the prostitutes $800 go to game farms and pose next to rhinos killed by others to provide proof the horns were souvenirs. Jailed: Thai national Chumlong Lemtongthai has been handed a record 40-year jail sentence for an elaborate fraud to ship poached rhinoceros horns to Asia . It is legal for foreigners to hunt rhinos in South Africa and ship horns overseas as long as it is for personal trophies. Judge Prince Manyathi said Chumlong fraudulently obtained hunting permits to kill 26 rhinos and then shipped most of the horns to Asia to sell for a profit. ‘The shooting was not for trophy hunting. It was for horn trading,’ Manyathi said, adding rhinos were a symbol of the country and continent. ‘We cannot allow anybody to take our pride away.’ South Africa is home to almost all of Africa's rhinos and has been in an escalating arms race with poachers who smuggle horns to China, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere. Its value there as a medicine is about $65,000 a kilogram, making it more expensive than gold. Faking it: Chumlong Lemtongthai paid Thair prostitutes $800 to take part in 'fake hunts' and pose next to dead rhinos to make it look like the horns were souvenirs . Chumlong did not make any statement when he was handed his sentence but his lawyers said they planned an appeal. Chumlong pleaded guilty on Wednesday to more than 50 counts of illegal exports and violating environmental protection laws. The environment ministry said the . sentence was the longest ever handed out for rhino poaching. It was also . harsher than the minimum term for murder. Between October 2010 and May 2011, . more than two dozen rhinos were killed on licensed 'hunts' arranged by . Chumlong. The horns were mounted as trophies and sent  to the owner of a . wildlife trading firm called Xaysavang Trading Export-Import in Laos . Illegal sales: The horns were mounted on trophies and shipped to Laos where they were allegedly sold on to south-east Asia where it is believed to be a cancer cure . In 2011, Chumlong signed a deal with the South African owner of a hunting reserve requesting horns from an additional 50 rhinos, with a street value of about $20 million, according to documents obtained by Reuters. Increased demand meant poaching has hit record levels in South Africa where, by mid-October, 455 rhinos had been killed illegally. There were 448 in 2011. Poaching increased dramatically from about 2007 as a growing affluent class in east and southeast Asia began spending more on rhino horn where it is believed by many to prevent and cure cancer. According to some studies, rhino poaching has reached a level that is causing species decline.","Thai national given record sentence for rhino poaching in South Africa .

Cesar Lucas, 16, today pleaded not guilty to rape and burglary as police released the handwritten letter, signed by the teen on the night of the alleged rape. The accused described ‘a type of disea’ which made him enter the victim’s flat after midnight on September 29. Charged: Delivery boy Cesar Lucas, 16, has pleaded not guilty to rape in court but confessed to 'sexual intercorse' with the 35-year-old in a handwritten note release by police . Cesar Lucas was working as a delivery boy for his father who owns Sal’s Pizza in the same Manhattan neighbourhood as the woman’s luxury apartment building. He was delivering a pizza to the next-door flat when he noticed that the door was slightly ajar and entered the apartment. He sexually assaulted the woman, who was sleeping in her bed with her daughter, police said. ‘I screamed,’ the 35-year-old victim told the New York Daily News. ‘It took him about 30 seconds. I said, “Get off of me,” and I pushed him. He said “I’m sorry,” and ran out,’ she said. On the stand: Cesar was delivering pizza to a neighbour in the 35-year-old woman's luxury condo complex in Manhattan when he attacked her as she slept next to her seven-year-old daughter . Lucas was picked up by police at Sal's Pizza a short time later and charged with rape and burglary. He allegedly told police he was 'feeling horny'. ‘Cesar got type of disea in a way he never had felted before,’ the poorly written note reads. ‘I unrap her from all the coushing she had on top of her. She also started to feel horny, you can say,’ Continuing to refer to himself in the third person, Lucas Cesar then describes the sexual assault, claiming he had sexual intercourse with her for two minutes before leaving the apartment – but not before rummaging through her daughter’s purse and stealing $20, according to the New York Post. The 16-year-old also claims the woman was ‘completely drunk’ ‘I really was pretty scare because she was drunk and I kind ah took advantage of her.’ Appearing at Manhattan Supreme Court today, Lucas Cesar kept his head down and stared at the table in front of him until he was asked to plea. He briefly lifted his head to speak the words ‘Not guilty’. Disturbing: The 16-year-old was on a delivery for his father's restaurant Sal's Pizza . Upon his arrest in the early hours of the 29th September, Cesar Lucas initially denied raping the woman, but admitted he had broken into the flat . ‘What's going on? Why are you arresting me? I've been arrested before for the same thing. I broke into an apartment. It's still pending. I have to go to court,’ he said according to police statements released to the New York Post. Lucas was referring to his arrest in August for breaking into a 39-year-old woman's apartment while making a delivery and stealing her wallet. He was charged with burglary, criminal possession of stolen credit cards and theft of service, to which he has pleaded not guilty . Lucas was taken into custody on September 29 where he eventually made the horrific and grammatically appalling confession to rape. He put all the blame on his ‘disea’, adding in the note that ‘Cesar didn't realized what kind of things he was about to do or make,’ He is back in court January 22.

It has a reputation as a rather po-faced Middle England town, typified by the famed fictional letter writer ‘Disgusted, of Tunbridge Wells’. Now the good burghers of the royal spa town want to inject a little cheer. In an attempt to boost tourism, councillors are considering re-branding the town Funbridge Wells.

Cultural Capital of West Kent: Councillors want to re-brand Tunbridge Wells to make it more appealing . The council says a slogan will help ‘guide its development strategy’ and are also looking to ‘make the most’ of famous quotes about Tunbridge Wells.

Another line, from 007 movie On Her Majesty’s Secret Service starring George Lazenby in which Bond girl Tracy Di Vicenzo - played by Diana Rigg - tells Bond that she ‘looks forward to living as Mr and Mrs James Bond of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells’.

Boycott: Lord Blair (right) has told voters to ignore the elections for police and crime commissioners but Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the remarks were 'silly' and former senior officers should not make them . But Mr Grayling hit back, saying: ‘I . think it’s a very silly thing to say. I’m very sorry he’s said that. Nobody should ever look upon a democratic election as something they . shouldn’t take part in. ‘Parliament has decided to put these . positions in place, I think they’ll make a real difference locally and . they will give frustrated communities unhappy about their policing . somewhere to turn to get help. We should not have a former senior police . officer making a silly comment like this.’ The commissioners – who will be paid . between £65,000 and £100,000 – will replace police authorities, taking . charge of budgets and overall strategy for the 41 forces. They will also . have the power to hire and fire chief constables, which critics warn . could politicise policing. Lord Blair, who was forced out of his . job in 2008 when Boris Johnson took over as London Mayor, said: ‘I . actually hope people don’t vote because that’s the only way to stop . this. This is not an appropriate system.’ Questions on police commissioners . He said the police areas, which are . larger than constituencies and local authorities, would be too big for . any individual to manage properly. David Cameron yesterday said the . commissioners would ‘put people in charge of policing’ and ‘bang heads . together to get things done’. He added: ‘If you want more tough . policing, you can get it. If you want coppers who are on the beat, on . your street, cracking down on anti-social behaviour, focusing on the . things you care about, then don’t just talk about it, get out on . November 15 and vote for it.’ Ministers have been accused of failing . to explain the shake-up to the public, or attracting enough . high-profile candidates. The Electoral Reform Society says turnout could . be as low as 18.5 per cent. Former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Labour MPs Tony Lloyd and Alun Michael are  the best-known candidates.","Ian Blair, who was forced out of the .

A disgraced St John's University dean who hanged herself this week after being accused of embezzlement left several suicide notes inside her Queens home promising never to forgive the school where she had worked for three decades. One of the notes left by 59-year-old Cecilia Chang at her Jamaica Estates home indicated that the dean believed the Catholic university had scapegoated her. 'You're cruel,' she wrote in Manadarin in one of the missives. Accused: Dr Cecilia Chang, who was found dead in her home on Tuesday, allegedly embezzled $1million from St John's University, where she worked . In another note, the contents of which were revealed to the New York Daily News by a source, Dr Chang said: 'i fee very painful. I want to die. I want to be with my parents.' In her final moments, the 59-year-old . dean of St. John's Asian studies turned her thoughts to her lawyer son, . Steven, writing that she would always love him and apologizing to him. Another source told the Daily News . that Dr Chang, who faced 20 years in prison if convicted, was unhappy . with her attorney. She apparently attempted to take her life twice . before her Tuesday suicide. Following her Monday court . appearance, the 59-year-old mother of two reportedly tried to slash her . wrists and gas herself in a fireplace. Tragic: Morgue workers remove the body of former St. John's dean Cecilia Chang from her home in Jamaica Estates . Upscale: Chang hung herself amid her embezzlement trial inside her lavish Jamaica Estate residence . Dr Chang committed suicide after she . went on trial for embezzling $1million and forcing students to work as . her servants, it was claimed on Tuesday. Chang’s legal troubles started when an anonymous letter written in Chinese was sent to St. John’s board of trustees, detailing her purported wrongdoings. The school had conducted an audit and alerted the Queens District Attorney's Office, which incited her for alleged embezzlement, bribery, tax evasion and making false statement to the FBI. Chang's rambling testimony on Monday has revealed that she had misappropriated school funds and spent the money on gambling, online dating services and items from Victoria’s Secret. The dean also implicated two university presidents, including the current head of St John’s, the Rev Donald Harrington, who allegedly received custom-made suits from Chang. The 59-year-old, known among her . students as the 'Dean of Mean,' was found dead in her Jamaica Estates . home one day after she testified at her own trial and denied taking . money from the university. Dr . Chang was also reportedly the prime suspect in the 1990 murder of her first . husband, Ruey Fung Tsai, who was shot three times in the back by an unknown assassin. Disastrous testimony: Dr Chang leaves a court in Brooklyn on Monday after giving evidence in her case . Dark past: Chang was a prime suspect in her husband's 1990 murder . According to the New York Post, law enforcement sources discovered her body at her home about 7.30am on Tuesday. She had been on house arrest since she was first charged with the crimes. A member of Chang's legal team knocked on her door Tuesday morning, the Post reports, to pick her up for court, got no answer and smelled gas. Authorities were called, broke into the home and discovered her body. A source told the New York Daily News she hanged herself from a folding ladder leading to the attic after she had also slashed her own wrists. On Monday, she had taken the stand at her trial and said she was innocent of allegations that she forced her students to wash her underwear by hand and cook her meals. The judge presiding over the case had her responses stricken dozens of times as she refused to answer with simple yes or no, instead giving lengthy answers. Federal Judge Sterling Johnson Jr, called her death a 'Shakespearean tragedy.' on Tuesday after he was told of her suicide. 'Dean of Mean': Dr Chang earned a reputation for treating her students like indentured servants -- making them cook for her and do her laundry . Despite a mountain of evidence that . university money had been transferred to foreign bank accounts, Dr Chang . repeatedly pleaded ignorance in court Monday. When asked why she told police that . she didn't have money in foreign bank accounts -- even though records . show she had $200,000 stashed in Hong Kong -- she claimed that she had . forgotten about that account because she had been drinking before the . police interview. She said she also forgot about $40,000 she had in another account. Dr Chang said her students cooked meals for at St John's Asia Studies Center -- but only because the students prepared food for everyone who stayed there. She said students had washed her laundry -- but only rarely. Former students of the program had testified that they felt like indentured servants because they were afraid they would lose their scholarships if they refused to do work for her. Dean's ties: Chang allegedly supplied St John's University President Rev Donald Harrington, left, with custom-made suits, and was suspected of having an affair with Queens Borough President Donald Manes, right . The New York Daily News also reports that detectives investigated Ms Chang in the murder of her husband. From his death bed, Mr Tsai reportedly wrote 'My wife did this!' when questioned by detectives. He was shot four times in the back while leaving his business in Brooklyn, New York, in 1990. He died says later and no one has every been charged in his death. Tsai's note also suggested that Dr Chang had an affair with Queens Borough President Donald Manes, a neighbor who killed himself in 1986 after being caught in a scandal.","Found dead hanging from attic ladder Tuesday morning in her Queens home .

A former wrestling coach accused of molesting young boys in a YouTube video was hunted down and arrested by authorities in Mexico, police said Wednesday night. Police arrested Herbert Ortiz, 29, of California, after a month-long search that was initiated by a YouTube video that a teenage boy posted online in which he accused Ortiz of molesting him. The teen posted the video as a cautionary note to other kids and parents who might know Ortiz, a former assistant wrestling coach at Rosemead High School in California. Alleged assault: A teenage boy says Herbert Daniel Ortiz allegedly sexually assaulted him after his mother recognised the man in a YouTube video . The Los Angeles Sheriff's department was alerted to the video by a woman from the community whose son had been coached by Ortiz. She stumbled on the video and recognized the former coach's name, then asked her 14-year-old son whether he had ever been abused by Ortiz. Her son's answer was yes. Caught: Ortiz was arrested in Mexico after he eluded authorities for a month following the allegations . Authorities removed the video from YouTube as they began an investigation into the claims. Their investigation turned up more allegations of sexual abuse dating back to 2002. At the time of their investigation, Ortiz was working as a coach at the Bad News Panthers Children's Wrestling Club in Rosemead, California. He was suspended from his job when Rosemead City officials learned of the allegations, even though he denied the claims.

He may have trust issues with women - but that certainly doesn't stop Josh Elliott from bedding them, according to new reports. It was revealed today that The Good Morning America anchor has been seen doing the 'walk of shame' from the home of WABC-TV anchor Liz Cho. The reports come just one day after the 41-year-old was described as being 'high-maintenance' and having 'serious trust issues with women stemming from a difficult childhood' - but friends of the star say he considers these rumours to be 'hurtful'. The couple were first reported to be in a relationship in September and a source told RadarOnline today: 'Josh has been seen sneaking out of Liz's apartment way early in the morning. 'It's been going on for at least three or four months, and she is in the middle of a really messy divorce.' A source told RadarOnline: 'Josh Elliott, right. has been seen sneaking out of local anchor Liz Cho's apartment way early in the morning. ' Ms Cho, 41, split from her husband Evan Gottlieb over the summer and moved out of their Yonker's mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment - where Josh has been seen leaving in the early hours of the morning. Josh is divorced from Priya Narang Elliot, the mother of his three-year-old daughter Sarina, while Ms Cho has a five-year-old daughter called Louisa Simone. Radar claimed this week: ‘It's . no secret that Josh has major, major issues with women. Josh had a . difficult childhood and as a result, has trust issues with females.

The TV hosts were first spotted having dinner together in Manhattan in September sparking rumors of a fledgling relationship, but at the time friends said it was not a serious romance and they had been on a few dates. The New York Post reported that Ms Cho and her ex-husband were embroiled in a nasty legal battle over renovation work done to their $2.2 million, nine-bedroom, four-bathroom Westchester mansion. Ms Cho split from her husband Evan Gottlieb, pictured, over the summer and moved out of their Yonker's mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment . Cathal Maguire, a Yonkers contractor, claimed that Ms Cho and Mr Gottlieb racked up a $430,875 bill for upgrades made to their home and then stiffed him for $100,875 of the work. Ms Cho and her spouse filed a counterclaim in state Supreme Court in White Plains alleging Maguire inflated prices, charged for work never done and did a shoddy job. The case is ongoing. Meanwhile, It was also claimed that Josh has repeatedly clashed with co-host Lara Spencer . over trivial issues, including how stories are covered, and the pair's off-air relationship is anything but amicable. The only woman he is said to have any time for is primary anchor Robin Roberts. 'The only female Josh hasn't fought with is Robin Roberts, because he respects her for her previous work at ESPN, the source told Radar.

"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:53 EST, 7 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 7 September 2012 . Three vicious robbers dubbed the Nappy Valley stranglers were jailed yesterday for a crime spree that targeted wealthy young mothers. The trio singled out vulnerable lone women as they walked their children in pushchairs along the street in daylight. Disguised with motorcycle helmets, hoods and balaclavas, they crept up on victims from behind and stripped expensive rings from their fingers after throttling them until they blacked out. Williams: Jailed for 17 years . Lord: Given eight and a half years . Byom: Sentenced to 21 years . Some of the victims, including one who was seven months pregnant and walking a 17-month-old baby, feared they would be killed. Detectives believe the men made more than £100,000 by selling the jewellery to a corrupt businessman in London’s Hatton Garden district. The career criminals, responsible for hundreds of violent offences between them, spent the cash on overseas holidays and shopping sprees for designer clothes. Judge Richard Southwell labelled the crimes ‘gratuitous’ and ‘motivated by pure greed’ as he jailed the men for a total of 46 years yesterday. Speaking at Kingston Crown Court, he said all three men ‘roamed as predators’ and posed a significant danger to the public. Perrie Williams, 26, terrorised the affluent Battersea, Clapham and Fulham areas of South West London – known as Nappy Valley because of its high number of families with young children – with his school friends Christopher Byom, 29, and Anton Lord, 33. After stalking their victims on motorcycle or by car, they strangled them with a potentially deadly grip on the carotid artery in their necks. Some of the women were punched and kicked, including one who needed reconstructive surgery to her jaw. The robbers, all on licence and bail for other crimes, lived on benefits and Williams even applied for a taxpayer-funded loan just a month before he travelled to Miami. They were convicted of nine robberies but detectives suspect they were behind dozens more.Byom, of Clapham, was jailed for 21 years; Williams, of Wandsworth, was jailed for 17 years and Lord, of Croydon, who pleaded guilty, was jailed for eight and a half years. It can now be revealed Williams’s life of crime began when he kidnapped a 13-year-old boy in an attack that shocked the nation and was compared to the killing of James Bulger. He and two accomplices abducted Michael Servante and strung him up by his feet before beating him to within an inch of his life in 2000 when he was just 15. But he has never been named publicly in connection with the crime because of an anonymity order imposed by an Old Bailey judge. It emerged yesterday that he began strangling and robbing minicab drivers within a month of his release from the seven-year jail term in December 2006. Last night, Michael’s mother Leisha, . 45, described Williams as ‘pure evil’ and said the special treatment he . received in court opened the door to a life of crime. She . said: ‘The criminal justice system just protected him. He was always . considered more important than us. The judge treated him with kid . gloves. ‘My son and I have to live with what he did every day. How he was allowed back on the streets I do not know.’ Off the streets: The three men were jailed for a total of 46 years at Kingston Crown Court . The court was told the gang’s crimes began between October and November 2010 when three lone women were robbed of rings, watches and purses as they walked with their children. The most shocking was an attack on a pregnant woman who was grabbed and choked in front of her baby in Clapham. Her £11,000 engagement was stolen and she came round to find her child screaming in an upturned pushchair. In another case a victim’s seven-year-old son was left with post-traumatic stress disorder. Police believe their crimes date back further to April 2009 when a woman was throttled in front of her two-year-old son. Once the men were finally in custody for the robberies police put their lifestyles under minute scrutiny and discovered they were responsible for an extraordinary crime spree. They uncovered photographs of the men posing with bundles of £50 notes and found they were linked to robberies and burglaries spanning more than a decade. Two of them admitted hundreds of crimes in a bid to wipe the slate clean. Unemployed Byom confessed to 257 crimes, including robbing bookmakers, taxi drivers and train passengers over a decade, in some cases while armed with  a gun. Lord, who wore a £4,000 Rolex watch, admitted raids on Post Offices and betting shops. Lord went to school in Wandsworth with one of the Mykoo brothers, who were jailed for life after being convicted of throttling wealthy women to within an inch of their lives. In a shockingly similar series of robberies, Daniel and Matthew Mykoo stole jewellery worth £300,000 in just four months in South West London in 2008. Among their victims were TV presenter Dani Behr and designer Nicole Farhi. Williams was also sentenced for his role in a knife-wielding gang who lured three minicab drivers and violently stole their takings in January 2007 when he was on licence from prison. After his release for the attack on Michael Servante, Williams amassed nine convictions for 16 offences linked to drugs and burglary. DC Dan Williams, who caught the robbers, said: ‘These men were animals.’ Victim: Laura Iverson struggled with two of the gang . Mother Laura Iverson feared she would die at the hands of the stranglers when she was targeted outside her home. The 38-year-old told yesterday how she felt the 'blood leaving my head' as one of the men throttled her. She believes she only survived after pulling off her diamond engagement ring while pinned to the pavement. The wine industry worker, who has since left Britain to live in New York, described how she struggled with two of the gang as she saw her children's toys through her kitchen window. Mrs Iverson, a mother of four-year-old twins, said she kicked her attackers as they failed to get the ring off because her fingers had swollen. She said: 'The guy holding my throat was clearly the more experienced of the two and he was getting agitated. 'At that point he tightened his grip around my jugular vein and I could literally feel the blood leaving my head. 'I thought I was going to pass out or worse and he said: ""Get her to take the ring off"". I pulled it off and handed it to the other guy and they were off like a shot. Mrs Iverson was attacked in Fulham, West London, on February 24 last year. She was left with two black eyes because her glasses were rammed into her face during the struggle. Speaking about her attackers she said: 'What is outrageous is that for these men this is a profession. 'The idea that you can have a profession of targeting absolutely innocent people in such a terrifying way is abhorrent.'","Perrie Williams, Christopher Byom and Anton Lord jailed for 17 years, 21 years and eight and a half years respectively .

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 04:06 EST, 8 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:29 EST, 8 November 2012 . Astronomers have discovered a planet orbiting a nearby sun at just the right distance for an Earth-like climate that could support life. The planet, which orbits a star 42 light years away, sits in the so-called Goldilocks Zone, the band around a sun where temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist. 'The star HD 40307 is a perfectly quiet old dwarf star, so there is no reason why such a planet could not sustain an Earth-like climate,' said Guillem Angla-Escude from Germany's University of Goettingen. Super-Earth: This artist's impression shows HD40307g in the foreground (on the left hand side), with its host star HD40307 and two other planets in the system (on the right-hand side) Dr Angla-Escude led the research alongside Mikko Tuomi at the University of Hertfordshire. It is one of three super-Earth type planets recently discovered orbiting HD 40307, doubling the number of known planets in that system to six. Of the new planets, the one of greatest interest is the one with the outermost orbit from the star. The planet has a mass at least seven times that of Earth but it orbits at about the same distance from its sun, meaning it receives a similar amount of solar energy as Earth gets - increasing chances it may be habitable. More than 800 planets have been discovered outside our solar system since the first was detected in the early Nineties, but only a handful of those have been in the habitable zone. Even more rare are planets in the zone that rotate, as this one does, to create a day-time and night-time, which increases the chance of an Earth-like environment. Asteroid belts like the one in our own solar system may be the key to tracking down life elsewhere in the universe, a new theory proposes. An emerging view proposes that asteroid collisions with planets may provide a boost to the birth and evolution of complex, intelligent life. This might sound surprising; asteroids are generally known - and feared for - for their potential to trigger mass extinctions after catastrophic impacts with our own planet. However, according to the theory of punctuated equilibrium, occasional asteroid impacts might accelerate the rate of evolution by disrupting ecosystems to the point where species must find new adaptation strategies. Those that don't spin are said to be tidally locked, with one half in constant darkness. 'This is the closest one to Earth in a habitable zone that is not tidally locked,' University of Hertfordshire astronomer Hugh Jones said. 'The longer orbit of the new planet means that its climate and atmosphere may be just right to support life. 'Just as Goldilocks liked her porridge to be neither too hot nor too cold but just right, this planet, or indeed any moons that it has, lie in an orbit comparable to Earth, increasing the probability of it being habitable.' The planet, named HD 40307g, is part of a system that was previously thought to have just three planets, all in orbits too close to the star to support liquid water. The astronomers made the discovery, unveiled in a research paper in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, by examining data from the HARPS spectrograph, attached to a European Southern Observatory telescope at La Silla in Chile's Atacama desert. The HARPS device is able to pick up tiny changes in the colour of the light coming from a host star as it wobbles under the gravitational influence of orbiting planets. The team used a novel technique to filter out signals caused by the host star itself. 'We pioneered new data analysis techniques including the use of the wavelength as a filter to reduce the influence of activity on the signal from this star,' said Mikko Tuomi. 'This significantly increased our sensitivity and enabled us to reveal three new planets around the star.' David Pinfield, also of the University of Hertfordshire, who leads the RoPACS network, under the auspices of which research was carried out, commented: 'Discoveries like this are really exciting. 'Such systems will be natural targets for the next generation of large telescopes, both on the ground and in space.'","HD 40307g is one of three newly found planets orbiting the same star .

Athens needs parliamentary approval for the package - which includes slashing pensions by as much as a quarter and scrapping holiday bonuses - to ensure its European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders release more £25billion of aid, much of it aimed at shoring up banks.

But a new study suggests that retiring abroad may not make as much difference as you thought. US researchers have found you're more likely to die of a heart attack in winter regardless of the climate. Retiring to a warm climate does not reduce your risk of a heart attack. New research has found you're more likely to die of a heart attack in winter, regardless of the climate . They looked at the death rates across warmer and cooler parts of America and found very little difference. The researchers, from the Good . Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, analysed four years of death certificate data from . seven states with different climates: California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Washington, Pennsylvania and . Massachusetts. Arizona, for example, is considered to have a warmer winter climate than somewhere chillier such as Massachusetts. For the years studied, in . all areas, the total deaths as well as circulatory deaths (i.e. heart and stroke-related . deaths)  rose an average of 26-36 per cent during the winter compared to the summer. What surprised the researchers was . that seasonal patterns of total and cardiac deaths were very similar in . the seven different climate patterns. It was thought colder weather would increase the risk of a heart attack, but researchers found no evidence of this . No matter where the figures were from, the pattern was the same: many more deaths in the winter than in the summer. ‘This was surprising because climate was thought to be the primary determinant of seasonal variation in death rates,’ said Bryan Schwartz, lead author of the study. 'We thought colder climates with a colder winter might have a higher increase [in heart attacks] in the wintertime or a prolonged increase in the wintertime, but that's not what we found.' Because low temperatures have often been linked with increased death rates, the researchers thought the winter peak would be more prominent in cold climates like Massachusetts, added Dr Schwartz, now a cardiology fellow at the University of New Mexico. 'But the death rates were similar. That means that temperature is a small factor - or not a factor at all.' The research was not designed to show why heart-related death rates rose across the board in the winter. But Dr Schwartz suggested that people may 'acclimate to their local climate,' making the change between summer and winter temperatures more important than how low the temperature dips in winter. Flu season - which peaks in the winter - is another factor, he added. Higher rates of respiratory infection have also been shown to raise the risk of death from a heart-related issue, which reinforces the importance of flu vaccines.","US researchers analysed heart attack death rates cross warmer and cooler parts of America and found very little difference between states .

Greek police fired water cannons and fought running battles with protesters hurling petrol bombs outside its parliament today, during the biggest rally in over a year against spending cuts the country must approve to avert bankruptcy. Nearly 100,000 Greeks waving flags and chanting 'Fight! They're drinking our blood' packed the square outside parliament as lawmakers neared a vote on unpopular budget cuts and labour reforms that the government is narrowly expected to win. Violence erupted when a handful of protesters tried to break through a barricade to enter parliament, prompting riot police to respond with teargas, stun grenades and - for the first time in an anti-austerity protest - water cannons. Protest: Tear gas thrown by police hangs over the square in front of the Greek parliament during clashes in Athens . More chaos reigned inside the assembly, where the session was briefly interrupted when parliamentary workers went on strike to protest against a clause that would have cut their salaries. In a humiliating about-face, the government was forced to cancel the measure to allow the session to resume. 'Today we vote on whether we will remain in the euro zone or return to international isolation, meet complete bankruptcy and end up in the drachma,' Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said in a final plea to lawmakers to back the cuts and unlock aid. Outside, loud booms rang out through the evening as hooded protesters hurled molotov cocktails and rocks at police. Billowing smoke and small fires dotted the square and streets next to parliament. At least 35 people were detained. There were no reports of serious injuries but at least four protesters suffered breathing problems, police said, as protesters dispersed in pouring rain. Painful measures: A protestor throws a molotov cocktail at riot police during the strike in central Athens . A petrol bomb thrown by protestors explodes close to riot police in front of the parliament building in Athens . Challenge: The vote on the deeply unpopular austerity measures represents the toughest challenge yet for Greece's fragile coalition government . The 13.5 billion euro package is expected to scrape through parliament despite its unpopularity . The anti-austerity rally appeared to be the largest in Athens since summer last year. 'These measures are killing us little by little and lawmakers in there don't give a damn,' said Maria Aliferopoulou, a 52-year-old mother of two living on 1,000 euros a month. 'They are rich, they have everything and we have nothing and are fighting for crumbs, for survival.' The vote on the painful austerity measures necessary to keep the country afloat represents the sternest test yet for Greece's fragile coalition government. The 13.5billion euro (£10.8billion) package is expected to scrape through parliament, following a day-long debate. But any defections or abstentions could severely weaken the conservative-led coalition formed in June. Greek lawmakers were locked in a fierce debate today ahead of a vote on a new austerity package needed to unlock international aid and stave off imminent bankruptcy. Outside, crowds gathered to protest against the measures . The Greek parliament has to approve the package of spending cuts and tax increases agreed with the country's international creditors so that it can continue receiving vital bailout loans. The next loan installment of 31.5billion euro (£25.3billion) out of a total of 240billion euro (£192billion) is already overdue and without it, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has said Greece will run out of euros on November 16. If the country cannot raise any more funds from elsewhere, it would quickly find it impossible to pay its debts. The government would then be forced into issuing its old currency, the drachma, to pay bills and wages. As well as pushing the country out of the 17-country group that uses the euro, this could trigger a nightmare of bank runs, hyperinflation and currency depreciation that would vapourise savings and put even the most basic goods out of the reach of many Greeks. If the country was forced into a default and began printing its own currency, the entire eurozone's finances would become increasingly shaky as markets would assume other countries in the eurozone might be the next to go. Investors would begin to pull their money out of the region or demand higher returns to keep it there. Local authority workers driving their motorbikes in protest in front of the Greek parliament in Athens . Demonstrators march during a protest against a new government austerity bill on the second day of a 48-hour general strike in Greece . The package is expected to scrape through Parliament, following a hasty one-day debate . 'We must vote in favour of the measures,' conservative New Democracy lawmaker Constantinos Tassoulas urged Parliament at the start of the stormy debate. 'It is our duty.' The measures being debated include new deep pension cuts and tax hikes, a two-year increase in the retirement age to 67, and laws that will make it easier to fire and transfer civil servants. The country is suffering a deep recession set to enter a sixth year, and record high unemployment of 25 per cent. Opposition parties accused the . government of trampling on Greece's constitution with the proposed cuts . in pensions and benefits, and complained that the several hundred . pages-long bill was too complex to be debated in a single session. 'This is blackmail,' main opposition Radical Left Coalition MP Zoi Constantopoulou said. Mr . Samaras' small Democratic Left coalition partner has said it will not . back the measures, while a handful of lawmakers from the third coalition . party, the Socialists, are expected to vote against the austerity . package.

Empty: Pedestrians cross the usually crowded Amalias Street a few hours before the planned protest in Athens . The government combined has 176 of Parliament's 300 seats, and needs a simple majority of those present to pass the bill. Without the Democratic Left, Mr Samaras' conservatives and the Socialists control 160 votes. However there is still a threat of more dissenters. While Mr Samaras has been facing increasing pressure at home, the other members of the 17-country eurozone have been doing what they can to ensure Greece stays in the currency group. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, has softened her previous tough stance toward Greece - paving the way for a deal to let Greece take more time to meet loan conditions, including painful budget cuts. Even if Parliament approves the draft legislation, it is not clear whether Greece will receive the next bailout installment in time for Mr Samaras' November 16 deadline. The payment was expected to be approved at a meeting of European finance ministers on Monday November 12. However the ministers' vote hinges on a report by the so-called troika of austerity inspectors from the European Union, IMF and European Central bank - which may not be ready in time. In this case, the EU or ECB may have to step in with some interim financing. The vote in Athens comes on the second day of a 48-hour general strike which has shut down the public administration, left hospitals functioning on emergency staff and closed schools and tax offices. All ferry and train schedules have been cancelled until Thursday, flights will be disrupted by a four-hour air traffic controllers' strike and Athens will be without public transport for most of the day. Two separate anti-austerity demonstrations are expected to converge on Parliament this afternoon, at the height of the debate on the new cutbacks. On Tuesday, more than 35,000 people marched through central Athens to express their anger at the new belt-tightening.","Violence erupted in Athens as lawmakers neared a vote on unpopular budget cuts and labour reforms .

His condition rapidly worsened and he died two days after he ruptured a blood vessel despite doctors' best efforts to save him. His father Dave, an accountant based in Didsbury, Manchester, said he never expected to say goodbye to his son. The 33-year-old said: 'He was ill with a sore throat and swollen glands so we took him to hospital. 'His throat went down and he came home, but then he got worse.

Two 'premier league' bird egg collectors have been fined for stealing hundreds of rare eggs after a two year police investigation to find the culprits. 'Obsessive' collectors Marcus Betteridge, 52, and Seymour Crang, 49, built up a unique collection of rare eggs after stealing them from the nests of birds including lesser redpolls, tree pipits and redshanks. Police raided their homes after a two year joint investigation with the RSPCA and National Wildlife Crime Unit and discovered hundreds of eggs, collecting equipment, photographs and diaries relating to activities at nest sites. Egg thieves: Egg collector Marcus Betteridge, left, was fined £1,000 for disturbing rare Dartford warblers while fellow enthusiast Seymour Crang, right, was fined £1,000 for unlawful possession of wild birds' eggs . Rare collection: A selection of wild bird eggs found at Devon home of Seymour Crang . Five eggs of a lesser redpoll, four of a tree pipit, five linnet eggs and one of a redshank, all kept in a cotton-wool lined ice cream carton were found at the home of Crang. Police also discovered a diary belonging to Mr Betteridge which contained hundreds of pages with detailed notes covering more than a decade of activity. Newton Abbot Magistrates Court heard Crang and Betteridge are 'premier league' and 'obsessional' egg thieves with a 'twisted psyche'. Quite a haul: PC Josh Marshall with some of the eggs Seymour Crang and Marcus Betteridge stole . Betteridge, 52, from Totnes, was fined £1,000 after he pleaded guilty to the disturbance of Dartford warbler's nest. The RSPB lists the Dartford warbler on its 'amber; species list, meaning it is often considered among one of the country's rarer breeds. The society's website said of the species: '(A) small, dark, long-tailed warbler is resident in the UK and has suffered in the past from severe winters. Its population crashed to a few pairs in the 1960s, since when it has gradually recovered, increasing in both numbers and range.' His co-defendant, from Bittaford near Ivybridge, was also fined £1,000 after pleading guilty to unlawful possession of wild birds' eggs. They were also ordered to pay £200 in costs each. Nigel Butt, defending, insisted the pair were just 'passionate about their subject and have had to adjust their behaviour'. Pc Josh Marshall, a wildlife crime officer, said: 'This prosecution and sentencing highlights the benefits of joint partnership working in tackling wildlife crime and the determination to bring offenders to justice. 'This should send a clear message to persons engaged in such criminal activity that they will be identified and brought to justice.' Betteridge was a former associate of Colin Watson - Britain’s most notorious egg collector - who died falling from a tree. Police caught the pair after a two year investigation into the bird egg thefts . Rare birds and their eggs are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act . Watson, 63, had a string of convictions for stealing rare eggs over a 14-year period which saw him fined £4,600. Watson was killed when he lost his footing  and fell to his death after climbing three quarters of the way up a 40ft tree in hunt of a nest.

'Our goal is to help them be successful - their voters are our users.' Sharp is confident the service will stand up during the election. 'We've been fortunate with a lot of big events this year- the Olympics, conventions and debates. 'Our . infrastructure is sound we believe - it's more about making sure we are . ready to give news organizations details on the conversation, and what . people are talking about.

David Petraeus' biographer-turned-mistress Paula Broadwell sent an anonymous email to General John Allen about Florida housewife and military social liaison Jill Kelley, as Broadwell suspected Kelley of having a romantic relationship with Petraeus as well. The cyber love triangle expanded as it was revealed today that Allen was electronically connected with Broadwell after he received an email from one of her dummy accounts. He then went on to tell Kelley, a married mom that he denies having an affair with, who in turn reported the emails to the FBI. Because of their respective involvement in the unfolding case, the Pentagon has requested access to the 20,000-30,000 pages of communications between Allen, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, and Kelley. Scroll down for video . 'Sweetheart': General John Allen (left) reportedly called Jill Kelley (right) 'sweetheart' in emails, which are now under scrutiny as he was also contacted by Petraeus' mistress from a dummy email account . In light of the extra marital affair between Broadwell and Petraeus, Pentagon spokesmen have been quick to dismiss ideas of a similar affair between Allen and Kelley though their confirmation of some 'inappropriate communication' among those thousands of pages of emails has sparked further curiosity about the nature of their relationship. One divulged example reported in The Washington Post was Allen's use of the word 'sweetheart' in referring to married mom Kelley, but a senior Pentagon official said that proves nothing as the 58-year-old general is from Virginia and the word is used in the south as a platonic phrase and not one demonstrating a romantic relationship. Mrs Kelley runs in the same social circle as both Petraeus and Allen as she serves as an unpaid social liaison for the military and often hosts events at her million-dollar home located only a couple of miles from MacDill Air Force base. Allen served there from July 2008 to June 2011. Allen, a four-star Marine general, succeeded Petraeus as the top American commander in Afghanistan in July 2011. Request: Gen Petraeus, pictured with his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell, asked her to stop when he found out she was sending threatening emails to family friend Jill Kelley . Brothers in arms: Allen (left) took over for Petraeus (center, seen with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta) as the commander of the U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan after Petraeus left to become the director of the CIA . Regarding the nature of the emails between Allen and Kelley, an unidentified senior government official would not disclose whether they were inappropriate in a sexual nature or because classified documents were disclosed. Denial: A government spokesman said that Allen never had an affair with Kelley . Both of those misgivings were found in the case of Broadwell, who was discovered to be the person behind the 'harassing' emails sent to Kelley and Allen. Broadwell entered the fold when she began writing a biography of Petraeus, and at some point in November 2011 the two began an affair. Petraeus was shocked to hear his mistress had been sending harassing emails to Mrs Kelley, who she saw as a rival for the ex-CIA boss' affections. When Kelley told Petraeus that Broadwell was behind the emails, the four-star general told his biographer to knock it off, The Washington Post reported. The . associate spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential . conversations with Petraeus. The CIA director resigned on Friday after . confessing to and apologizing for the affair. Broadwell reportedly sent the emails from dummy accounts she had set up to Mrs Kelley, FoxNews.com reported. Spooked by the bullying in her inbox, Mrs Kelley notified the FBI. Victim: Jill Kelley, a family friend of Gen Petraeus, went to the FBI after she received the threatening emails . Mistress: Paula Broadwell's close contact with Gen Petraeus raised red flags among his advisers . A government official told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.' The official added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and felt she was in a 'lovers triangle.' What followed was an intense FBI probe in which Broadwell and Petraeus - both married with two children - admitted to investigators that they had engaged in on-the-side sexual trysts. A senior federal law enforcement official told NBC News that the probe concluded on November 2, just four days before the presidential election. The network reported that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wasn't notified of the investigation until Election Day. Indiscreet: Aides have said Paula Broadwell posted Facebook postings about her adventures in Afghanistan that crossed the line into potentially leaking sensitive operational details . Insensitive: Paula Broadwell traveled frequently to interview Petraeus during his time in Afghanistan but sources said her immodest attire made her stick out like a sore thumb in the conservative culture . Skeptical: Those close to Petraeus were shocked the military chief placed so much confidence in Paula Broadwell since they say she lacked the credibility and credentials of a biographer . The emails were not the first time Broadwell had raised red flags while behind a computer. Advisers . to Petraeus had become suspicious Broadwell due to her playful Facebook . status updates they claim disclosed sensitive details about military . operations in Afghanistan. She became a cause of concern back in 2009 when those in Petraeus' inner circle saw her lighthearted postings on Facebook. Former Petraeus aides told the Washington Post that Broadwell's behavior at the time seemed odd and her closeness to the . notoriously straight-laced family man was not without controversy. Without . any specific examples of her Facebook postings, aides said they were . stunned that Broadwell was so free to describe her daily movements in . Afghanistan on the networking site, so her friends back home could . chronicle her adventures. Another social media no-no occurred . when Broadwell posted a picture to her Facebook page of Petraeus with . actress Angelina Jolie, that had been captured at his 7th floor office . at CIA headquarters, where only the official agency photographer is . allowed.

"By . James Tozer . UPDATED: . 20:09 EST, 27 February 2012 . A dying man was told to ‘pull himself together’ by a doctor when he began struggling to breathe during a severe allergic reaction, his grieving family said yesterday. John Haworth, 58, was taken ill after eating a meal of chicken and chips. But following a series of blunders during which hospital staff were said to have ‘stood by and done nothing’ he died. John and Gloria in Las Vegas 2007. The 58-year-old was left fighting for his life when he was taken ill after dinner at home - yet staff at Royal Blackburn Hospital in Lancashire, were claimed to have 'stood by and did nothing' Gloria Haworth, 68, branded the hospital a 'disgrace' after accepting an undisclosed six figure damages payout in an out of court settlement . His widow has won a six-figure compensation pay-out after NHS trust bosses admitted his treatment had been sub-standard. Fit and healthy Mr Howarth, an MoT tester, had initially experienced only a sore throat after the meal in March 2009. But when his condition worsened an ambulance was called to take him to Royal Blackburn Hospital. On arrival at the accident and emergency department at 1.40am, he was struggling to breathe and being sick. However, he and his wife Gloria were left waiting for an hour. When she . pointed out her husband’s breathing problems to the receptionist she was . told ‘the doctor will see you when it is your turn’. ‘He was getting worse and worse yet they just told us to wait with . people who had a broken leg, or who were drunk,’ Mrs Haworth said . yesterday. ‘It just felt wrong.’ Eventually the couple were moved, but were wrongly sent to the urgent . care centre where Mr Haworth saw a doctor after a  90-minute delay – but . the treatment he received shocked his wife. ‘John couldn’t speak, his throat was so swollen – yet the doctor was . asking him basic questions about his name and age,’ she said. ‘He left . the room and threw an oxygen mask at John saying, “Here, put this on”.’ Shortly afterwards the doctor – Immanuel Ajawan – returned and asked him . to lie down. ‘I told the doctor he couldn’t, because he couldn’t . breathe,’ said Mrs Haworth. ‘The doctor thought he had a throat tumour – . he hadn’t a clue. He was so rude. A spokesman for East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust has apologised and offered its sincere condolences to Mrs Haworth and her family following the care he received at the Royal Blackburn Hospital . John and Gloria in 2004. At the hospital Mrs Haworth and her husband were told to sit in the waiting room - even though Mr Haworth was struggling to breathe and being sick. They were then sent to the wrong department . ‘I said John looked as though he was having a heart attack but the . doctor said, “I can see that, but he will have to pull himself . together”. ‘The doctor then put a wooden spatula down John’s throat. I remember . John gagging and jumping up, it was awful, he kept mouthing “Help!” to . me. ‘He was choking yet the doctor disappeared again. I just ran out . screaming for help, the nurses dragged me away, and put John somewhere I . couldn’t see him.’ She was left in a room by herself. The father-of-two was pronounced dead . at 3.21am. Tests later confirmed he had suffered an acute anaphylactic . reaction resulting in a heart attack, although the cause has never been . determined. Yesterday his widow said the hospital was a disgrace. Mrs Haworth, 68, . who ran a cleaning firm in Altham, near Blackburn, accepted undisclosed . six-figure damages in an out-of-court settlement. ‘John could have and should still be here today were it not for the . conduct of the hospital staff,’ she said. ‘He was my soul mate. ‘It’s unbelievable how much the hospital has messed up my life and they probably haven’t even lost one night’s sleep over it.’ At an inquest, Dr Ajawan said he had left the cubicle twice, once to get . his stethoscope and the second time to get some adrenalin, standard . treatment for anaphylactic shock. The inquest recorded a narrative . verdict. East Lancashire Hospitals Trust has admitted that the care . provided by its staff fell below ‘expected standards’. It admitted Mr Haworth was sent to the wrong unit. Medical evidence . confirmed that when the doctor placed the spatula on Mr Haworth’s . tongue, it caused his airway to close – a mistake which probably . wouldn’t have happened in A&E. Pam Roberts, of Woodcocks Solicitors, which represented Mrs Haworth, . said no amount of money would have compensated for her loss. The trust . has apologised and said it had made major changes to its emergency care.","John Haworth told to sit in waiting room even though he was struggling to breathe and was being sick .

Raking it in: A total of 73,536 fines were handed out across Britain last year - the equivalent of 201 every day . Two hundred people a day are being fined for dropping litter – prompting fears that councils and private firms are dishing out tickets to make money. A total of 73,536 penalties were handed out across Britain last year for dropping rubbish, equivalent to 201 a day. Of that total, 63,883 were issued in England – up from just 727 in 1997. And some town halls are earning more than £650,000 a year from the tickets, a new report has revealed. An increasing number of local authorities – who get to keep more than half the money raised – are  turning to a private company run by ex-Armed Forces personnel to issue on-the-spot fines. Victims say wardens, often wearing police-style uniforms, lie in wait for smokers or follow them down the street and ‘pounce’, hitting them with a £75 fine even if they put cigarette butts down drains. One woman was wrongly convicted of giving false details after her local council tried to track her down on Facebook. And a teenage boy was accused of littering when he threw a twig into a river while playing the time-honoured game of Pooh Sticks. Others have been fined for accidentally dropping orange peel or nut shells. Josie Appleton, of the libertarian group The Manifesto Club, which compiled the new study, said: ‘Over the past few years, in some councils, litter fines have become a business. ‘When punishment is motivated by profit, it is more likely that fines will be issued for more minor but easy-to-catch offences, rather than those that are harming the public amenity.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said councils should not be 'using residents as cash cows' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘Members of the public who shamelessly litter and flytip should be brought to book. But councils shouldn’t be using residents as cash cows.’ The new report, The Corruption Of Punishment: How Litter Fines Became A Business – shows that the largest number of litter fines handed out in one area last year was 8,865 in Newham, East London. That earned the local council £664,875. At least 12 councils have so far employed one private firm, Xfor, to issue fines. Freedom of information requests suggest the company has made £1,636,547 after its 51 officers handed out 43,478 tickets.","A total of 73,536 fines were handed out across Britain last year for dropping rubbish - equivalent to 201 a day .

Opposition councillors have now called for Mr Howell to quit. Haslingfield and The Eversdens representative Robin Page said that his rival's behaviour was 'intolerable'. He added: 'I think it's just disgraceful. I think that not only should he resign from cabinet, he should resign as a councillor.' But Mr Howell said yesterday that the email had not compromised his position, despite admitting that he 'stupidly' circulated it. He said: 'The email from more than six years ago was nothing more than a private joke between friends in the independent group I was a member of at the time, which is now being used for nothing more than political gain. 'Anyone who knows me will know I do not support the views contained within it and have worked tirelessly for all residents since becoming a councillor. 'In hindsight it was a stupid thing to have sent and i can only apologise if anyone takes offence.' Controversy surrounds the Mettle Hill site which South Cambridgeshire District Council plans on buying and reopening as a traveller site . Details of the email have come to light as Councillor Howell backs plans to reopen a controversial traveller site in Meldrith, Cambridgeshire. He has also been accused by rival politicians of ignoring two other possible sites for travellers. Plans to buy and reopen the Mettle Hill site were revealed last Wednesday with an estimated 20 extra pitches needed up until 2031 to meet the authority's legal obligation to supply enough housing for travellers. The project will cost the authority £500,000 and has already been opposed by South Cambridgeshire MP and Leader of the House of Commons Andrew Lansley.","Mark Howell, who oversees policy on traveller sites in South Cambs, sent email six years ago .

Former prime minister, Gordon Brown, United Nations' Special Envoy for Global Education, pictured, has presented a petition to Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari . Malala is now recovering at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after being flown to the UK for treatment a week after the shooting. She has become a symbol of courage and received thousands of goodwill messages. The public is being encouraged to show their support for today by using social networking sites to post messages. Youth representatives worldwide are handing in the 'I am Malala' petition, which has already attracted more than one million signatures. Mr Brown said: 'The president of Pakistan has agreed to work with the United Nations to ensure urgent delivery of education for all and to get Pakistan’s five million out-of-school children into education for the first time. 'No bombs, bullets, threats or intimidation can deter the international community, working in partnership with Pakistan, to ensure we build the schools, train teachers, provide learning materials, and ensure that there is no discrimination against girls.' Mr Brown announced that three million children in poor families in Pakistan will now receive cash in return for going to school. He also set a goal with Mr Zardari to ensure that every girl and boy will have a quality education with teachers, books and classrooms by 2015. The latest Unesco figures show that 61 million children worldwide are not in school - 32 million of whom are girls - and that Pakistan has the second largest number of girls out of school in the world. In Pakistan today, Mr Brown met two of Malala’s friends who were injured in the attack in Pakistan. He said there was now a real momentum for change in the country. 'I believe that in Pakistan, the silent majority is speaking and that there is now a national consensus that the country can delay no longer in ensuring girls and boys have schools to go to and teachers to teach them,' Mr Brown said. 'This has been a breakthrough moment for Pakistan and now we must turn Pakistan’s new ambitions and popular determination into delivery on the ground.'

The merciless Simpson Desert in central Australia claimed the life of a 25-year-old man who died from thirst – while his mate was found ‘just in time’ suffering from extreme dehydration. Mauritz ‘Mo’ Pieterse and his friend, Josh Hayes, 30, had set out from a cattle station to check on a water spring when their four wheel drive became stuck in the sand. It should have been a routine job lasting just a few hours before the men returned to the remote Ethabuka Station in north west Queensland. Death in the desert: Mauritz Pieterse, 25, was found dead in the merciless Simpson Desert, Central Australia after setting out on a routine check of a water spring with his friend Josh Hayes . Unforgiving: The Simpson Desert in Australia is nearly 70,000 square miles of arid, sandy plains and dunes . When they failed to return by late afternoon, a number of workers – including Aboriginal trackers – set out into the darkness to look for them. Close to midnight on a rough track, the headlights of a search vehicle driven by Greg Woods from another cattle station picked out the body of Mr Pieterse who had collapsed and perished from dehydration and exhaustion. A short time later Mr Woods came across a highly distressed Mr Hayes. ‘It was about 11.30pm when I came across Mo’s body,’ said Mr Woods. 'I found Mo’s hat and shirt and car keys where he’d dropped them and I came across him a bit further down the track, but he was finished,’ he told Australian Associated Press. ‘I was more wild with him for doing it than I was bloody sad for him – I thought he had more bloody sense than that. But anyway, that’s the way it turned out.’ Remote: The two men's 4x4 got bogged down in sands near Ethabuka Station in far western Queensland . The two men, he said, made many mistakes but the worst was walking away from their vehicle in the blazing heat – temperatures can reach 50c in the middle of the day in the Simpson. ‘They were only bogged, they had plenty of fuel, they could have just sat there with the air conditioning going until somebody found them.’ After finding Mr Pieterse’s body, Mr Woods retraced his tracks and found Mr Hayes, who had been lying under a bush when he first drove past. He was close to death. ‘Another hour and he would have been gone, too. He was just bloody lucky he got through – he didn’t even have a hat to start with, but he had a massive head of hair and that might have helped him a bit. ‘He was well and truly perished. His eyes were like owl eyes, wide open and sunk in his head…you could see his heart beating out of his chest and he reckoned he couldn’t hear anything other than his heartbeat.’ Search operation: A 4x4 drives down a dusty path in the Simpson Desert - Pieterse and Hayes made a mistake by leaving their vehicle in the 50C heat . Police constable Tim Farran, whose ‘patrol’ covers the region, said the two men were experienced in their work in the desert. ‘But this time it was just a series of small mistakes that led to one big one,’ he said. ‘The desert is a beautiful place and we do look at it through our windows and it looks really nice. ‘But just because it’s the 21st century and we have modern technology, don’t think it won’t kill.’ Later today the grief-stricken Pieterse family, who live in Western Australia, said they were planning to fly to rural Queensland and talk to those who had found their son. ‘He was the best son ever,’ said the dead man’s mother, Gerald, through her tears. ‘He was a gentle giant, the sort of kid who helped me even to do the ironing. He would hug you and was never shy to show his affection.’ Mrs Pieterse said her son loved his conservation work and that she trusted his judgement. ‘We don’t know exactly what happened yet but we’re sure he would have made the right decision and looked after the other person he was with.’ Mr Pieterse’s younger sister Jani, and father, Tjokki, described his as a passionate and enthusiastic nature lover, dedicated to conservation. Although Mr Pieterse would sometimes shoot animals that were causing problems or were injured. Ethabuka Station is owned by the conservation group Bush Heritage Australia, which is helping regenerate the area after degradation caused by cattle and feral camels. Mr David Whitelaw, spokesman for the group, said all staff were trained to work out in the desert and were provided with he equipment they needed. ‘This is a very tragic event,’ he told ABC radio.","Mauritz Pieterse, 25, died after driving out from Ethabuka cattle station in north west Queensland to check on a water spring .

The Old Harrovian murdered by the wife of a top Chinese politician was spying for Britain after all, it was claimed yesterday. Businessman Neil Heywood,41, was supplying ‘useful’ information to MI6 in the months before he was poisoned, a newspaper has reported. The claim is at odds with William Hague’s attempts to distance the Government from the scandal. Extraordinary report: British businessman Neil Heywood had been providing information to an MI6 officer on top Communist politician Bo Xilai, for at least a year before he died, it has been claimed. Trial: Bo's wife Gu Kailai was given a suspended death sentence in August for poisoning Heywood, 41, with cyanide at a Chongqing hotel. In April, the Foreign Secretary said Mr Heywood was not a government employee ‘in any capacity’. It is a year since Mr Heywood was lured to a hotel in Chongqing, south west China, and given cyanide by Gu Kailai, 53, the lawyer wife of Bo Xilai, who had been tipped as a future leader. Mr Heywood had been friends of the couple for years, after being hired to teach their son English, and had an intimate knowledge of their private affairs. Yesterday’s twist came a few days before the country’s once-in-a-decade change of leadership and could prove damaging to relations with the UK. The report in the Wall Street Journal claims that a person Mr Heywood met in 2009 later acknowledged being an MI6 officer to him. Mr Heywood, who lived in Beijing with his wife and two children, later met that person regularly to pass on information on Mr Bo’s affairs. His death in November 2011 brought down Mr Bo, the former Communist chief of Chongqing, and in August this year his wife was given a suspended death sentence for murder. She claimed Heywood threatened to ‘destroy’ her British-educated son, Bo Guagua, 24, unless he was paid £13million, allegedly commission on a property deal. Mr Bo is expected to be tried for abuse of power and taking bribes.A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it ‘had a long-standing policy that we don’t comment on intelligence matters’. Bo has since been expelled from the party, a move which has stripped him of immunity from prosecution. Mr Heywood's relatives have declined to comment. In a letter to a Richard Ottaway MP on 26 April, Mr Hague moved to end speculation over Mr Heywood. He said that while it was usual government . policy 'neither to confirm nor deny speculation of this sort' that 'given the intense interest in this case it is, . exceptionally, appropriate... to confirm that Mr Heywood was not an . employee of the British government in any capacity ' Bo Xilai, pictured while he was Governor of Liaoning Province. It has been claimed that murdered British businessman Neil Heywood was providing information about Bo to MI6 . The 41-year-old had lived in China from the early 1990s, where he learned fluent Mandarin. One of Heywood's ancestors was Britain's consul general in the northern port city of Tianjin from 1929 to 1935. Chain-smoking Heywood made his living as a mostly self-employed consultant to companies, including the Beijing dealer of Aston Martin, helping them resolve disputes and assisting with due diligence. His grey Jaguar was second-hand, with a license plate ‘N007W3’. He requested and obtained the ‘007’ plate from Beijing traffic authorities as he was a fan of James Bond spy movies and classic sports cars, according to a family friend. Previous reports that he was a spy had been based on the part-time work Heywood had done for Hakluyt, a UK-based private business consultancy founded by former British intelligence officers. The claims were dismissed by family friends at the time. Another source close to the family scoffed at the idea, saying a real spy would hardly advertise the fact by driving around in a car with ‘007’ plates. ‘Who would be so stupid as to carve 007 on his face if he were a real spy?’ the source said. During Gu Kailai's trial it was claimed she killed him over a business deal that went sour. The case first came to light when police chief Wang Lijun fled to the US consulate in February, allegedly after falling out with Mr Bo over the Heywood case. Chinese officials then ordered that an investigation into Mr Heywood's death be reopened. Police had originally said he died of 'over-consumption' of alcohol. Five senior police officers in Chongqing have also been jailed, according to Chinese state media, for covering up the case.","Heywood 'spied on' top Communist politician Bo Xilai, for at least a year before he died, it says .

"PUBLISHED: . 14:05 EST, 10 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:22 EST, 11 November 2012 . More than four years after Wael Ali’s identical twin brother Wasel was found strangled in back woods the brothers played in as children, Wael was charged with first-degree murder. Accused of killing his then 19-year-old brother in Columbia, Maryland, prosecutors said that because of the twin’s shared DNA, no DNA evidence was found at the crime scene or finger prints collected. The murder weapon was only a pair of hands. But police said there were at least 25 minutes before Wasel’s death that Wael was unaccounted for as well as changing statements on where he told authorities he had been. Slain: More than four years after the murder of 19-year-old Wasel Ali, his identical twin brother Wael, both pictured together, has been released on a charge of first-degree murder . Slain: More than four years after the murder of 19-year-old Wasel Ali, his identical twin brother Wael, both pictured together, has been released on a charge of first-degree murder . 'I am so done with you,' prosecutors . accused Wael of threatening his brother after one of their increasing number . of fights just before Wasel’s death in August of 2007, reports the Washington . Post. It followed a series of shared trouble with the law including twice impersonating police officers as well as shop lifting. 'I'm sick of getting in trouble because of you. Wait till we get home,’ prosecutors claim Wael told Wasel after their arrest in August of 2007 when caught impersonating police officers after enrolling in the army out of high school. It was their second arrest on such a crime, with both brothers accused of stealing an Army sedan from Fort Meade months earlier to chase a speeding vehicle. Wearing military batons and pepper spray on their belts, the two wrongfully identified themselves as military police officers to police dispatch. That identification served them with probation after charged with stealing a government vehicle, impersonating a police officer and being in possession of a dangerous weapon. 'We just made some wrong decisions,' Wael told the Washington Post. 'We got mesmerized by the whole being in uniform thing and being in the Army.' Everything together: With the brother's high school graduation they both enrolled in the Army hoping to go into a career as military police officers . Defense: The brothers admitted to getting into fights with one another from time to time, increasingly more before Wasel's death noted prosecutors, but Wael said he never killed him . Both left the Army and moved in with their parents getting jobs at the mall: Wasel at Banana Republic and Wael selling cell phones. But they hadn’t lost their passion for law enforcement, leading to that second arrest in 2007. A search of their car after that arrest found an unloaded .45-caliber pistol the twins would tell police had been stolen. It was days later on August 22 of 2007 that their home, and then world, would be turned upside down. Bursting through their parents' doors, hand cuffing both brothers and their father outside their townhouse, a Howard SWAT team raided their property looking for additional illegal weapons. While their raid was unsuccessful, prosecutors said Wael’s embarrassment for his father and the failure they had found themselves in with the law, led to his increasing anger toward his brother. ‘There were a number of stressful situations on August 22, 2007, the day that we believe this young man was killed,’ Sherry Llewellyn, a spokeswoman for the Howard County Police Department told ABC2. ‘We can't say for sure what led up to the murder, but we do know that those things took place’ Police said Wael admitted both getting in a fist fight in their home that day following, with their father told to regardless drive to the mall in the family minivan later where Wasel had been called into work and needed a ride home. Torn apart: On August 22 of 2007 police believe Wasel, pictured with his mother and brother, was strangled in some woods near their home in Maryland, his body found five days later . Wasel had been accused of shoplifting and in his admittance to the crime he dually implicated his brother in the theft, according to police. Prosecutors worked to prove that Wasel’s . allegations of theft against his brother tipped him over the edge when . he met up with him that night. When Wael’s father sent him to pick his brother up from the mall, Wasel never returned with him. Wasel's body was found in the woods five days later by a hiker, a victim of strangulation. His black suit jacket was pulled over his shoulders, his arms pinned behind his back. 'We don’t have DNA at the crime scene . because with twins, they share DNA,' said prosecutor Doug Nelson who . accused Wael in the crime. 'There’s no fingerprints on the murder . weapon. There’s no murder weapon.' Authorities accused Wael of changing his story on what he did after captured entering the mall parking lot on surveillance camera, meeting his brother and some friends inside, and then the two brothers exiting through different doors. 'They're seen on the video together, and then leaving the mall separately. Then our suspect's time is unaccounted for, for a period of time in which we believe he committed the murder,' Ms Llewellyn said. Wael's defense said he waited for his brother in the mall's parking lot where they planned before leaving on his own. They said he did not kill his brother. 'There is no motive present for Wael to kill his twin brother, his best friend, and his flesh and blood,' attorney David Zwanetz said in his opening statement. With the case going cold, Wael was released. Charged: Wael is seen after his arrest on September 15 of 2011 on charges of first-degree murder, four years after his brother's death . In 2009, hoping to move on with his life, Wael moved to the Atlanta area with his mother and sister, enrolling at American Intercontinental University Atlanta for criminology. One year later, Wasel's cold case was assigned to a new investigator, Nick DeCarlo of Howard. Agreeing to meet with Mr DeCarlo during a visit home in August of 2010, the two sat in an interrogation room with a tape recording their conversation. 'You don’t know what it’s like to lose a twin brother,' Wael is heard telling Mr DeCarlo in the tape that would be later played before a jury. 'Please do not insult me and come at me as a suspect. I have been through Hell and back ... There is no reason why I want my brother’s killer to just be out there walking the streets.' Mr DeCarlo replies: 'Neither do I.' 'Two brothers. You have a fight. You have some issues. You are going to resolve the issue as brothers often do, with fists or whatever, and unfortunately Wasel got hurt and he died,' Mr DeCarlo accused. 'We did not fight ... my brother and I did not fight that day,' Wael retorted. Despite his claims on September  15 of 2011 he called his father from a Cobb County Jail informing him: ‘I’ve been arrested for first-degree murder.’ ‘I just see, like, flashlights at my back door and hear police radio chatter. They just coming, rushing in, like, 20, 25 of them,’ he described of that night to CBS. ‘I told him three times. I think he asked me in the interview had I killed my brother and I said no.’ Celebration: With charges dropped Wael Ali is seen celebrating with family at his release and return home in Maryland last May after a seven-month jail stint . Held for seven months behind bars, during the final verdict, a jury deliberated for 20 hours before ruling a mistrial. No direct evidence or DNA evidence could prove Wael guilty the court found. - Wael Ali after his release . One month later in Howard County prosecutors dropped charges against Wael. Prosecutors told a judge that they will not pursue another trial for Wael Ali, 24, after a mistrial was declared. ‘It was great being able to kiss and hug my mom again,’ Wael told WJZ after his release. ‘To know I’m free and that this is over. We’ll never know [what happened to Wasel]. It’s unsolved.’ Assistant State’s Attorney Jim Dietrich says after speaking to jurors, prosecutors didn’t think they could do better in a retrial of the circumstantial case. Howard police say the case remains open, and in a statement released in April, reminded of Wael being a main suspect. ‘The investigation to date has continued to lead detectives to the victim’s brother as the main suspect. We will continue to investigate the case, and if additional leads are discovered, we will review with the state’s attorney’s office,’ they wrote.","Wasel Ali, 19, found strangled prosecutors said hours after fight with his brother in 2007 .

A University of Montevallo student 'dismembered' a cat and 'hung it up for display' on a flag pole in the middle of campus, according to court documents in Alabama. Christian Todd Slaton, 19, faces four felony charges of first-degree cruelty to animals - including one for leaving the carcass of another cat near the university president's campus residence. Two others were discovered near the university's 'Becoming' sculpture, a work by professor Ted Metz, and in woodland near the off-campus apartments in Montevallo where Slaton lives. Montevallo's director of university relations, Jamie Bessette, said the first cat was discovered on October 16, with the second and third turning up a few days later. Slaton has been kicked out of the University and is banned from its campus. He is due to appear in Shelby County District Court on December 12. Court documents said one of the cats was 'hung up for display' on the main quad's flag pole, right in the middle of campus.

String of convictions: In her latest offence, Busfield was caught driving her Peugeot 206 at 42mph in a 30mph zone . When magistrates asked her if a driving ban would affect her ability to do her job, Busfield replied: 'I cannot speak for the diocese. 'But I would hope that the knock-on effect would make them consider the sensibleness of appointing a priest to cover 16 parishes.' She added that she would have to fork out on taxis to take her around her patch because there was no public transport available. Speaking after the hearing, Busfield said: 'I am very embarrassed about the whole situation, but the disqualification was a fair outcome for my speeding offences (all between 38-48mph) and my morning in court will certainly ensure that in the future I will be more aware of the speed limit of the road on which I am driving.

One parishioner in Peopleton, Worcestershire, who did not want to be named, said: 'Lynn Busfield is a wonderful vicar and we are truly blessed to have her working so hard for us. 'She is devoted to her flock but in order to fulfil all her duties she is known for driving like a bat out of hell around the narrow country roads to avoid being late for appointments.

Two female Army officers testified Wednesday they provided nude photos to a general facing sex crime charges. A . married captain testified that Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair repeatedly . asked her to send him nude photos of herself, which she said made her . uncomfortable. Eventually, she said she placated the married general by . sending him downloaded pornographic photos of other women cropped so . that their faces weren't visible. Charged: Army Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair has been charged with forcible sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate relationships with several female subordinates . The . testimony came during the third day of a hearing at Fort Bragg to . determine whether Sinclair will go on trial for multiple criminal . charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual conduct and adultery, . which is a crime under the military justice system. The allegations . against Sinclair involve relationships with five women other than his wife. On Tuesday a former subordinate to Sinclair testified that her superior . officer started an affair with her in Iraq and later threatened to kill . her and her family if she told anyone. The . woman says she was honored at first by the attention from Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, who she said was highly regarded. They first had sex . in 2008 at a forward operating base in Iraq, she said. 'I . was extremely intimated by him. Everybody in the brigade spoke about . him like he was a god,' the woman said, as Sinclair rolled his eyes and . appeared visibly annoyed during her testimony. Now a captain, she was testifying on the second day of a military . hearing at Fort Bragg, N.C., on whether there is enough evidence to . court-martial Sinclair on charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful . sexual conduct and engaging in inappropriate relationships. She had earlier testified how he had grabbed her by the neck and forcibly sodomized her. Sinclair is accused of using his rank to coerce women, including four female subordinates and one civilian, into sexual affairs and to sending him naked photos of themselves. It is a rare criminal case against a general and the details from the . hearing are the first public narrative of the alleged offenses. During the testimony, Sinclair repeatedly rolled his eyes, sighed audibly and stared at his former aide from the defense table. She did not look at him. The captain testified that she believed Sinclair's threats because he had gone through special forces training, knew how to kill with his hands and had a reputation as a killer in battle. Trial continues: Sinclair's trial is now in its third day at Fort Bragg and witnesses continue to come forward . Sinclair was deputy commander in charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in May amid a criminal probe. He has been on special assignment since then at Fort Bragg, the sprawling base that is home to the 82nd Airborne. Sinclair's former commanding officer, Maj. Gen. James Huggins, testified on Monday that he launched the criminal investigation that led to the charges after the female captain told him Sinclair forced her to have sex. Huggins said that on March 19, the captain came to his office late at night in tears. She reported that she had been involved in a three-year sexual affair with Sinclair, then her direct commander and a married man. Adultery is a crime under the military code of justice. Huggins said he knew the female officer to be a good soldier whom Sinclair had specifically asked to have transferred under his command. According to Huggins, the captain said Sinclair had once forced her to perform oral sex on him, but that she also had sex willingly with her boss at Army bases in the United States and on deployments to Germany, Iraq and at the airborne division's headquarters in Afghanistan. When she had tried to end the affair, Sinclair had threatened her and persisted in pushing for sex, according to Huggins' testimony. But she also told Huggins she finally decided to report Sinclair after finding emails exchanged with other women in his account. Sinclair is accused of 26 . violations of military law including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual . conduct, possessing pornography while deployed and conduct unbecoming of . an officer. Sinclair's . attorney asked for the charges to be thrown out, arguing that . prosecutors had read confidential emails between the general and his . defense. Defense attorney Lt. Col. Jackie Thompson said this violated . his client's rights and asked that new prosecutors be brought in to try . the case. The hearing officer called a recess until early Monday afternoon to give a legal adviser time to review the documents.","Jeffrey Sinclair is accused of sodomy, forcing women to send him naked photos and threatening violence against a subordinate .

"By . James Nye and Thomas Durante . PUBLISHED: . 10:30 EST, 11 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:30 EST, 11 November 2012 . A New York Times editor has denied that an anonymous letter sent to the paper's magazine advice column over the summer is from the spurned husband of Gen David Petraeus' alleged mistress. The possibility was raised after observers dug out the July 13 edition of Chuck Klosterman's 'The Ethicist' and pointed to extraordinary parallels between the letter and the now scandalous love tryst that led the general to hand in his resignation as details of the affair came to light. But yesterday, the editor of the The New York Times magazine denied that the column and the Petraeus scandal are related. Was the fact that Paula Broadwell (left) having an affair with David Petraeus known by her husband Scott (right) and did he write an anonymous letter to the New York Times advice column for help? Denial: New York Times magazine editor Hugo Lindgren tweeted yesterday that the advice The Ethicist column in question was not from Scott Broadwell, the husband of alleged Petraeus mistress Paula Broadwell . Hugo Lindgren tweeted: 'This @theethicist column... is NOT about the Petraeus affair, based on our factchecking. Strange, I know'. Writing about a deepening . relationship he knew his wife was having with a 'government executive' whose job 'is seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership' the anonymous man offers up what could be considered in hindsight as . striking information. The letter writer explains that 'exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort,' and asks 'The Ethicist' whether it is OK for him to 'suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project.' Indeed, he seems pained to make it clear he believes the mission 'must succeed' and wants to know if he should confront his wife in some way and 'finally force closure' or if he should 'suffer in silence for the next year or two.' 'Affair': Paula Broadwell and David Petraeus, pictured, reportedly had an affair that led to his resignation . The reader tells 'The Ethicist' that has . 'watched the affair intensify over the last year' - which matches the . timeline of the affair from August 2011 until about several months ago. Slate writer Allison Benedikt asked, 'What government executive is not having an affair with some guy's wife?' Another writer with the publication added, 'would anyone really repeatedly refer to heading the CIA as a 'project'? Doesn't sound quite right.' Those supporting the belief that the letter came from Scott Broadwell, point to Klosterman's insightful reply to the anonymous man's dilemma. He tells the letter writer that he should tell his wife he wanted to separate, 'just as you would if she were sleeping with the mailman.' 'Other woman': Paula Broadwell, left, is married . and has two children. Petraeus has been married to his wife Holly, . pictured right, for 37 years, and they also have two children . Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student . He claims there is no reason to reveal the affair in a public fashion, but having offered this clear-cut advice he goes slightly further. 'The fact that you’re willing to accept your wife’s infidelity for some greater political good is beyond honorable,' replied Klosterman on July 13 to the letter. 'In fact, it’s so over-the-top honorable that I’m not sure I believe your motives are real. 'Part of me wonders why you’re even posing this question, particularly in a column that is printed in The New York Times. 'I halfway suspect you’re writing this letter because you want specific people to read this column and deduce who is involved and what’s really going on behind closed doors (without actually addressing the conflict in person). 'That’s not ethical, either.' 'My wife is having an affair with a government executive. His role is to manage a project whose progress is seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership. (This might seem hyperbolic, but it is not an exaggeration.)'I have met with him on several occasions, and he has been gracious. (I doubt if he is aware of my knowledge.) I have watched the affair intensify over the last year, and I have also benefited from his generosity.'He is engaged in work that I am passionate about and is absolutely the right person for the job. I strongly feel that exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort.'My issue: Should I acknowledge this affair and finally force closure? Should I suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project I feel must succeed?'Should I be “true to my heart” and walk away from the entire miserable situation and put the episode behind me?' NAME WITHHELD . The resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus has brought a sudden and unexpected end to the public career of a four-star general who led U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and was thought to be a potential candidate for president. Petraeus admitted to an extramarital affair in tendering his resignation, which President Obama accepted on Friday. The FBI discovered the relationship by monitoring Petraeus' emails, after being alerted that Broadwell may have had access to his personal email account and allegedly sent threatening emails to another woman whom she believed was also having an affair with Petraeus, officials said. Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, . has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was . a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. Confident: Paula Broadwell appeared on The Daily Show with John Stewart in January to promote her biography of David Petraeus . Comfortable: She lives with her husband and their two young sons in Charlotte, North Carolina, pictured . CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell will serve as acting director, Obama said. Morell was the key CIA aide in the White House to President George W. Bush during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. 'I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission,' Obama said. The resignation comes at a sensitive time. The administration and the CIA have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. It was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with Obama's re-election Tuesday. The CIA has come under intense scrutiny for providing the White House and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the Benghazi attack was a result of a film protest, not a militant terror attack. It has become clear that the CIA was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the Muslim world. Morell rather than Petraeus now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the assault on the consulate in Benghazi, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Barack Obama's national security policy has been compromised  by the loss of one of David Petraeus . Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, . has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was . a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. She was the daughter of the academy superintendent. They have two children, and their son led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. The retired general told his staffers in a statement that he was guilty of 'extremely poor judgment' in engaging in the affair. 'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.' He said he had offered his resignation to Obama on Thursday and the president accepted it Friday. Administration officials said the White House was first notified about the Petraeus affair on Wednesday, the day after the election. Obama, who returned to the White House that evening after spending Election Day in Chicago, wasn't informed until Thursday morning. Embedded: Broadwell, pictured here in Afghanistan, has more than a decade of U.S. military service . For the director of the CIA, being engaged in an extramarital affair is considered a serious breach of security and a counterintelligence threat. If a foreign government had learned of the affair, the reasoning goes, Petraeus or Broadwell could have been blackmailed or otherwise compromised. Military justice considers conduct such as an extramarital affair to be possible grounds for court-martial. Failure to resign also could create the perception for the rank and file that such behavior is acceptable. Petraeus, who became CIA director in September 2011, was known as a shrewd thinker and hard-charging competitor. His management style was recently lauded in a Newsweek article by Broadwell. Broadwell, pictured with Lt Col. Steve Grenier in Gizab, writes opinion pieces on leadership . The article listed Petraeus' 'rules for living.' No. 5 was: 'We all make mistakes. The key is to recognize them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear view mirrors—drive on and avoid making them again.' The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said Petraeus' departure represented 'the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants. From his long, illustrious Army career to his leadership at the helm of CIA, Dave has redefined what it means to serve and sacrifice for one's country.' Other CIA directors have resigned under unflattering circumstances. CIA Director Jim Woolsey left over the discovery of a KGB mole, and director John Deutch left after the revelation that he had kept classified information on his home computer. The New York Times denial begs the question: If not Petraeus, then who is the 'government executive' involved?","Letter written by anonymous reader and printed on July 13 in the New York Times magazine has been noted for its striking similarities to Petraeus-Paula Broadwell affair .

Our attention may have been focused on the athletes, but it seems competition was also fierce among politicians during the Olympics. MPs were handed thousands of pounds worth of free London 2012 tickets and hospitality thanks to the generosity of private sponsors. According to the Commons register of MPs' financial interests, Tory Chris Heaton-Harris topped the chart after accepting £11,750 of gifts. The former Euro MP and three family members attended swimming, diving and gymnastics events as well as the Closing Ceremony courtesy of Coca-Cola, which met the bill in full. In second place was John Stevenson, the Tory MP for Carlisle, who received two tickets to unspecified events, plus hospitality, worth £5,500, from Nestle. The bronze medal was shared between Labour MPs Sir Stuart Bell and former minister Hugh Bayley, who both declared tickets and hospitality worth £4,500. Sir Stuart, the Middlesbrough MP who came under fire last year for failing to hold a constituency surgery for 14 years, declared 'one Category B ticket and hospitality' worth £4,500 from French oil firm Total, which allowed him to watch the Opening Ceremony. York MP Mr Bayley received  a ticket to an athletics event on August 6, plus hospitality, worth £4,500 from Nestle. Keith Vaz, left, attended the opening ceremony courtesy of steel firm ArcelorMittal and Sir Stuart Bell, right, claimed £4,500 from French oil firm Total . Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, attended the Opening Ceremony with his wife courtesy of steel firm ArcelorMittal. In the register,  he claimed that no value for the gift was provided to him. A spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance pressure group said: 'Many people failed to get Olympics tickets so the idea that MPs waltzed into events free of charge is bound to cause anger. 'MPs should be careful about what corporate hospitality they accept and they should declare every penny of it.' Many members of the public failed to get any tickets for the Olympic spectacle . Sebastian Coe is upset that football knocked the Games off the back pages . Lord Coe criticised newspapers yesterday for 'resorting to type' by allowing England's football triumph over lowly Moldova on Friday to bump the Paralympics off the back pages. Most papers led their sports coverage with reports of England's 5-0 victory in the opening match of the World Cup qualifying campaign. It came on a relatively barren day for Team GB, with Josie Pearson's victory in the discus Britain's only gold. Her success came nine years after breaking her neck in a car accident, and the 26-year-old set three world records on her way to claiming the title. Lord Coe said the press could help maintain the profile of Paralympic sport after the Games, and he criticised 'the speed with which we reverted to back-page leads for England-Moldova'. He added: 'That relegation happened too quickly. We [the Paralympics Committee] could not have done more in the past seven years to move this on. It now sits in a large part with you guys. 'The speed with which we resorted to type was maybe not a great sign.'","Chris Heaton-Harris took family members to sports events as well as Closing Ceremony .

Damian Rzeszowski, 31, has been jailed for a total of 30 years after stabbing six people to death . A builder who knifed six people to death, including his wife and two young children on the island of Jersey, has been jailed for 30 years. Damian Rzeszowski, 31, snapped after his wife Izabela, 30, admitted having a two-month affair with another man. He armed himself with . kitchen knives and killed her, along with his daughter Kinga, five, and two-year-old son . Kacper, at their home in St Helier on August 14 last year. He also killed his father-in-law Marek Gartska, 56, and turned on his wife's friend, Marta De La Haye, 34, and her five-year-old daughter Julia, who were at the house for a barbecue. Rzeszowski was convicted of six counts of manslaughter but cleared of murder following a trial at the Royal Court in St Helier, Jersey, last August. Judge Michael Birt today sentenced him to 30 years for each victim, which are to run concurrently. According to States of Jersey Police, Judge Birt, who is the Bailiff of Jersey, told the court: 'The horror and brutality of these killings is hard to believe. 'Within a quarter of an hour all six people had died, their lives cruelly cut short at the hand of this defendant. 'The court is in no doubt from the nature of the attacks that you intended to kill all six victims. 'This was not a case of murder - the court found you guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility - but you still pose a risk of harm to anyone you are in a relationship with.' The court was told that Rzeszowski was still not fully aware of what he did on the day of the killings. It also heard that he had sent letters to the loved ones of some of his victims but had not been able to bring himself to write to his wife’s mother. The killer’s trial heard he acted like a 'pressure cooker with no escape valve' as his marriage collapsed. The frenzied attacks were launched after Mrs Rzeszowska told her husband she had cheated on him. Rzeszowski had a history of violence and had as many as 10 fights since moving to Jersey from Poland in 2005. Solicitor General Howard Sharp, for the prosecution, said Rzeszowski had difficulties controlling his emotions and 'communicating his frustrations and worries' and that violence was part of his character. Siblings: Kinga, right, and Kacper Rzeszowski, left, were killed by their father on August 14 last year in a frenzied knife attack . Izabela Rzeszowska, left, who told her husband she was having a two-month affair before he killed her and her father Marek Garstka, 56, right, who was also stabbed . After learning of his wife’s two-month affair with another man in June last year, Rzeszowski started going out drinking and had a one-night stand, before taking an overdose of pills on July 19. In a bid to save their marriage, the couple decided to take their children back to Poland to visit their families. 'However, the problems remained and the defendant visited a prostitute while he was in Poland,' Mr Sharp said. The terrifying attack happened in the couple’s home in Victoria Crescent, St Helier, on the day they returned from the holiday. 'The state of their marriage was a determining factor in the defendant’s behaviour in June and July last year,' Mr Sharp said. 'He could not face the prospect of a failed marriage.' Family: Damian Rzeszowski pictured with his wife Izabela, daughter Kinga and son Kacper. He stabbed all three . Stabbed: Mrs Rzeszowska's friend Marta De La Haye, left, and her daughter Julia, right, were the last two victims of the knife attack . On the day of the attack, Rzeszowski got into a discussion with his wife after leaving the children on their own in the house. Rather than flying into an instant rage, Rzeszowski waited an hour and three-quarters before butchering his family and their visitors. The court heard Rzeszowski probably attacked his father-in-law first, as Mr Garstka appeared to be be caught unawares while watching Polish TV on his bed. Toddler Kacper was likely to have been stabbed 13 times with two different kitchen knives while playing with his toys, while the two little girls were each stabbed 16 times. As she tried to escape her husband’s attack, Mrs Rzeszowska climbed in through the bathroom window and made a desperate attempt to call police using her father’s mobile phone. But Mrs Rzeszowska dialled 997 - the Polish emergency services number - rather than 999. Mrs De La Haye, who had visited the house with her daughter for the barbecue, staggered out into the street and collapsed outside the flat. Rzeszowski admitted manslaughter through diminished responsibility last April, but the pleas were not accepted by the Crown, which argued he was not suffering an abnormality of the mind when the attacks took place.","Builder snapped after his wife admitted to having a two-month affair .

It was only after Mr Mitchell stripped the panels from the vehicle that he found the stowaway kitten sleeping peacefully. Simon Mitchell found the kitten in his dashboard after driving 120 miles . Mr Mitchell had spent the day driving the bus on his 120-mile standard route across Chulmleigh, Devon to neighbouring towns on October 11. After several passengers had reported hearing a strange noise, Mr Mitchell stopped several times and searched under all the seats - but to no avail. He looked inside the engine - thinking the purring sound was perhaps coming from there - but still couldn't find its source. He returned to his depot after his five-hour round trip and as a last resort started to remove the vehicle's panels. Mr Mitchell, of Turner's Tours, eventually found the problem when he removed the dashboard panel. He said: 'When cars pass you they make a whooshing noise and it sounded like a miaow. I thought I was going mental. 'I stopped several times to look around the bus but I couldn't find anything. 'Every time I stopped the kitten stopped making a noise.

He was actually feral and bit and scratched me, but he's calmed down a bit. 'There are a couple of feral cats that live around the depot, and we think his mum must have taken Lucky and the other kittens into the bus to keep dry. 'The driver had left the door open on the bus so they must have got in there. And in the morning the drivers coming in must have scared them and they rushed off.

A former Scotland Yard detective has been jailed for sabotaging 13 sex crime investigations and allowing alleged rapists to escape prosecution. DC Ryan Coleman-Farrow, 30, lied to alleged victims, claiming their cases had been dropped, and then forged police files to cover up his negligence. His defence lawyer claimed his offending was not the result of corruption or laziness - but the effects of ill health. But Coleman-Farrow was jailed for 16 months today after the judge ruled his 'deliberate' and 'calculated' actions made the prosecution of alleged sex attackers impossible. Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'In all . 13 cases you failed to take steps that were appropriate and necessary . for a full and proper investigation in each case. 'This was deliberate and calculated on . your part and had the effect of not only delaying investigations but in . reality made prosecution in respect of them impossible'. The policeman, who worked in Scotland Yard’s specialist Sapphire sex crimes unit, failed to get CCTV of alleged attacks, . did not submit evidence for forensic testing, and falsified paperwork to . hide his incompetence. He even fabricated interviews with suspects and key witnesses. Mark Heywood QC, prosecuting, said: 'This case is not simply one of gross failure to carry out the duty of the office of Constable. 'But is rather that in each of the cases identified, having failed first properly to investigate those allegations of serious sexual assaults, the defendant went on to then create false or misleading records.' After his lies unravelled police tried to reopen some of the cases, but many of the victims were too upset to go through their ordeals again. Only one of his bungled cases has been able to be fully investigated to the point of trial. His actions meant victims, suspects, families, witnesses and his colleagues were misled and in some cases 'the victim was kept waiting for many months without any results while being fed false information,' Mr Heywood said. He told Southwark Crown Court: 'In total 32 cases required to be reopened and reanalysed and in some cases reinvestigated. Coleman-Farrow was a Scotland Yard detective who was sacked after he admitted falsifying police records . 'This included revisiting victims and witnesses which no doubt involved considerable distress not only to those individuals but to the teams responsible for doing that. A review of working practices resulted.' The documents he faked 'related not only to his own conduct but also the conduct or statements of others whether they are complainants, suspects witnesses, or by implication fellow investigators, scientists, or on occasion reviewing lawyers from the CPS to whom it was said the case was referred', the court heard. The former DC, who joined the police at 18, has pleaded guilty to 13 charges of misconduct in public office involving investigations he worked on between January 2007 and September 2010. The charges relate to 13 investigations involving 11 suspects. Ten were investigations into rape whilst three involved sexual assault. Mr Heywood said: 'It appears to have been his immediate purpose first to cover his own failings and lack of capacity and secondly, positively but falsely, to create the impression that he had done all he could to investigate the allegations but for one reason or another the allegation could not be progressed. 'He appears to have acted in his own interest for his own advantage. The consequence is that the interests of justice were deliberately frustrated.' Mr Heywood said that some of the cases may have never made it to trial, but because of his actions the allegations were not fully investigated. He added: 'It is now difficult to determine from this side of the court what the true outcome of these investigations might have been.' The former detective was sentenced to 16 months in jail today at Southwark Crown Court . The cases he bungled included an allegation of rape made by an 18-year-old student which he investigated as a trainee DC in 2006. Then he lied recording that the CPS had taken the decision to take no further action. Another alleged 18-year-old rape victim he duped was so upset by the fake decision not to prosecute she had threatened to appeal, but did not take it to the top. When investigating an allegation of the rape of a 49-year-old living in a care home by a carer he failed even to interview the suspect despite writing on the file the man denied the allegations. Other investigations he sabotaged include allegations of sexual assault made by a 15-year-old schoolgirl against a waiter in an Indian restaurant, a vulnerable 25-year-old living in a specialist hospital caring for victims of abuse who claimed she was raped by a stranger, a 20-year-old who claimed she was impregnated by her rapist, the alleged rape of a 97-year-old woman by her son, and the sexual assault of a 14-year-old schoolboy by his classmate at a school for special needs. When the lies of Coleman-Farrow, from St Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, East Sussex, unravelled he was quizzed by the IPCC and admitted he had made up records and was sacked. Dominatrix Jaime Perlman, 37, who committed suicide in September 2010 with 33-year-old fellow sex worker Riley Lison Taylor, also complained in her suicide note that officers - including Coleman-Farrow - had failed to investigate allegations she made. Her complaints were not upheld. Defence counsel Robert Atchley said that within the space of six weeks in late 2005 and early 2006 Coleman-Farrow separated from his first wife and was diagnosed with cancer. He claimed his offending was not the result of corruption or laziness, but the effects of ill health. He said: 'The defendant in no way seeks to blame anybody other than himself for what has happened here. 'He has, he understands, by his conduct affected victims, colleagues, and the Metropolitan Police.'","Defence lawyer denied corruption or laziness and blamed ill health for crime .
