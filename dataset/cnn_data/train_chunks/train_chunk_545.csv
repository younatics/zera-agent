Love is blind: Wildlife rangers have rescued a blind baby rhino found bumping into trees and rocks on the African savannah . Nicky, a rare black rhino, inside his padded enclosure at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya . The boisterous 18-stone mammal named Nicky was rescued by Mike Watson who found him running around alone. Mike, CEO of the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, which was founded to protect rhinos from poachers, said: 'A couple of months ago we noticed a baby rhino running into things, straying away from his mother and getting confused. 'The veterinary team confirmed he was blind, so we took him in as the chances of survival in the wild would have been very slim. 'The first few days in his new home were difficult for him, but now he’s thriving, growing and getting into all kinds of trouble.' Over the next few months, Mike is hoping to raise enough money to fly in a specialist to perform cataract surgery to restore Nicky’s eyesight. Cure: Staff at Lewa hope is vision can be restored by surgery to remove his cataracts . Ranger Adan takes Nicky for a walk in search of food. He would not have survived in the wild . But for now, he is enjoying life with his adoptive family. Mike said: 'As soon as Nicky wakes up, he’s ready to play. He goes crazy for a couple of hours, running around, bumping into things. 'After a nap, he’ll go for a walk with his minder, then take a mudbath - his favourite activity.' Nicky depends on his minders who look after him 24 hours a day. Mike said: 'Nicky even sleeps with his minder, who makes sure he’s wrapped up in a warm blanket - a comfort he would get from his mother in the wild. Sanctuary: Nicky even sleeps alongside his minders, who keep him safe and ensure he is warm at night . Friends: Nicky has formed a close bond with staff and is 'thriving' in the wildlife park . 'If it falls off he’ll wake his minder up by jumping on top of him until it’s put back on.' The Duke of Cambridge has called for a halt to the killing of rhinos for their horns as experts warn that Africa is facing the worst poaching crisis in decades. The Lewa Wildlife Conservancy reported five slaughtered rhinos in a fortnight last month. It costs Lewa around $1,265 per month to care for Nicky.

Defence chiefs have placed more than 600 British troops on standby as part of contingency plans to evacuate UK nationals from Lebanon, amid intelligence warnings that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could fall within four weeks. There are fears that thousands of Britons would become trapped in the region in the aftermath of the downfall of the Assad regime, with ethnic fighting spilling over into neighbouring Lebanon, where tens of thousands of refugees are seeking sanctuary. Rebel leaders, whose fighters include men trained by former SAS soldiers, claimed yesterday that Assad will fall within 30 days. Stepping up: Syria's new defense minister is sworn in by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus . This view was endorsed by the Russian ambassador to France, who suggested the Syrian leader had accepted he would leave power. Alexandre Orlov said Assad had in effect agreed to step down last month at a conference in Geneva by nominating his representative to lead negotiations with the opposition for a democratic transition. ‘That means he accepted to leave, but in a civilised way,’ Mr Orlov added. Syria denied the claim yesterday as fierce fighting continued around Damascus. Battles involving tanks, helicopters and mortars have turned parts of the city into combat zones and sent thousands of Syrian families streaming across the border into neighbouring Lebanon. Uprise: Intelligence suggests Assad's regime called fall in a matter of weeks following uprising around Syria . Rebels: A burnt car is seen at al-Midan neighbourhood in Damascus where clashes between the Syrian army and rebels took place . More than 300 people were reported to have died around the city on Thursday, while the UN’s refugee agency said between 8,500 and 30,000 people have fled into Lebanon over the past 48 hours. Significantly, rebel fighters have seized control of several border posts on the southern frontier with Iraq and the northern border with Turkey. The Daily Mail can reveal some rebels inside Damascus have been trained by former SAS soldiers working for teams of private security contractors from two companies based in the Middle East. Faltering: Syrian President Bashar Assad could fall within four weeks, potentially leading to fighting spilling out of Syria and in to Lebanon . More than 300 rebels have passed through a remote base just inside Iraq, while a second ‘higher tier’ command course not involving weapons is being held in Saudi Arabia. Potential leaders are given military planning tuition with training in military tactics including weapon handling, leadership and using communications systems. Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday condemned Russia’s decision to veto a UN resolution on Syria and warned the body could be sidelined in efforts to support the opposition movement. He said other countries would step up the supply of arms after the Security Council failed to approve a resolution threatening sanctions against Assad’s regime. He added: ‘I don’t rule out any option for the future because we can’t foresee how it will develop, but it’s never been our policy in any of the conflicts in the Middle East to send lethal assistance to any of the parties involved.’ The Foreign Office has been closely involved in contingency plans to evacuate UK passport holders from across the Middle East if the regime collapses and chaos spills over into Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. SAS soldiers and diplomats have been in Cyprus and the wider region, assessing the number of Britons who have already fled from Syria and drawing up plans for an evacuation if the violence spreads. The move follows criticism last year of Britain’s delay in evacuating stranded citizens from Libya. Syria’s new defence minister, Fahad Jassim al-Freij, was sworn in yesterday after his predecessor was killed in a suicide bombing in Damascus on Wednesday.","Intelligence warnings that Assad's regime could fall within four weeks .

The Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation said they don't believe the two events are connected. The first whale was found dead around 8am in Napeague. Officials say there were no outward signs of what may have caused the death of the 59-foot-long female finback whale. At around 2.30pm, officials got a report of a 5-foot-long juvenile pygmy sperm whale in nearby Amagansett. The foundation told Newsday the young whale was euthanized because it had skin lesions and appeared ‘sickly.’ Necropsies will be performed on both mammals on Monday.

Controversy: Director Quentin Tarantino shocked press backstage at the Golden Globes by using the N-word . Quentin Tarantino has stirred further controversy in the wake of his slavery-themed movie Django Unchained by using the 'N-word' backstage at the Golden Globes. The cult movie director, who won the award for best screenplay, shocked gathered press at the Hollywood event with his use of the word, before saying that the U.S. prison system is 'modern slavery'. Tarantino, renowned for his risqué directorial decisions, has walked an even finer line with Django Unchained. The spaghetti Western starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington and Christoph Waltz sees characters use the N-word more that 100 times. Tarantino defended his inclusion of the word in the script - and repeated it in front of gathered reporters. 'They think I should soften it, that I should lie, that I should massage,' he told the Hollywood Reporter. 'I would never do that when it comes to my characters.' The director also said that slavery continues in the U.S. - it has just taken on a different form. 'If you go to Malaysia, there's sexual slavery going on in places like that, but I'm more concerned about the slavery that is going on in America,' he said. 'The drug laws that have put so many black males in jail that wouldn't have existed in the `70s, that is slavery. It is just straight up slavery as far as I'm concerned.' Scroll down for video . Cult figure: Quentin Tarantino, pictured on the red carpet at Sunday night's Golden Globes in LA, with a blonde guest and later in the night (right) The director has made the point in earlier interviews. While on a Canadian talk show in December, Tarantino said: 'This whole thing of this ''war on drugs'' and the mass incarcerations that have happened pretty much for the last 40 . years has just decimated the black male population. 'It’s slavery, it is just, it’s . just slavery through and through, and it’s just the same fear of the black male . that existed back in the 1800s.' Despite winning two awards on Sunday night at the awards ceremony in Hollywood - one for Tarantino and best supporting actor for Christoph Waltz - Django Unchained has been met with a mixed reception. Director Spike Lee deemed the film 'disrespectful' and blasted the feature for insulting his 'ancestors'. Lee wrote on Twitter last month: 'American Slavery Was Not A Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. It Was A Holocaust. My Ancestors Are Slaves.Stolen From Africa. I Will Honor Them.' Django Unchained, which opened on Christmas Day, sees Foxx as a slave Django Freeman, who fights for his freedom and to be reunited with his wife Broomhilda (Washington), who was sold to brutal plantation owner Calvin J Candie (DiCaprio). Close bond: Tarantino and Kerry Washington at the after-party at the Beverly Hilton hotel following the Golden Globes . Screen success: Tarantino and his guest share a joke with Adele as Jamie Foxx looks on . Waltz, who plays a bounty hunter who trains Foxx's character, backed Tarantino's directorial choices given the controversial subject matter of slavery. He told the Hollywood press: 'It should be . controversial if you make a movie about a story against the backdrop of . slavery. 'You better be prepared for a controversial . discussion. I wish more movies gave us an opportunity to talk about . subjects that matter to us today.' His co-star Jamie Foxx opened up last month about the struggles he had on set with the racial slur constantly being repeated. The 45-year-old actor told Jay Leno last month: 'It was a deep movie what I had to learn though was the slavery part of it was tough. I've worked so hard to get where I am as black man - strong and handling my business in 2011/2012. 'That was tough for me to act like I can't read, or be subservient to someone or to hear the N-word over and over again which is what I asked for because that's the way they labelled them at that time.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had a chance today to forget for a little while the furore surrounding the topless pictures taken of her. The royal couple visited a rainforest in Borneo and enjoyed the high life - by being hoisted up a 130ft rainforest tree by ropes and walking along a 300-metre long canopy bridge. Kate joked: 'I'm going to go ""whee"" and fly the way up.' William and Kate toured the Danum Valley research centre in Sabah, one of the two States that make up the Malaysian part of Borneo.

Smiling: The couple look confident as ropes attached their harnesses lift them up the rainforest tree . Panoramic view: William and Kate dangle from their harness with the Borneo rainforest below them . They arrived from Kota Kinabalu by helicopter on a flight which saw them take in spectacular views of the Imbak Canyon and the Maliau Basin, which is famous for its seven-tier waterfall. While her outfits on the tour have so far have included designs by Alexander McQueen, Erdem and Alice Temperley, the Duchess was dressed for the jungle in slim-cut beige jeans and a plaited brown leather belt, sturdy walking boots and a sheer green blouse over a black t-shirt. She saw at first hand the conservation work of the Royal Society, of which the Duke is a fellow. It carries out world renowned research on the impact of deforestation. High-level corruption has been blamed for the destruction of the rainforests which have been turned into oil palm plantations because of continuous logging. Less than 4 per cent of forest remains in Sabah despite the efforts of the Royal Society. Strolling on the canopy: William holds onto the wire fence as he follows Kate on the walkway .

Tengku Adlin, a Malaysian prince who previously accompanied Prince Philip in a helicopter flight over the rainforest when he visited the region in 1972, also flew with the couple. He said:  'They enjoyed it immensely, they asked lots of questions about primates, birds and insects, and Kate was taking a lot of photos.' On arriving at the field centre, the couple attended a short briefing with a group of Malaysian and British scientists, including Dr Glen Reynolds, the director of the Royal Society’s South East Asia research programme, which explores the impact of deforestation in the region and Dr Owen Lewis from Oxford University. They were then fitted with special harnesses and helmets in a private room before being hoisted 42 metres up into a giant parashorea tomentella tree. Officials used a 'counterweight pulley system' which had been set by rope access technicians to their combined weight, believed to be 150kg.

' I hope I don’t have any wardrobe . malfunctions.' He also added: ""It's not quite as impressive as the . Shard.  When Dr Reynolds joked: 'Size isn't everything,' the Duke . responded: 'That's true.' The Duchess, appearing somewhat . apprehensive as she looked upwards at her route of ascent into the . jungle canopy, said:  'I’m going to go “whee” and just fly up.' Simon Amos, the rope access technician who oversaw their ascent up the tree, said:  “It’s the closest anyone will ever get to time travel. 'What they are seeing is exactly what it would have looked like 150 million years ago as there has never been an ice age here.  It is as if time stood still.” Ready for action: William and kate laughed and joked as they toured the rainforest . Casual look: No designer dresses for Kate who wore tight-fitting jeans with a leather belt and green shirt . Suspended in the air, with sweeping views over the top of the jungle canopy, they were greeted up the tree by Kalsum Yusah, 32, from Sabah, who completed a PhD in entomology at Cambridge University two years ago and is now based at the field centre. Miss Yusah said:  “They just said it was such a surreal, totally unique experience up there because they had never been up in the canopy. “They enjoyed it immensely and they weren’t scared of the heights.  They asked about the primates, birds and insects and they were interested in how the forest is sustained.  “They enjoyed it because it gets them into the midst of the canopy, where there’s nothing much else going on.” After spending around 10 minutes up in the air, they were lowered back down to the ground, with wide smiles, clearly stunned by what they had seen. The Duke said: 'That was amazing.' Goodbye: Kate waves to the crowds at Lahad Datu airport before the royal couple depart after their visit . 'That was rather surreal, wasn’t it?' said the Duchess.  'It was amazing, such a treat, really brilliant to be up there.  I could have stayed up there for hours, even though there were a lot of ants.” The Duke wryly joked that even high up in the jungle canopy, he could not escape a photographer who had been positioned high up in an adjacent tree. 'We saw a spy in a tree,' he said, before thanking the rope technicians:  'Thank you for keeping us safe, that was super.' The couple then took a jungle walk with Dr Reynolds, who had offered them the use of 'leech socks', which the Duke and Duchess politely declined.  'Apparently they didn’t pass the sartorial test,' said Dr Reynolds. But moments later, the Duchess may have wished she had taken Dr Reynolds up on his offer, as a jungle leech attached itself to her leg.  'She dealt with it very calmly and just bent down and picked it off.' The Duke and Duchess then visited the field centre’s laboratory, where they met with representatives and academics from Raleigh International, the Earthwatch NGO, and Oxford University. Wild in the jungle: An Orang-Utan is seen near the tree William and Kate were hoisted up by forest conservationists . Speaking to a group of academics and students in the laboratory about their research, the Duchess was told of how the region’s rainforest is believed to be the oldest in the world, and is home to the world’s largest natural Orang-Utan population and rare species including the clouded leopard, Macaque monkies and the Borneo pygmie elephant. Staking up: Closer magazines displayed at the the company's headquarter, in Montrouge, near to Paris . The Duke asked:  “Are Orang-Utans quite social animals?  Do they have big families or are they solitary?” The Duchess was also inquisitive about their mating habits, asking:  'Do they have any young at the moment? We’re very jealous [when the scientists said often see them].  We still haven’t managed to see one.' The couple also looked at a selection of pressed jungle flowers and leaves.  'Do you press the leaves here yourself?' said the Duchess.  Her husband then joked:  'She’ll now ask you all about how you do it – she’s very arty.' In an attempt to enjoy some much-needed privacy, the Duke and Duchess then retired privately to the lodge for the afternoon, where they were served an eight-course lunch of Sabah delicacies including fern salad with coconut and chicken soup cooked in sweet traditional local rice wine. After lunch, much to their delight, they were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of an Orang-Utan family, a mother, father and their baby, while with a guide from the lodge.

The father whose child was kidnapped by his own parents 19 years ago now says that he would like to tell his son that he loves him. The family drama is being unveiled after Michael Landers, who is now 24-years-old, was discovered to be living with his paternal grandparents in Minnesota after they kidnapped him in Indiana in 1994. Michael Landers' biological father, Richard Landers Sr., spoke out saying that he wants to get in touch with his kidnapped son but doesn't know his phone number and cannot afford to fly to Minnesota. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New man: Pictured outside his home in Browerville, Minnesota Michael Jeff Landers faced reporters as a 24-year-old . Michael, who was originally named Richard Landers Jr but legally changed his name when he was 18, apparently knew that he was kidnapped by his grandmparents but believes that they were in the right and raised him well. He now lives next door to them with his pregnant wife, and has been publicly praising his grandparents saying that while they did something that was illegal, they should not be punished because it was in his best interest. It is unclear why Landers' biological parents would have been unfit, but his grandparents fled with the then-5-year-old boy when he was at the center of a contested custody dispute. His grandparents fled with him during a custody dispute with his mother, Lisa Hartner in July 1994 from Wolcottville, Indiana. Authorities reopened the case in September and using his social security number determined Landers to be the abducted Indiana child. Vanished: In 1994 Richard Wayne Lander Jr disappeared at the age of five from Wolcottville, Indiana before he was found 19 years later at the age of 24 living in Minnesota . A Facebook post, believed to be from Michael Landers' account, has defended the grandparents who raised him. The message to the Minneapolis television station KARE's Facebook page, said: 'For you people who jump to conclusions you should find out the whole story I was where I needed to be. My `grandparents' were in the the right I don't care what anyone else thinks.' The grandparents were charged with misdemeanor interference with custody, which was bumped up to a felony in 1999. But the charge was dismissed in 2008 after the case went cold. Landers' mother and stepfather were unemployed and lived in a car at the time, recalled John R. Russell, who spent several months investigating the disappearance with the LaGrange County Sheriff's Department in Indiana. 'These people (the grandparents) were nice people. It was wrong for them to do it, but I can understand why,' Russell said. 'But I also didn't think the child would be in any danger at all with them.'

After a while, she moved into an apartment and gained custody of her son on weekends, and she filed a petition to expand her custody rights when she remarried.

Office workers who spend all day behind their desks should consider working standing up instead, according to new research. Staying on your feet for an extra three hours a day would burn off 8lbs (3.6kg) of fat each year, according to exercise scientist John Buckley from Chester University. He said there is no need to sit down so much and those feeling sluggish would do well to push their chairs away during the day. On your feet: Humans are designed to stand up and keep moving, says Dr Buckley . Dr Buckley added that people could switch to higher than normal computer desks to answer emails and type documents. An upright working stance was championed by author Ernest Hemingway who wrote his vigorous prose on a typewriter at a special chest-height desk. In a letter in 1950, Hemingway wrote: 'Writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and I like to write standing up.' Dr Buckley, from the department of clinical sciences and nutrition at Chester University, said that switching from chairs to working standing up will reduce obesity and improve circulation. Standing up for three hours will consume 144 calories, he claims. 'People are sitting down at work, then sitting in the car and then sitting down in front of the television,' Dr Buckley told BBC News. 'Your metabolic rate crashes to an absolute minimum. It isn't natural. Humans are designed to stand up and keep moving.' Though pictured sitting with his typrewriter in 1944, Ernest Hemingway, liked to write standing . Dr Buckley is part of a group of experts working with England's chief medical officer on ways to tackle obesity. There have been several recent reports warning about the sedentary nature of work and recreation. A study late last year made a strong connection between too much sitting down and an increased risk of diabetes. Meanwhile a major Australian study published in March 2012 found . sitting down too long increases your risk of dying within a few years - . even if you are already physically active. It found adults who sat 11 or more hours . per day had a 40 per cent increased risk of dying in the next three . years compared with those whosat for fewer than four hours a day. Dr Buckley concluded making small changes in the workplace such as standing at your disk can make long-term improvements to your health.","Standing for 3 hours a day can burn 8lbs of fat a year .

President Obama warned Republicans on Monday against failing to raise the debt ceiling, saying the move would 'send the markets haywire' and plunge the U.S. into a second recession . The U.S. is expected to default on its debt by late February or early March. 'If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America’s bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans’ benefits will be delayed,' Obama said. 'We might not be able to pay our troops or honor our contracts with small business owners.' Threatening the safety of Americans at home and abroad, Obama also warned that food inspectors, air traffic controllers and specialists who collect loose nuclear material would not be paid. 'Markets could go haywire,' he said. 'Interest rates would spike for anybody who borrows money - every homeowner with a mortgage, every student with a college loan, every small business owner who wants to grow and hire.' The move would slow down the recovery and 'might tip us into a recession,' he said. 'To even entertain the idea of this happening -of the United States of America not paying its bills - is irresponsible. It's absurd.' Responding to Republican calls to offset increases in the debt ceiling with an equal amount of cuts, Obama said the two issues should be considered separately. 'The debt ceiling is not a question of authorizing more spending,' he said. 'Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending, it simply allows the country to pay for spending that Congress has already committed to... these are bills that have already been racked up and we need to pay them.' Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, released a statement insisting that Democrats accept new spending controls. 'The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time,' Boehner said. 'The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation's obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same.'

'If they think that they can get that through Congress, then they are free to go ahead and try,' Obama said, calling out Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, by name. He said he refused to accept that Congress would risk a default to make a political point. Obama held the press conference, the last of his first term, as it was revealed that more than half of House Republicans are . prepared to allow the U.S. to default on its debt unless he commits to steep spending cuts. 'We always talk about whether or not . we’re going to kick the can down the road,' House Republican Conference . Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers told Politico. 'I think the mood is . that we’ve come to the end of the road.' While the results of a default would be dire for the . economy, most Republicans agree it's a better option than allowing . additional debt to pile up without an equal-or-greater offset of deep . spending cuts. If House Republicans choose not to force . President Obama's hand on spending cuts with the threat of a default, . they are planning to shut down the government in March when a six-month . temporary funding measure expires. 'I think it is possible that we would . shut down the government to make sure President Obama understands that . we’re serious,' McMorris Rodgers said.

The last temporary measure was passed in . September and it expires on March 27.

That turned up a man with the same number and birthday with an address in Long Prairie, about 100 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Indiana State Police then contacted Minnesota law enforcement agencies, which began investigating along with the FBI and the Social Security Administration. Minnesota officials say the grandparents - now living under the assumed names Raymond Michael Iddings and Susan Kay Iddings - verified Landers' identity. They were known as Richard E. and Ruth A.

Landers works at an auto parts store in Long Prairie, but wasn't at the store Friday and an employee declined an interview. Raymond Iddings has worked since 1999 as a herdsman at Twin Eagle Dairy in nearby Clarissa, where owner Patrick Lunemann described him as a 'dedicated, faithful' employee. Lunemann said he was in shock when he read a story about the case. He said Iddings plays guitar at his church, and recalled a day last summer when the couple brought their instruments to play for dairy workers. He said he knew Michael slightly, saying he stopped in occasion - perhaps to drop off Iddings' lunch if he had forgotten it. '(Landers) works at an auto parts place. That fits him perfectly, because Ray is kind of a motorhead and Michael is the same way,' Lunemann said. The town buzzed with the news, though. Rich Wall, a retired jeweler, said some residents speculated that some people knew of Landers' history but kept quiet. He said it was the most notable news since a grisly triple homicide there in 2003. 'My grandson called last night and said, `Long Prairie made the news again,'' Wall said.

Caroline Woollen stole £159,000 off her employers Nordic Offshore to take her boyfriend on luxury holidays to stop him leaving her . A manager of a global offshore company stole £159,000 to buy her boyfriend a camper van and take him on luxury holidays in a bid to stop him leaving her. Caroline Woollen, 33, tricked her Danish employers Nordic Offshore into believing she had landed lucrative contracts with major firms including Shell and Siemens. Bosses at the maritime company then authorised the payment of £159,000 to Woollen, as they believed the money would be used to pay workers to carry out the contracts. But she was using the stolen money to buy her boyfriend a camper van and take him on exclusive skiing trips and luxury holidays to stop him leaving her. Hull Crown Court heard Woollen, who had been drinking up to three bottles of wine a night, was a fantasist who led a 'Walter Mitty existence'. Her barrister Anil Murray said: 'She wanted to be loved by her partner. She wanted to please him. 'Once this offending was uncovered, her partner left her. She is a broken woman.' Woollen, from Brough, East Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to fraud between April 2011 and May last year. She was charged with stealing £387,609.13 but pleaded guilty to stealing £159,000. The court heard Woollen even lied to her family about her accomplishments, claiming she was at drama school and college when both were untrue. She said she lied to conceal the inadequacies she felt compared with more successful members of her family. Woollen had previously defrauded a different company in 2010 and had been convicted of writing a false invoice. She was also convicted of making a false representation in 2009 and ordered to pay £5,000 compensation. Nordic Offshore, which specialises in providing offshore personnel to major corporations such as oil and gas companies, was unaware of her previous convictions when she secured a job with them after pretending she had excellent contacts with Siemens and Shell. Deceptive: Woollen managed to convince her bosses at Nordic Offshore Marine - which specialises in providing offshore personnel to large gas and oil companies - that she had secured lucrative deals to get them to authorise payments . Her first task was to apply to the UK Border Agency for a licence allowing the firm's employees to work in the UK but she failed to make the approach. She lied to her employers, creating fictitious e-mails pretending she had. Woollen then said she had obtained contracts with major firms, requesting thousands of pounds which she claimed she needed to pay contractors. Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'She told her employers these companies were prepared to do business with them, which was untrue.' Woollen was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the company last May as her lies began to unravel and she admitted her deceit. Mrs Jobes said: 'She admitted all of this offending and said she was trying to impress her boyfriend and her family. 'She went on skiing holidays, funded a £10,000 holiday to Canada with her boyfriend and talked about all the parties she had attended using company money.' In court: Caroline Woollen was sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work at Hull Crown Court . Mr Murray, defending, said Woollen believed the stress of her conduct had led to the death of her father late last year. He said: 'She comes from a respectable, happy family and has had chances in life. 'She has had every support and been brought up well-loved. However, it seems she felt she didn't deserve that love. 'She has had siblings who have done extremely well and she has always felt she hadn't done well and didn't live up to what she thought was expected of her. 'As a result, she has low self-esteem and a desire, almost a compulsion, to please others. 'The irony is they love her for just who she is anyway.' Woollen has been sentenced to two years' imprisonment, suspended for two years and ordered to attend an alcohol treatment course and carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. She will now face further legal action under the Proceeds of Crime Act as the Crown Prosecution Service is seeking to recoup more than £160,000. Judge Simon Jack told her: 'You are a victim of your own personality and your need to please those around you.'","Caroline Woollen duped her bosses into believing she had secured lucrative deals for the company so they would authorise payments .

For thirty years it has proudly rested beside the entrance of Leeds Art Gallery, giving visitors a glimpse of the stunning works to be viewed inside. But Henry Moore's Reclining Woman: Elbow sculpture was yesterday moved for the first time since it was erected outside the gallery's new extension in 1982. The famous bronze figure - completed in 1981 - has been taken off its plinth to be loaned to the Rijksmuseum gallery in Amsterdam for a major exhibition of the artist's work. Scroll down for video . Landmark: Workers prepare to move the Reclining Woman: Elbow from outside Leeds Art Gallery for the first time in 30 years after it was installed there in 1982 . Steady now: Staff check underneath the Reclining Woman: Elbow yesterday to make sure there are no structural problems with the sculpture . It will join other sculptures and works by Moore as part of a unique exhibition to celebrate the reopening of the Rijksmuseum, which has undergone a 10-year refurbishment. Castleford-born sculptor, who died in 1986, had close connections with the city after studying at the Leeds School of Art in the early 1920s. Leeds City Council executive member for leisure, councillor Adam Ogilvie, told the BBC that Rijksmuseum's request to temporarily host the sculpture showed the international significance of the sculpture. He added: 'It's going to be a little strange walking past the art gallery and not seeing the Henry Moore sculpture there as it has been a permanent fixture for the last 30 years, but it is long overdue a holiday after all that time.' Lift off: Residents watch the Reclining Woman: Elbow, which has become a local landmark, being moved for the first time in 30 years . Temporary new home: The famous bronze figure is being loaned until September to the Rijksmuseum gallery in Amsterdam for a major exhibition of the artist's work . Renowned: Sculptor Henry Moore, who was born the son of a coal miner in Castleford - is still considered one of Britain's greatest artist of all time . The 7ft 3in long figure, which has become a well-known fixture of the Moore Sculpture Gallery extension, will be cleaned and renovated when the exhibition ends in September before being returned. The artist - who was the son of a coal miner - was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are now located in public spaces in cities around the world. His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace in Yorkshire. Iconic: The Reclining Woman has become a well-known local fixture in Leeds . Other work: Henry Moore's Large Reclining Figure on display at Kew Gardens in 2007 . Tower Hamlets Council caused controversy last year when they proposed to sell Moore's Draped Seated Woman - nicknamed Old Flo - for up to £20million. Moore sold the sculpture to the then London County Council in 1962 at a reduced price of £7,000 as part of a regeneration scheme of the city after World War II. The decision to sell was delayed in December while art heritage groups - including the Henry Moore Foundation - and campaigners - such as the director of the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Danny Boyle - challenged Tower Hamlets Council's right to sell the sculpture and demanded proof of ownership before it can be sold.

A social worker has been off sick for ten years during a £45,000 legal wrangle with Birmingham city council over her bullying claims. Julie Ridsdale last went to work for the council in December 2003, before being signed off long term sick. Despite losing a string of battles with the authority -  including claims of bullying and disability discrimination - the 54-year-old, from Bromsgrove, technically remains a council employee. The saga began in 2003 when she fell . foul of bosses after leaving work to collect her son from school, . despite her claims it had been agreed.

They've been so heartless. 'I had been a well respected social worker and the council know they did wrong. 'I will not let this go because I have been wronged and want an apology, but I don’t know where I go from here.' The council insisted it had done all it could to resolve the dispute and stressed that Ms Ridsdale, who earned £1,200-a-month, was no longer on the payroll. A council spokesman said: 'Ms Ridsdale took the council to an employment tribunal and the civil courts and both hearings found in the council’s favour, with the tribunal finding that we had acted in good faith in seeking to resolve matters with her internally. 'While she remains an employee of the council she has not been well enough to return to work for some time and has therefore not been in receipt of any salary. 'Now legal proceedings have concluded we will seek to work with Ms Ridsdale to progress matters.

Dr Jones designed the device which is able to electronically scan blood alcohol level based on a breath sample. Until then police asked drivers to walk a straight line or use a crude blow in a bag chemical system. Dr Jones established Lion Laboratories to manufacture and market the products internationally. Dr Jones designed the device which is able to electronically scan blood alcohol level based on a breath sample (picture posed by model) In 1991 the entrepreneur sold his business to the American technology giant MPD, Inc. He then went on to establish toxic gas detection company PPM Technology based in north Wales, Caernarfon, Wales .

The Dr Tom Parry Jones Fund is currently used to stage the annual Bangor Science Festival. Dr Tom Parry Jones invented the electronic breathalyser in 1974. He went on to manufacture and sell it to police forces across the world and significantly contributed to road safety. Speaking to the BBC in 2003 Dr Jones . said: 'I found inventing the device the easy part but producing it, . developing it, and selling it was the challenge.' The device is able to electronically scan blood alcohol level based on a breath sample. Alcohol that a person drinks shows up in the breath because it gets absorbed from the mouth, throat, stomach and intestines into the bloodstream. Because the alcohol concentration in the breath is related to that in the blood, a figure determining the amount of alcohol consumed can be determined by measuring alcohol on the breath. The ratio of breath alcohol to blood alcohol is 2,100: 1. This means that 2,100 ml of air will contain the same amount of alcohol as 1 ml of blood. The breathalyser uses a chemical reaction involving alcohol that produces a colour change. Each device has a mouthpiece, a tube that the suspect blows air through, and a sample chamber where the air goes. It contains two glass vials containing the chemical reaction mixture, a system of photocells connected to a meter to measure the colour change and a system to sample the breath. The device works by a suspect breathing into it and the sample being bubbled in one vial through a mixture of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, silver nitrate and water. Until its invention police asked drivers to walk a straight line or use a crude blow in a bag chemical system.","Dr Tom Parry Jones has died at his home in Anglesey, north Wales, aged 77 .

Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘We all expect our police officers to uphold the highest standards of integrity, but this startling research shows how, for many, the line between right and wrong is indeed blurred. ‘It is also apparent that for some officers, the sense of proportion has gone wrong. Use of inappropriate force and cover ups are completely unacceptable for officers of the law. ‘The police service is undergoing significant reform, with the new College of Policing and a tough new Chief Inspector of Constabulary it must take this opportunity to make sure that our expectations for officers’ conduct are clearly established and upheld.’","A police ethics study concludes there is a 'blue wall of silence' in policing .

A French bistro is set to lose its licence after a council launched an investigation into it holding 'sex parties' in the basement. Bosses of the Le Bourgeois eatery - situated on the ground floor of a 1960s tower block called Eros House in Catford, south London - have been told that its license faces being withdrawn after a raft of complaints from neighbours. The notoriety of the restaurant has become so widespread even the local MP, Labour's Heidi Alexander has got involved after dozens of locals got in touch with her. Le Bourgeois: This French bistro is set to lose its licence after a council launched an investigation into it holding 'sex parties' in the basement . The Metropolitan Police are also vying for the restaurant to lose its licence, and a report from police officers recommending it be closed is set to be handed into Lewisham Council licensing chiefs on Thursday this week. According to locals the bistro holds regular 'basement sex parties', with strippers and exotic dancers and 'private booths' for regulars. Locals also reported people openly having sex outside the eatery - whose name translates as 'the middle classes' - with one saying he found hands prints all over his car, suggesting someone had romped on his bonnet. Speaking this week, Lewisham East MP Heidi Alexander said she was first aware of activities at the restaurant nine months ago. She said: 'People told me there are strippers inside and there are people having sex at the back of the restaurant. 'Given the length of time that these problems have been going on, I do think some serious action needs to be taken.' A string of locals have provided statements to police urging the council to withdraw the restaurant's licence because of a steady stream of incidents over the past year. One man said he ended up leaving his flat at weekends so he could 'get some peace'. The Metropolitan Police are also vying for the restaurant to lose its licence . He said in a letter to the Met: 'It is having a detrimental effect to my physical and mental well being and has got to the stage where I have to leave my flat on weekends and look for where I can go to in order that I can have a peaceful weekend.' Another said: 'On several occasions I saw finger and hand prints places on the bonnet of my car in a compromising position.' Other residents also vented their anger, with one man saying: 'There are lots of strange people wandering the building, usually very drunk, stinking of alcohol and or carrying bottles/cans of strong alcohol.' - Resident . Another said: 'I have been informed by a co-resident that sex activities are going on in the basement... she found used condoms constantly in the basement after parties at Le Bourgeois.' And yet another wrote to the police to say: 'The noise, fighting, gangs hanging around, drug dealing, shouting and screaming, all from this club, is getting to my wits end.' Others said the restaurant was a 'haven' for sex parties, with one saying that a 'pool party' held last summer - in which punters turned up in swimming costumes - turned into a 'sexual free for all'. He said: 'They all turned up in swimming costumes - maybe 20 people and by the end of the night they were outside having sex on cars and on the pavement - it's disgusting.' Police said that parties - called 'late night adult parties' - are advertised as The Thick Lick - which is slang for a 'sensual massage' which ends up with a pair having sex. The ads for the parties state that the restaurant will lay on 'male and female performers, exotic dancers, private rooms'. Jokers wrote online about the restaurant's reputation, with one - calling himself Madras - saying: 'Well, it is a French restaurant - how terribly bourgeois.' Another said: 'Sounds more like the kind of thing the proletariat would like, not the bourgeois.' The council's licensing committee will meet on Thursday this week to decide on the fate of the eatery.

Mungerina Arabin Jerin, known as 'Jerin Mir', was walking with a male friend near a train station on Saturday night when the tragedy occurred. The friend has been arrested on suspicion of murder after relatives of the student accused him of being involved in her death. Tragedy: Jerin Mir, 22, has died in Bangladesh after apparently being hit by a train . Jerin was born and brought up in Canada, although her family is originally from Bangladesh, according to the Daily Star, a local paper. Her grades were not good enough to secure access to a Canadian medical school, so she moved to Bangladesh last year to train to be a doctor. She was studying at the Medical College for Women in Uttara, a suburb of the national capital Dhaka, and living in college accommodation. A relative told the Star that Jerin had visited her aunt on Saturday, then went for a walk with a friend, Mohiuddin Sharan. She was then hit by a train, according to Sharan, and was taken to a nearby hospital where efforts to revive her proved unsuccessful. Train: The student was taken to hospital but later died of her injuries (file photo) Sharan was questioned by police after Jerin's death, and was arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday after relatives pressed charges. One member of Jerin's family told the Star that witnesses had seen the pair fighting moments before her death, but that no one except Sharan had seen exactly how she died. Friends of Jerin, whose family lives in Scarborough, a suburb of Toronto, took to Facebook to pay tribute to her. 'You had several talents, you were always so creative,' one said. Another added: 'Still hard for me to believe that you're gone, RIP.' A spokesman for Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs expressed sympathy for the young woman's death. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of a Canadian citizen who passed away in Bangladesh,' the department said in a statement.

After more than a decade of denying doping claims, disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has admitted to Oprah that he used performance-enhancing drugs to help him win seven Tour de France titles, sources revealed Monday evening. A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that Armstrong confessed to Oprah Winfrey during an interview taping with the Queen of Talk, which is slated to air on Thursday on her network. Armstrong was stripped of all seven Tour titles last year in the wake of a voluminous U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report that portrayed him as a ruthless competitor, willing to go to any lengths to win the prestigious race. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO PREVIEW . Confession: Lance Armstrong has admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey this week, a source told AP . Scene: Armstrong gave the interview at the Four Seasons hotel in Austin, Texas . A group of about 10 close friends and . advisers to Armstrong left a downtown Austin hotel about three hours . after they arrived Monday afternoon for the taping. Among them were . Armstrong attorneys Tim Herman and Sean Breen, along with Bill . Stapleton, Armstrong's longtime agent, manager and business partner. All . declined comment entering and exiting the session. Soon afterward, Winfrey tweeted: . 'Just wrapped with (at)lancearmstrong More than 2 1/2 hours. He came . READY!' She was scheduled to appear on 'CBS This Morning' on Tuesday to . discuss the interview. Promises, promises: I'll answer the questions directly, honestly and candidly,' Armstrong said. 'That's all I can say.' In a text to the AP on Saturday, . Armstrong said: 'I told her (Winfrey) to go wherever she wants and I'll . answer the questions directly, honestly and candidly. That's all I can . say.' Armstrong stopped at the Livestrong . Foundation, which he founded, on his way to the interview and said, 'I'm . sorry' to staff members, some of whom broke down in tears. A person . with knowledge of that session said Armstrong choked up and several . employees cried during the session. The person also said Armstrong . apologized for letting the staff down and putting Livestrong at risk but . he did not make a direct confession to using banned drugs. He said he would try to restore the . foundation's reputation, and urged the group to continue fighting for . the charity's mission of helping cancer patients and their families. Rae Bazzarre, a spokeswoman for Livestrong said it was emotional 'but we were all glad to see him.' Armstrong had not been at the headquarters since October 21, Ms Bazzarre said, about two weeks before he resigned from Livestrong’s board of directors. Media: Local news crews parked outside of Lance Armstrong's home in anticipation of his interview with Oprah Winfrey in Austin, Texas . Close watch: An unidentified man enters a gate at the home of cyclist Lance Armstrong . USADA chief executive Travis Tygart . labeled the doping regimen allegedly carried out by the U.S. Postal . Service team that Armstrong once led, 'The most sophisticated, . professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever . seen.' After a federal investigation of the . cyclist was dropped without charges being brought last year, USADA . stepped in with an investigation of its own. The agency deposed 11 . former teammates and accused Armstrong of masterminding a complex and . brazen drug program that included steroids, blood boosters and a range . of other performance-enhancers. Speaking: Armstrong pictured in October addressing participants at The LIVESTRONG Challenge Ride at the Palmer Events Center in Austin . Armstrong seemed calm and joked with reporters outside his Austin, Texas home over the weekend . The . interview with Winfrey will be Armstrong's first public response to the . USADA report. Armstrong is not expected to provide a detailed account . about his involvement, nor address in depth many of the specific . allegations in the more than 1,000-page USADA report. After . he was stripped of his Tour titles, Armstrong defiantly tweeted a . picture of himself on a couch at home with all seven of the yellow . leader's jerseys on display in frames behind him. But . the preponderance of evidence in the USADA report and pending legal . challenges on several fronts apparently forced him to change tactics, . and he still faces legal challenges. He is planning to testify against several powerful people in the sport of cycling who knew about his doping and possibly facilitated it, said several people with knowledge of the situation, according to The New York Times. Armstrong is in discussions with the United States Department of Justice to possibly testify in a federal whistle-blower case. Former . teammate Floyd Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France . title for doping, has filed a federal whistle-blower lawsuit that . accused Armstrong of defrauding the U.S. Postal Service. Landis claimed the team defrauded the government because its riders used performance-enhancing drugs in violation of its sponsorship contract. The Justice . Department has yet to decide whether it will join the suit as a . plaintiff. Better days: The interview, which will take place at Armstrong's home, will be broadcast Thursday on the Oprah Winfrey Network . The London-based Sunday Times also is suing Armstrong to recover about $500,000 it paid him to settle a libel lawsuit. On . Sunday, the newspaper took out a full-page ad in the Chicago Tribune, . offering Winfrey suggestions for what questions to ask Armstrong. Dallas-based . SCA Promotions, which tried to deny Armstrong a promised bonus for a . Tour de France win, has threatened to bring yet another lawsuit seeking . to recover more than $7.5 million an arbitration panel awarded the . cyclist in that dispute. The lawsuit most likely to be influenced by a confession might be the Sunday Times case. Potential . perjury charges stemming from Armstrong's sworn testimony in the 2005 . arbitration fight would not apply because of the statute of limitations. Armstrong was not deposed during the federal investigation that was . closed last year. Armstrong's Oprah appearance will be the cyclist's first public response to the USADA report . Many of . his sponsors dropped Armstrong after the damning USADA report — at the . cost of tens of millions of dollars — and soon after, he left the board . of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity he founded in 1997. Armstrong . is still said to be worth about $100 million. Livestrong could be one reason Armstrong has decided to come forward with an apology and limited confession. The charity supports cancer patients and still faces an image problem because of its association with Armstrong. He may be hoping that his willingness to . testify against the cycling union officials and his former team’s . officials and his confession will allow him to return to . competition in the elite triathlon or running events he participated in . after his cycling career. World Anti-Doping Code rules state his lifetime ban cannot be reduced to less than eight years. WADA . and U.S. Anti-Doping officials could agree to reduce the ban further . depending on what information Armstrong provides and his level of . cooperation . He had a meeting last month with  United States Anti-Doping Agency officials, and it was reported by The New York Times that people with knowledge of the discussions said the officials would be willing to reduce Armstrong’s punishment if Armstrong would testify against the people who helped him dope.","Sources tell AP that the disgraced athlete confessed to Oprah that he doped to win Tour de France titles .

And if there are some who are finding it difficult to look for a suitable match, life needn't be a bitch. There's now a website that's dedicated to their need. With dog mating as its raison d'etre, Internet portal candyromeo.com is a platform for all those canine owners who want a partner for their pet. Claiming to be the country's first matrimonial website for dogs, candyromeo. com offers an opportunity to prospective 'brides' and 'grooms' to meet each other before tying the knot. Yappily Ever After: Kareena is . the owner of the first of its kind . matrimonial website for pet dogs . The brain behind the website, Kareena Abbott, was inspired by her love for dogs to launch it. 'I was in college in England and wanted to do something for dogs,' Abbott said. So, she got together with three friends to launch the website to help people find mates for their pets. 'We knew how difficult it is to mate pets as you can't just pick up a roadside animal for the purpose,' Abbott says. 'People today have become very conscious of the lineage of puppies their pets would have.' The portal draws its name from Abbott's two pet dogs, Candy (a poodle) and Romeo (a pug which has three generations now, all living at their owner's house). The proud owner of 10 dogs says that since she already had a kennel and was into dog breeding, handling the rush of visitors on the website wasn't a difficult task. Canine Coupling: The website candyromeo.com . 'Launching a matrimonial and dog mating website was the next logical step. But theme weddings are all that we charge for.' The idea has picked up well. Popularised solely by word of mouth, the website assisted mating of 1,065 dogs from across the country in its very first year. This year, candyromeo. com has already got 665 registrations. For dogs in Delhi, Abbott holds breeding sessions and weddings at her farm in Sultanpur. For other parts of the country she just connects the owners to each other 'who then take it forward from there'. People living in America are also using the website. Pavni Bagga of California found a match for her Maltese named Skittles in Princess from New Jersey via candyromeo.com. The Roman themed wedding took place on October 26, 2011, with three lavish functions - one in California and two each in India at Abbott's farmhouse. Mutt Matchmaker: Kareena Abbott with one of her pet dogs . 'Skittles and Princess have relatives in India too, so it was easy for the families to travel down and celebrate,' says Bagga. 'They now have three puppies. One lives with us in California and two with Princess in New Jersey.' Abbott has other themes to offer as well to dog owners getting their pets married off. Themes such as the Arabian Nights, New Yorker Nights and Caribbean Nights - the idea is to pamper the dogs. From decorations to the dress code, from the wedding cake to the guest list, from snacks to the after party, everything is done with attention to the minutest details. 'For the Arabian Nights theme, we also organise hookahs for dogs,' says Abbott. 'We are about to launch the 'Exquisite Candy' theme, which comes with a booth offering manicure and pedicure for dogs, and the dress code is Gucci and Prada.' Pet mating is a necessity to keep a dog physically and mentally healthy, but candyromeo. com has gone the extra mile to make a regular activity an occasion for fun.","Possible pet wedding themes include Arabic Nights, New Yorker Nights and Caribbean Nights .

'Parting blast': Dame Liz Forgan will make a speech at tonight's bash making the case for 'sustained government investment in arts and culture' The outgoing head of the Arts Council was under fire last night over plans for a £12,500 ‘leaving do’ funded by the taxpayer. Dame Liz Forgan, an outspoken critic of government funding cuts to the arts, will fire a parting blast at ministers at the event at the British Museum tonight in front of an audience drawn from the great and the good in the arts world. The event is going ahead despite the Department for Culture Media and Sport initially turning down a request from the Arts Council to use taxpayers’ money. The quango got round the decision by reclassifying the event under an existing part of its budget which had already been approved for funding. The original £12,500 budget for the event included a catering bill of £7,500 to pay for each of the 250 guests to enjoy an average two-and-a-half glasses of wine and five canapés. A further £1,000 was earmarked for ‘contingencies’. An Arts Council spokesman last night denied the event was a ‘leaving do’ and said the final budget had been reduced to £8,130. But a government source condemned the decision to press ahead with the ‘party’. The source said: ‘It’s unbelievable that the Arts Council would complain about arts funding and then, instead of bidding for extra money for front-line arts, ask the Government for £12,500 of taxpayers’ money to fund an extravagant leaving party. ‘It makes you question their priorities if they think this is a good use of money.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘This is yet another example of a taxpayer-funded body that is out of touch with the people who pick up their bills. It smacks of hypocrisy for the Arts Council to decry necessary spending cuts when it is more than happy to splash out on a luxurious goodbye bash. Venue: The event is going ahead at the British Museum despite the Department for Culture, Media and Sport initially turning down a request from the Arts Council to use taxpayers' money . ‘This unelected and unaccountable quango should be axed before it wastes any more taxpayers’ money quaffing champagne.’ The council last night defended the decision to press ahead with the event, which is now part of its ‘State of the Arts’ series of lectures on the value of the arts. 'This unelected and unaccountable quango should be axed before it wastes any more taxpayers' money quaffing champagne' Matthew Sinclair, Taxpayers' Alliance . Dame Liz, a former BBC executive and chairman of the Scott Trust which owns the Guardian newspaper, will deliver a speech making the case for ‘sustained government investment in arts and culture’. She will also stress the importance of including cultural education as a key element of the Government’s new Ebacc qualification. The council spokesman described the occasion as a ‘thought leadership piece which will help stimulate debate and discussion among the key stakeholders present, and those who hear the podcast of the event, around key priorities for the Arts Council’. The spokesman said costs had been ‘kept to a minimum’, adding that the event would also be an opportunity for ‘discussion and networking’. Dame Liz was appointed as chairman of the Arts Council in 2009 but was asked to step down by the then Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt when her term came up for renewal last year. Her departure was mourned by administrators who saw her as an effective champion of public spending on the arts. She is being succeeded by Sir Peter Bazalgette, the man who will forever be known for introducing Big Brother to British television.","Dame Liz Forgan, the outgoing head of the Arts Council, is an outspoken critic of government cuts to arts funding .

Traditional religious freedoms are under assault from the ‘intolerance of aggressive secularism’, a Cabinet minister will warn today. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will today attack court rulings against the right of Christians to wear crosses at work and legal action to prevent prayers before council meetings. He will insist that faith provides a ‘clear moral compass’ for society and declare that the Coalition does ‘do God’, unlike the last Labour government. Warning: Eric Pickles will say religious freedoms are under assault from the 'intolerance of aggressive secularism' Mr Pickles’s comments come on the day of a crunch verdict from the European Court of Human Rights, which will rule whether four Christians were discriminated against at work – including two women who claim they were forced out of their jobs for wearing the cross. He is vowing to change UK law to support the right of people to discreetly display a symbol of faith in their workplace if their case is rejected. Addressing the think-tanks British Future and Policy Exchange in London, Mr Pickles will say: ‘Faith provides a clear moral compass and a call to action that benefits society as a whole. At a time when Christians are under attack for their beliefs in different parts of the world, I am proud of the freedom of belief that exists in Britain. ‘But in recent years long-standing British liberties of freedom of religion have been undermined by the intolerance of aggressive secularism: taking people to task for wearing a cross or a rosary, beginning costly legal actions against council prayers – as if they had nothing better to do. Symbol of faith: Eric Pickles is vowing to change UK law to support the right of people to discreetly display a symbol of faith in their workplace . ‘We’re committed to the right of Christians and people of all beliefs to follow their faith openly, wear religious symbols and pray in public.’ Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, the former bishop of Rochester, said that it would be ‘clear discrimination’ to allow employers to ban the cross whilst letting those of other faiths wear symbols and clothing from their religions. He added that it would ‘further accelerate the undermining of this country’s Judeo-Christian foundations by aggressive secularism and naive multi-culturalism’. In his speech, Mr Pickles will also reiterate previous demands that all immigrants should learn English, saying it is ‘incomprehensible’ that no one speaks the language in one in 20 households. Parents who do not ensure their children learn English are ‘condemning them to a limited life’, he will say. He will attack the ‘old statist policies’ such as the decision to pay for translation ‘instead of trusting people to learn the language’. ‘People should be able to talk to and understand one and another in a nuanced way. The reality is you need English to succeed. We all miss out, our country is the poorer, if people can’t speak our language, if they are unable to participate or make an economic contribution. ‘English is the passport to prosperity the world over. From Mumbai through to Beijing every striving parent is trying to get their kids to learn English,’ he will add. Eric Pickles: Not confident in estimates . David Cameron yesterday explained why the Government is refusing to publish official estimates of how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK to seek work when restrictions are lifted at the end of the year. He confirmed that figures had been drawn up by civil servants but said he had little confidence his officials had come up with reliable numbers. The Prime Minister said the Coalition wants to avoid mistakes made by Labour in 2004. Then, there were confident predictions that only a few thousand Poles would come to Britain for work when they joined the EU. In the event, the number of Polish migrants turned out to be far higher – and the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals put huge pressure on housing and public services. Some 21million Romanians and 7million Bulgarians will be free to travel to and work in Britain from the end of the year when transitional controls on EU migrants expire. At the weekend, Eric Pickles revealed he had seen estimates of how many might come to the UK but said he would not yet release them because he was not ‘confident’ that the figures were accurate. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Cameron backed Mr Pickles’s decision not to publish the estimates. He said civil service figures had proved unreliable in the past. He added: ‘If you look at what the calculation was in the case of Poland, it was something like 14,000 – a ridiculously low number – and it turned out to be many, many times that. So we don’t want to make that mistake again so it’s right to take the time and get this right.’ But Mr Cameron said he did not believe as many Bulgarians and Romanians would come over as Poles did almost a decade ago. He added: ‘The last government didn’t put in place any transitional controls – we told them to. ‘You can basically restrict the immigration for the first seven years and they failed to do that, and quite rightly we have had transitional  controls in place with Romania and Bulgaria.’A source close to Mr Pickles yesterday said: ‘When we get the answers, we will make a  judgment [on the figures].’","He will insist that faith provides a 'clear moral compass' for society .

A 32-year-old Indian man acquitted of the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl was arrested on Friday after an almost identical attack. He had been released from jail for two other rape-murders just months earlier, because of good behaviour. Sunil Suresh (aka Pappu Salve) is now accused of kidnapping a nine-year-old girl from Shirdi town in Maharashtra in December and carrying out another brutal attack. Furious: Indian activists on hunger strike at a protest in New Delhi over the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student . His story is the latest in a series of horrific rape cases to besiege India, following the gang-rape and murder of a student on a New Delhi bus a few weeks ago and the rape of a 29-year-old on a coach in northern India on Friday. Salve was detained yesterday near Manmad railway station by Shirdi police and later appeared in Rahata local court, which remanded him to police custody till January 17. His most recent previous arrest came in 2003, when he was given the death sentence following the rape and murder of a girl in Sinnar area of Nashik district. He appealed in the Bombay High Court against the sentence and was acquitted, police sources said. Shockingly, he was already serving two jail terms - of ten years and seven years each - over rape and murder allegations made against him at Ambad and Nashik police stations in 2002, police said. He was released from the Nashik road jail on May 28, 2012, for those crimes because of good behaviour, according to India Today. Salve then allegedly raped and murdered another nine-year-old on December 28 2012, and dumped the body at an isolated spot near Shirdi railway station. The decomposed body was recovered on Friday night, police said. Disgusted: A series of violent rapes in India have provoked a furious backlash from activists across the country . Additional Superintendent of Police Sunita Thakare said yesterday that a rape and murder case against Salve will be tried by a fast-track court. Enraged Shirdi locals went on a protest march yesterday to demand vigorous punishment for Salve. 'On December 28, when the girl didn't return home from school, her parents began searching for her and Salve helped them in the search,' Inspector Datta Pawar told the Times of India. 'Another girl told her parents that she had seen the victim with Salve in the afternoon of December 28.' Salve, who sold photo frames outside the Shirdi temple, then fled the area. Police teams were formed to track him down Salve. On Friday, they learnt that Salve, who had been living with his wife and two children in Shirdi after his release, had called his spouse and asked her to come to Manmad railway station. Inspector Pawar added: 'We laid a trap and nabbed him. During interrogation, he admitted to having raped and murdered the girl.' The inspector said Salve had ensnred the girl by asking her to help him find his 12-year-old son, and had later buried her boy near the railway station. 'We are probing whether he has committed any other crimes after being released from jail in May last year,' he added. Sunita Salunkhe-Thakre, additional superintendent of police (Ahmednagar), confirmed that the high court had acquitted Salve in the Sinnar case. She said in 2002, three similar cases were registered against Salve by Ambad and Nashik road police stations. 'In the case registered by the Ambad police, Salve was charged with kidnapping and rape and sentenced to six years' rigorous imprisonment. In the two cases under the Nashik Road police station, he was sentenced to seven years' rigorous imprisonment for kidnap, rape and murder in one, but acquitted of kidnap and rape in the other,' she said. An organisation working for nomadic tribes blocked roads in Shirdi on Saturday to protest against the crime. State agriculture minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil met the parents of the victim and announced a financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh. Inspector general (special) Dhananjay Kamlakar of Nashik Range said police superintendents have been told to examine judgments in such cases before deciding on the legal course of action to be taken.","He was acquitted of raping and murdering another nine-year-old on appeal .

Sypek's attorney, Mike Epright, . added: 'There's a lot sensitivity right now with Newtown and its on . everybody's minds right now. But at the same time, I think its important . that everyone does a fact check and at the end of the day not to . overreact to something that's just bad judgement.' Nice: When a reporter asked Sypek whether she had anything to say, the woman, pictured in center, replied: 'How about ""bite me""' Reckless: Both have been charged with reckless endangerment, threatening and breach of peace . The suspects were identified in a . school security video, which showed the couple's silver, four-door . vehicle pull up to the school gate at around 1:45 a.m. and Doran jump . out, leaving the bomb-like device at the school entrance. Doran and Sypek were located at . around 12:30 p.m. in their car, and the man was wearing the same plaid . shirt shown in the video, officers said. Also in the vehicle was the couple's 2-year-old daughter. The couple  confessed to the . crime, saying they found the 'fake bomb' at a paintball compound before . placing it at the school. Doran's father Stephen Doran is also facing charges after he allegedly struck a female reporter outside the courthouse where his son was being arraigned on Monday. The 50-year-old is charged with third-degree assault and second-degree criminal mischief. Confession: Doran and Sypek, pictured left and right, confessed to the crime, saying they found the 'fake bomb' at a paintball compound before placing it at the school .

Speech: Policing Minister Damian Green yesterday called for the private sector to be given a greater role in police work . The new policing minister yesterday called for the private sector to be given a greater role in police work, even as it emerged G4S had lost more than half its fee for the Olympics security fiasco. Damian Green, in his first speech since being appointed in last week's reshuffle, said partnerships between police forces and security firms would save money and improve services. Some forces have considered transferring functions to contractors in response to steep budget cuts, but G4S's handling of Olympic security has led to calls to put the move on hold. Games organisers Locog yesterday laid out the firm’s catalogue of failings before MPs. On its worst day, G4S provided less than two thirds of the required staff numbers, Locog’s chief executive Paul Deighton told the Home Affairs Select Committee. During the Games some two-thirds of venues were left with a 15 per cent deficit in guard numbers – a level viewed by organisers as critical, he added. Mr Deighton, who last week was made a peer and will join the Government as a Treasury minister, also revealed that only £90million of the £236million contracted fee had been paid to G4S so far. Despite the G4S debacle, Mr Green tried to give fresh impetus to the drive towards privatisation in his speech candidates for November's first police and crime commissioner elections . He also urged the first holders of the newly created role to increase collaboration between constabularies. 'I hope you will all consider the value of private sector partnering to achieve both cost savings and better services for the public,' Mr Green said at a national briefing day held by the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners in London. 'Every pound saved means a pound saved to be used on the front line putting officers on the streets. 'I want more officers to be out there getting on with the job of fighting crime - we all know they can't do it if they are bogged down with red tape and form filling.' He said the police would remain 'a public service accountable to the people', adding that decisions on business partnering would be taken by elected commissioner so people are given a say. 'I'm sure police and crime commissioners will also want to exploit the benefits that collaboration brings to their forces, and will be guided by the duty to collaborate where it is in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of their own or another police force,' he added. G4S is bidding for a series of contracts to take over civilian jobs in police forces, including a bid to part run a police station in Lincolnshire. The company only told Olympics organisers it would fail to supply enough staff just a fortnight before the Games began, forcing ministers to draft in thousands of soldiers to plug the gaps. London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe has told the Home Affairs Select Committee that overcoming the failure of G4S to deliver on their contract was the biggest challenge he faced in delivering a successful Games. Buck stops here: G4S chief executive Nick . Buckles gives evidence on Olympic security to an earlier hearing of the Home Affairs Select Committee in June . G4S chief executive Nick Buckles said he could draw his 28-year career with the group to a close if he is found to be accountable for the company’s failure to provide the guards for the Olympics. Appearing before the same group of MPs yesterday, Buckles admitted the buck stopped with him. The company has brought in forensic accountants PwC to help with an investigation into what went wrong. One of the aims of the report, which is expected later this month, is to find out which G4S executives contributed to the failure. Mr Buckles told MPs: ‘I am the chief executive. If a contract goes wrong I take the pain for that. ‘I will wait to see the outcome of the review.’ He added: ‘I have been with the group for 28 years, I have been chief executive 10 years. It’s been a big investment for my whole career. ‘It is only after me talking to the board and the board talking to shareholders that that decision will be made.’ Soldiers patrol the Olympic Park: Thousands of troops were drafted in for Olympics security after G4S announced it would be unable to fulfil its contract . Payments to G4S were stopped within 48 hours of the firm admitting on July 11 that it would not be able to provide all 10,400 guards on time. The contract had been worth £284million when signed last December but was scaled back to £236million, Deighton said. Executives at G4S will lock horns with Locog to negotiate over how much of the remaining £150m the company receives. It already said it expects to make a £50m loss on the contract.","Damian Green said partnerships between police and private companies would save money .

"James Whitmarsh claimed he was not in control of his actions after eating seafood starter . Jury took just 40 minutes to acquit him of one count of sexual assault . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:05 EST, 15 December 2011 . Cleared: BBC producer James Whitmarsh . A former BBC producer has been cleared of sexually assaulting a female paramedic after he claimed it was the fault of some oysters he had eaten earlier. James Whitmarsh, 41, groped the medic after friends called an ambulance because he was acting strangely following a Christmas meal. Southwark Crown Court heard Whitmarsh had grabbed the paramedic’s buttocks and put his hand between her legs while he was being treated. But he claimed he had not been in control of his actions after suffering a bad reaction to a seafood starter. A jury took just 40 minutes to acquit Whitmarsh of one count of sexual assault. During his trial jurors were told it ‘likely’ Whitmarsh had been poisoned by toxins in an oyster he ate and was not conscious of his actions. Expert toxicologist and pharmacologist Professor Nicholas Birch said naturally occurring toxins filtered through the shellfish in the sea may not have been properly removed before it was served. Prof Birch said: ‘In my view if you’ve got mixed batches of oysters it’s possible that oysters from one source that have been incorrectly cleaned got into that batch. ‘Even a single oyster might affect someone.’ Southwark Crown Court, pictured, heard Whitmarsh had not been in control of his actions after suffering a bad reaction to a seafood starter . Whitmarsh was accused of launching the . assault against the medic, who cannot be named for legal reasons, while . she treated him on the night of December 13. The ambulance had been called for . after he began acting erratically, swinging his arms around and . answering questions with the word ‘Honk’ while eating out in London’s . West End. Mr Whitmarsh ate oysters and smoked salmon as a starter a court heard . Whitmarsh had drunk a pint of lager, prosecco and white wine during the evening and his friends had concluded he was drunk. But Prof Birch said the effects of . that amount of alcohol would not have been likely to lead to the . symptoms Whitmarsh displayed. Defence counsel Ross Cohen asked: ‘Was Mr Whitmarsh likely to have been aware of what he was doing when the ambulance attended?’ Prof Birch replied: ‘From what ‘I’ve heard of the evidence he would not have been aware.’ The barrister then asked: ‘And therefore it is fair to say his actions may not have been under his conscious control?’ Prof Birch answered: ‘That’s fair.’ ‘And in your professional opinion . that’s likely to have been caused by poisoning and highly unlikely to . have been caused by alcohol?’ asked Mr Cohen. Prof Birch replied: ‘That’s correct.’ He told the court it was also . possible Whitmarsh could have been suffered from ‘scombroid food . poisoning’ contracted from a piece of salmon. Giving evidence the paramedic, who is . in her thirties, said: ‘I felt his hand reach underneath and grab me. I . could feel his fingers, so I wouldn’t call his touch soft. His hand was . grabbing at me as he groped. ‘Had I not been wearing thick trousers, it would have felt a lot worse.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","James Whitmarsh claimed he was not in control of his actions after eating seafood starter .

President Obama is weighing 19 different gun control measures that he could enforce without congressional approval as he prepares to unveil on Wednesday a comprehensive plan to address gun violence. Vice President Joe Biden discussed some of the measures with House Democrats during a meeting Monday, after Obama confirmed during the final press conference of his first term that he was prepared to side-step Congress to strengthen laws regulating firearms. 'It was all focusing on enforcing existing law, administering things like improving the background database, things like that that do not involve a change in the law but enforcing and making sure that the present law is administered as well as possible,' Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia told Politico about the meeting with Biden. Scroll down for video . President Obama is weighing 19 different gun control measures that he could enforce without congressional approval . 'I think everybody acknowledges that the assault weapons ban is a challenge, but other things — like the size of the magazines, the background checks, straw purchases — are all things that have a good chance of passing.' Obama will be joined by Biden and a group of children from around the country who wrote letters to the president concerning gun safety in the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut last month that left 27 people dead. Republicans claim that Obama would be . overstepping his bounds by taking executive actions on gun control, and . Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, has threatened impeachment as a result. 'The President’s actions are not just an attack on the Constitution and a violation of his sworn oath of office – they are a direct attack on Americans that place all of us in danger,' Stockman said. 'I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including, but not limited to, eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment.' The executive orders under review may include granting greater power to federal authorities for gun research, as well as measures requiring background checks for gun dealers' employees, wider sharing of gun databases between federal and state agencies and stricter regulations on gun inventories. Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading Obama's push for greater gun controls, discussed some of the potential executive actions with House Democrats during a meeting Monday . 'I'm confident that there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation and that are within my authority as president,' Obama said Monday. Obama will reveal which measures he is considering on Wednesday, when he is planning to present Congress with his comprehensive plan to address gun control. He is also reviewing measures that would need congressional approval, including an assault weapons ban and a limit on high-capacity magazine ammunition. Gun rights groups fear that tighter controls will restrict responsible, sane adults from owning, obtaining and using certain firearms. Obama said Monday that those fears are unfounded. 'Part of the challenge we confront is that even the slightest hint of some sensible responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow here it comes, and everybody's guns are going to be taken away,' Obama said. He blamed gun rights groups for 'ginning up' those fears. 'My starting point is not to worry about the politics,' Obama said. 'My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works. What should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we're reducing the incidence of gun violence?'","Executive orders may include granting greater power to federal authorities for gun research and measures requiring wider sharing of gun databases between federal and state agencies .

A high school special education teacher in Ohio was sentenced to four years in prison today for sleeping with one of her developmentally disabled students. Sonya Horn, 32, pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence by altering phone records in her bid to cover-up her encounters with the 18-year-old student. Horn also entered Alford no contest pleas to four counts of sexual battery. The sexual abuse took place at Johnstown High School and another location from between June and October 2011. During that period, Horn got married, the Columbus Dispatch said. Sick: Sonya Horn, 32, admitted to sexually abusing her 18-year-old, developmentally disabled student. Horn, who was married while the abuse occurred, was sentenced to four years in prison today. “I know a lot of people are going to think because this was a female . teacher and a male student it is less serious, but it’s more serious,” said Licking County Assistant Prosecutor Brian Waltz about the four-year jail term. “This was a special needs student who was led on by her and seriously thought she was in love with him.” Waltz added that the victim came to believe they would spend the rest of their lives together. Horn, who had her teacher's certificate permanently revoked and will have to register as a sex offender for the rest of her life, broke into tears when Judge Thomas Marcelain announced her sentence, the Newark Advocate reported. Neither she, nor her victim who was present, spoke at the hearing. By entering an Alford plea, Horn, a former intervention specialist, does not have to admit to the sexual abuse, but concedes there's enough evidence against her for a conviction. Even though the student was above the age of consent, it is illegal in Ohio for a teacher to have sexual contact with a student. Abuse: Horn sexually assaulted her student at Johnstown High School on campus as well as another location . Horn's lawyer, Mark Collins, said, 'She brought shame on her profession. She is looking for a chance to make up for the trauma she caused.' He said Horn claimed the victim was stalking her and she had to file an order of protection against him.

Charles Rodriguez, 31, fled the UK after robbing a diamond trader in ‘an appalling attack’ in Manchester in October 2011. But police caught up with him after he brazenly posted holiday snaps of himself enjoying the sights of London and Rio de Janeiro on his Facebook page. He was jailed for five years and four months at Manchester Crown Court today after pleading guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing. Rodriguez, who is thought to be a member of the London-based South American organised crime group The Latin Kings, threw the trader to the floor with another male during the robbery. They stole the keys to his car and opened his boot during the attack on Singleton Road in Broughton Park, Salford, making off with two briefcases containing diamonds and pearls worth more than £80,000. Detectives in the Salford Volume Crime Team trawled hours of CCTV footage and identified the culprits who were following the trader on the day of the robbery. They followed them from Manchester city centre back to Salford on October 12, 2011, the day of the attack. Brazen 'arrogance': Detectives continued to monitor Rodriguez, who posted holiday photos in London, Rio de Janiero and Mexico City (pictured), travelling on a false passport . After an analysis of his social networking use and analysis of telecommunications evidence, officers discovered he had fled the UK and returned to Columbia about a month after the robbery. He then posted his holiday snaps including one showing him draped in a Rio de Janeiro flag on what appears to be a tourist boat. He had purchased two tickets for a TAM airlines flight to Rio de Janeiro on November 10, 2011 and left using a false passport in the name of ‘Mr Chiguichon-Lopez’. Detectives discovered Rodriguez had returned home to Columbia after his holiday in Brazil, but they were unable to arrest him as Columbia is a non-extradition country.

Hopefully it's a sign that the weather will be better this year.’ Beauty: A winter red sky soon emerged as the sun rose over Bristol. Forecasters expect cold, frosty and more wintry weather to return to the UK this week . New day: Allotments are just visible as the winter sun rises . Met Office forecaster Craig Snell . said: ‘Temperatures will trend colder, with . frost more widespread, and it is most likely to remain cold into next . week with wintry showers, especially in central and eastern parts, with . overnight frosts but also a good deal of fine and dry weather. ‘Later next week is most likely to . remain colder than average, and from January 21 to February 4, there is . an increasing probability of a trend to colder conditions relative to . what we have seen so far this winter. ‘This brings the risk of spells of . colder-than-average conditions and wintry weather, especially across . northern and eastern areas.’ Tom Tobler, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'It will be freezing in some areas this week but could get slightly colder if the skies are clearer than forecast. 'This would be a return to more typical January temperatures than the milder weather we've been having. There is the potential next week for some colder weather.' Mr Snell added: ‘From . next weekend, there is a lot of uncertainty in the forecast. We’re on . the boundary between colder air and warmer air.' After a miserable 2012 - the second wettest on record - the prospect of a dry start to 2013 was welcome.

Fredrick Baer once claimed to be so soft-hearted that he cried if a butterfly hit his windscreen. He is devoted to his pet cat Lucky, whom he describes as his ‘heart, soul and world’. Yet one chilling day last year I sat with him in his cell on Death Row in the Indiana State Prison and listened to him describe how he had slit the throat of a young mother and partially decapitated her four-year-old daughter. It had been a random attack while Baer was high on crystal meth and marijuana. His victims were strangers to him, a woman and a child simply unlucky enough to answer the door when he knocked at their home. His wickedness makes him an outcast even among other Death Row inmates at this notorious maximum security penitentiary. As Baer himself told me: ‘I think I probably deserve to die.’ Moving tales: Trevor McDonald in Indiana State Prison where he came face to face with some of America's most dangerous prisoners and every-day life on Death Row . By the time he had finished speaking even the hardened legal professionals alongside me were ashen. Although his guilt was not in doubt, Baer had never divulged such detail before, and while he was securely handcuffed, I could not wait to get out of his cell. I was, I admit, terrified. I thought: ‘What the hell am I doing in here? Why am I sitting on the bed of a man  on Death Row with absolutely nothing to lose?’ The answer was to make a ground-breaking documentary about a subject that divides the civilised world: capital punishment. What does it mean to exist in the shadow of a death sentence, or a jail term of a century of more? There are 1,900 inmates in Indiana State Prison. Twelve are on Death Row and many others have sentences far in excess of their natural life span. I was invited to spend two weeks among them, given unprecedented access to multiple murderers, cop killers, gang members, drug-runners, hitmen and sexual deviants. I needed a lot of convincing to say yes, and if my mother had been alive, she’d have told me I was crazy. It was a fortnight filled with surprises. The first was that I thought I would find, as in the iconic prison film The Shawshank Redemption, that ‘everyone is innocent’. That was not the case. Softer side of a kill: Death Row inmate Frederick Baer lives for his pet cat Lucy, yet this is the same man who slit the throat of an innocent young mother and nearly decapitated her child . Here were dozens of men talking freely about their crimes. There was a lot of blunt self-assessment and some profoundly sad reflections such as from one Death Row inmate whose criminal career began with stealing the cookie jar in kindergarten. He was always last in the queue for a cookie and was often missed out, so one day he simply stole the jar. When he grew up he shot and killed a policeman. They were articulate, knowing men, perhaps none more so than double murderer Ronald L. Sanford. He killed two pensioners when he was aged just 13. He escaped Death Row but got a 170-year sentence. He will only be eligible for parole in 100 years. He’s never been to a school prom, never driven a car or travelled abroad. In his cell I found him reading books about eugenics and metaphysics, a way of escape for a man who has none. He’s a bit of a poster boy for Indiana Prison – yet I still had to interview him in a steel cage. That’s the reality of life lived in lockdown 23 hours a day. About the one place where there is an air of normality is the prison barber’s shop. It’s for inmates and staff alike but is run by prisoners who handle scissors and razors. It was cosy and filled with easy banter and bonhomie. The barbers were in perfectly ironed tops, their leather wallets in breast pockets. Indiana State Prison: The perimeters of the prison are enforced, covered in barbed wire and kitted out with cameras and the constantly watching eyes of the guards . One was apologising that his moustache was not properly waxed that day. He looked like your favourite uncle, or someone who might turn up with your gifts at Christmas, yet he had been a hitman. Despite this, and despite the feuds and fights which are a potent undercurrent to prison life, there has never been an incident in the shop. And it was while in there that I came closest to understanding prison life. The prisoners had a powerful work ethic and were busy and fulfilled doing something for others. They were, I suppose, the maximum security equivalent of model citizens and were leading, insofar as they could, complete lives. Yet at the end of the day they returned to cells within shouting distance of Death Row. The inmate who runs the barber’s shop had a wall of photographs. He’d mounted them on cardboard so he could take them with him if he ever gets out. He won’t, of course, which raises another question about America’s judicial system: what is the difference between being given 150 years or being on Death Row? The answer, I suppose, is hope and arriving at some kind of modus vivendi. One inmate was married to a woman in St Albans, while Baer had a girlfriend in Germany and spent his time imagining her pottering around her kitchen cooking dinner. Growing up behind bars: Sir Trevor McDonald with Ronald L. Sanford who is serving a 170-year sentence for committing a double-murder at the age of 13 . One Death Row prisoner was obsessed with the late Princess Diana and had papered his cell with pictures of her, including the famous Mario Testino portrait of her in a strapless white dress and tiara. He said he believed in her goodness and likened her to Jesus Christ or Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Another, who had killed his wife and two children, had never learned to read or write, so he polished his cell and its contents until they shone. A lot had turned to religion for solace. Several, including Baer, had joined a pet adoption programme and been given cats to look after. The idea is to make inmates more passive because ownership encourages a sense of responsibility. And there’s real affection there. One cat called Rascal had made friends among other prisoners besides his owner: no one from that gang of murderers would kill a cat. They would kill each other perhaps, but not a cat. The men’s common fate has given rise to some unusual friendships, most of the ‘he’s got my back and I’ve got his,’ nature. Inmates have their own codes of conduct and specific hatreds. The cop killer described some of the other inmates as ‘sharks circling’, yet his bravado gave way to vulnerability when he spoke to me about his past. I am no amateur psychologist, but it struck me that their early lives were not ideal. I didn’t particularly like any of them but it was impossible to cut yourself off entirely from a sense of sadness at the circumstances which brought them to prison. I was horrified by what they had done, but you’d be lacking any humanity and empathy if you did not feel for someone preparing to be put to death by the state. Final rest: The trolley to which Death Row prisoners are strapped prior to the lethal injection . The time we saw the gurney – the trolley on which a condemned man is strapped prior to execution – was, I think, the defining moment for me. Imagination is even more powerful than reality and the real fear lay in the Superintendent (the prison governor) saying: ‘These are the steps the condemned man would take, this is the isolation room where he would wait to be taken to the gurney . . .’ I was left imagining someone’s last . hours in that room with just  a pair of slippers, a TV screen, a clock . on the wall, and their every movement watched. I wrestled with that: how does one . come to terms with the final hour of life in a room adjoining an . execution chamber? The gurney itself is just nuts and bolts, straps and . handcuffs, but what goes through the mind? I saw an image of that room . when  I went back to my hotel and I can see it now. I can still . visualise the yellow slippers waiting for the feet of a condemned man. The Superintendent is a fascinating . character. He visits the men on Death Row every week and – this was . another shock – gets to know the men over whose executions he will . eventually preside. He says: . ‘Our course in life throws us together. At one particular juncture we . will participate in the same event.’ He means the death of one  of them. I am not a religious person but the Superintendent told me he had made peace with God about his job and I took him at his word. End of the road: Death Row at Indiana State Prison currently hosts 12 of the prison's 1,900 inmates . I have never accepted the philosophy of state killing and my mind has not been changed by this experience. But I do understand why that system is in place for people like Fredrick Baer, and why American voters continue to support it. When I emerged from Baer’s cell after hearing him speak in such detail, there was absolute silence. Usually there is professional banter common to all TV jobs: bad jokes and teasing and chat, but after that there was just a hush. I was deeply affected by the depth of evil described in the interview and, like everybody on the crew, I found myself in need of a stiff drink. Baer, who committed his double murder in 2004 and was sentenced a year later, is likely to be the next man at Indiana sent for execution. There is a natural momentum to human life, to our work and relationships but the men I met on Death Row exist in a state of stasis. They are prisoners of the past, trapped in the present, with no true future. It was that which scared and  saddened me the most. Not the locks and keys or cages, or even the gurney. It was the fact that all they have left in their lives is time, and for some of them even that is running out.

Police have released a trove of chilling photos of beautiful young women they fear may be unidentified victims of a 1970s serial killer who has already been convicted of six murders. The intimate pictures feature women in compromising positions, were taken by Rodney Alcala, 69 - the so-called 'Dating Game killer' who was a professional photographer before being sentenced to death row. They come from a cache of hundreds of of portraits that Alcala kept in a storage locker in Seattle. After years of researching the pictures, detectives still have been unable to identify more than 120 of the women and their fates are unknown. Scroll down for video . Predator: Convicted serial killer Rodney Alcala met many potential victims by convincing he was a fashion photographer who wanted them to pose for him . Searching: If you recognise any of the women in these images, contact the Huntington Beach police in California . Doomed: Rodney Alcala, 69, (pictured last Monday) is currently awaiting execution on death row in California . Investigators fear some or all of these women may have also been murdered by Alcala. Detective Pat Ellis told CBS News in . 2010 that police received a tip when Alcala's sister visited him in . jail, and he mentioned a storage locker in Seattle, Washington, which . ‘the cops don’t know about’. The detective said Alcala was recorded . as saying: 'It's a good thing they don't know about this. I don't have . to tell them about it. Do me a favour - get the stuff out of there… get . it cleared out.’ But Alcala was unaware that police . discovered a receipt for the locker at his home - and discovered . hundreds of photos inside of women in ‘positions of supreme . vulnerability’, Detective Ellis said. Alcala, 69, of California - who has . been in prison since 1979 - is a former photographer and infamously . appeared as ‘bachelor number one’ on the TV show Dating Game in 1978. He was sentenced to 25 years to life . in prison in New York last week for the murders of Cornelia Crilley, 23, . and Ellen Hover, 23, in Manhattan, New York, in 1971 and 1977.

Alcala said last month he wanted to . plead guilty to the two New York murders so he could get back to . California, where he was sentenced to death over five other killings, to . pursue an appeal there. The killer had complained that his . jailers in New York would not give him access to a laptop computer and . legal records. He was imprisoned last Monday at the State . Supreme Court in Manhattan. Crilley was found strangled in her . flat in 1971 and Hover was living in Manhattan when she vanished in . 1977. Her remains were found the next year in the woods on a suburban . estate. ‘This kind of case is something I've . never experienced - hope to never again,’ Judge Bonnie Whittner said, . choking back tears. When she finished sentencing him, she put her head . in her hand. Crilley's sister said in a statement . that she was missed. Kaitie Stigell thanked police and prosecutors for . treating Crilley like she mattered, because ‘she matters to us and she . always will’. Ladies' man: Alcala had a way with women, and even appeared on the Dating Game in 1978 . Horror: Upon sentencing him for his part in the deaths of two women in New York in the 1970s, a judge wept calling his crimes 'inexplicably brutal and horrific' Machine: Authorities described Alcala as one of history's most brutal and focused serial killers . Killer: Before his 2013 sentencing, Alcala had already been convicted in the murders of five other women . Potential victims: Hundreds of images where discovered in Alcala's storage . Evil: Alcala was known to sexually assault his victims before strangling them . Stigell was asked later about the . judge's emotional reaction. ‘It was overwhelming and it meant a lot to . me,’ she said. ‘It's just a testament of how everybody involved in this . has been so good.’ Hover's sisters said in a statement . that ‘her senseless murder irreparably damaged our family’. They spoke . of her estranged brother's drug abuse and suicide, and their mother's . struggles with alcohol. Alcala has spent three decades . tangling with California authorities in a series of trials and . overturned convictions. He was found guilty in 2010 of killing four . women and a 12-year-old girl in the 1970s. He had been eyed in Hover's death for . decades and in Crilley's killing for at least several years.

New answers: A new study suggests an alternate explanation for the apparent link between teen pot use and a drop in IQ scores in adulthood . A new analysis is challenging a report that suggests regular marijuana smoking during the teen years can lead to a long-term drop in IQ. The analysis says the statistical analysis behind that conclusion is flawed. The original study, reported last August, included more than 1,000 people who'd been born in the town of Dunedin, New Zealand. Their IQ was tested at ages 13 and 38, and they were asked about marijuana use periodically between those ages. Researchers at Duke University and elsewhere found that participants who'd reported becoming dependent on pot by age 18 showed a drop in IQ score between ages 13 and 38. The findings suggest pot is harmful to the adolescent brain, the researchers said. But not so fast, says an analysis published online Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Ole Rogeberg of the Ragnar Frisch Center for Economic Research in Oslo, says the IQ trend might have nothing to do with pot. Rather, it may have emerged from differences among the study participants in socioeconomic status, or SES, which involves factors like income, education and occupation, he says. He based his paper on a computer simulation. It traced what would happen to IQ scores over time if they were affected by differences in SES in ways suggested by other research, but not by smoking marijuana. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The challenger: Ole Rogeberg of Oslo, Norway, ran the numbers and thinks socioeconomic factors could explain the apparent link between pot and IQ score . He found patterns that looked just like what the Duke study found. In an interview, Rogeberg said he's not . claiming that his alternative explanation is definitely right, just that . the methods and evidence in the original study aren't enough to rule it . out. He suggested further analyses the researchers could do. The Duke scientists, who learned of Rogeberg's analysis late last week, say they conducted new statistical tests to assess his proposed explanation. Their verdict: It's wrong. Duke University replies: Researchers from the prominent institution were among the first to discover the pot/IQ link. They are now saying the Norway study is wrong . Rogeberg says they need to do still more work to truly rule it out. Experts unconnected to the two papers said the Rogeberg paper doesn't overturn the original study. It 'raises some interesting points and possibilities,' but provides 'speculation' rather than new data based on real people, said Dr. Duncan Clark, who studies alcohol and drug use in adolescents at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said observational studies of people like the Duke work can't definitively demonstrate that marijuana cause irreversible effects on the brain. In an email, she said Rogeberg's paper 'looks sound' but doesn't prove that his alternative explanation is correct.

Taxpayers are handing nearly £500,000 a week in legal aid to prisoners to help them make human rights claims. In four years, convicts have been given more than £93million to help them demand early release from jail, compensation or softer treatment behind bars. The bill has spiralled from £1million a year before the Human Rights Act came into force to more than £25million in 2010. Freed with tax: Convicted burglar Wayne Bishop celebrates his release from prison on the grounds of his five children's human rights . Since then prisoners addicted to heroin have used legal aid to win thousands in compensation for being forced to go ‘cold turkey’ when locked up. In another notorious case, a rapist was given legal aid to claim his rights were breached by having to ‘slop out’ because there was no lavatory in his cell. And in May 2011 burglar Wayne Bishop was released from jail after the Court of Appeal ruled that locking him up breached his family’s human rights. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has . ordered a review of legal aid payouts over the damaging ‘compensation . culture’ gripping jails. Robert . Oxley, campaign manager of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Britain’s . legal aid bill has become unsustainable and must be reformed. Review: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to look into the 'compensation culture' in Britain's jails . ‘It’s important that prisoners, like . everyone else, have access to justice, but this must not be abused. Taxpayers are sick to death of paying for frivolous legal actions by . inmates who do it simply because someone else is paying.’ Figures released under the Freedom of . Information Act show £93,482,475 has been spent on legal aid for . prisoners in the four years since 2008. That is the equivalent of . £449,435 a week. It was £19.7million in 2008, but rose . to £24.2million in 2009. It peaked in the last year of the Labour . government at £25.7million in 2010 and fell back to £23.6million last . year. The total excludes criminal legal aid . and is for internal prison matters only – cases brought by burglars, . rapists and other convicts while they are behind bars. All 143 prisons in England and Wales . are required have legal services officers whose job is to ‘identify . prisoners who may be eligible for publicly funded legal services’. Inmates can demand lawyers to represent them at Parole Board hearings which decide whether they are safe to be released. They can also use legal representation . to demand better treatment from governors, or fight disciplinary cases . over breaking jail rules. Such cases involve fights with other inmates, . disobeying instructions or being caught with drugs or phones. A . breakdown of the costs shows ‘free-standing advice and assistance’ for . inmates cost nearly £53.6million over four years. Assistance at . disciplinary hearings cost more than £12.6million and lawyers at Parole . Board hearings cost more than £27million. Mr . Grayling said: ‘After years spiralling out of control, rising by 2,500 . per cent in a decade, the bill to the taxpayer has started to fall. ‘I . am concerned about public confidence in the legal aid system. I have . ordered an urgent review into aspects of the system that affect its . credibility with the public. ‘Legal aid is a fundamental part of . our legal system, but resources aren’t limitless. Legal aid should be . reserved for cases where there is genuine need.’ In . October one of the country’s most senior judges, Lord Justice Davis, . warned that human rights laws mean ‘unthinkable’ cases were coming . before the courts. Half-million help: Hate preacher Abu Qatada has received over £500,000 in legal aid and has been released to live in a benefits funded home costing the taxpayer £1,400 a month . He made the comments as he dismissed a case brought by two prisoners – rapist Desmond Grant, who was given legal aid, and paedophile Roger Gleaves – who demanded an end to ‘slopping out’ in prisons in England and Wales. They said the use of buckets in cells at Albany prison on the Isle of Wight was a breach of human rights but the judge threw out the claim, saying buckets were used rarely, the inmates had exaggerated their use of them and there was no evidence they had suffered any distress, anxiety, or feelings of humiliation or hurt. Yesterday a spokesman for the Legal Services Commission, which awards legal aid, said: ‘The rules on legal aid for prisoner treatment cases were tightened in 2010. ‘Prisoners will receive funding only once they have gone through the prison complaints procedure without their problem being resolved, and only where there is an allegation of serious mistreatment which proves their case has sufficient legal merit.’ Convicted burglar Wayne Bishop was let out of jail early after a judge ruled that locking him up breached his family’s human rights. In a judgment in 2010, the Appeal Court said the rights of Wayne Bishop’s five children were more important than those of his victims or the interests of justice. The hate preacher Abu Qatada has . received more than £500,000 in legal aid in his decade-long legal battle . against the Government, which wants to deport him to his native Jordan . where he is wanted on charges of terrorism. The Al Qaeda fanatic was held in a . high security prison for eight years but was released to live in a . £1,400-a-month property – paid for with state handouts – while he fights . his deportation on human rights grounds. Judges released him after a month of his eight-month sentence for burglary and dangerous driving. Unemployed Bishop, who admitted he had ‘never thought’ the judges would free him, claimed at the time that he was ‘going straight’ for the sake of his children. But less than a month later he attacked a man in a supermarket as horrified shoppers looked on. At the time of his release 33-year-old Bishop said: ‘I’m a lucky boy and I’m on top of the world.’ The Appeal Court had been told he was the sole carer of his children, aged from six to 13, for five nights a week. After he was jailed the children had been cared for by his sister during the week and their mother, Bishop’s ex-partner Tracey York, 30, at weekends. His sister, a single parent, was already responsible for seven children and lived seven miles from the schools attended by her nieces and nephews. Bishop, of Nottingham, said his wife Sandra, 36, was never considered as a possible carer for the children because she had four of her own and he and his wife lived at separate addresses with their own children.","Taxpayers' money used to fund human rights claims by prisoners .

Hundreds of thousands of Britons living in Spain or with holiday homes there risk being the worst hit as property prices  continue to plummet. Analysts warn values could slump by another 50 per cent in the crisis-hit nation, with the biggest falls in coastal areas full of apartments and villas owned by those from the UK. The slide threatens to be so bad that swathes of half-built or unsold holiday homes along the Mediterranean coast will simply have to be demolished as no-one wants them, even at rock-bottom prices. Hit: Costa Malaga has always been a popular destination for British tourists but house prices are falling rapidly . Plummet: House prices in Marbella have already fallen 50 per cent . The warning came from RR de Acuna . & Asociados, one of the country’s leading economic consultancies. It . predicts the relentless gloom could stretch more than a decade – even . up to 15 years – with falls of up to 50 per cent along the coast where . around 400,000 Britons live or own homes. Group vice-president Fernando Rodriguez de Acuna said: ‘The market is broken. ‘In places like Castellon [near . Valencia], where over-development was mad, banks are not financing . anything and there is a high prob- ability these properties will never . be sold. They will have to be knocked down. Spanish bank Santander slashed house prices by 60 per cent to clear backlog . 800,000 houses are still on the market . 250,000 are currently being built . 300,000 homes have been foreclosed .

Marbella has already fallen by 50 per cent and . prices are going down and down.’ The firm’s latest analysis suggests the total decline from peak to trough could end up at 75 per cent in some areas. The downturn has blighted the . retirement of Valerie Burch, from Brixham, Devon, who planned to sell . her seafront duplex apartment in Caleta de Velez, east of Malaga. It was worth £180,000 in 2008 but has . dropped by a third to £120,000 by September. The 72-year-old said: ‘I am . devastated. I was thinking of selling this year to help me in my . retirement but I would never recoup my investment.’ Mr Rodriguez de Acuna said there were . almost two million properties waiting to be sold, with ‘no progress at . all’ over the last five years to clear up the backlog. He expects the crisis to also hit the . capital Madrid and major cities like Barcelona, with prices down 30 per . cent and no pick-up until 2018. ‘There are 800,000 used homes on the market,’ he added. ‘Developers are sitting on a further 700,000 completed units.

'On Friday, December 14th, I put two children on the bus and only one came home. 'I pray that no mother, father, grandparent or caregiver of children ever have to go through this pain,' said Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose six-year-old daughter Ana Marquez-Greene, a first grader with brown eyes and black curls, was killed in the shooting.

At a press conference on Monday families launched a grassroots initiative called Sandy Hook Promise to support solutions for a safer community . Francine Wheeler holds a photo of her son Benjamin Wheeler, 6, a victim of the massacre on December 14, 2012. Parents of the children helped launch The Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit organization created in response to the shootings . One month after the shootings that left 20 children and six adults dead, the group, called Sandy Hook Promise, vowed at a press conference to transform public outrage into action to 'make our communities and our nation a safer, better place.' Named for Sandy Hook Elementary School where the shootings took place, the group pledged to hold debates on wide-ranging safety issues and come up with a plan of action. At least half a dozen pairs of parents of children slain in the attack appeared on stage with the organizers, some making their first public appearances since the shooting, all holding photographs of their son or daughter. 'There is no quick-fix single action but instead a multitude of interlinked actions that are needed,' said Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan, a blue-eyed, blond-haired six year old, was also killed.

The killings plunged the rural New England town of 27,000 into grief along with much of the country and prompted President Barack Obama to form a task force headed by Vice President Joe Biden to find ways to curb gun violence. Biden is due to submit recommendations as early as Tuesday. He has said that he will recommend universal background checks for gun buyers and limits on the ammunition capacity of magazines. Gun rights groups said on Sunday that these restrictions would fail in Congress. The Newtown group offered no specific solution or policy position, but co-founder Thomas Bittman said its aim is to drive a national conversation on three issues: gun ownership and regulation, mental health, and school and public safety. 'Some of us who came together to start Sandy Hook Promise are gun owners,' Bittman said. 'We hunt. We target shoot. We protect our homes. We're collectors. We teach our sons and daughters how to use guns safely. Family members of the Sandy Hook victims arrive at the press conference, all carrying a photograph of their relatives . Tim Makris, co-founder of the Sandy Hook Promise, speaks at the podium to victims' families . 'We're not afraid of a national conversation within our community and in Congress about responsibility and accountability,' Bittman said. The National Rifle Association, the biggest gun rights lobby group, has predicted that Obama's drive for new limits on firearms and ammunition sales will fail in Congress. U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut who attended the event in the basement gymnasium of Newtown's former town hall, warned the NRA against being too confident of congressional inaction. 'I think what is possible politically today changed a month ago today,' Murphy said, referring to the December 14 school attack. 'It's the NRA's job to say that no gun control legislation can pass Congress, but they're wrong.' The elementary school, about 70 miles northeast of New York City, remains closed to everyone but police who are still investigating the attack. Its students, more than 400 children in kindergarten through fourth grade, are attending school in the neighboring town of Monroe. Residents on Sunday began debating what to do with the school itself. At a town meeting attended by several hundred people, including Sandy Hook parents, it was clear there is no early consensus on whether the building should ever be used again as a school. Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra, the town's top elected official, said it would be months before a decision on the facility's future is reached. Authorities have not offered a motive for the attack. The gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, killed his mother before driving to the school and shot himself dead after the rampage. The press conference was a sombre affair for all at the press conference .

But as the broadcaster unveiled its colourful new logo yesterday, not everyone was so flattering in their assessment. The design was immediately ridiculed by some viewers who said it reminded them of a child’s crayon drawing or even the outline of a human bottom. Ridiculed: ITV launched a new logo for all its channels yesterday but it was likened to a child's crayon drawing by one viewers and a bottom by another . The logo is part of a multi-million pound rebrand – ITV’s biggest in 12 years – launched at 6am yesterday across all the network’s channels. As well as introducing a new lower case logo, designed to look like joined up handwriting, the broadcaster renamed its flagship channel. Known as ITV1 since 2001 it will now simply be called ITV. The logo will change colour to match the tone of different programmes and channels. ITV News has a sombre blue design, while entertainment channel ITV2 has been given a ‘hot red’ logo. The broadcaster also introduced a series of new ‘idents’, the branded segments shown between programmes while announcers give scheduling information. Biggest in 12 years: The logo is part of a multi-million pound rebrand and it will change colour to match the tone of different programmes and channels . However, the new look divided opinion among viewers. Writing on Twitter, one said: ‘The new ITV logo looks like a child practising joined up writing with crayons.’ Another added: ‘Hmm. New ITV logo does look a little bit like a bottom.’ A third said: ‘The new ITV logo looks like something a local charity would use after Debbie in marketing goes on a half-day photoshop course.’ Loves it: ITV's This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield is a fan of the new logo in the redesign which took over a year to plan . However, other viewers welcomed the change. One said: ‘Love the new rebranding, very fresh and modern.’ Unsurprisingly, ITV’s This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield was also a fan, declaring: ‘I love the new ITV logo!’ Produced by ITV’s in-house creative team, the redesign took over a year to plan. Rufus Radcliffe, ITV’s group director of marketing and research, said: ‘Viewers now have access to hundreds of channels and are forming relationships with digital brands that did not exist a few years ago. ‘The rebranding of ITV will allow us to further cement the relationship in viewers’ minds between our shows and the ITV brand that produces and broadcasts them. ‘We now have a consistent identity across everything that we do, all rooted in our positioning as a media brand that is at the heart of popular culture.’ This is not the first time a TV rebrand has divided opinion. In 2008, the BBC were criticised for spending £550,000 on a new logo for its news operation. Viewers complained the swirling red globe left them feeling nauseous and dizzy.","The new logo is part of a multi-million pound rebrand .

The US has closed evacuated its embassy as rebels close in on the capital of Central African Republic. The US ambassador and other diplomats were evacuated by plane overnight amid fears rebels could try to take the capital Bangui. US officials said about 40 people were evacuated on an US Air Force plane bound for Kenya. It comes after President Francois Bozize called for urgent help from France and other foreign powers to fend off the rebels who are quickly seizing territory and approaching the capital Bangui. Plea: Supporters of President Francois Bozize chant during his speech in the capital city Bangui where he appealed for help from France and other foreign powers . Denied: Former colonial ruler France has refused to provide military assistance to Bozize (centre) but is trying to broker peace talks . The UN Security Council condemned the recent violence and expressed concern about the developments. 'The members of the Security Council reiterate their demand that the armed groups immediately cease hostilities, withdraw from captured cities and cease any further advance towards the city of Bangui,' the statement said. But France said it will not offer any military assistance and the developments suggest the country could be on the brink of another violent change in government. Mr Bozize came to power nearly a decade ago in the wake of a rebellion. Speaking to crowds in the capital, which is home to 600,000 people, the president pleaded with foreign powers to do what they could. He pointed in particular to France, Central African Republic's former colonial ruler. About 200 French soldiers are already in the country, providing technical support and helping to train the local army, according to the French defence ministry. Under siege: Bozize, centre in blue, has been pledged help by neighbour Chad in the fight against the rebels who are closing in on the capital city . Anger: Protesters were angry that France refused to provide military assistance . The landlocked Central African Republic is one of the world's poorest despite having a wealth of diamonds, timber and gold . 'France has the means to stop (the rebels) but unfortunately they have done nothing for us until now,' Mr Bozize said. French president Francois Hollande said that France wants to protect its interests in Central African Republic and not Mr Bozize's government. Mr Hollande said their presence in the country was 'in no way to intervene in the internal business of a country. Those days are over'. The comments came a day after dozens of protesters, angry about a lack of help against rebel forces, threw rocks at the French Embassy in Bangui and stole a French flag. Paris is encouraging peace talks between the government and the rebels and the French foreign ministry said negotiations will start soon in Gabon. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius has also asked the Central African Republic government to be responsible for the safety of French citizens in the country. Neighbour and ally Chad has pledged to send 2,000 troops but it is not clear if they have arrived and whether they can stop the rebels, which consist of at least four different groups. They have already seized ten towns across the north of the country. They claim they are justified in light of the 'thirst for justice, for peace, for security and for economic development of the people of Central African Republic.' Despite having a wealth of gold, diamonds, timber and uranium, the country remains one of the poorest in the world. Following independence from France in 1960, the country has suffered decades of army revolts, coups and rebellions. The rebels signed a peace deal in 2007 but have accused Mr Bozize of failing to keep it.","US ambassador and 40 diplomats evacuated from country overnight .

'Angry': Ann Carr launched the attack after a night out in Derby to celebrate turning 37 . A woman stabbed a man in the back with a kitchen knife for eating her takeaway burger and chips after a night out to celebrate her 37th birthday. Ann Carr had bought the food as she made her way back to her home in Allenton, Derby, with a group of people at the end of the night. A court heard the group continued the celebrations back at the house, but the atmosphere quickly soured when Carr realised one of her guests had eaten 'a lot' of her chicken burger and chips. The 37-year-old, who had gone into her bedroom to remove her make-up, was infuriated when she returned to find her takeaway partially eaten. Carr pushed the remnants of the food into the face of one onlooker, then fetched a 'large kitchen knife and lunged' at the man who had eaten the burger. The attack damaged muscles around the man's spine and left him with a 3cm wound, the court heard. The victim has had trouble walking and suffered nightmares in the wake of the incident, the court was told. Hal Ewing, prosecuting at Derby Crown Court, said the atmosphere had initially been good at Carr's home, where the group had played music and continued drinking. But he said Carr became angry and launched the attack when she returned from cleaning her face to discover her half-eaten takeaway. The defendant, who has battled with alcoholism, had taken drugs on the night of her birthday, the court heard. Carr was jailed for 20 months for wounding after admitting the attack on September 1 last year. 'It was most disgraceful to have caused a nasty wound to his back,' Judge Andrew Hamilton said. 'If you had stuck it in a bit further, it could have caused even worse injuries. Takeaway: Carr attacked the man for eating her chicken burger and chips . 'So long as you continue to take drugs and drink, you will continue to be at risk of causing serious harm to people,' the judge added. Carr had been placed on a curfew for more than 120 days but half of that will be taken off her prison sentence. The court was told she had a previous conviction for assault dating back to in 1996. Clive Stockwell, mitigating, told the court Carr had had a tragic early life. He said: 'Her mother died when she was a teenager and she had also lost her father and a brother. 'As a result, she consumed a great deal of alcohol to deal with these emotional problems and she became an alcoholic. 'On this night, she went out for her birthday and foolishly decided to take some drugs. 'She is a vulnerable person and has dealt with a lot in her life,' Mr Stockwell added.The judge studied a psychiatric report on Carr before jailing her.","Ann Carr had bought the takeaway on her way home from a night out celebrating her birthday in Derby .

North Korea's recent rocket launch shows it has likely developed the technology to fire a warhead more than 6,200 miles - putting Europe, and the US West Coast in range, South Korean officials said yesterday. The secretive state claimed the December 12 launch put a weather satellite in orbit but critics say it was aimed at nurturing the kind of technology needed to mount a nuclear warhead on a long-range missile. South Korea retrieved and analysed parts of the first-stage rocket after debris fell into the waters off its west coast. Scroll down for video . A South Korean investigator examines a piece of debris from the rocket that fell into the Yellow Sea . Analysis of pieces of wreckage from Unha-3 (Milky Way 3) rocket, such as this one believed to be a fuel tank, shows North Korea can fire further than originally thought . Write caption here . Yesterday, a Defence Ministry official said: 'As a result of analysing the material of Unha-3 (North Korea's rocket), we judged North Korea had secured a range of more than 10,000 km in case the warhead is 500-600 kg.' North Korea is banned from testing missile or nuclear technology under United Nationas sanctions imposed after its 2006 and 2009 nuclear weapons tests. The UN Security Council condemned the launch earlier this month. North Korea's previous missile tests ended in failure. The country, which regularly denounces the United States as a warmonger, has spent decades trying to develop technology capable of striking long range targets. It is also working to build a nuclear arsenal. The South Korean Defence Ministry released this picture of the inside of the North Korean rocket . The rocket wreckage was fished out of the sea by South Korea. A minesweeper equipped with the sonar system detected three parts of the rocket in waters . But experts believe the North is still years away from mastering the technology needed to miniaturise a nuclear bomb to mount on a missile. South Korean defence officials also said there was no confirmation whether the North had the re-entry technology needed for a payload to survive the heat and vibration without disintegrating. Despite international condemnation, the launch this month was seen as a major boost domestically to the credibility of the North's young leader Kim Jong-un, who took over power from his father who died last year. He has called for the development of more powerful rockets after the successful satellite launch. He told the project's backers at a banquet held in their honour that he wanted 'a variety of more working satellites' and 'carrier rockets of bigger capacity'. The speech on Friday marks the first time he is explicitly calling for the advancement of his country's long-range rocket programme.","Debris from the rocket was found off the South Korean coast .

Two-time Oscar nominee Charles Durning - dubbed the king of the character actors - has died aged 89. The Tootsie star died yesterday of natural causes at his New York City home. Durning is best known for role as a corrupt governor in 1982's The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, which earned him an Academy Award nomination. He was nominated a second time a year later for his performance as a bumbling Nazi official in Mel Brook's To Be Or Not To Be. His longtime agent and friend, Judith Moss, announced today that he had died at his home in the borough of Manhattan. He is survived by his children, Michele, Douglas and Jeannine. In 2008, Durning said he never wanted to stop working. He said: 'They're going to carry me out, if I go.' During his 50-year-career, Durning also won plaudits for his stage performances and received a Tony award in 1990 for his portrayal of Big Daddy in a Broadway revival of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. He was decorated in the Second World War but refused to speak of his experiences. 'Too many bad memories,' he told an interviewer in 1997. 'I don't want you to see me crying.' He won . a Silver Star and three Purple Hearts during the Second World War and . was among the first wave of US soldiers in the D Day Landings and was . later taken prisoner.

At school he was told he had no talent for art, languages or maths and should learn office skills. But after seeing King Kong and some of James Cagney's films, he knew he wanted to perform. Durning began his career as an usher at a burlesque theatre in Buffalo, New York, when he replaced a comedian who was too drunk to go on stage.

Abandoned dogs that were facing death because they bark too loudly have been saved after hundreds of people stepped in to help. Twin sisters Pat Hartley and Jane Wright, who run Mill House Animal Sanctuary, feared they would have to make the heartbreaking decision to destroy the animals after one noise complaint was made by a neighbour. The 70-year-old sisters were issued with a council noise abatement order, which meant they must find homes for the 17 dogs or erect a £2,000 soundproof fence that they could not afford. If that failed the dogs would have to be put down. Overwhelmed: Pat Hartley, left, said she and twin sister Jane Wright, right, . have been moved by the response . Life line: The twins are hoping they can now build a soundproof fence with the pledged money . But after people heard their plight, the twins have been swamped with pledges of money to save the dogs from death row. A law firm has even offered to provide a free legal service if the sisters, who have cared for abandoned animals since 1948, decided to fight the council order. Mrs Hartley said the response has been 'overwhelming'. The sanctuary, in Fulwood, Sheffield, . costs £3,000 a week to run and, although they receive donations, the . sisters and their husbands prop it up with their own cash. They feared they may have to close it after the council issued the order. But now Mrs Hartley thinks they will have enough money to build the fence. She said: 'The the phone hasn't stopped ringing since 6.30 each morning. 'We just cannot believe the support we have received from all over the country and even abroad. 'All these dogs were abandoned, their owners didn't want them or couldn't care for them but this shows people really care because at the moment there are so many animals being abandoned.

'We are so grateful to everyone who has offered their support. You don't realise how nice a lot of people are. 'We think we will get enough to buy the fence, because quite a lot of people have pledged to send us money.'

Just months after her second child died in a freak accident, Kijivu the gorilla cuddles up to her newborn infant. At just two days old the tiny baby looks curiously around his new home at Prague Zoo yesterday, his 19-year-old mother takes a well-earned rest. The birth of any rare Western lowland gorilla in captivity is a cause for celebration but staff at the zoo are especially excited as the new arrival comes after one of the most tragic events in its history. Scroll down for video . Wide awake: The two-day old baby has a look around while worn out mum Kijivu takes a well-earned nap . Mother and baby strike a hauntingly human pose as they lie together for a cuddle . Kijivu's second infant, five-year-old Tatu, accidentally hanged himself with a climbing rope. The young male was found dead in July with the rope around his neck in a sleeping room. Female gorilla Kamba - another of Prague Zoo's gorilla group - was by Tatu's side when he was found and was apparently trying to help him. At the time zoo director Miroslav Bobek said the death of Tatu - whose birth in 2007 was watched by tens of thousands of people online - was the most . tragic event at the zoo since flooding in 2002 killed more than 100 . animals. But this week staff have something to celebrate and the beautiful pictures reveal the special bond between mother and baby as Kijivu gently cradles her newborn. Ceske Noviny quoted zoo spokesman Michal . Stastny as saying the birth on Friday was quick and both mother and . baby were fine and remained in the gorilla group. Kijivu has now given birth to four infants fathered by Prague Zoo male Richard. She gave birth to her first, Moja, in 2004 and Tatu in 2007. She also had a male named Kiburi in 2010. Moja, seven, has since been transported to a zoo in Spain. The Prague group of gorillas also includes three other females - Kamba, Shinda and Bikira. Content: Kijivu is an experienced mother and has already given birth to three infants in captivity . Relaxed: The baby and mother cuddle up at Prague Zoo . Zoo staff are anxiously preparing for another expected arrival. The most senior female at the zoo called Kamba is heavily pregnancy even though, at 40 years old, she was believed she was past reproductive age. She is expected to give birth next year and keepers say it there is a large risk of complications. According to Prague Zoo, Kamba was born in the early 1970s in Cameroon's tropical forests. She became pregnant in 2007 but the infant died and the adult also nearly lost her life in the process. Mr Bobek said on the zoo's website: 'There will be a team of medical specialists ready to solve any . possible complications when Kamba is giving birth. Furthermore, we will . build a temporary operating theatre on the premises of the pavilion. 'We are all hoping Kamba’s story . is going to be a happy one. But I must emphasise her giving birth can . present some serious complications.' Keepers are assessing her with an ultrasound probe through her cage. The new born baby will become one of the zoo's main attractions when he is old enough to be seen by the public . Prague Zoo was opened in the Czech . Republic in 1931 with the goal to 'advance the study of zoology, protect . wildlife, and educate the public' in the district of Troja in the north . of the city. It stands on 111 acres and houses about 4,400 animals that represent 670 species from all around the world.","Western lowland gorilla Kijivu gave birth to her fourth infant on Friday .

Stifling: Professor Brown, who is director of the National Centre for Post Qualifying Social Work, warned that a target-driven approach was damaging to the nursing profession . A generation of nurses and carers have had their compassion ‘knocked out of them’ by a blindly target-driven workplace culture, an expert has warned. An obsession with targets and jargon is stifling their innate desire to care for patients and care home residents, Professor Keith Brown said. The professor, who is in the process of overhauling the training received by Britain’s care professionals, said many workers felt unable to stand up to abuse if they saw others mistreating patients. He pointed to the example of the abuse . scandal at the Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol, which he . said showed how those not perpetrating abuse had found it easier to . ‘turn a blind eye’. He . said: ‘The vacuum has been in those situations, people lack a . willingness to stand up and be counted and to do the right thing at the . right time. 'That . might be because they are afraid, or because of the culture, that if you . whistle-blow you will be in trouble, or it might be that they just . don’t want the hassle.’ Professor Brown, who is director of . the National Centre for Post Qualifying Social Work, added: ‘I think . that most people who come into this line of work – whether it is . nursing, social care, or in care homes –  want to care but somehow it . gets knocked out of them. ‘They end up in systems and structures that make them feel anxious or nervous. ‘It might be the pressure of work or the . culture of the organisation just setting inappropriate targets where . you can measure the measurable but not the qualities of what it feels . like.’ Scandal: Professor Keith Brown referenced Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol where abuse was exposed. He said staff often found it easier to 'turn a blind eye' to abuse and criticised target-driven workplace culture . Professor Brown told the Daily Telegraph there had been a growth in ‘daft’ targets within the care system. He . said: ‘A lot of the leadership development through the whole sector is . based on a business school type ideology, because we haven’t got a clear . leadership development framework based on social work or social care . principles. ‘Instead of being taught how to care for people, they are being taught how to  meet targets.’ He . added: ‘Of course you are going to get the odd rogue but the million . people involved in social care came in to it for good reasons, we need . to switch that back on again. ‘We need to stop it being knocked out of them or crushed so that they don’t exercise it any more. ‘Experience is crushing it but maybe training should give then resilience to stop them being crushed.’ Abuse: An investigation exposed how vulnerable patients suffered terrible treatment.

Magazines have been urged to ditch New Year ‘miracle diets’ that promise to help readers shed the pounds they have piled on over the festive season. Jo Swinson, the Minister for Women and Equalities, claims such diets – which offer tips on how to lose up to a stone in a matter of days – encourage ‘dangerous’ behaviour and ‘self-hate’. In an open letter to women’s, men’s, health and celebrity magazines, she implored editors to stop focusing on short-term solutions and instead encourage sustainable healthy lifestyles. The Lib Dem MP said: ‘As editors you owe more to your readers than the reckless promotion of unhealthy solutions to losing weight. ‘If your aim is to give practical, sensible advice about losing weight – not how to drop a stone in five days – you should encourage reasonable expectations, instead of dangerous ones, along with exercise and healthy eating.’ Speaking on Five Live yesterday, Miss Swinson, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image, said: ‘There’s a real difference between having a crash diet and getting healthier.’ She added: ‘It is irresponsible for magazines to offer “tips, tricks and simple steps” so that people can be thin. Not healthy or vibrant, just thin.’ 'Magazines should reflect ‘real diversity’ rather than showing only slim, young models.' Editors, she added, ‘need to be updating the type of January article that they’re putting in their magazines to have a more positive body image rather than the sort of self-hate perpetuated by the fad diet articles’. Ms Swinson co-founded the Campaign for Body Confidence in 2010 with fellow MP Lynne Featherstone. It promotes diversity of women's bodies in the media, as well as body confidence education in schools and honesty in advertising. The group's founders believe the 'pressure to conform to impossible stereotypes' is damaging to both men and women and increases low-self-esteem, depression and eating disorders. Weight Watchers, which was recently named the NHS' most effective weight loss provider, welcomed the letter. A spokeswoman said: 'We’re delighted that the government is taking measures to prevent the promotion of irresponsible and unhealthy fad diets. Weight Watchers is not a diet, it’s a healthy lifestyle.' She said they encourage a 'healthy and sustainable weight loss' of no more than 2lbs a week.","MP Jo Swinson urged magazines to ditch fad diets in new year editions .

When a mother gorilla failed to bond with her baby daughter, zoo-keeper Ron Smith and his wife Barbara were quick to volunteer as foster parents. The couple, who had no children of their own, looked after Salome for the first year of her life, giving her a cot in their bedroom. Thirteen years later, in 1990, Mr Smith bade an emotional farewell to the ape when he was made redundant at the age of 60. Two years later she was transferred from London Zoo to Bristol. Reunited: Retired zookeeper Ron Smith gets emotional as he visits Salome, pictured as a baby with Ron, at Bristol Zoo . Visit: Ron Smith pictured next to the gorilla pen at Bristol Zoo, home to Salome for 20 years. Ron had been deputy curator of the ape house at London Zoo when the ape was born . But he still thinks of her as ‘my . baby’ and this year, as a Christmas present to himself, the 82-year-old . widower travelled 200 miles from his home in Ipswich for a poignant . reunion. He sobbed as he saw Salome, now a . 36-year-old mother of three, emerge from behind a bush with her . one-year-old son Kukena clinging to her leg. She stared at Mr Smith for a . few seconds before attending to her son. ‘She looks really well,’ said Mr . Smith. ‘It’s so nice to see her. I am choked.’ Salome’s story was . reported by the Daily Mail in August 1976, when she became the first . gorilla born at London Zoo. Her mother, Lomie, struggled from the start . to rear her daughter. She was not feeding her properly and became . increasingly irritable, with two scars on Salome’s head to prove it. Now: Mr Smith watched as Salome, pictured at Bristol Zoo this week, played with her own one-year-old son Kukena . Sentimental: Ron hadn't seen the gorilla since she moved to Bristol Zoo in 1992 and became emotional as he watched Salome in her enclosure . So Mr Smith, who was second in . command of the Ape House, took Salome back to his flat in Cricklewood . every evening for the next year until she grew into a strong and healthy . youngster. He and his wife took turns to wake up . in the night and feed her every three hours from a baby’s bottle filled . with warm, diluted, evaporated milk. John Partridge, senior curator of . animals at Bristol, saluted Mr Smith and his wife, who died in 2008, for . doing such a good job as foster parents. ‘Salome is a brilliant mother and that . is all down to this guy,’ he said. ‘She has had babies, rears them . herself and is a strong member of the family.

His four children from his first marriage, however, may beg to differ. They were not surprised that, when Mr Cook died last year aged 76, his wife Somsangouane, an exiled Laotian princess, was the main beneficiary in his £340,000 will. They were upset, however, that Mrs Cook – known as Sam – inherited everything. Mr Cook had stipulated that his estate would go to his grandchildren only if 70-year-old Sam died before him. Expenses scandal: Labour MP Frank Cook claimed £153,902, including £5 for a charity donation . Mr Cook, one of the MPs who was caught up in the Commons expenses scandal, represented Stockton North for 27 years. He died last January from lung cancer. His children say their relationship with his second wife became strained during his year-long illness and is now non-existent. What has really upset his son, Andrew, 47, is that he and his sisters Christine, 51, Nicola, 48, and Maxine, 49, have not been given anything of worth to remember their father by. The siblings had not received any of Mr Cook's possessions until a box arrived several weeks ago, he said. 'There was nothing meaningful there,' he said when the Daily Mail contacted him. 'My father always said that his watches would be mine and I know he had some expensive ones worth £300 to £400 but there was nothing like that in the box. The whole contents could not have been worth more than £30. His grandchildren had to look through to try to find something to remember him by. 'We have had no contact with Sam even by email or telephone. We understand she has now moved away. I do not know where she is. To be honest, I don't care if I never see her again. She has taken the whole estate and disappeared.' Mr Cook was still married to his first wife, Patricia, when in 1992 he met Somsangouane Baldinger, who was divorced and lived in Arizona, at Billingham folk festival in 1992. Mr Cook moved out of the family home in 1993 and was divorced five years later. Family feud: Princess Somsangouane was made the main beneficiary of Mr Cook's £340,000 will . In an interview with his local newspaper in 2008, Mr Cook said of his second wife: 'She is almost too perfect. She's a lady of considerable skill and merit. She's never made me the same meal twice since we met. Heaven knows what she sees in me.' The relationship landed him in trouble, however, when she refused to move to Teesside, saying it was too cold and she would miss her cocker spaniel. He was deselected by his local Labour party in 2008 for spending too much time abroad. Around the same time it emerged that he had claimed expenses of £153,902. He sued the Sunday Telegraph over an article about how he had claimed £5 on Parliamentary expenses for a donation made by an aide representing him at a Battle of Britain service. He said he made the claim by mistake but lost his case in 2011 and was left with a bill for costs which saw his estate reduced from £769,115 to £336,688. He stood as an independent in the 2010 General Election but finished fifth and lost his deposit. Mr Cook was diagnosed with cancer in February 2011. His son said: 'He was pretty much home-bound for the last year. Sam would only let us in when she felt like she wanted to. It was kind of strained. 'The funeral was very trying because she didn't take our feelings into consideration.' Although he had seen reports that his father and Sam married, he was unaware of any ceremony. 'We have never seen any certificate,' he said. Mrs Cook did not respond to a request to comment which was put to her solicitor.

A Tory MP who said that marriage could work only between ‘one man and one woman’ has been accused of hypocrisy – by his alleged former mistress. Bob Blackman, 58, who made the comments in opposition to gay marriage, is claimed to have had an 11-year affair that started just one year after he married his  wife Nicola. His alleged former mistress, Carol Shaw, claims that they  had the long-term affair while they were both Conservative councillors. She said that Mr Blackman is an . ‘absolute hypocrite’ for making the comments about gay marriage last . month considering his infidelity, which she claims included sex in his . marital bed  and at an office. Speaking . about the affair for the first time, Miss Shaw, 62, said: ‘I couldn’t . believe a man who had an affair with me for over 11 years could have the . cheek to preach about the sanctity of marriage. ‘You . have to be squeaky clean to do that and he has made a mistake. Bob is . an absolute hypocrite. He talks about marriage being between one man and . one woman ... but why does he not practice what he preaches. ‘More . than once I asked about his wife and I got the impression one day he . might leave her, because he said he could love two people at the same . time.’ Mr Blackman last . month said that he believed marriage had to be ‘between one man and one . woman’ as he claimed in an interview that David Cameron’s backing of . religious same-sex marriages was wrong on ‘principle’. But . Miss Shaw claims that their affair began just a year after he married . his wife in 1988 when  all three of them were councillors on Brent . Council in North-West London. Miss Shaw said that they first had sex . after Mr Blackman dropped her off at her flat after a function, but it . then became a regular occurrence with frequent Friday afternoon meetings . at her home. ‘Bob was a terrible lover but I was madly in love with him,’ she said in the interview with the Sunday Mirror. ‘He wasn’t one of these . four-times-a-night lovers. He’d never try anything new. He would just . say, “I haven’t got much time”. He just wanted to get into it. Mr Blackman, pictured here with David Cameron, became an MP in 2010 and said marriage could work only between 'one man and one woman' ‘It was once and then he would fall asleep. He would snore and I would have to wake him up.’ Miss Shaw said that the affair ended in 2000 when she became frustrated with the relationship. She . added: ‘Eleven years is a long time to carry on an affair. It’s not . like it was a one-night stand. He must have been desperately  miserable . in his marriage... or  he found me irresistible.

When Graham Cowley took early retirement, he wanted a home with views of unspoilt countryside. But eight months after buying his dream bungalow, Mr Cowley was aghast to discover that the local council planned to build Europe’s largest renewable energy plant surrounding it. If the plans go through, there will be half a million huge solar panels and several wind turbines only 100 yards from his front door. There will also be an 8ft security fence bristling with CCTV cameras. Anger: Graham Cowley, owner of Hill Farm House in Crowland is understandably upset as his property could be covered by 500 acres of solar panels and five wind turbines . Father-of-three Mr Cowley, 47, said there was no evidence of the scheme when his solicitors carried out searches before he spent £225,000 on his home in Newborough, Cambridgeshire, and a further £18,000 building a garage. He claims it is now almost worthless but he has been offered no compensation or the opportunity to relocate. ‘My views are going to be completely spoilt. I will look out of my house to see solar panels, huge wind turbines practically in my garden, and they want to install CCTV cameras. ‘I may as well commit a crime and go to jail as I would probably have a better quality of life. This is not a case of “not in my back yard”. It is a huge solar and wind farm surrounding my bungalow.’ Details: The plan for the energy farm . Mr Cowley said he was shocked when he received a letter from Conservative-run Peterborough City Council telling him of the scheme, which was originally intended to cover 3,000 acres. This was downgraded to a £140million scheme on 900 acres, producing enough energy to power more than 22,000 homes. There would be nearly 500,000 solar panels and Mr Cowley said  he has been told informally there would also be five wind turbines sited near his home. Nine other people affected by the scheme – all tenant farmers renting council land – have been offered new land and compensation. Mr Cowley, a retired water company engineer, said the first he heard of the plan was in a letter to ‘The Householder’ last summer. ‘Why have they not been down to see me rather than just posted an impersonal letter?’ he said. ‘It seems like a done deal and they have their fingers in their ears. I am in favour of renewable energy but the council has tons of other land where they could build this farm.’ Eyesore: How the field might look covered in solar panels . Other homeowners complained they learned of the development only through word of mouth. Farmer William Cave said: ‘It’s very distressing. People will lose their livelihoods and homes.’ The scheme was discussed at a full council meeting and has entered the formal planning stage.It is part of a ‘gold rush’ of applications submitted ahead of a cut in government subsidies for such projects and would be funded by government grants and private investment. A contractor would install the solar panels but it would be managed by the council’s energy services company, Blue Sky Peterborough. Peterborough City Council said the solar farm would make £100million profit over 25 years that would be invested in ‘frontline services’. A council spokesman said locals’ concerns had to be balanced ‘against the needs of Peterborough’s 184,000-plus residents’.","Graham Cowley's vision of unspoilt countryside set to be shattered .

A ‘lively and vibrant’ student died from an asthma attack triggered by the warm air in a pub. Sarah Carter-Edwards, 21, had walked through near-freezing temperatures to meet friends for a night out when she entered the premises. Moments later she collapsed and was  left fighting for breath, despite using  an inhaler. Her friends called 999 and paramedics took her to hospital but she had gone into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Her devastated father, businessman Malcolm Carter, 55, yesterday spoke of the huge ‘void’ in his life. He said: ‘It’s a tragic loss because she’d had two little scares in the past but nothing that alerted us that this could happen. It was the cold air she breathed in and, when she got to the warmth of the pub, it seems to have triggered the asthma attack. ‘No words can do justice to her. We were exceptionally close. She was my best friend and we would do everything together. ‘She was wise beyond her years and always said and did the right thing. She was a charming, kind and compassionate young lady with a lovely nature. ‘There is a huge void in our lives and Sarah will be greatly missed  by everyone.’ The heating firm owner said his daughter carried an inhaler ‘religiously’ after suffering two severe asthma attacks that required the use of a nebuliser in hospital.

Fun: Sarah pictured relaxing at a music festival; she was on a gap year at the time of her death . West Mercia Police said a post-mortem . examination revealed that Miss Carter-Edwards died of natural causes. The coroner was informed of her death but an inquest was not needed as . there were no suspicious circumstances. Asthma UK said an average of three . people died every day from severe attacks, which can be caused by sudden . changes in temperature. Asthma specialist Elaine Gillard said: . ‘On the majority of occasions the blue inhaler – which relaxes the . muscles surrounding the airways – works very well. Unfortunately, in . some cases it doesn’t work so well and can have tragic consequences.’ More than 5million Britons suffer from asthma, including 1.4million children, and the disease kills 1,400 people each year. Asthma is an inflammatory disease . of the airways, causing them to constrict and resulting in attacks of . breathlessness and wheezing. Breathing cold, dry air, or humid air, and . exertion are all possible triggers. Winter weather means drier air and . when an asthma sufferer rapidly breathes in dry air, it dries the . airway. This releases histamine that can increase inflammation of the . air passages in the lungs, leading to bronchospasm – acute narrowing of . the airway – which makes breathing difficult. These symptoms are aggravated by extremes of temperature. In an asthma attack the lungs . tighten, and gradually there is not enough air movement to produce . wheezing. Experts call this the ‘silent chest’ and it is a danger sign . of a severe asthma attack. Popular: Friends of Sarah paid tribute to her on social networks such as Facebook after her tragic death . A sudden change in temperature puts stress on the body and is a common trigger for an attack, according to the NHS. ‘It’s been long known that in people with asthma who aren’t controlled, just swallowing cold or hot liquids can set off an asthma attack,’ says Dr Richard Gower, president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. ‘The temperature sets off a bronchial spasm. We know that a change in temperature, down or up, can set it off.’ Changes in temperature are also associated with more serious attacks in youngsters. A 2009 study from the University of Michigan suggested that jumps in temperature and humidity were associated with a rise in asthmatic children going to A&E. Breathing hot or cold air can also have an irritating effect on the airway. This can cause the muscles of the air passages in the lungs to go into spasm and the linings of the airway swell making sufferers gasp for breath. Attacks can usually be controlled by using a blue reliever inhaler and breathing slowly and deeply. However, an ambulance should be called if the attack shows no signs of easing after a few minutes. Asthma UK recommends sufferers to take their usual dose of reliever inhaler before going out on cold, dry days. If it's cold and windy, wearing a scarf over your face will help to warm up the air before you breathe it in. Elaine Gillard, an asthma nurse specialist from Asthma UK, told MailOnline: ‘People with asthma have airways that are very sensitive and twitchy. They can quickly go into spasm if there is a trigger, such as a change in temperature or inhaling smoke. ‘A recent survey of our users revealed 75 per cent of sufferers found cold air can trigger an attack. ‘The trick with asthma is to make sure it is controlled all the time. A preventer (brown) inhaler works to stop the airways being so sensitive in the first place. If they are triggered a blue (reliever) inhaler helps. ‘If people find they need their blue inhaler three or more times a week they should go back to their doctor to look at their brown inhaler dosage. ‘Anyone who needs advice can speak to an asthma nurse on our helpline - 0800 121 6244.'","Fashion student Sarah Carter-Edwards died of asthma during night out .

Shocked father says 21-year-old was 'wise beyond her years'"
"By . Andrew Levy . PUBLISHED: . 13:30 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:41 EST, 10 January 2013 . Care home staff waited for 40 minutes before calling an ambulance after a 100-year-old dementia patient fractured her skull in a fall. Great-grandmother May Ward, who was described as being ‘full of life’, was being lifted in a hoist from a chair to her bed when she fell 5ft and hit her head, an inquest heard yesterday. Instead of immediately calling for help, Shasha Wei, from China, and Rumyana Ivanova, from Bulgaria, lifted her on to her bed and changed her bloody clothes. May Ward, who died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her two carers were using to hoist her out of bed at Meppershall Care Home in August 2010 . A 999 call for an ambulance was not . placed until 40 minutes later. When paramedics arrived they discovered . the former pub landlady heavily bruised and vomiting blood. She died the . next day in hospital. Inquiries later revealed that Miss . Wei and Miss Ivanova, who started working in the UK in 2009, were . unfamiliar with the bucket sling and possibly moved her  too quickly. The inquest heard Mrs Ward did not . have the correct straps attached to her legs in the sling. This allowed . her to pitch forward on to the floor when one of her carers let go of . her. A jury yesterday returned a verdict . of accidental death at an inquest the two women were not asked to attend . because they had returned to their respective countries and were beyond . the coroner’s jurisdiction. The Health and Safety Executive said it was investigating the case. After the hearing Mrs Ward’s son . John, 62, a retired Royal Mail manager, from Rugby, Warwickshire, said . the family were ‘frustrated’ that the pair had not been available to . explain the delay in calling for help. May Ward died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from China and Bulgaria - were using to hoist her out of bed at Meppershall Care Home in Bedfordshire (pictured) ‘They were key witnesses,’ he  said. ‘Now we may never know what really happened. ‘I am concerned about the 40 minutes – . the time between the accident happening and the paramedics arriving . could have been a lifesaver.’ His wife, Lesley, 56, said: ‘It’s devastating. She was always pleased to see us, liked to chat and was full of life.’ May Ward and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west London before taking over the Prince William Henry pub (pictured) in Blackfriars, central London, according to her son . Coroner Edward Thomas said it was not . clear why Mrs Ward was moved by her carers after her fall because they . were not present. ‘They should not have moved her,’ he added. He would be writing to the Care Quality Commission to ask them to ‘look more closely at care in homes’. Mrs Ward had been living at . Meppershall Care Home in Shefford, Bedfordshire, for six years when she . was fatally injured on August 27, 2010. The home received a 'poor' rating in a Care Quality Commission (London offices pictured) inspection report around the same time as manager Judith Eglen started working there in December 2009 . May Ward's son, John Ward, said she was born in West Tottenham, north London, and met her husband William Ward while she was a cook in the RAF. Her husband died in 1989, after the two had successful careers as publicans. Ms Ward has four grandchildren and six great grand-children - three girls and three boys, her son said. She and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west London before taking over the Prince William Henry pub in Blackfriars, central London, according to Mr Ward. They retired in 1980 and moved to Kenton, Middlesex, and Ms Ward was taken into care in 2004. The care home manager at the time, Judith Eglen, was sacked in the wake of Ms Ward's death, the inquest heard. She began work at the home in December 2009, around the same time it received a zero-star, or ‘poor’, rating in a Care Quality Commission inspection report, the jury heard. That was uprated by the watchdog to a one-star rating in May 2010, around three months before Ms Ward's death and around the same time the new slings were purchased. Ms Eglen told the court that she and the two carers involved re-enacted the lead-up to Ms Ward's fall for her family and the deputy manager a few days after her death. She said Ms Ward was dropped from about 5ft but the carers were ‘good’ at their jobs. ‘Our conclusion (after re-enacting the fall) was that they did everything correctly but they moved too quickly,’ Ms Eglen told the court. The widow, whose husband William, a . former RAF chef, died in 1989, had previously been in good physical . health. Months earlier she had received a telegram from the Queen . marking her centenary. Detective Constable Philip Freebrey told the . inquest in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, that both carers said Mrs Ward . became agitated when she was moved. ‘Shasha was controlling the hoist device and Rumyana was supporting Mrs Ward,’ he said. ‘She was let go by one of the carers, . causing her to jerk forward out of the sling to the ground. The sling . was in perfect working order. It would appear from later investigations . that it was not used correctly.’ Health and Safety Executive officer . Ruth Boulton said: ‘There was evidence that the carers had been trained . to use a sling before but not this particular device. ‘The language barrier, though they could speak English, could have made a difference to the care.’ Former care home manager Judith . Eglen, who was sacked four months after Mrs Ward’s death, described how . Miss Wei and Miss Ivanova showed her what had happened before the fall. ‘She was hoisted about the height of . the bed before she slipped and fell,’ she said. ‘My initial report . indicated that the carers had perhaps moved her too quickly.’ Nurse Beatrice Ngarama, who was . called to treat Mrs Ward, said: ‘When I got to her, her face was . obviously swollen and she was already changed and in bed. ‘I wouldn’t have moved her from the . floor because I did not know the extent of her injuries.’ A post mortem . examination showed Mrs Ward died from two fractures of the skull and a . brain haemorrhage. Her right leg was also broken. In November 2009, a Care Quality . Commission inspection found ‘significant shortfalls’ at the care home, . which is owned by GA Projects Ltd, including ‘moving and handling’ of . patients. Bedfordshire Police said it had . considered neglect charges against Miss Wei and Miss Ivanova but dropped . the case due to ‘insufficient evidence’. The Health and Safety Executive can . bring criminal charges against employees, directors and companies. A . spokesman said: ‘We cannot comment while an investigation is live.’","Grandson of 100-year-old May Ward has called her death a 'disgrace'

And it seems the problems caused by flooding are spreading... even seals are confused. This creature swam 50 miles from the sea to a flooded field via the mouth of the swollen Great Ouse in the Wash. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Adventure: The seal has stunned nature experts by finding its way into a land-locked lake 50 miles from the coast after swimming through floods . Good effort: The seal is believed to have swum up the Great River Ouse, from King's Lynn, in Norfolk . Remarkable journey: The route the seal is believed to have taken to find itself 50 miles inland . It was seen heaving itself over flood defences which surround the Fen Drayton Lakes Reserve, near St Ives, Cambridgeshire. Footage of its progress was posted on . video sharing website YouTube with a caption that read: ‘The fields . around the lakes have flooded, as they annually do. ‘In the river is a seal that is . climbing up the flood defences to get into the field, now a mere, with . swollen water from the lake inside.' Wildlife workers said seals were . occasionally spotted in the River Ouse but this seal made it ten miles . further than previous sightings. Graham Elliott of the RSPB, which runs . the reserve, said: ‘It would be the first time this has happened to my . knowledge – that a seal has made its way into the lake. Climb: The seal can be seen attempting to clamber over flood defences at the lakes . Strength of character: The creature pulls itself up as it makes a bid to get into the water-logged field . ‘It would be tremendous if one is there. It would be extremely unusual and it would become an attraction to visitors.’ In a fitting end to the wettest year on record in England, 86 flood warnings and 134 flood alerts were in place last night. Around 540 properties have been . flooded since December 19, including 20 in Burton Fleming, East . Yorkshire, which has been under water since Christmas Eve, despite five . powerful pumps operating around the village. Squally winds and flooding caused more tragedies yesterday, after a 41-year-old man was swept out to sea by gales in Blackpool. A search began shortly after midnight on New Year’s Eve when a man he was with raised the alarm. It continued throughout the day but coastguards said it was ‘highly unlikely’ he had survived. Nearly there: The courageous creature knows it has almost conquered the climb . It is thought the man was walking his dog at high tide but ignored warning signs and was picked up by a 30ft wave. Crews spent more than four hours searching for him but the operation was hampered by gale-force winds. Paul Parton, from the Blackpool Royal . National Lifeboat Institute, said: ‘Conditions were very difficult. It . would have been a miracle if anyone managed to survive.’ Hotel worker Nadia Taylor, 20, said . rescuers spotted a man in the water but he disappeared under the . gigantic waves seconds later. She added: ‘We had just sung Auld Lang Syne when the sirens started outside. ‘The lifeboats did a tremendous job launching in waves like that.’ A footpath is submerged near the world famous Iron Bridge because of the swollen River Severn .

So spare a thought for Tania Sullivan, who has just celebrated the birth of her 12th child. This year, between the frenzied opening of stockings and presents and preparing a full English breakfast for 14 as well as lunch with all the trimmings, Mrs Sullivan, 38, will have to make time to feed five-week-old Isobelle. Fortunately, she is an expert at using her time efficiently as she and her husband, Mike, 39, both work full time, rather than relying on the state to bankroll their huge family, and the children are home educated. Scroll down for video . And mum and dad make 14: Left to right are Joseph, two, Sid, six, Steph, 18, Michael with Libby, 14 months, Ben, 19, Caitlin, 13, with Anna, 14 months, Tania with baby Isobelle, Harry, nine, Eddie, seven, Paddy, five and Oliver, three . Growing brood: Tania and Michael now have seven sons and five daughters, ranging in age from five weeks to 19-years-old . ‘Christmas Day is non-stop for us,’ said Mrs Sullivan. ‘It is a long day but we have a lovely time and the children are happy, which is so rewarding. By the time all the younger children are in bed, Mike will have a Guinness, which is his little treat, and I might go for a glass of Baileys. But if I am really shattered it might end up being a cup of tea.’ The couple’s oldest child, Ben, is 19, followed by Steph, 18, and Caitlin, 13. Then there is Harry, nine, Eddie, seven, Sid, seven tomorrow, Paddy, five, Oliver, three, Joseph, two, and 14-month-old twins Libby and Anna. Isobelle arrived on November 21. The day will begin in the small hours for Mrs Sullivan, when she gives Isobelle a couple of bottle feeds. At 5am she and her husband will get up to start preparing breakfast, which is kept warm in the oven until the children have opened their stockings. Cooking the turkey begins at 8am, after which the family’s first present opening session takes place. With 150-or-so gifts to open, time has to be set aside after lunch to finish the process. The smaller children have a nap mid-morning while mum puts the finishing touches to lunch, which is served around 1pm. What's for lunch? Tania and Mike will prepare a full English for the family of 14 on Christmas Day, before serving up lunch with all the trimmings later on . Supplies: Mum Tania and baby Isobelle with the mountains of food for the Sullivan family Christmas . With the last of the gifts opened and the wrapping paper tidied up by 5pm, a buffet is laid on for the family before they settle down to play games. By 6pm, the gruelling round of putting children to bed begins, lasting around 90 minutes. Mrs Sullivan then has a quick shower to freshen up and collapses on the sofa with a drink at 8pm. The family budget for Christmas is around £2,000 – which includes around £200 on food and drink. Gifts this year include an iPad, books, cameras, toys and clothes vouchers. Mr and Mrs Sullivan met when they were teenagers and married ten years ago. She used to work as a recruitment consultant but runs a website, www.largerfamilylife.com, which gives advice on how to run a large family. Working from the couple’s £200,000 detached house, near Rochester in Kent, also allows her to home school the children. Mr Sullivan is self-employed as a part-time joiner and helps out with the website and at home when he is not working. When the festive season is over, the family will get back to its usual routine, which involves a £200 weekly food shop. They are planning a two-month family road trip through France and Italy from April but hope to offset the cost with a book about the adventure. So, with each day already packed from end to end, do they plan to settle for a round dozen children? Not necessarily… . ‘Having one more will not change our lives massively now,’ said Mrs Sullivan.","Tania Sullivan, 38, and her husband Mike, 39,  have just celebrated the birth of their 12th child, Isobelle .

Parents have threatened to take their children out of a top independent school after an intruder walked into a girls’ changing room and indecently assaulted a young pupil. The girl was threatened with violence when the man approached her at Felsted Preparatory School, near Great Dunmow, Essex. She managed to escape and alert a teacher but her attacker fled from the grounds of the school, which was founded in the 16th century and has fees of up to £19,080 for boarders, rising to £26,385 in the senior school. Top prep school: Parents have threatened to take their children out of a school after an intruder walked into a girls' changing room and indecently assaulted a young pupil . Scene: Felsted Preparatory School which has fees of up to £19,080 for boarders, rising to £26,385 in the senior school . Police have issued an efit of the pervert and have appealed for information. They refused to rule out the possibility he might strike again or at another school. Furious parents yesterday questioned how a stranger was able to make his way on to school property unchallenged. One father, who did not want to be named, said: ‘A man walked in off the street and into the girls’ changing rooms and assaulted one of the girls. 'She ran off screaming. I am very angry about this and am taking my daughter out of the sixth form.’ Unchallenged: An efit of the man wanted in connection with the incident at a school in Essex . Another said: ‘This has shaken my trust in the school. If they cannot protect my daughter then I have to consider other options.’ A mother added: ‘A lot of the parents are worried that this chap will come back. ‘The grounds here at Felsted are incredibly open, so in that respect it is very easy for anyone to make their way on to the premises. ‘In all honesty, I don’t think you will be able to stop people as the school is the size of a village and there are always so many people coming and going. But I am still shocked.’ The sex attack took place just before 11am on Tuesday. Sources said it involved one of the older pupils in the preparatory school, which takes children aged four to 13. The school’s site security policy document states ‘many of the existing buildings were not designed with security in mind’ and its ‘open door policy in some areas can put staff and pupils at risk’. Prep school headmistress Jenny Burrett said: ‘Our focus has understandably been on the welfare of the individual involved and providing support to her and her family.’ She added: ‘We have obviously increased vigilance.’ Essex Police said the intruder was 5ft 10in, white, about 30, with crooked teeth and gelled, dark brown hair. A spokesman for the force said: ‘We can’t predict this person’s future intentions.’ A bronze statue of a young female hockey player, near the sports grounds of the independent school where the attack happened .

Michael Van Der Linden, 38, died and killed another motorist when he drove the wrong way down Interstate 94 near Michigan City just after 1.30 a.m. on Thursday. When police went to his Bellevue, Michigan home to tell his wife Linda, they found her dead body along with those of her two sons, Matthew, four, and Julien, seven, in separate bedrooms. Police said they are investigating whether the father, who had a history of depression, killed his family before purposefully . crashing into oncoming traffic 120 miles from his home. Scroll down for video . Killed: Linda Van Der Linden, 34, (right) was found stabbed dead in her home with her two sons by police who had gone to the house to tell her that her husband Michael (left) had died in a car crash . When officers visited the Van Der Linden home, in an affluent Detroit neighbourhood, they found the front door ajar and, when no one answered, went inside. The two young boys and mother, 34, were found stabbed in their chests in their beds, police said. LaPorte County Medical Examiner John Sullivan told WSBT  it appears Van Der Linden stabbed his wife and children and then fled, eventually crashing near Michigan City. 'They want us to look for a knife in the vehicle, but the vehicle is completely burned up and destroyed,' Sullivan said. Police Capt. Gregory Laurain added that it was too early to speculate about what had happened, but no suicide notes were found in the home, which is around 25 miles west of Detroit. 'There was no sign of forced entry. No sign of robbery,' he said. Scene: A coroner's van takes away the three bodies from the Bellevue, Michigan home on Thursday morning. The two boys, aged four and seven, and their mother were all stabbed in their chests . Tragic: Police are investigating if Michael Van Der Linden stabbed his wife and children to death before purposefully driving into oncoming traffic on a highway in Indiana . 'It is a very tough scene, but it's one of those things we have to investigate and hopefully we're going to get some closure on it.' He added that they did find a weapon inside the house, but would not give further details. Police told WDTV4 that the Van Der Linden, who went by 'Mike', had a history of depression and had been known to try to commit suicide before. Records show the fire department had been called to the family's home in recent weeks for an incident involving the father, the news site added. Police have collected computers and voice messaging equipment from the home. Fatal: Michael Van Buren died on Interstate 94 early on Thursday morning after driving the wrong way and colliding head-on with another vehicle. He also killed the other driver . Van Der Linden left a highway rest stop and drove his Chrysler eastbound in the westbound lanes and crashed head-on with another car, driven by 45-year-old Juan Nelson Jr. from Portage, Indiana. The crash engulfed both vehicles and both men were pronounced dead at the scene. Linda Van Der Linden was a stay-at-home mother, while her husband worked in IT for business computer firm Experis, which is based in Portage. He had been with the company nearly three years. They lived in Anna Drive in Van Buren Township, a quiet, clean subdivision of Tudor- and Colonial-style homes. It is an area of well-kept lawns and outdoor swimming pools.

Jailed: Naomi Thriepland tried to smuggle £170,000 of drugs into the UK with her daughter Aiesha beside her . A pregnant former soldier has been jailed for four years after trying to smuggle more than £170,000 of heroin – using her young daughter as cover. Lance Corporal Naomi Thriepland, 25, took seven-year-old Aiesha with her to Amsterdam to collect the drugs. When questioned by customs officials at the Channel Tunnel entrance near Calais, she pretended they had been to Disneyland Paris. Staff eventually discovered the heroin, which had been hidden in her BMW convertible. Thriepland, who served as a clerk attached to medics in Iraq and a bomb-disposal unit in Afghanistan, is four months pregnant and will give birth behind bars. She told Canterbury Crown Court she had been seeking ‘better conditions’ for her family, but Judge Heather Norton responded: ‘You did what you did for financial gain. 'More than that, you took your seven-year-old child with you as some kind of family cover, putting that child at risk. ‘You claim you became a courier to give her a better life, but that child is now likely to suffer more than you.’ She added: ‘You have served this country with a number of tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and in perilous positions. 'So, whatever else can be said of you, this was certainly out of character.’ Thriepland, from Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, broke down in court as her forces record was mentioned. She served in the Army for six years, but left after Aiesha wept on breakfast television programme GMTV shortly before Christmas in 2009 as she spoke to her mother via a satellite link. Smuggler: Lance Corporal Thriepland with Aiesha, whose face is obscured for legal reasons . Well known: When a soldier, Thriepland appeared on to GMTV from Camp Bastion where she was serving and spoke to her daughter at Christmas . Story: The 25-year-old told customs officials she was returning from a trip to take her daughter to Disneyland in Paris in December 2011- but she had been to Amsterdam to load up with 3.44 kilos of heroin . Choice: The former soldier was earning £120 a week as a trainee beautician but accepted £8,000 to smuggle the heroin into Britain . Thriepland later found work as a . trainee beautician, earning £105 for a 15-hour week. However, . investigations revealed that £10,500 was deposited into her bank . account, including £8,000 for the trip that resulted in her arrest last . December. Thriepland, who admitted attempting to . smuggle drugs, was stopped at Coquelles in France as she tried to enter . the UK with Aiesha, now eight and living with an aunt. Distraction: The 25-year-old said she and her daughter had been in Paris but in fact her BMW was being stuffed with drugs in Amsterdam . Officials found Thriepland had 3.5kg of heroin, worth £172,000, as well as 12kg of cutting agents. She said the consignment was hidden in the car while she and her daughter stayed in a hotel. Thriepland denied making previous smuggling trips to Europe but confirmed she had gone on a ‘dummy run’ a month earlier. Christopher Baur, defending, said  she . had not acted ‘in malice or wickedness but rather stupidity and with an . element of greed’. He added: ‘She did this because she . wanted to better her situation, in particular for her child, and the . irony is not lost on her. ‘She is 16 weeks pregnant. That was . not planned and not done, as it were, in preparation for these . proceedings. She will now give birth in prison. ‘The situation she finds herself in is . dire, because she wasn’t coerced into it, but neither was she a major . player in the enterprise. ‘She was quite naive. She did it to . better conditions for her child.’ The father of Thriepland’s unborn . baby, Anwar Pitters, told the Daily Mail he would stand by her. ‘We are still together and will be . while she is in prison until she comes out,’ he said. ‘I will try to get . custody of our unborn child but need to speak to Naomi first. 'I won’t . know any more until I speak to her.’ Malcolm Bragg, of the Border Force, . which has been responsible for security at ports since last March, said: . ‘Drug trafficking is a serious offence and those convicted will face . prison sentences. ‘Our message to those who  would consider it is that it’s just not worth it.’ Shame: Thriepland quit her life in the army . after serving in Afghanistan and Iraq because she wanted to spend more . time with her daughter .

Ian Hockley, whose six-year-old son Dylan was one of 20 youngsters murdered, had proudly shown former neighbours pictures of his two children when he returned to finalise the sale of their old home in Hampshire last week. Mr Hockley, who is in his early 40s, told friends at his local pub that he and his U.S.-born wife, Nicole, were having a ‘wonderful American adventure’ after moving to New England with Dylan and his older brother Jake in January 2011. Full of smiles: Dylan (left) with his brother Jake and parents Ian and Nicole. Ian had told friends and family back in the UK that they were having a wonderful time in America . Relatives said they emigrated for a ‘better life for the family’ and chose to settle in Newtown, Connecticut, because it seemed so ‘safe and peaceful’. The house they moved into was directly across the street from the home of crazed gunman Adam Lanza, who opened fire in Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday after shooting his mother dead. Before the massacre, Mrs Hockley gave a poignant interview to the local newspaper in Newtown, describing her new home as a ‘wonderful place to live’. The devoted mother said the family had ‘felt happy and comfortable’ leaving Eastleigh, Hampshire, where she had lived with IBM finance manager Mr Hockley for nine years, to move to New England. In the article posted on The Newtown Bee website, the 42-year old said: ‘The schools here have been amazing, and the people in my neighbourhood are incredible. ‘Newtown is a wonderful place to live and we’re looking forward to being here a long, long time.’ Mr Hockley’s cousin, David Lutkin, 48, from Whittlesey in Cambridgeshire, yesterday said the entire family was in shock. ‘They chose to move to that area because it’s the last place you’d expect something like that to happen and it had a good school,’ he said. Heartbreaking: Dylan Hockley was described as a 'lovely little boy' by the family's next door neighbour . ‘Obviously there was one bad apple in the neighbourhood. You can’t account for that.’ Mr Lutkin added that Dylan had been ‘very close’ to eight-year-old Jake, who would have taken the loss very hard. ‘They are just a fabulous family. They are not good at the moment.’ Maria Sweet, 81, a retired nanny who lived next door to the Hockleys in Eastleigh, said the news left her ‘brokenhearted’. She said: ‘Dylan was such a lovely little boy and very intelligent too, he enjoyed school. ‘I would often offer him a drink and some biscuits and he’d come up to me and give me a cuddle.’ She still has cards from Dylan and his brother thanking her for presents. One read: ‘Dear Mrs Sweet, thank you so much for the chocolate bars, we love chocolate. We hope you had a nice Christmas and Happy New Year and hope to see you again soon.’ She described Mr and Mrs Hockley as ‘fantastic parents’. She said: ‘They both had so much time for the kids and loved them so much. ‘Ian was back here only last week to finalise the sale of their house – they had settled in America and were enjoying life there. ‘Ian and Nicole worked so very hard here and I think they wanted to move to America for a quieter life. ‘I remember Nicole being really excited about going and the two boys were looking forwards to seeing their grandparents more. They thought it would be a nice place to bring up their children.’ Peter Missen, 55, of Southsea, Hampshire, who worked with Mr Hockley at IBM in Hampshire, said: . ‘We kept in touch via Facebook and he would upload family snaps of himself with his beloved boys.‘Although Ian was a serious professional man, he was happy go lucky and you could tell he was a doting dad. Brothers: Dylan (left) and Jake were 'very close' according to a family member . He seemed very happy with their new life over in the States and this is absolutely tragic for them. I feel completely devastated.’ Dylan’s devastated grandmother Theresa Moretti, who lives in the US, said her daughter had previously described the town as ‘safe and lovely’. She said she heard the news as she was out buying Christmas presents for Dylan and Jake. ‘I got a garbled message on my answerphone from my daughter. She was almost incoherent. I called her back and she told me what had happened. Happy: Dylan (top), Jake and father Ian. The family have lived in the U.S. for nearly two years . 'She kept saying, “Mum, how do you tell an eight-year-old his six-year-old brother is dead and not coming back?” ‘Jake was at school that day. He heard the gunfire that killed his brother. 'The family isn’t doing well . . . Why did he have to shoot 20 innocent babies? They were only six and seven years old. Killer: Adam Lanza shot 26 people dead, 20 of them schoolchildren aged five to ten, and then shot himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut . ‘Dylan was a lovely boy. He had dimples and blue eyes and a mischievous grin . . . We are shattered and will never be the same.’ Close family friend Kristen Trudeau said the Hockleys were being comforted by hundreds of messages of support that have flooded in. But she said the family’s agony was made even worse by the  fact that they lived in the same road as Lanza. ‘They are totally bereft over the loss of Dylan, but to know you have lived with the killer is just unreal,’ the mother of two said. Another friend added: ‘Losing your son in such a way is unimaginable, but having to live within sight of the killer’s home is just sick. 'They must want to get away from here as quickly as possible.’ Mrs Trudeau, 36, and her husband Brian, 38, got to know the Hockley family soon after they moved  to Newtown. Mrs Hockley joined a newcomers’ club and with another British woman, Jillian Cruwys, became one of the main organisers. The club arranges social events to  help people moving into the town make friends. The family were also regular visitors to a shop that sold British goods in Newtown called UK Gourmet. ‘The children like to go there to get their Flakes and other chocolate bars,’ said a friend. ‘I don’t think the boys really liked our American chocolate.’ Prayers were said yesterday for the family at St Nicholas’s Church in Eastleigh, and advent candles were lit for them during the service. Bravery: Victoria Soto, 27, is believed to have sacrificed her life to save the children in her care . Out of the chaos and horror of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School emerged incredible stories of bravery and selflessness from teachers and staff who were prepared to lay down their lives to protect the children in their care. Teacher Victoria Soto is believed to have hidden her pupils in a classroom closet but stood outside, possibly because there was no room for her to hide in there too. When Lanza demanded to know where the children were, the 27-year-old lied and told him they were at the other end of the school in the auditorium. But six of her pupils tried to escape and Lanza shot them, Miss Soto and a teaching assistant who was in the room. Police later opened the closet and found the remaining seven members  of the class, who told them what had happened. Miss Soto’s cousin Jim Wiltsie said: ‘She took her kids, put them in the closet and by doing so she lost her life protecting those little ones. 'I’m just proud that Vicki had the instincts to protect her kids from harm.’ He added: ‘It brings peace to know that Vicki was doing what she loved, protecting the children, and, in our eyes, she’s a hero.’ Miss Soto, who had worked at the school for five years, was popular with the students – not least because she liked to chew gum in class, a habit usually frowned upon during lessons. The teacher, who lived with her family in nearby Stratford, Connecticut, was single and doted on her black labrador Roxy. She called her pupils her ‘little angels’, said a friend. Scores of mourners, including Miss Soto’s mother Donna, sisters Karly and Jillian and brother Matthew, gathered in Stratford on Saturday night for an emotional vigil.

The winner of a £148million lottery jackpot has closed his music shop – after it was targeted by spongers looking for handouts. Despite his stunning win in the Euromillions draw, father-of-two Adrian Bayford chose to continue dealing with the public because he enjoyed it so much. But he has now decided to close the independent Suffolk Music Centre in Haverhill because of abuse from visitors. Scroll down for video . In demand: Lottery winner Adrian Bayford (pictured with his wife Gillian), has shut his business after he was bombarded with requests for cash following his huge £148miillion win . Mr Bayford, 41, went back to work behind the counter just two weeks after he and his wife Gillian, 40, won the massive prize in August last year. Neighbours say he held a closing-down sale before Christmas, charging just £10 for as many as 20 second-hand CDs or DVDs. The shop shut at the end of December and has been stripped of all its shelving and contents. The owner of a nearby business said yesterday: ‘Adrian was getting a lot of grief from people walking in and trying to get cash off him. ‘There are idiots in every town and some of them got nasty when he turned them away. He just does not need that kind of abuse.’ The shop which Mr Bayford ran with business partner Richard Hudspith also used to sell guitars. A sign on the window states that the multi-millionaire hopes to start a new business, selling and repairing musical instruments. Mr Bayford, a former postman, used to sell second-hand CDs from a market stall. After he and his wife realised they had hit the jackpot they celebrated by ordering a Domino’s Pizza and booked an easyJet flight to Scotland.  The Bayfords’ win placed them at 516th in the Sunday Times Rich List and the couple recently spent £6million on a mansion and country estate in East Anglia. Bombarded: The tiny shop which Adrian Bayford jointly ran with his best friend in the Suffolk town of Haverhill closed at the end of last month and has been stripped of its contents . The shop, which Mr Bayford ran with business partner Richard Hudspith, also used to sell guitars and other musical instruments . The Grade II-listed Georgian mansion is set in more than 100 acres of woods and farmland, and has seven bedrooms and four marble bathrooms as well as a three-bedroom annexe, a lodge, a three-bedroom farmhouse and four cottages. A friend of the couple said: ‘Adrian and Gillian made no secret about wanting to buy a nice house when they went public with their win. ‘Some people expected them to move out of their old home straight away – but they have taken their time to find the ideal place.’ The Bayfords’ jackpot was the second-biggest to be won by Britons. The record is held by Colin and Christine Weir, from Ayrshire, who scooped £161million in July 2011. Still on a budget: Adrian and Gillian Bayford board a helicopter after it was revealed that they had won £148million on the lottery. Within hours, they were on an easyJet flight to the continent with their two children . Jet-setters: The helicopter took the couple on a four-mile journey to Stansted Airport, where they boarded an easyJet flight with their two children . The couple scooped the second largest . lottery jackpot in British history in August with a ticket Mr Bayford . bought at his local newsagents. The first evidence of the start of their spending spree was spotted in the shape of a modest Ford family car. The Bayfords stunned Britain with the . warm, laid back approach to super wealth and appeared to continue the . modest trend by opting for a £17,000 4x4 Kuga. Jackpot: The couple want to use their money to help people and support good causes, Mr Bayford's business partner has said . The sensible buy was a far cry from the dream car Gillian admitted to craving when she discovered the win - a £60,000 Audi Q7. Millions of admirers were surprised to hear the Bayfords celebrated their fortune by having takeaway pizzas from Dominos. They shunned exclusive resorts and the tropics by jetting off for a caravaning holiday with Gillian's parents in Scotland.

Tesco is set for a big push into India as politicians in Delhi cleared the way for foreign firms to break into the retail market. The controversial decision to remove a ban preventing international firms like Tesco, Wal-Mart, and Carrefour from setting up shop in India has now received full parliamentary backing. India is a crucial market for Britain’s biggest retailer, which was dealt a blow earlier this week when it effectively called time on attempts to crack America with its fledgling supermarket chain Fresh & Easy. Expansion: The removal of the ban means international companies, such as Tesco, can expand in the country. Tesco already has links with supermarkets in India, which is viewed as a key international growth market . The Delhi government has made it hard for foreign supermarket chains to break into the domestic scene because it wants to protect the local network of corner shops, known as kirana stores. It has faced fierce protests and had announced plans to relax these rules in January only to stage a u-turn days later. India’s upper house waved through a relaxation of laws on Friday as part of a plan to boost the country’s slowing economy. It was the last hurdle after the Congress-led government won a key vote in the lower house with a total of 123 MPs voting in favour of the decision. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘Tesco welcomes this positive development and we are reviewing the conditions. We already have a successful franchise arrangement with Tata’s Star Bazaar stores and we are hopeful that this development will allow more Indian consumers, businesses and communities to benefit from retail investment.’ Tesco already has stores in 13 countries – with Poland, Korea and Thailand its star performers. Growing: Tesco is pursuing international expansion, with stores in 13 countries, including Poland, Korea and China, pictured . In an effort to learn more about Indian consumers ahead of entry laws being relaxed, the big chains have joined forces with local players. Tesco teamed up with Tata and has started to roll out a series of Tesco-style hypermarkets, branded Star Bazaar, under a franchise arrangement. Yesterday’s development will mean Tesco can take control, owning more than 50 per cent of the business, and also put its name above the door. Tesco has been struggling to turn its business around in the UK, following a shock warning on profit levels in January. It needs success from abroad to offset the challenges at home. Its international business now accounts for a third of group sales. Tesco had seconded veteran David Morris from its Hungarian business to become chief operating officer, but he has now moved back to Eastern Europe. He has almost doubled the number of stores to 13 in the past two years. ‘We supply 80pc of the stock into Star Bazaar and have opened a state-of-the-art distribution centre in Mumbai,’ Morris told the Mail earlier in the year. ‘We are focused on the west and south of the country, which has 150m potential customers, where we are trying to understand each city.’","Overturned ban means international companies can compete in India .

Couples travel from all over the world, including the UK, to tie the knot at the store in full bridal wear - before firing semi-automatics as well as pistols, UZIs and AK47s. The £300 package includes an ordained minister, access to a private VIP shooting range and five shots on a shotgun for the bride and groom. Another deal, called the Mr & Mrs Smith & Wesson, offers even more guns, ammunition and targets.

Melbourne's Daily Planet brothel says it's the largest and most exclusive in the Southern Hemisphere . Australia, once an 18th century penal colony, is still attracting criminals although it would seem they are now going there out of choice. The nation’s strong economy, high currency and wages have now made it a magnet for international drug smugglers and foreign sex workers. Even rock and roll stars are getting in on the act and reaping rewards of performing in a country that is prepared to pay top dollar to have them. Australian police made 69,500 illicit drug busts in the year to June 30, . 2012, the highest in a decade, and have made record arrests in the . first six months of this financial year. 'Offshore organised crime syndicates perceive Australia to have a robust economy and to have been less affected by the global financial crisis than other jurisdictions,' said Paul Jevtovic, the Australian Crime Commission’s executive director of intervention and prevention. Crime statistics show why some are willing to risk up to 20 years in prison. The Australian Crime Commission, which examines trends and works . closely with police agencies, said heroin and MDMA, also known as . ecstasy, sell for about eight times more in Australia than in Britain . and the United States, though Australia is a much smaller market. Crime Commission data given to Reuters shows a kilogram of cocaine is . worth about £1,540 in Colombia, £8,025 in Mexico, and £21,186 in the . United States. The same kilogram of cocaine is worth £141,000 in Australia. In recent months, police have intercepted drugs hidden in a 20-tonne steamroller and heavy machinery, in a large wooden altar, and they have broken up a drug ring involving smugglers in Australia, Japan and Vietnam. One of the biggest smuggling operations was a failed bid to bring in more than 200 kg (440 lb) of cocaine across the Pacific Ocean from Ecuador on a 13-metre (40-foot) yacht, found grounded on a small atoll in Tonga with a dead crewman aboard. Australian police, who work closely with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and authorities throughout Asia and the South Pacific, said the high prices paid in Australia and the strong dollar all helped make the country attractive for smugglers. The steamroller sent from China was used to hide 350kg of cocaine and methamphetamine by two men in Sydney this year. A Canadian man and a U.S. man were arrested. Small portion of a £180 million drug haul seized in Sydney this year from the above steamroller . Foreign sex workers are also cashing in on the boom, particularly in remote . mining towns, where the world’s oldest profession is the latest to adopt . fly-in, fly-out work practices. And more overseas sex workers are . heading for Australia. A 2012 report for the government in the most populous state, New . South Wales, found a marked rise in the number of female sex workers . from Thailand, Korea and China since 2006, with 53 percent of sex . workers from Asia and a further 13.5 percent from other . non-English-speaking countries. The report, by the University of New South Wales, found a median . hourly rate of £100 for sex services in Australia’s largest city of . Sydney, although sex workers can charge double that in remote mining . towns full of men with disposable incomes. In the gold mining town of Kalgoorlie in the Western Australia state, . the Red House brothel, which has operated since 1934, advertises . services starting at £190 an hour. Proprietor Bruna Meyers said women in her establishment earned up to £2,570 a week at a busy time, or about three times the average . full-time Australian wage. US pop singer Justin Bieber (left) arrived for his Live & Intimate concert in Sydney, in July this year, whileUS singer Ke$ha, who's real name is Kesha Rose Sebert (right), performed live in Australia last year . 'The girls who come here are mainly from over east (eastern . Australian states). They come in, sometimes for two or three weeks at a . time. Some are just girls who are travelling around the world,' Meyers . told Reuters. The . strong dollar has also made Australia the ideal place to perform for . musicians wanting to make money at a time when touring rather than album . sales is the main driver of income, with many acts charging a premium . in a thriving economy. In . the first half of 2013, Australia will see tours by Bruce Springsteen, . Pink, Guns N’Roses, Ringo Starr, ZZ Top, Thin Lizzy, the Steve Miller . Band, Deep Purple, Santana, Status Quo, Robert Plant, Neil Young, Carole . King, Paul Simon and Kiss. The . high ticket prices have upset some fans, who question why an artist . like Springsteen charges £140 for a premium ticket in Australia, when . the same ticket to the same show in Connecticut in October cost £58. 'You . can’t tell me it costs more than double per head to stage a concert . here in Australia,' said music fan Robin Pash, who has just returned . from the United States, where he saw Springsteen and a series of acts . for what would be considered bargain prices.

'I want it to be about me and him,' she said. 'He's a guy I can see myself having a real future with.' She insisted that McCarron had not . asked her to cancel the interviews, after TMZ had earlier reported that . he was upset about being overshadowed by his girlfriend.

'We . always try to capture interesting . storylines, and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss . Alabama USA and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test.

'If he had said something along the . lines of we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, . that would have been a bit different,' she told the Today show on Wednesday morning. 'The fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous - I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that.' But as well as Miss Webb herself, her father, Alan Webb, came to the defense of Musburger. Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed' 'On . one hand, you can look at it as being kind of like the dirty old man,' he said. 'But I'm used to this and I think if you really look into what . that he was trying to say, he was trying to be complimentary, and I . think they need to give Brent a break.' Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Miss Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 205,000 by Tuesday evening. And ever since, her phone has been ringing off the hook, Trump told Page Six. 'She . was forced to change her phone number,' Trump said. 'She was getting . thousands and thousands of calls.

Pakistan's ISI security service also found two radio sets in a final sweep of the compound before demolition. The . English-language Bibles - a bizarre find in the home of the world's . most famous Islamic fundamentalist - contained pages that are . folded-over and highlighted texts. An . ISI commanding officer told The Sun: 'The Bibles were in English and we . cannot be sure why they were there. These copies were found as we . checked the rooms for the final time before demolishing the building. 'The . radios are in working condition and will be given with the Bibles to . the investigators. Some pages were folded and we will see later what was . of most interest to Bin Laden. 'Maybe he was looking for teachings of jihad.' Bin Laden was killed at the compound by U.S. Navy SEALs last May after the biggest manhunt in history. Its demolition was completed on Sunday, erasing a symbol of humiliation for Pakistan's military that has marked one of the most difficult periods in U.S.-Pakistan ties. The Pakistani military was angry it had not been consulted by U.S. officials before the raid took place - a decision the U.S. explained was driven by . concerns that someone in the government might tip off Bin Laden. Inside the compound: An image showing Bin Laden in the shabby Abbottabad compound surrounded by TVs, a PC, digital decoder and a boster pillow . While much of the world cheered the death, Pakistan fumed over what it called a violation of its sovereignty. Why Pakistani authorities decided to demolish the structure last week is unclear. Residents . of the normally sleepy town of Abbottabad were divided on what the . government should do with the compound in the aftermath of the raid. Some . thought it should be destroyed, but others believed it should be turned . into a tourist attraction to help the town earn money. There was always the danger, however, that it could also draw Al Qaeda supporters. American officials said they buried Bin Laden's body at sea to avoid giving his followers a burial place . that could become a makeshift shrine. Many . U.S. officials expressed disbelief that Bin Laden could have lived in . Abbottabad for around six years without the Pakistani government . knowing. Now demolished: Bin Laden was killed at the three-storey compound by U.S. Navy SEALs last May after the biggest manhunt in history . But the U.S. has not found any evidence that senior Pakistani . officials knew of the Al Qaeda chief's whereabouts. The . U.S. Navy SEALs who attacked bin Laden's compound infiltrated . by helicopter from neighbouring Afghanistan. Pakistan responded by kicking out . more than 100 U.S. troops training Pakistanis in counter-terrorism . operations and reduced the level of intelligence cooperation. Some . members of Congress called on the U.S. to cut of the billions of . dollars of military and civilian aid to Pakistan unless Islamabad . explained Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad and boosted cooperation on . the Afghan war. The aid has continued, although at a somewhat lower . level.","Pakistani officials also found two radio sets at the Abbottabad compound .

She is the ultra-glamorous Pussycat Doll who soared to glory on this year's X Factor when her act James Arthur won. Her 'sha-mazing' performance on the show won her countless new fans - many of whom gaped at her dazzling dresses on the show week after week. And now, the sha-mazing star herself has revealed just what she's going to be wearing this 25 December: A pair of not-so glamorous Spanx. The suck-me-in control pants have fast become the go-to garment for celebrities and regular folk alike looking to banish the bulge and avoid the dreaded VPL - and they are now set to make up Nicole's Christmas look too. Dazzling: Slender Nicole doesn't look to be in need of Spanx - but the star says she loves the control pants - whether she's wearing them under these X Factor gowns is as yet unconfirmed . Even slender young stars like Katy Perry, Tulisa and Kristen Stewart admit to wearing them, and everyone from Princess Beatrice to Kim Kardashian via Jennifer Lopez has inadvertently flashed a glimpse of their Spanx. So if nothing else, Nicole, 34, is in excellent company. The star told Closer magazine she would be pairing her control pants with a push-up bra. 'I'll be wearing Spanx and a great bra to lift up those puppies!' she said in an interview with the magazine. 'I can't wait to have Christmas with my family,' she added, saying that she would be indulging on chicken, dumplings and pecan pie. 'There's no diet then,' she says. 'I like to pig out over Christmas and work it off in January. Then I'll go running in Hyde Park and do Bikram yoga classes. I also try to cut down on salty foods and eating late at night.' LEFT: With fellow X Factor judge and Spanx fan Tulisa Contostavlos, and right, Nicole has won the hearts of X Fact fans with her strong leadership and witty one-liners . But the star, who recently admitted she suffered from bulimia while she was touring with The Pussycat Dolls in 2003, says she tries to eat healthily. 'Breakfast is boiled egg with toast, lunch is a chicken and salad wrap, dinner is wholewheat pasta or sushi.' Nicole tells Closer that she snacks on raw nuts, bananas and sugar-free hot chocolate, and avoids alcohol apart from the occasional glass of wine with her dinner. She keeps her weakness for crumpets, chocolate, sweets, cheese and cakes in check by enjoying them once in a while, but not over-indulging. Her rule of thumb? Don't deny yourself anything - it will only make you want it more. And despite her fondness for a sequinned dress, Nicole plans to keep it real on Christmas Eve. Her festive outfit is a funny Christmas jumper and jeans for Christmas Eve, and comfy clothes on Christmas Day. Her one concession to smart? She will wear a classy outfit for church on Christmas day. 'It's not a time for latex!' she jokes. How the stars do it: Spanx are worn by everyone from Princess Beaatrice and Sienna Miller to Gwyneth Paltrow, who recently said the control pants are 'the way all the Hollywood girls do it'","X Factor star, 34, plans to pair control pants with push-up bra to 'lift up those puppies'

Mitt Romney’s openly gay national security spokesman has resigned from his post after being on the job less than a month. Richard Grenell said in a statement that he resigned because of the ‘hyper-partisan discussion of personal issues that sometimes comes from a presidential campaign.’ His employment under the Romney campaign had been heavily questioned by Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association, who said Mr Grenell posed a national security risk. In a statement issued exclusively to the Washington Post, Mr Grenell said: ‘I want to thank Governor Romney for his belief in me and my abilities and his clear message to me that being openly gay was a non-issue for him and his team.’ Matt Rhodes, Romney’s campaign manager, said in a statement that the likely GOP candidate and his team were ‘disappointed that Ric decided to resign from the campaign for his own personal reasons. ‘We wanted him to stay because he had superior qualifications for the position he was hired to fill.’ His highly active Twitter page has been silent - his last tweet was on April 27. He got into hot water over his sexist and offensive tweets days after he was appointed Romney's spokesperson. Grenell, who formerly worked as a spokesman for George W.Bush, has deleted more than 800 of his past tweets including scathing remarks which mocked Michelle Obama, Callista Gingrich, Hillary Clinton and female news reporters. Moving on: Former Gov Mitt Romney was in New York City today; here, he is seen delivering pizzas for the FDNY . But reporters spotted Grenell’s sexist snipes and cutting comments, which largely targeted the media and high-profile female Democrats, before he had the chance to erase them. In one tweet, which has been removed from the site, Grenell reflected on First Lady Michelle Obama ‘sweating on the East Room carpet' as she worked out in the White House. In another tweet he took a swipe at her grammar posting: ‘First Lady slang? Michelle Obama tonight in North Carolina said: 'Because I got to get home after this.' is that transcript right?’ And Romney’s new national security and foreign policy spokesman repeatedly took to the social media site to slam Newt Gingrich's wife, Callista. Lookalikes: In one tweet Grenell wrote that Hillary Clinton is starting to look like her Secretary of State predecessor - Madeleine Albright . Harsh: Grenell used Twitter to ask if Callista Gringrich's hair was clipped on . Grenell, who lives with his long-term partner Matthew Lashey, asked whether Callista Gingrich’s ‘hair snaps on’ and, in a separate tweet, commented that Gingrich’s third wife ‘stands there like she is wife #1’. Hillary Clinton was another victim of Grenell’s acerbic tongue when he compared her to Madele  ine Albright, the first female Secretary of State, who served under Bill Clinton. 'Hillary is starting to look liek [sic] Madeline Albright,’ he wrote on his Twitter page. He saved some of his most . misogynistic remarks for MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who he patronizingly . advised to ‘take a breath and wear a necklace’ and said she was a 'dead . ringer' for teenage pop sensation Justin Bieber. The . Huffington Post were directed to Grenell’s original statement defending . his tweets, which can no longer be seen on his feed. 'My tweets were written to be tongue-in-cheek and humorous but I can now see how they can also be hurtful,' Grenell said. 'I didn’t mean them that way and will remove them from twitter. I apologize for any hurt they caused.' However, . Maddow didn’t accept the apology and, during a Friday night show, asked . if the Romney campaign sees ‘any sign that they understand that a long, . string of really nasty, sexist tweets about Callista Gingrich's . appearance might be alienating to people who might otherwise consider . voting for Mr. Romney,’ reported the Huffington Post. Dead ringer: Rachel Maddow, an MSNBC host, was unamused by Grenell's tweet saying she was a dead ringer for pop sensation Justin Bieber .

A Las Vegas police officer is being investigated by a federal grand jury after he kicked a man in diabetic shock five times in the head during a traffic stop, it was revealed today. Henderson police sergeant Brett Seekatz was caught on dashboard camera beating Adam Greene after he was dragged from his car in the controversial 2010 incident. In the video, Greene was stopped by officers who said they thought he was driving drunk. The diabetic was in fact suffering from severe hyperglycemia while on his way to work. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Investigation: Henderson police sergeant Brett Seekatz, right, was caught on dash cam kicking Adam Greene in 2010 . The man is shown to be unresponsive when an officer walks up to him, cursing, and kicks him in the head. He is then kneed in the ribs by other officers as he screams out in pain. Paramedics arrived on the scene and Greene was treated for low blood sugar. He was later treated for fractured ribs and bruises all over his body including his face and scalp. In February, Greene was awarded a $292,500 settlement in the beating case. Seekatz was 'disciplined' at the time, according to a Henderson police department statement, but was not suspended from duty or demoted. However, it was revealed Tuesday that a grand jury has been hearing evidence for months about the incident. Aggressive: Greene was ordered out of his car at gunpoint after he was pulled over for driving erratically . Screams: Greene, pictured on the ground, screams out in pain as he is kicked in the head by Seekatz and kneed in the ribs by other officers . Grand jury sessions are secret, and it is unknown what, if any, charges federal prosecutors are seeking against Seekatz, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The newspaper reported that the federal investigation was referenced in an email from Las Vegas Police Protective Association director Chris Collins to the union's nearly 3,000 members last week. In the note, Collins outlined recent changes in the department's use-of-force hearings. He also advised officers not to testify if subpoenaed to appear, mentioning a federal investigation stemming from a 'high-profile arrest.' Settlement: In February 2012, Greene, shown above during an interview where his face was concealed, was awarded a $292,500 settlement . 'It has come to my attention that the local U.S. Attorney working with Department of Justice Civil Rights prosecutors, has been investigating another department's officer for alleged criminal conduct arising out of a high-profile arrest,' Collins wrote, according to the LVRJ. The federal authorities regularly review officer-related use-of-force incidents for 'potential civil rights violations. The risk that you may be investigated by another law enforcement agency is real and substantial,' Collins wrote. He told the Review Journal on Monday that he wasn't aware of the grand jury investigation and a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office said she could not confirm or deny it. Greene's former lawyer said the man had not yet been subpoenaed to testify in any grand jury proceedings.","Las Vegas police sergeant Brett Seekatz is seen beating Adam Greene after he was pulled over for driving erratically .

Wal-mart Stores is pledging to hire every recently discharged veteran looking for a job, kick-starting one of the largest hiring commitments for U.S. veterans on record. The both world's largest retailer and the nation's largest private employer says it expects to hire more than 100,000 veterans over the next five years thanks to the pledge, starting on Memorial Day. The hiring pledge will cover veterans within 12 months of honorably leaving active duty. Most of the jobs will be in Wal-Mart's stores or its Sam's club locations. Some will be in the company's distribution centers. Open doors: Wal-mart stores is pledging to hire more than 100,000 honorably discharged veterans who are looking for a job, Frank Brincho, a WWII veteran of Foothill Ranch California, pictured . With spirited support from the White House, specifically First Lady Michelle Obama, the pledge is set to be announced in New York on Tuesday as part of an address at the annual retail industry convention by Bill Simon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart's namesake U.S. business. 'Let's be clear; hiring a veteran can be one of the best decisions any of us can make,' says Mr Simon, according to prepared text supplied by the discounter. 'Veterans have a record of performance under pressure. They're quick learners, and they're team players. These are leaders with discipline, training, and a passion for service. There is a seriousness and sense of purpose that the military instills, and we need it today more than ever.' Wal-Mart says it believes it is already the largest private employer of veterans in the country. Employees: Wal-Mart, employing more than 1.4 million workers in the U.S., already claims to be the largest private employer of veterans in the country . The company says that it has spoken to the White House about its commitment, and said Mrs Obama's team has already expressed an interest in working with Wal-Mart and with the rest of the business community. Calling Wal-Mart’s announcement ‘historic,’ Mrs Obama has herself spearheaded a White House drive to encourage businesses to hire veterans. 'We all believe that no one who serves our country should have to fight for a job once they return home,' Mrs Obama said in her statement. 'Wal-Mart is setting a ground-breaking example for the private sector to follow.' In the next several weeks, the White House will convene the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense and major U.S. employers to encourage businesses to make significant commitments to train and employ American's returning veterans, according to Simon's prepared text. Wal-Mart which also operates Sam's Clubs, employs more than 1.4 million workers in the U.S. Of that number about 100,000 are already veterans, a spokesman told CNN.","The hiring pledge would benefit honorably discharged military within 12 months of leaving service .

Shoppers face higher produce prices nationwide because of unseasonably chilly weather in the western United States. As an unusual cold spell gripped parts of the West for a fifth day, some California citrus growers reported damage to crops and an agriculture official said national prices on lettuce have started to rise because of lost produce in Arizona. The extreme chill in the West comes as the eastern U.S., from Atlanta to New York City, is seeing spring-like weather. Citrus crisis: Icicles form on an orange tree during the five-day cold snap in California . Fruit growers are struggling to protect the $1.5 billion crop but some wastage is now inevitable . An orange is encased in ice at a grove in Redlands, California. Farmers are hopeful that the thaw is not far away . In California's San Joaquin Valley, . where farmers are fighting to protect about $1.5 billion worth of citrus . fruit on their trees, Sunday temperatures dropped to 25 degrees in some . areas and stayed low longer than previous nights. Prolonged temperatures in the mid-20s or below cause damage to citrus crops. 'It was our coldest night to date,' said Paul Story of Exeter-based . California Citrus Mutual, an association of the state's 3,900 citrus . growers. 'I think mandarin growers are going to see a range of significant damage, enough that they will have to separate their crops.' Mandarins are more susceptible to cold than other citrus and start to freeze at about 32 degrees, Story said. Growers are doing everything they can to protect the crops, including harvesting early and using air blowers to keep warm air moving . On Sunday temperatures dropped to 25 degrees in some areas and stayed low longer than previous nights . Because many mandarin trees were . planted in recent years as the fruit's popularity soared, they are grown . in colder areas outside the traditional citrus belt. Other citrus crops saw little or . minimal damage, Story said. This year's high sugar content in oranges . helped protect them, he said, because sugar inhibits freezing. Growers deployed wind machines to keep the warm air closer to the ground and irrigation to raise the temperature in the groves. Rows farthest away from the protection could be damaged, Story said. And farmers who do not have wind machines could lose crops. Lindsey-based . Robert LoBue — who grows 1,000 acres of citrus, including mandarins — . said wind machines were critical in his groves, but saving the crop . doesn't come cheap. LoBue runs one wind machine for every 10 acres and . has to employ a crew to operate them. The forecast for Tuesday suggests more mild temperatures but the western states have suffered freezing weather for the last five days . 'We're . very diligent, we run the wind and water all night,' LoBue said, 'but . we're spending thousands of dollars to protect these crops.' And . farmers are on the hook for a fifth cold night: a freeze warning . remains in effect until 10 a.m. Tuesday for central California. In . Southern California, where strong winds helped keep some crops out of . danger by keeping the cold from settling, farmers said any damage would . negatively impact workers and consumers. 'We have between 170 to 200 employees . and if we can't pick we have to lay off our picking crews,' said John . Gless, a third-generation Riverside-based grower. And if there's less . fruit to pick, he said prices will go up. Frost covers the ground in a grove east of Clovis, California. Five days of cold temperatures have put citrus crops in danger . Temperatures in downtown Los Angeles fell to 34 degrees, breaking the previous record of 36 degrees set on Jan. 14, 2007. In Angeles National Forest, where overnight temperatures have been dropping into the 20s, Arcadia hiker Danny Kim, 28, was found Sunday night after surviving 26 hours in the frigid West Fork wilderness. Kim was airlifted to a hospital for treatment of hypothermia. In Beverly Hills, fans brought heavy coats and scarves as they waited along the red carpet hoping to catch glimpses of stars arriving for the Golden Globes ceremony Sunday evening. Some of the actors shivered but weren't complaining. 'I'd rather be nippy than boiling hot,' said actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who arrived in a strapless dress. 'No, I'm not wearing any leggings or long underwear.' In San Diego, zookeepers offered extra heat and shelter for some animals. To . the east, the freezing temperatures already have done enough damage to . southwestern Arizona lettuce crops that prices are increasing, said Kurt . Nolte, a Yuma, Ariz.-based agricultural agent for the University of . Arizona. 'I'd rather be nippy than boiling hot,' said actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who arrived at the Golden Globes awards in Beverly Hills in a strapless dress . The area provides much of the nation's leafy greens during the winter, and farmers are reporting damage to many romaine and iceberg lettuce crops. The cold is freezing the heads of the lettuce and affecting the quality and yield, Nolte said. The price for a carton of lettuce in Yuma two weeks ago was $7 to $8. As of Monday, it cost around $20 per carton, he said. 'That's a result of cold weather in the Yuma area for the last six weeks,' Nolte said. Overnight temperatures this week have dipped into the 20s around Yuma, and Nolte said lettuce farmers can't protect their crops. 'With lettuce, you don't have the luxury of wind machines to stir up the atmosphere,' he noted. 'You have to live with what Mother Nature brings. 'Very little can be done other than maybe running some water to protect what's going to be harvested the next day.' Farm workers are worried that a large percentage of the crop could be destroyed . Nolte said Yuma farmers haven't seen much damage so far with other crops such as spinach, cauliflower and broccoli. Metropolitan Phoenix marked one of its coolest stretches since 1988 and Sunday morning's low of 7 degrees in Douglas, Ariz., broke a record for January in the Mexican border town. Farther north, a school district on the Navajo Nation cancelled all classes Tuesday because of freezing temperatures. Temperatures in Window Rock, Ariz., were expected to be well below freezing Tuesday with a high of 21 degrees and a low of minus 5 degrees. The Window Rock School District posted the cancellation notice on its website Monday, saying heating the schools has been a problem. In Nevada, the temperature in Ely plummeted to 24 below zero early Monday and wind chills were expected to drop to near 40 below into Tuesday. And in northern New Mexico, parts of Interstate 25 and some other highways were snow packed and icy Monday, and officials warned travelers that additional light snow could lead to hazardous driving conditions when coupled with the freezing temperature.","Extremely cold spell freezes western states for fifth day running as the east basks in spring-like conditions .

A nine-year-old boy who is dying from cystic fibrosis has been sent hundreds of thousands of Christmas cards in his bid to set the world record for the most ever received. For the past month, Dalton Dingus has been getting cards from strangers from all over the world bearing the same wish - that he sets the Guinness world record before he succumbs to the disease. So far, the youngster from Salyersville, Kentucky has received 504,269 cards, far exceeding the 205,120 cards received in 1992 - the last official time Guinness noted a Christmas card category. Scroll down for video . Overwhelmed: Nine-year-old Dalton Dingus, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, has received hundreds of thousands of Christmas cards from strangers across the world wishing him a merry Christmas . But this astonishing achievement does not mean that Dalton has set an official record, as spokeswoman Jamie Panas told ABC that Guinness 'currently does not monitor a . category for this'. Still, the family is encouraging the cards to keep coming, in the hope that Guinness Records will re-open the category for his feat. Cards stacked in the family's garage and swamping the home have come from as far afield as Germany, the Ukraine and South Korea in what his mother Jessica calls 'a Christmas miracle'. The first few trickled in after a family friend wrote a post on Facebook asking for messages of support that Jessica Dingus could place on the mantlepiece for her sick son. Plea: It originally started after a family . friend posted on Facebook asking for cards bearing warm wishes that his . parents, Jessica and Tommy, pictured, could put up in the home - and the . message went viral . Generosity: The youngster has received more than half a million cards, which no longer fit in his family home . Loved: UPS brought him 30,000 on Christmas Eve alone. Volunteers handpick ones for him to read . But as cards started coming in from neighbours and friends, the Facebook message began spreading across the social network and was picked up by local media. With this boost came thousands more cards, including stacks hand-delivered by Miss Kentucky and Kentucky State Troopers. On Christmas Eve alone, the postal service delivered 30,000 letters and 1,972 packages, some of which were crammed full with cards, David Walton, from the US Postal Service, told ABC. In addition to these, services such as UPS and FedEx delivered hundreds more. There are so many that the cards can longer fit in the family's . home and the postal service can no longer fit them all into a truck. Show of support: A stack of the cards was hand-delivered to Dalton by Kentucky state troopers . Battle: Dalton relies on a mask to help him breathe. Doctors said he had just days to live in October, but his mother said the cards have helped him become like he was before the illness really took hold, right .

A former school principal who had sex with one of his students is believed to be the father of her child. John Ward, 55, was arrested and charged with indecent liberties with a student after the 16-year-old girl told police he could be the father of her two-year-old baby. Ward, who is married, is expected to undergo a paternity test to determine if he is the father. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Former principal and transportation director John Ward, is facing charges of inappropriate behavior with a student after a 16-year-old said he may be the father of her baby . The child is now aged two and lives with her mother, a former student at the Montgomery Learning Academy in Troy, North Carolina. The possibility that Ward is the father came after the girl spoke with police as they investigated the inappropriate relationship. 'I asked the victim, “could the child possibly be Mr Wards’?” She said, “yes,”’ said Montgomery County detective Lt. Kelley Howell. Police were tipped off about the baby by school officials. Ward has been employed with Montgomery County Schools since 2002. He has worked as a band director, assistant principal and principal. His last role was as transportation director for the school district. Local TV station WFMY said the school district received a complaint about Ward and the student back in 2011. But after investigating the complaint no action was taken and the police were not called in. But on Monday after receiving another complaint about Ward they notified the sheriff's department. Sheriff's questioned Ward and he allegedly confessed to the relationship. Intimacy: Both the teenager and the former principal have admitted to having had a sexual relationship at his home where she frequently stayed for several days (file photo) Ward's wife, who works for the Department of Social Services in Montgomery County, has been suspended with pay from her job while the investigation into her husband continues. She is said to have only found out about the affair this week. According to Lt. Detective Kelly Howell most of the sexual encounters took place at Ward’s home, where the student frequently stayed for several days at the time. None of the encounters occurred at the school said Howell. During the time of the affair and while a student at the Learning Academy, the student had a baby. ‘They both stated that they had a sexual relationship with each other,’ said Lt. Kelley Howell with the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department. ‘There was a child. The child’s father’s in question. It may be Mr Ward’s, it may not be.' School chiefs issued a statement reassuring parents. 'Although this situation is very disturbing and upsetting – it does not define who we are.  It is sad that it might somehow overshadow the tremendous work that our employees do on a daily basis — being leaders and role models for our students. 'It is already a part of our annual process to remind employees about inappropriate relationships with students.  However, we will continue to evaluate existing and additional training opportunities to ensure that employees understand the importance of keeping the student-educator relationship professional.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:11 EST, 18 July 2011 . Animal testing for everyday household products such as washing up liquid, furniture polish, air freshener and bleach could soon be banned in the UK. The Government has taken a first step towards ending the practice, which will make household products subject to the same rules as cosmetics. In a statement today Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said inflicting pain and suffering on animals to manufacture household products was 'unacceptable'. The animal tests for household products currently involve giving animals high toxic doses of chemicals or rubbing irritants into their skin . The Government had previously voiced its intention to introduce a ban, but today it went a step further by announcing that it was consulting with companies, trade bodies and other interested parties to confirm a working proposal. One question that needs to be answered before the ban becomes a reality is how to define a 'household product'. The testing of cosmetics or their ingredients on animals has been illegal in Britain since 2008. In future, a condition added to the 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act will stop animal testing licences being granted for experiments involving household products. Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said inflicting pain and suffering on animals to manufacture household products was 'unacceptable' The tests involve giving animals high toxic doses of chemicals or rubbing irritants into their skin. Ms Featherstone said: 'We believe it is possible to sell household products without inflicting pain and suffering on animals, and it is unacceptable that testing in this area continues. 'We propose to implement a ban through our licensing powers, and we are inviting stakeholders to share their views so we can end this practice as soon as possible.' The move was given a guarded welcome by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) which has been at the forefront of campaigns to end animal testing for cosmetics and household products. BUAV chief executive Michelle Thew said: 'The BUAV welcomes the reaffirmation of the intention to ban testing on animals for house products although we are concerned by the Government's continued uncertainty about which products will be covered and the absence of a firm date to implement the ban. 'It is unacceptable for animals to continue to suffer and die for a new washing up liquid or air freshener.' It is likely to be several months before the ban is brought in. The consultation period is due to last 12 weeks, after which all the information collected will have to be considered and responses made. The proposal is part of a wider science-led programme launched by the Government today to reduce the use of animals in research. Led by the UK National Centre for Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), it will focus on maximising opportunities to find alternatives to animal testing. Where animal procedures cannot be avoided the aim will be to minimise suffering. Animal testing for everyday household products such as washing up liquid, furniture polish, air freshener and bleach could soon be banned . The programme will involve exploring new approaches such as conducting tests on laboratory-grown cell cultures and computer modelling. Mice, rats and guinea pigs are most commonly used in the testing of household product chemicals, but tests may also be carried out on rabbits and dogs, according to the BUAV. The effects can include vomiting, seizures, internal bleeding and organ damage. Animals are routinely killed even when a test is not fatal. A 'kitemark' scheme endorsing 'cruelty free' cosmetic and household products has been run by the BUAV since the 1990s. Approved products which meet international humane standards are allowed to carry a recognisable 'leaping bunny' logo. Companies whose products are certified by the scheme include the Co-Op, M&S, Sainsbury and Astonish. Professor Frances Balkwill, chairwoman of the group Understanding Animal Research, which supports necessary animal testing, said: 'Scientists across the UK are committed to the 3Rs - reduction, replacement and refinement - to reduce animal use and promote best practice in the care of laboratory animals. 'Much progress has already been made by the research community to reduce animal use. Investment in biomedical research has more than doubled over the last 15 years, while animal studies have increased by little more than one third. This clearly demonstrates that 3Rs policies are working.'",The testing of cosmetics or their ingredients on animals has been illegal in Britain since 2008 .

Feisty: Lady Nancy Astor was the first woman to sit as a Member of Parliament and was renowned as an extravagant society lady . A Rolls-Royce commissioned for Lady Astor in September 1935, when the U.S. was in the middle of the Great Depression, is to go up for auction. The vintage car is expected to fetch in excess of £100,000 at Bonham's auction house in Arizona - almost the same amount she paid for it 77 years ago. The American socialite asked for her 'Sedanca de Ville' Rolls-Royce to have a number of . stylistic flourishes, including one of the earliest forms of the car . radio. It was delivered to . her residence at No.4 St. James Square in London, although she and her . husband, Viscount Astor, also had an aristocratic country seat at . Cliveden, Berkshire. In the . 1950s the car made its way across the Atlantic, where it changed hands a . couple of times before ending up in a private collection in Colorado. Despite its age it was serviced 12 months ago and is still in good working order. Lady Astor, who was born Nancy Witcher Langhorne in . Danville, Virginia, moved to England to begin her new life as . a socialite and support her husband's career in politics. After he ascended to the title of Viscount in 1919 Lady Astor won the by-election for his seat in the House of Commons. She was the second woman ever to be elected and the first woman MP to sit in the House of Commons. Lady Astor spent a small fortune on the magnificent car - it would cost £95,000 in today's money -.a similar move these days could well spell the end of a political career but the extravagant purchase did her no harm and she retained her seat for another decade.

Rolls-Royce was pretty much one of the best cars money could buy back . in 1935 and this vehicle was the ultimate item of luxury in its day. ‘It was big and luxurious, had a seven . litre engine and was a great way to travel across the country in . comfort. This would not have been used to drive around town. Extravagant: Lady Astor asked for her new car to have a number of stylistic flourishes to add to its plush luxury, including one of the earliest forms of the car radio in the back compartment . Remarkable: The car has a seven litre engine which is still in working order, and is expected to fetch close to £100,000 when it goes for auction at Bonhams . ‘The back compartment even has a radio in it, which would make it one of the earliest car radio systems. ‘The most wealthy people were upgrading their cars all the time back then, just like they tend to do today.’ The Prime Minister's wife, Samantha Cameron, is the daughter of Annabel Astor and landowner Sir Reginald Sheffield. Annabel was born in 1948 to barrister Timothy Jones and socialite Pandora Clifford, who was just 17 at the time. The pair had married very young, and split soon after. Pandora went on to marry Michael Astor - the son of Lady Nancy Astor - in 1961. Meanwhile, her daughter Annabel's marriage ended in her mid-twenties, leaving her with two daughters, Samantha and Emily. In 1976, Annabel married William Astor (4th Viscount and grandson of Lady Nancy Astor) - making him SamCam's stepfather. The Viscount and Lady Astor met on a transatlantic voyage in 1905 and were married the following year. She retained her seat until stepping down in the 1945 general election. The Astors spent most of their time . at Cliveden, where they often held lavish parties and the millionaire . divorcee was famous for her heated exchanges with Winston Churchill, . In . one exchange she is said to have told the Prime Minister 'Mr Churchill, . you're drunk', to which he replied: 'Yes, and you, Madam, are ugly. But . tomorrow, I shall be sober.' The Phantom II was introduced in 1929 as a successor to the New Phantom (retrospectively known as the Phantom I) with deliveries commencing in September of that year. Car designer Henry Royce's favourite coachbuilders, Barker & Co, used a new low-slung frame for the car, with the radiator set well back, to create a more streamline vehicle than previous models. The finished product would go on to win the Grand Prix d'Honneur at the Biarritz Concours d'Elegance in September 1930.

The 72-year-old critic and broadcaster even revealed that he ‘admires’ his  wife, the academic Prue Shaw, for having the courage to kick him out of  the family home after discovering his eight-year affair. 'She's annoyed': Clive James, pictured with his wife Prue Shaw, in 2008, says he still loves her and that he regrets being unfaithful . James, who is battling leukaemia, said: ‘My wife is very angry with me, so the situation is fluid. I deceived her and she’s annoyed. ‘She is not just within her rights, she is perfectly justified and I not only understand but I admire her. ‘I’d like to say I love my wife and family very much and I am sorry that I have behaved so badly. I have great respect, admiration and love for my wife. ‘I am a reprehensible character who needs to clean up his act. But I have already done a few things that may have justified my existence and, given time, I would do more. ‘I don’t think I was a bad father but I was a terrible husband, much to my regret. ‘I deserve everything that has happened to me.’ 'Instant attraction': Former model Leanne Edelsten opened up about her eight-year affair with Clive James on Australian television in April . In April it was revealed that . Sydney-born James had enjoyed an eight-year affair with Leanne Edelsten, . a twice-married former model and Australian socialite. Speaking . of their romance on Australian television, the 48-year-old claimed she . and James had their own bedroom rituals, including drinking a cup of tea . and eating a Cherry Ripe chocolate bar before making love. She also described how she had nicknamed him Mr Wolf because of the way he ‘ravished’ her, while he called her ‘Miss Hood’. And . she told how they met in a Sydney restaurant in  2004 while she was . still  married to an Australian barrister. She divorced her first . husband, Dr Geoffrey Edelsten, in 1988. She said: ‘We had an instant attraction. He was his formidable, funny, witty self. He just walked to the table and said: “In my opinion all intelligent women talk with their hands”. ‘He was flirting, complimenting, a very open guy. The  guy’s hysterical. He made me laugh from the word go. ‘He has always been and always will be “Mr Wolf”...because our initial, how can I say it, our initial liaison, he devoured me.’ Mrs Edelsten said James confessed the affair to his wife after she confronted him with a string of their secret emails, along with photographs of his lover in bikinis and underwear. Miss Shaw, the mother of his two children, then banished him from their home in Cambridge, forcing him to live in a London flat. When asked if she felt sorry for Miss Shaw, Mrs Edelsten said: ‘No. I know he’s been busted. There will be comments, but that’s if there’s a home to wreck.’ The writer – who in June  said he was  ‘getting near the end after several years of serious illness – is currently moving back to Cambridge to be nearer Addenbrooke’s Hospital, where his cancer is being treated. However, the Mail revealed last week that he has been forced to find his own accommodation because Miss Shaw will not allow him back into her home. A source said: ‘It’s the first time Clive has had to live on his own and he is rather down in the dumps and worried.’ James previously denied allegations of adultery in 2009, when opera singer Anne Howells claimed he had had an affair with her in 2005.

Flower Foods has been selected as the 'stalking horse' bidder for the Hostess bread brands, which means a higher competing bids can still be made . Flower Foods was selected as the 'stalking horse' bidder for the bread brands. That means higher competing bids can still be made and the final deal must be approved in bankruptcy court. The company made two separate bids for the Hostess breads; a $360 million bid for Wonder, Nature's Pride, Butternut, Home Pride and Merita, along with 20 bakeries and 38 depots. Another $30 million bid was made for Beefsteak. Taken together, Hostess said those breads generated just under $1 billion in sales last year, with Wonder bread accounting for about half of that.

The young workers, who are mostly students, lost their jobs last month after bosses at the El Monte Aquatic Center labelled their two-minute routine, which comprised synchronised swimming, complicated choregrography and plenty of hip-thrusting, 'inappropriate and disgusting.' But the lifeguards should soon be back at work after the El Monte City Council voted on Tuesday to rehire the workers pending a review of the leisure centre's management and procedures.

In a 3-2 vote, council members . approved a recommendation made by Mayor Andre Quintero to direct Interim . City Manager Dayle Keller to rehire the group, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune. The lifeguards clearly put a lot of work into the video, which was a spoof version of a Korean rapper’s music clip.

Rocking it: Titled Lifeguard Style, the two-minute video is a parody of pop star Psy¿s Gangnam Style music video . In the hilarious spoof, red swimsuit-clad lifeguards and their young male colleagues strut their stuff, mimic Psy's dance moves and rub sun cream into each other. One clip in the video shows a man straddling another male lifeguard in an elevator while giving some impressive hip thrusts. But rather than being amused or entertained by the film, the lifeguards’ superiors 'said the entire video was inappropriate and disgusting,' fired lifeguard Gabriel Gonzalez told NBC. The city claim that the group were fired for using city property, the pool and their uniforms, for private use. All but one of the lifeguards are college students who were working at the pool to raise money before going back to school. Disgusting? Rather than being amused or entertained by the film, bosses said the entire video was inappropriate and disgusting, according to a fired lifeguard . Desperate for their jobs back, the group set up a Facebook page 'Bring Back The El Monte Aquatic Center 14,' which has attracted more than 17,360 'likes' and they managed to get almost as many signatures on a petition. 'We just felt it was really unfair and not really grounds for termination,' former lifeguard Alexander Huerta told CBS. Another fired lifeguard, Juliet Gilek, told the TV station he was stunned when he heard the news. 'I was in shock. Because I really didn't think that it would escalate to termination,' he said. 'I loved what I did. I loved teaching the kids. I loved making sure everybody was safe. So I would never have wanted to hurt the pool in any way. This was just a fun thing to capture our memories with.' Goofing around: All but one of the lifeguards are college students who were working at the pool to raise money before going back to school . The Californian lifeguards' jobs are no longer on shaky ground, and Psy’s music career is similarly going from strength to strength. His music video, in which he performs his now signature horse riding move, became an internet hit attracting 117 million on YouTube since its July release and Psy recently attended the VMA's. Psy - real name Park Jae Sung - was the first Korean artist to be invited to the industry event since 2005. His undeniably catchy song was meant as a commentary on the rampant materialism and emphasis on appearance of today's South Korea - particularly in relation to Gangnam, which Psy terms Seoul's Beverly Hills. While Psy has won millions of YouTube hits, the lifeguards' spoof video has impressively garnered more than 74,000.

Busted: Darien Meheux turned himself in to police in connection with the slaying death of Jasmine Benjamin . An ex-boyfriend has been arrested for the slaying of the Georgia college freshman whose parents learned of their daughter's death hours after her body was discovered through a Facebook post forwarded by one of her friends. Darien Meheux, 18, of Lawrenceville, Georgia turned himself in Thursday evening to sheriff’s deputies in Ellaville in Schley County, about 115 miles south of Atlanta, and was booked for murder, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Meheux is charged with mortally suffocating Jasmine Benjamin, a 17-year-old Valdosta State University nursing student whose lifeless body was found on a college dorm study room couch on Nov. 18. 'Right now, he's the sole suspect,' Steven Turner told People Magazine. 'They had dated at one time. The status of their relationship back in November is not necessarily clear whether they were dating or not.' The story gained notoriety for the bizarre manner in which Benjamin's mother, Judith  Brogdon and her stepfather, James Jackson, learned of their daughter's untimely demise. The parents told CBSAtlanta.com in the days after Benjamin's death that the university never notified them of the tragedy, but they discovered what had happened when they saw a Facebook post from a friend. A life cut short: Jasmine Benjamin's body was found in the common area of a dormitory at Valdosta State University in November . A stormy relationship: Authorities said that Meheux and Benjamin once dated, as the two hail from the same Georgia town . Former flame: Meheux and Benjamin graduated from different high schools but followed each other to Valdosta State University . The university, for its part, reportedly said its Valdosta State University Police Department notified both the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Department and the Lawrenceville Police Department. A Gwinnett County sheriff's deputy then notified Benjamin's parents of her death on Sunday afternoon, or several hours after Benjamin's body was discovered. 'For someone to be so insensitive not to . reach out to the family, or not even to keep up with what's going on . because it's a holiday and you're going away on vacation or whatever . you're doing – it's very, very hurtful to say the least,' James Jackson . told CBSAtlanta.com.

Benjamin and Meheux reportedly both hail from Lawrenceville, Georgia, and even - for a short while - together attended Valdosta State University, although the college is now saying that Meheux only enrolled for a single semester. The Journal-Constitution could not reach Benjamin’s family for reaction, although a private investigator that had been hired by the family to look into her death, Robin Martinelli, said the arrest was not a surprise and that the family had suspected Meheux from the outset.

Trainers are also known as as kicks, trabs daps, sandshoes, gym boots or joggers, gutties, or canvers, according to Wikipedia. The first athletic shoes, with a canvas upper and rubber sole, were developed as beachwear in the 1830s by the Liverpool Rubber Company. They were  known then as plimsolls or pumps. By the early 1900s, sneakers were being produced by small rubber companies who specialized in the production of bicycle tyres. U.S. Rubber, introduced Keds in 1916, about the same time that Converse was marketing its All Star. At first, the market for sneakers was small and practically invisible, but after the First World War, the US turned to sports and athletes as a way to demonstrate moral fibre and patriotism. A huge breakthrough came in when the Olympics were revived after the Second World War, attracting more fans not only to sports, but to sneakers as well. The 1950s gave American families more leisure time, and as the baby boom started, more families chose to dress their youth in sneakers as school dress codes relaxed. In the early 1960s, sneakers were imported to the US from Japan, but accounted for only a small portion of the market until Nike founders Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman began importing Onitsuka Tiger shoes (1950s) under the name Blue Ribbon Sports. By the 1970s and 80s there were shoes for football, jogging, basketball, running - every sport had its own shoe and trainers had graduated to the movies. Dustin Hoffman wore them while playing reporter Carl Bernstein in the . movie All the President's Men while Cybill Shepherd even wore a pair of . comfortable orange sneakers with her elegant black gown at the 1985 Emmy . Awards. Woody Allen wore them to the ballet and Led Zeppelin had them on in their 1976 documentary. Companies like Nike and Adidas cashed in on the craze with major endorsements to players - the largest  to Chicago basketball player Michael Jordan, who was given  a contract with Nike to make his own signature line of shoes and apparel.",Olympic champion Mo Farah's winning track shoes on show with Noel and Liam Gallagher's trainers from their private collection .

Brave: Annie Edson Taylor became the first person to survive a drop over the Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901 . Before Felix Baumgartner, or even Evel Knievel, there was a daredevil with much humbler ambitions - but by no means less mettle. Annie Edson Taylor was the first person to survive a trip over the Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1901. And her story is all the more extraordinary because it seems she never set out to become a record-breaker. After the death of her husband David in the American Civil War, she had lived a nomadic existing teaching on opposite coasts of the United States. But at the age of 62, she was facing a grim financial future and possible retirement in the poorhouse. In a bid to secure her financial future, she decided to become the first person to drop over the Niagara Falls on her 63rd birthday. Annie believed her feat would bring her fame and fortune by selling memorabilia, group signings and giving talks. But although her achievement made headlines around the world at the time, it didn't quite work out as planned and she lived the rest of her life in relative poverty. The New York Times reported how thousands of people gathered at the bottom of The Horseshoe Falls to witness her attempt, despite most thinking she stood little chance of surviving. Frank Russell, Annie's manager, had been warned he could be charged with manslaughter if she died during the attempt . The barrel was made from oak and iron and padded inside with a mattress . Annie Taylor believed she would make fame and fortune through her death-defying feat over the Niagara Falls . The tension was even more palpable for Annie's manager Frank Russel who had been warned he could be prosecuted for manslaughter by both Canadian and American police if she died. The custom-built barrel was around 1.4metres tall by 1m wide, made of oak and iron and padded with a mattress. After she got in a lid was put in place and a bicycle pump used to pressurize it. A 200lb anvil was used to weight it and it floated in an upright position through the rapids and down the 174-foot fall. A crowd of thousands reportedly gathered to watch the attempt although most didn't believe Annie would survive . Her first words after emerging from the barrel were 'I prayed every second except when I went unconscious' There were apparently several delays before the launch - particularly because no one wanted to be part of the potential suicide. Much to their amazement, the crowd saw the barrel bob back to the surface after a 20-minute journey over the edge. Many then doubted that the woman inside would still be alive. But Annie emerged unscathed and suffering only from a degree of shock. She told reporters how she had momentarily gone unconscious during the trip but thanked God for her survival. According to reports, Annie's first words were: 'I prayed every second I was in the barrel except for a few seconds after the fall when I went unconscious.' 'Nobody ought ever to do that again. If it was with my dying breath, I would caution anyone against attempting the feat. 'I would sooner walk up to the mouth of a cannon, knowing it was going to blow me to pieces than make another trip over the Fall.' Despite her achievement, Annie never achieved the wealth she desired, partly because her manager decamped with her barrel, and most of her savings were used towards private detectives hired to find it.","Annie Edson Taylor made the attempt because she didn't want to be poor .

He initially bought her gifts including sweets, drinks and even a mobile phone to win her trust before subjecting her to a string of attacks.

Today Janagle, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was jailed for six months at Birmingham Magistrates Court after he admitted running a brothel. District Judge Neil Davison told him: 'You were managing a brothel in January last year and you were cautioned. 'There's no doubt you knew exactly what you were doing but you carried on.

The mocking continued in the NMA video, which has been circulating in Westminster all day. Seeing stars: Mr Cameron is shown being hit about the head with the EU logo . A mob of people waving European flags breaks down the gates . The animators have seized on Mr Cameron's bizarre defence for why he had not delivered his speech sooner. 'This is a tantric approach to policy-making,' he said last month. 'It will be even better when it does eventually come.' The cartoon shows the PM in bed struggling to formulate his policy, before showing a group waving European flags breaking down gates to confront him. In green overalls, Mr Cameron is shown in the Netherlands trying to stem the tide of leaks about his speech . Cry baby: With the coalition parties split on the idea of taking on Brussels, the PM is seen nursing a weeping baby Nick Clegg . It also shows many people voting that . Britain is 'better of out' of the EU, but the idea has upset Mr Clegg, . the Deputy Prime Minister, who is shown in a baby harness crying his . eyes out. But the video warns that Mr Cameron risks being sunk by the issue of Europe like his predecessors, showing Baroness Thatcher in a rowing boat wielding an oar. The team have previously made videos about Cleggmania, during the 2010 election campaign and Gordon Brown calling a Labour voter a 'bigot'. David Cameron dodged a question on whether he thought Britain would still be in the EU in five years' time as Labour's Ed Miliband claimed the Prime Minister was taking an 'unnecessary gamble' Mr Cameron is due to deliver his long-awaited speech in Amsterdam on Friday, when he will set out how he hopes to negotiate for Brussels to return powers to London before giving the British people a vote on accepting the ‘fresh settlement’. But amid growing signs of chaos in Tory ranks, the Daily Mail revealed Mr Cameron has agreed Tory Cabinet ministers would be free to campaign against each other in the referendum, which is unlikely to be held until 2018. Downing Street today launched a charm offensive to win over Eurosceptic Tory MPs, inviting them to Number 10 to brief them on Mr Cameron's plans. In the Commons, Mr Miliband claimed the reason Mr Cameron had been bounced into making a speech on Europe 'is nothing to do with the national interest - it's because he has lost control of his party'. Downing Street has launched a charm offensive to win over Eurosceptic Tory MPs ahead of the PM's big speech. Among those seen leaving No.10 today were (left to righ) Edward Leigh, Peter Bone and John Baron . Mr Miliband said the uncertainty created by talks about renegotiation and whether a referendum would pave the way for Britain to exit Europe would hit the economy: ‘His position appears to be this: an in out referendum now would be de-stabilising but promising one in five years time would be just fine for the country. ‘What does that mean? Five years of businesses seeing a “closed for business” sign hanging around Britain.’ Tory grandee Lord Heseltine had said the policy was an ‘unnecessary gamble’, Mr Miliband added. Downing Street is anxious to win over Eurosceptic Tory MPs ahead of the Big Speech on Friday . Lord Heseltine told the Financial Times: 'Mrs Thatcher said ""Never go into a room unless you know how to get out of it."" 'To commit to a referendum about a negotiation that hasn't begun, on a timescale you cannot predict, on an outcome that's unknown, where Britain's appeal as an inward investment market would be the centre of the debate, seems to me like an unnecessary gamble.' A group of 100 Conservative MPs launched a ‘shopping list’ of powers they want the . UK to reclaim from Brussels. The Fresh Start group is highlighting . powers over home affairs and justice, employment rules, energy and . agriculture that it says should be clawed back. The MPs, who have been working closely . with Foreign Secretary William Hague and other ministers, suggest . threatening to withhold funds from some EU schemes if powers are not . returned. 'Many of the . proposals are already Government policy, some could well become future . Government or Conservative Party policy and some may require further . thought,' Mr Hague said in a foreword to the report. Tory . MP Andrew Leadsom, a leading member of the group, said: 'I think it’s a . bit simple to say we want to return to the Common Market, I guess if . you were to say that our priority is more trade and less of the other . stuff, that’s true. 'But . there are other areas where we can co-operate very happily and . constructively with the EU, but what we’re actually trying to recognize . is that the status quo isn’t an option as the eurozone moves towards . ever greater fiscal union.' But Mr Cameron said he had long disagreed with the former Tory Deputy PM on the issue of Europe. As many as nine Tory . Cabinet ministers are thought to back a British exit if significant . powers cannot be repatriated from Brussels. As a result, Mr Cameron has agreed . that Cabinet ministers will be able to campaign to leave the EU, when he . eventually holds a referendum. A senior source said: ‘Different . ministers and different MPs are going to have different points of view . which they will want to raise and campaign on.’ In . the Commons, Mr Cameron refused to say whether he thought Britain would . still be in the EU in five years time, only saying he thought ‘Britain . is better off in the European Union’. The PM added: 'I think that even the leader of the Labour Party should accept the fact that there is a massive change taking place in Europe, a change that is being driven by the changes in the eurozone. 'Frankly, this country faces the choice, and political parties in this country face a choice: do we look at these changes and see what we can do to maximise Britain's national interest, and do we consult the public about that, or do we sit back, do nothing and tell the public to go hang? 'I know where I stand, I know where this party stands, and that's in the national interest.' The clash in the Commons came hours after a group of 100 Tory MPs launched a shopping list of powers they want to see repatriated. The Fresh Start group wants powers over home affairs and justice, employment rules, energy and agriculture to be clawed back. Foreign Secretary William Hague wrote the foreword to the group’s report, claiming many of the ideas could become Tory policy. But Mr Miliband said Mr Hague had flown out of the country to get as far away from Mr Cameron’s Europe speech as possible. The Prime Minister spent the afternoon briefing Tory ministers and MPs on his plans, in an attempt to prevent a collapse in support in the immediate aftermath of his speech on Friday .","Party leaders clash at Prime Minister's Questions on Britain's place in the Europe .

Kujtim Nicaj, 44, admitted burglary as a sexually motivated felony and felony misconduct, and was sentenced to six years in prison and seven years of probation at Westchester County Court. Once his prison term is completed he must sign the sex offender's register. The court heard in February last year Nicaj, from Rye, New York State, was employed as superintendent of the Rye Colony Cooperative Apartments. During this time he entered a resident's . apartment without permission and while inside, engaged in several sex . acts with the owner's 15-month-old Labrador retriever dog, USA Today reports. The conduct was recorded on three cameras the homeowner, Alan Kachalsky, had set up after he became suspicious about goings-on in his apartment while he was out. Mr Kachalsky said that he would return home and blinds would be drawn that had not been, a window would be left open that he had left shut. The footage confirmed Mr Kachalsky's suspicions that something was amiss in his apartment and provided indisputable evidence for the police. 'A naked man, in your apartment, having sex with your dog,' Mr Kachalsky, an attorney, said. A subsequent examination of the dog, Gunner, a one-year-old labrador, by a vet revealed no . permanent physical damage. Now, Kachalsky said, Gunner is mostly back to his old self. He turns two at the end of the month. 'Anytime anyone comes in, he's all over 'em. He's a terrific dog,' he said.

A company director died after slipping and falling head first from his porch roof while taking down Christmas lights. John Kershaw's wife Wendy had warned her husband to leave the decorations because she was worried that the roof was slippy, but he insisted on taking them down and fell 10ft on Saturday morning.

He died from his injuries on Sunday. Step-son Jonathan, 24, told how he saw John fall off the roof as he tripped over the guttering. He said: 'I was leaning out of the window at the time. 'My mum had asked him not to go out there at the time as it was cold and wet and a bit dangerous but he went. 'There's an identical roof at the back that he's up and down all the time and he was fine, it was just the wrong place at the wrong time. 'He was taking down rope lights which we have had up at Christmas for the last six years when he fell off.

Tragic: Debbie Smith attends the inquest into the death of her fiance, soldier Matthew Cottrell, at Bournemouth Coroners Court today . A young soldier was mown down and killed by a coach after he was dropped off on a dark road because he didn't have enough money to pay his taxi fare, an inquest heard today. Matthew Cottrell, 24, who was two weeks away from getting married, had been . heading towards his army camp after a night out with colleagues but had . to abandon the taxi ride as he was £30 short. As he walked alone along a darkened A-road he was struck from behind by a 14-ton single decker coach travelling at nearly 50mph. Mr Cottrell had become separated from . his three army friends on the night out and they came across the scene . of the fatal crash as they travelled towards the barracks. One . of them, Sapper Kristopher Knight, desperately tried to revive his . comrade but he was pronounced dead at the scene on the A35 in Poole, . Dorset. Mr Cottrell had been just two weeks away from getting married to girlfriend Debbie Smith when the tragedy occurred. After . an inquest into his death, Miss Smith confronted taxi driver Jovan . Josic, asking him why he dropped her fiance off on an unsafe road and . had to be pulled away by family members. The . army camp had an unofficial policy of paying soldiers' taxi fares if . they didn't have enough money, but local taxi companies were not aware . of this. The hearing in . Bournemouth heard Mr Cottrell, a sapper in the Royal Engineers, and his . three friends had caught a train to Poole for a night out in June last . year. He had nearly not joined pals on the . booze-fuelled evening out, claiming he only had 16 pence to his name but . eventually agreed to go after friends loaned him some money. During the evening the group, made up of Royal Engineers downed lager, Sambuca and cocktails. In the early hours of June 23 Matthew . was described as 'heavily intoxicated' by a pal and sent back to camp . for trying to start a fight in a club. Mr Josic said police officers had asked him to drive Mr Cottrell home at about 2am. Mr Josic, who was working for Poole . Radio Cabs, explained the fare for the 17 mile journey back to Bovingdon . Camp would cost £50. Officers had found £15 in notes on Matthew and he later discovered a further £7 pounds in change in his pockets. Scene of the accident: The young man was walking home along the A35 road near Poole, Dorset on June 23 when he was knocked down and killed . 'The . police said ""just get him out of Poole"",' said Mr Jovic, who explained . to the officers that Matthew did not have enough money for the fare. It . was agreed that the taxi driver would take him as far as he could . before leaving the soldier to walk the rest of the distance. He said: 'When it was £15 on the metre I pulled into a layby. 'I didn't think he was vulnerable and as a squaddie and I thought he would be used to walking long distances on foot. 'As he got out he said something like ""we defend this country and nobody cares about us"".' Matthew got out of the taxi on the . A35 road between Poole and Bere Regis. The inquest heard Mr Cottrell was seen by several motorists walking with the flow of the traffic on the side of the A35. Pictured are flower tributes in memory of the deceased soldier. Debbie writes: 'Love you more than anything. Please give me some strength because i feel broken without you' The inquest in Bournemouth, Dorset, heard that the busy stretch of road had no lighting or pavement. Matthew, . who was described as wearing dark clothing, was seen by a number of . motorists walking in the same direction as the traffic using his mobile . phone to light the route. Kenneth Baker, 55, who was driving the Excelsior coach, said he moved slightly towards the kerb to avoid an oncoming lorry when he struck Mr Cottrell. Tributes: The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death . He said: 'I saw what I think was an arm, as I saw this I hit something on the front passenger side of the coach. 'There was a bang and the windscreen on the same side broke.' Mr Baker, who was driving the empty 53-seater, said: 'I have never seen anybody walking along that road.' One motorist described having to take evasive action as the soldier appeared to stumble into the road others saw a man running. Paul . Byres was driving a Royal Mail delivery lorry. He told the inquest how, . as he travelled along the A35, he became aware of a large vehicle . travelling towards him in the opposite direction. 'As I got close to the up coming vehicle I saw an arm to the right of the coach,' said the HGV driver. 'I saw the person but I didn't have time to flash a warning.' A taxi carrying three of Matthew's pals stopped at the scene and tried to resuscitate their friend. The soldier's body was so bloodied that at first none of them recognised him. Sapper Kristopher Knight described the moment he came across his colleague's lifeless body in the road a few minutes later. He said: 'Our taxi was flagged down by the police officer who said there was a body in the road. 'I . could see a body on his back and near the verge. The male was wearing . dark clothing and there was a big pool of blood by his head. I didn't . realise it was Matt because of the blood. 'There was no pulse. I attempted resuscitation and carried on doing first aid and then the ambulance crew took over. 'I only thought it was Matt when we were doing the first aid but couldn't be sure because of all the blood.' - HGV driver . Major Barnaby Gray, based at Bovington camp, explained that the army had a policy to reimburse taxi drivers if soldiers had no money for their fares. He said: 'It's not something we like to advertise because we don't want it to be taken advantage of. 'There is a small pot of cash held in the guard room for that purpose.' Mr Josic said he did not think that any taxi driver in the area was aware of this policy. A post mortem examination revealed Mr Cottrell, from Southport, Merseyside, died from multiple injuries, including a fractured skull. He was three times the drink-drive limit at the time. PC John Heywood, a police accident investigator, said the coach was travelling at between 47mph to 49mph and that no blame was attached to the driver. A post mortem examination found Matthew had suffered severe head injuries in the impact and died at the scene. At the time of his death he was three-and-a-half times over the drink-drive limit. Accident investigations concluded that coach driver Mr Baker had no time to react to the presence of Matthew. Debbie Smith (left), 23, said she was disappointed that the taxi driver left her fiance on an unsafe road . Mr Sheriff Payne, the Bournemouth, Poole and East Dorset coroner, recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'This is a very sad accident. A sad aspect is his colleagues were following in a taxi and they were first on the scene. 'I'm concerned there is the availability of the barracks to pay to get soldiers back to camp and taxi drivers do not know about it.' He added: 'I have heard from many people who use . that stretch of road and they have no knowledge of pedestrians using it . in daylight or at night. 'From my own knowledge it would be dangerous to attempt to walk along there even in daylight. 'I cannot fault Mr Baker's driving of the coach. He was behaving perfectly properly. 'He had never come across any hazard like that. This is a very sad accident.' Afterwards Miss Smith, 24, said: 'I was disappointed that, as the coroner described, Matthew was dropped off on an unsafe road. 'I would hope under similar circumstances, morally, taxi drivers would drop people off somewhere safer in the future.' Matthew's mother hugged coach driver Mr Baker outside the hearing. Speaking . after the verdict his fiance Debbie Smith, aged 23 years, said: 'I am . disappointed as the coroner described Matthew was dropped off by the . taxi driver on such an unsafe road. 'In similar circumstances I would hope the taxi driver would have the morals to drop him off somewhere safer.'","Matthew Cottrell, 24, had been on a night out with colleagues .

Claimed sightings: Siberian councillor Igor Idimeshev insisted he has seen yetis 'several times' A Russian official has claimed that the yeti is an 'extraterrestrial' being sent to Earth to watch over things. Igor Idimeshev, 48, deputy head of Sheregesh's local council in Siberia, insisted he has seen the creature - dismissed by most scientists as legend - several times. Mr Idimeshev's comments come as his district in the Shoria Mountain area of Keremovo, is setting up a resort dedicated to the Abominable Snowman following a succession of claimed sightings. He told the Siberian Times: 'I've seen this creature several times. 'And when I saw the yeti's eyes my only thought was that they are not from Earth - they are clearly of an extraterrestrial nature. 'To me, the yeti is an extraterrestrial creature. I believe that it is like a controller to look over things here on Earth.' Mr Idimeshev added that the creature - known as Big Men by locals - could 'suddenly disappear and re-materialise' He added: 'Another extraordinary thing is that yeti's hair is luminous at night, and also that the Yeti can walk on water. 'Every man round here sees him when he hunts. It's all right to mention the fact of meeting - but we don't go into the details of it, like where exactly it was, what he did do, or your luck will be gone. 'The feeling is one of fear. It is a fear that you cannot explain rationally. You feel yourself very scared and tense at the same time. Insistence: Igor Idimeshev said the yeti is an 'extraterrestrial creature' that looks over things' on Earth . 'One of the closest comparisons is the feeling of looking into a wolf's eyes. If you've ever seen them - I mean a wild wolf,  not a caged animal - you remember a feeling of them being something very unusual, alien. 'Like with a wolf, you can see a yeti's eyes from a distance of some 100-150 metres. They are quite hypnotising. 'And when I saw yeti's eyes my only thought was that they are not from Earth - they are clearly of an extraterrestrial nature. 'To me, the yeti is an extraterrestrial creature. I believe that its like a controller to look over things here on Earth.' Tourism: The district in the Shoria Mountain area of Keremovo is setting up a Abominable Snowman resort . The planned Yeti Park in Sheregesh, including a hotel and a museum, is intended to bring in tourists keen to be the first to prove the existence of the yeti. The region's governor Aman Tuleyev has offered a £20,500 reward - one million roubles - to anyone who can catch a yeti and prove its existence.  'I'll sit down with him, chat and have a cup of tea,' he promised. Last year Russian academic Professor Valentin Sapunov claimed a population of 200 yeti exist in  the Kemerovo, Khakassia and Altai regions of Siberia. Ancestors? The Japanese snow monkey bears a striking resemblance to the legendary creature . Expeditions to the remote Azasskaya Cave in the region found samples of hair still awaiting DNA analysis. Apparatchik Idimeshev admitted he will never reveal full details of his  close encounters with yetis. He said: 'The only person I ever told everything in detail to was my mother - and she taught me to keep it to myself. ''People will simply think you've made it up', she told me.'

A former US Marine who spent four months wrongly imprisoned in Mexico has described the horrifying conditions of life in one of the country's most infamous jails. John Hammar, 27, spent most of his time at Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas chained to his bed in solitary confinement after he was arrested for declaring a legally-owned hunting shotgun to Mexican border guards. He endured regular threats on his life from officers and inmates alike, suffered extortion attempts on his family and developed a string of serious health complaints that went untreated until his release before Christmas. Scary: Hammar endured regular threats on his life from guards and inmates alike, suffered extortion attempts on his family and developed a string of serious health complaints that went untreated until his release before Christmas . Hungry and alone: John Hammar spent most of his time at Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas chained to his bed as in solitary confinement . 'I was dehydrated, malnourished, I had a lung infection, . stomach issues and a number of other things,' he told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly. 'It think it was because of a bad . environment.' Extraordinarily, prison guards even tried to extort money from his family in return for his safe release. 'Initially there was some pressure put on me,' he added. 'There were threats on my life ... and they tried to extort money from my family. Trapped: Marine Jon Hammer's ordeal began in August when he and a friend drove across the Mexican border on their way to Costa Rica on a summer surfing trip . 'They call your family, they throw threats at you and your family and tell you that ""we need your money"". 'There were times when I was afraid for my life.' Hammar's ordeal began in August when he and a friend drove across the Mexican border on their way to Costa Rica on a summer surfing trip. The trip was meant to be a time for relaxation and catharsis following his honourable discharge from the Marines after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by seeing a friend shot dead by a sniper in Iraq in 2007. They wanted to take his grandmother's legally registered hunting shotgun on the trip and asked American authorities what they had to do to to take it across the border. 'We told them we’ve got this hunting shotgun, ""we’re trying to . go through Mexico legally, what do we have to do?"" 'They gave us paperwork . to fill out and said as long as you declare it you should be fine. We paid a . fee, crossed the border and declared the weapon. Then things started going . wrong.' But when Hammar and his friend crossed the border and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and jailed the two men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short. Mexican law prohibits civilians from . carrying certain types of guns, like sawed-off shotguns - which can be . more easily concealed - as well as shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches. His lawyer, Eddie Varon-Levy said . Mexican officials measured the barrel on Hammar's shotgun as 24 inches and that it has not been sawed off. Weapon in question: Hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway . Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico . Nevertheless, he was taken to prison and held indefinitely. So he whiled away the time by reading the two books he had with him - The Last Stand of Fox Company, a true story about Marines in combat on the Korean Peninsula in 1950, and The Bible. He read both, all the way through. He was finally released just before Christmas and has been recovering ever since. But incredibly, he says he bears no ill will towards Mexico. 'I think Mexico's a great place,' he said. 'I really wish everywhere could get its act together.' Hammar served in Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2007. His mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hammar developed PTSD following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq. He had just completed treatment at a center for veterans in California last year, before getting detained during his misadventure in Matamoros.","John Hammar, 27, was held for declaring legal shotgun to border guards .

He was told he could not accept the Russian offer because he had already been honoured with the Atlantic Star . Damaged: Pictured is HMS Edinburgh after a torpedo hit it. Two officers and 56 seamen died as the rest were evacuated to other ships . The ship (stern pictured) fought on for three days after it was hit by two torpedoes before it was eventually sunk by a third . Two officers and 56 seamen died as the rest were evacuated to other ships. Lt Cdr Francis said: ‘Arctic convoys were renowned to be the toughest voyages. In addition to the threats from U-boats, bombers and surface craft to all convoys, the main enemy was the bitter cold. ‘I've known of ships where the build-up of ice led to the whole thing capsizing and the ship disappearing with all hands. Pictured is the Russian Medal of Ushakov, awarded for bravery . ‘We had to keep chipping away at the ice, were constantly wet and it was normally too cold to sleep when off watch.’ The FCO told veterans that because they have already been honoured with the Atlantic Star campaign medal, they could not accept the Russian offer. They were also told that their service had to have taken place in the last five years for them to be eligible. It has recently announced the creation of a specific Arctic campaign medal to recognise the severe hardships of this part of naval history. Lt Cdr Francis said: ‘I'm pleased to see that this government has finally agreed to give us a British campaign medal. ‘I'm told that checking eligibility for the award may take months, though, so I'm hoping I'll still be around when all of the bureaucracy has been carried out. None of us are getting any younger. ‘I think they have got it wrong, though. The Russian government wants to give us a bravery medal, not a campaign medal. There is a big difference. ‘Why can't our Government bend the rules when the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and American governments have all allowed their veterans to accept this great honour? ‘I think the Government should do what is right by the thousands of us who endured for freedom all those years ago, many of whom never made it.’ A spokesman for the FCO said the department appreciated the Russian government's wish to recognise the ‘brave and valuable’ service given by veterans of the Arctic convoys. He said: ‘The rules on the acceptance of foreign awards clearly state that in order for permission to be given for an award to be accepted, there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years. Unsung: One of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war . Hero: In perilous conditions a sailor frees chains, wires and bollards from the ice . ‘Additionally, permission cannot be granted if they have received, or are expected to receive, a UK award for the same services. ‘We look at each request for permission to confer a foreign or Commonwealth state award upon a British citizen on an individual case-by-case basis.’ A lapel badge - the Arctic Emblem - was introduced in 2006 and some 10,000 have been issued. Last year, the Prime Minister asked Sir John Holmes to review the current policy on military medals, the FCO added. An e-petition asking the Government to reconsider has been set up on Downing Street's website.","They risked their lives taking part in Arctic missions to support the Russians during WW2 .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 18:20 EST, 15 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:30 EST, 15 January 2013 . Jumping out ahead of Washington, New York state has enacted the nation's toughest gun restrictions and the first since the Connecticut school massacre, including an expanded assault-weapon ban and background checks for buying ammunition. Democratic Gov Andrew Cuomo signed the measure into law less than an hour after it won final passage in the Legislature, with supporters hailing it as a model for the nation. But gun-rights activists are condemning it as a knee-jerk piece of legislation that won't make anyone safer and is too extreme to win support in the rest of the country. Now it's a law: New York Gov Andrew Cuomo signs New York's Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act during a ceremony at the New York State Capitol . New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks during a news conference announcing an agreement with legislative leaders on New York's Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act . 'Common sense can win,' Cuomo said. 'You can overpower the extremists with intelligence and with reason and with common sense.' Owners of an estimated 1 million previously legal semiautomatic rifles, such as the Bushmaster model used to kill 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, a month ago, will be allowed to keep their weapons but will have a year to register them with police. The sale of any more such weapons is prohibited. 'When there's a pileup of events, when the federal government does not do it, the state of New York has to lead the way,' said state Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, a Brooklyn Democrat and co-sponsor. In addition to outlawing a broader array of military-style weapons, the measure restricts ammunition magazines to seven rounds, down from the current 10, creates a more comprehensive database of people barred from owning guns, and makes New York the first state to require background checks to buy bullets. The system will also help flag customers who buy large amounts of ammo. In another provision, therapists, doctors and other mental health professionals will be required to tell state authorities if a patient threatens to use a gun illegally. The patient's weapon could then be taken away. Protests: A protester holds up a sign calling for a ban on assault weapons during a recent rally that demanded an end to gun violence in America . Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said Cuomo clearly understood gun violence is a complex issue requiring broader solutions than simply banning a particular weapon. 'I think that's an important message for the nation,' he said. In a statement, the National Rifle Association said: 'These gun control schemes have failed in the past and will have no impact on public safety and crime.' 'While lawmakers could have taken a step toward strengthening mental health reporting and focusing on criminals, they opted for trampling the rights of law-abiding gun owners in New York, and they did it under a veil of secrecy in the dark of night,' the NRA said. President Barack Obama will unveil his own proposals in response to the Newtown tragedy on Wednesday. He favors sweeping gun legislation, including a ban on assault weapons. But because of powerful opposition from the gun lobby, he is said to be weighing 19 steps he could take through executive action alone. Those could include ordering stricter . action against people who lie on gun-sale background checks, seeking to . ensure more complete records in the federal database, and striking . limits on federal research into gun use. Deal: Cuomo shakes hands with New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, as Senator Jeff Klein, left, Robert Duffy, second from right, and Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, right, look on . New York's law passed the state Senate, which is run by a Republican-dominated coalition, 43-18 Monday night. The Democrat-controlled Assembly approved it 104-43 Tuesday afternoon. Republicans complained the measure was rammed through the Legislature and infringes on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. 'A lot of people say, 'Why do you . need these guns?'' said Assemblyman James Tedisco, a Schenectady . Republican. 'It's part of the freedoms and liberties we have. ... It's . for our public safety. It's to protect us from our own government.' He said the bill was dangerous because it would give people a 'false sense of well-being.' 'You . are using innocent children killed by a madman for your own political . agenda,' he said. 'You are actually making people less safe.' The new law would make private sales of assault weapons to someone other than an immediate family be subject to a background check through a dealer . Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, questioned whether other states or the federal government would follow New York's lead and said he expects the law to be challenged in court. Previously, New York state law on assault weapons banned semiautomatics that have detachable magazines and at least two military-type features, such as a pistol grip, folding stock, muzzle flash suppressor or bayonet mount. The new law outlaws weapons with just one of those features. It also requires background checks for even private gun sales, except those among immediate family. In . addition, it says handgun owners must renew their licenses every five . years, and it increases prison sentences for using guns in various . crimes or taking them onto school grounds. Comfort: Cuomo consoles Janina Kaczokwa, the mother of firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka who was shot and killed while responding to a blaze on Christmas Eve . 'By making this a priority, the governor has not only saved lives but will hopefully inspire leaders in Washington also to take swift action,' said Dan Gross, president of the national Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. In a concession to the pro-gun side, local authorities will be allowed to withhold the identities of registered gun owners - an issue that erupted recently when a suburban New York City newspaper published the names and addresses of gun owners in its readership area. The New York legislation sparked spirited discussion among customers at the Buffalo Gun Center in the suburb of Cheektowaga, where business was so brisk that people had to wait in line in freezing temperatures just to get in the door. 'It's ridiculous. It's absolutely - how to put it nicely - it's Prince Andrew Cuomo's bid for the White House,' said Jim Hanley, who was waiting to buy another handgun. 'I want to do it before the right is taken away. Andrew Cuomo and Barack Hussein Obama are two best gun salesmen in the history of the world.'","New law includes expanded assault weapons ban and background checks for buying ammo .

Among . the high-value goods stolen, it is alleged Mr Francis jnr, who is a . semi-professional footballer himself, stole golf clubs, a Vertu smartphone, . designer clothes and one diamond earring. At the height of his sporting . fame, Hendrie, who now plays for non-league Kidderminster Harriers, was well . known for his love of designer gear, and the ex-England international was often . barracked by rival fans for sporting a sparkling diamond earring.

"By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 15:01 EST, 16 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:13 EST, 17 January 2013 . Tragic: A nursery worker was talking on her mobile phone while looking after children moments before two-year-old Rhiya Malin, pictured, was found hanging in a wooden playhouse, a court heard today . A nursery worker was talking on her mobile phone while looking after children moments before a two-year-old girl was found hanging in a wooden playhouse, a court heard today. Rhiya Malin died after . becoming trapped in a wooden playhouse in the garden at Eton . Manor Day Nursery in Chigwell, Essex. Today, nursery manager Karen Jacobs, 38, and nursery assistant Kaylee Murphy went on trial for failing to provide adequate care at the nursery. Both deny they failed to provide reasonable health and safety measures for the children in their care. Chelmsford Crown Court heard today that it was a normal occurrence for staff to be on their mobile phones when they should have been looking after the youngsters in their care. Staff confirmed they were aware that they should not use their phones, but did so when their managers were not present. Staff realised Rhiya was missing when they came back inside following a play session in the garden and the tot was discovered hanging inside a wooden nursery playhouse with her head trapped. Desperate efforts were made to resuscitate the youngster and she was rushed to Whipps Cross Hospital, London, but was declared dead at 11.41am on November 7, 2007. A pathologist carried out a postmortem and found Rhiya had suffered a cardiac arrest due to compression of her neck. Brunette Jacobs and blonde-haired Murphy, both dressed in black, sat alongside each other in the dock today listening as former colleagues gave evidence. The jury of seven men and five women heard that immediately before the incident Murphy had been seen talking on her mobile phone when looking after the children. Giving evidence, nursery nurse Rebecca Bremner told the jury there were 'real staffing difficulties'. Accused:  Nursery workers Karen Jacobs , right , and Kaylee Murphy, left , went on trial today . Oliver Campbell, prosecuting, asked: 'How frequently did you see staff using their mobile phones when they ought to have been supervising children? She replied: 'It would not be an unusual occurrence. Mr Campbell asked: 'Was anything said by management when this happened? Miss Bremner replied: 'Yes - they said ""you should not be on your phones, put them away"". She . later confirmed: 'It was not an unusual occurrence to see members of . staff use mobile phones in the presence of the children. Grieving: Rhiya's parents Jay, left, and Shati, right, are pictured walking to court today . 'It did occur - I can't specify exactly, but it would occur during the week. I can't recall it being on a daily basis.' Rhiya's parents Jay and Shati were sat in the public gallery to hear the evidence. Mrs Malin wiped away tears with a tissue as the junior deputy manager third in charge, under the deputy and the actual manager Emma Lowman broke down as she was asked to recall the moment she went into the nursery garden when Rhiya's lifeless body had been found. Miss Lowman told the jury that no . disciplinary action had been taken against Murphy, who is in her 20s, . who still works at the same nursery and has been promoted three times . since Rhiya had died. Talking about the mobile phone use at the nursery, she said: 'Staff were not supposed to use their phones but they did. 'They knew they were not supposed to be on them - it was not just Miss Murphy, it was a common practice. Awful: Rhiya Malin died after becoming trapped in this wooden playhouse in the garden at Eton Manor Day Nursery in Chigwell, Essex . 'She said staff were aware of the policy that phones should not be used but it was common place for staff to use them.' She said she would normally text people but 'could not recall' making phone calls. 'We knew people were not supposed to use their phones but they did. 'I would not do it if a manager was there. We knew we were not supposed to do it,' she added. Mr Campbell, prosecuting, had said: 'Rhiya was left unseen for many minutes and not observed going into the playhouse and was not actually supervised.' 'On the day of this accident Rhiya Malin was dropped off at about 8.30am by her father. 'There were 14 children being supervised by four members of staff.' However, he said that the quota of staff was reduced when one had to go inside and assist another child, 'leaving three outside supervising'. He continued: 'At 10.55am they decided to take the children into class and as they got back noticed Rhiya was missing. 'They found her hanging by the neck with her head trapped. 'Rhiya was left unseen for many minutes and not observed going into the playhouse.' A three-wheel scooter was found in the playhouse at the nursery and Mr Campbell said it was likely that Rhiya had stood on it and become trapped when it moved. He continued: 'Rhiya was left unseen for many minutes and not observed going into the playhouse, and not actually supervised.' Two of the playhouses had been purchased from Argos in June 2006 with instructions that they were for children aged between two and six, and that there should be adult supervision when children were playing in them. Jacobs was not at the nursery on the day Rhiya died but was charged with the offences because it was felt she had failed in her duties as manager. Jacobs of High Ongar, Essex, and nursery assistant Murphy, of Loughton, Essex, are both charged with failing to discharge their duties under Section Seven of the Health and Safety Act 1974. They both deny failing to take reasonable care of people who might be affected by their actions at work; failing to ensure that children were adequately supervised in the garden and failing to ensure that risk assessments were carried out and safety check lists were completed. The case, expected to last about four weeks, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Rhiya Malin died in a playhouse at Eton .

'Accident waiting to happen': Stelios Morfis has been arrested in Zakynthos in connection with the murder of British teenager Robert Sebbage . Posing with his Rottweilers, this is the taxi driver who allegedly stabbed a British teenager to death on a Greek holiday island. Robert Sebbage, 18, was stabbed in the heart in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Taxi driver Stelios  Morfis, who will be charged with  murder today, was described by locals as ‘an accident waiting to happen’. Robert’s friend Jordan Manson, 18, was left with a punctured lung, and three other British teens suffered minor stab wounds in the vicious assault on the island of Zakynthos. Back in Hampshire, Mr Sebbage’s former school, Hurst Community College, was preparing to hold a minute’s silence today for the tragic teenager. His former head teacher, Malcolm  Christian, said yesterday: ‘All at the Hurst Community College were saddened to hear of Robert’s untimely death. ‘He held a special place in our hearts for the way in which he had fought hard to overcome a significant medical condition when he was younger. ‘We remember the many friendships he had created, his quiet tenacity in overcoming adversity and how well he achieved with us at GCSE level prior to going on to sixth form college.’ Supporters of Reading Football Club – the team the former England football  mascot followed – were also calling for a minute’s silence before the first game of the season against Millwall next month. By yesterday afternoon, more than 5,000 people had left messages on a Facebook condolences page. Stabbed: Robert Sebbage's dream came true when he was given the chance to be an England mascot . The teen was remembered as a ‘gentle’ young man by former teachers and friends. One, Sandie Jones, wrote: ‘I remember teaching Robert at Bishopswood School... Not fair, why the gentlest of people are taken first, Tadley missing an angel tonight.’ Mr Sebbage’s family said in a statement yesterday: ‘All these young men are very close friends. ‘They are simply just a bunch of nice lads and this is their first  holiday abroad and they had all gone just to enjoy themselves.’ His parents, Rhian and Andrew, have flown to Greece. Andrew Sebbage said the family was ‘devastated’. Injured: Jordan Manson . Recovering: Steven Granston . In hospital: Callum Lane . Close: Stabbing victim Robert Sebbage, left, with his brother Steven . Mr Sebbage had been picked as a mascot for the England team’s 2007 friendly against Brazil at Wembley by the Rays of Sunshine charity.  He stood alongside David Beckham. The youngster was a victim of the bowel disorders, Eosinophilic colitis and gut dysmotility, which led to part of his intestine being removed. More details of the incident emerged yesterday. In the hours after the fatal attack, Morfis attempted to evade police capture on a speedboat he had moored at a marina, according to reports. But officers tracked the  21-year-old thug, described by one local as ‘an accident waiting to  happen’, to a relative’s house. Murder scene: The spot on the central Laganas street where the brawl and killing took place . The family home where Robert lived with his parents Andrew and Rhian . The group allegedly provoked Morfis by shining a laser pen at him. Following his arrest, he told Greek police he snapped, stating: ‘I could not stand the insults and the mockery they were throwing at us.’ Morfis was arrested earlier this month for punching a man in the face. Morfis and his accomplice Dimosthenes Mylonas, 25, will appear in the island’s court today to be charged over the death. Yesterday, residents said the British youths had simply run into the ‘wrong guy’. Shop owner Nikos Liveras, 52, said: ‘He is known for having a short fuse. He would explode at anyone for no reason at all and has been involved in many arguments with tourists. He’s not the type to back down.’","Second teenager suffered punctured lung .

The fast food giant is giving away at least 15 million in books in its U.K. Happy Meals over the next two years, in place of toys. McDonald’s says it will have distributed the millions of fiction and non-fiction books to British families by the end of 2014. Scroll down for video . Will the kids love it? McDonald's is giving away 15 million in books in its U.K. Happy Meals over the next two years, in place of toys . The literary offering for kids began Wednesday with a five-week promotion in which a non-fiction book from Dorling Kindersley's ‘Amazing World’ series will be given away with each Happy Meal, the Guardian reported. The promotional effort is sponsored in part by the U.K.’s National Literacy Trust as the independent charity group looks to further encourage literacy in the country. The ‘Amazing World’ books cover topics including stars and planets, animals and oceans. ‘When children own their own books, it makes a huge difference to their reading,’ Conal Presho, the NLT’s head of fundraising, told the Guardian. ‘Our focus is on using any way we can to encourage children to read, and to read anything they can, whether that's menus in restaurants, non-fiction books or magazines – anything which spreads children's enjoyment of reading.’ Smarter Happy Meal: The book giveaway for kids started Wednesday with a five-week promotion in which a non-fiction book from Dorling Kindersley's ¿Amazing World¿ series will be offered with each Happy Meal . McDonald's also plans to launch new ‘Happy Readers’ £1 book offers, which will be redeemable at British book retailer WHSmith. The fast food chain said it will additionally ‘lend its family-friendly restaurant environment and its focus on family fun to encouraging parents and children to enjoy books together.’ In addition to Kindersley, McDonald’s plans to work with other authors and publishers over the next two years, the company says. The latest book offerings follow a similar effort last year when McDonald’s gave away nine million Michael Morpurgo books in its Happy Meals. Alistair Macrow, McDonald's vice president and head of marketing in the U.K., said the feedback from its previous book giveaway pilot had been 'overwhelmingly positive.' He said that 9 out of 10 parents wanted to see more book promotions from the popular burger chain. McDonald’s has 1,200 restaurant locations in the U.K. and an estimated 12,800 locations in the U.S. McDonald’s is the world's largest chain of fast food hamburger restaurants, serving around 68 million customers a day in 119 countries.

A State Police helicopter flew overhead . shining light into the black waters of the lake before the search was . eventually called off. Some witnesses said that they initially heard screams when the young adults, reported to be ages 14 and 15, fell through. Bartender Christine Stanat told the Hackettstown Patch that she heard one of them yelling, ‘Help, help, don’t let me die!’ William . Hardy, 25, and his roommate also heard the screams. They had been . smoking outside of their house, which is on the banks of the lake. Hardy told the Star-Ledger that he called the police, grabbed a flashlight, and then ran out onto the ice to see how he could help. The .

Rescue effort: First responders, including cold water divers, scoured Budd Lake in northern New Jersey for hours last night . Collective effort: Police, EMS, and firefighters all joined in to find the missing teens; search efforts continue today to recover their bodies . Rescue: Initial reports said that a body was pulled from the water last night; these reports were later deemed to be erroneous . Collaborative effort: Rescue workers from neighboring towns rushed to the scene to offer aid . ‘Clyde went to save him on his . bicycle. And then they both went in,’ he said. ‘He was a very good . child. I’m going to miss him a lot.’ Speaking with MyFoxNY, Mr Schimanski Jr. said that he ‘knows there is no hope.’ ‘It hurts my heart,’ the grief-stricken father said. ‘Until they pull him out, I’ll…hold tight. I want to know they find him.’ Last . night, Mount Olive Mayor Robert Greenbaum said that he believed the two . boys, both students at Mount Olive High School, were ice fishing. 'The . lake is not guarded in any way,' he said. The mayor later posted a status update on his Facebook page speaking of the grief that had likely come to the New Jersey community. He wrote: ‘Once again I am sad to report that we likely lost two young adults in Mount Olive this evening. May God bless their families and help ease their pain.’ The mayor added that he was thankful for all of the help received from neighboring towns. Tragedy: Budd Lake is located in Mount Olive, New Jersey, a small town about 40 miles outside of Newark . There were initial reports last night that a body had been removed from the water, but those reports were today proved to be erroneous. The natural lake is often used in the winter for recreational activities like ice skating and ice fishing. At its deepest, it is 12ft. The weather in Mount Olive has been warmer than average this season, with daily highs well above freezing point. However, area residents said that the lake had been frozen enough for usual wintertime activities such as skating and fishing. New York News | NYC Breaking News .

A Lithuanian man has been handed a life sentence for strangling his ex-wife in Peterborough before taking her dead body to Poland and dumping it in a shallow grave. Rimas Venclovas, 47, murdered Vitalija Baliutaviciene, 29, after discovering she had started a new life with another man. Her body was discovered in a remote wood in western Poland by a mushroom-picker more than two months after she disappeared from her home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Murdered: Vitalija Baliutaviciene, left, was strangled in Peterborough by ex-husband Rimas Venclovas, right . Venclovas bragged about his plans to kill and bury Ms Baliutaviciene, also of Lithuanian origin. He spent months planning the murder from his home in Lithuania. The killer applied for travel documents under an assumed name, used his lover’s credit card to buy supplies, grew his hair and started sporting a moustache. He even bought a minibus in preparation for the journey to Poland, removing the seats and tinting the windows so no one could see in. He then staged a ‘dry run’ three weeks before he snatched his ex-wife, sneaking back into the UK to watch her movements and to scout potential burial sites. Venclovas had been arrested twice by UK . police over previous attacks on Ms Baliutaviciene and fled to Lithuania while on police . bail to avoid prosecution. He denied ever having been violent . towards her and said bruises on her neck from the earlier attacks were . ‘love bites’ from her new boyfriend. Abducted: CCTV images show the moment Venclovas grabbed Baliutaviciene on the street . Getaway: After strangling his victim, Venclovas drover her body to Poland and buried it in a shallow grave . Venclovas claimed he was not in the country when Ms Baliutaviciene went missing and that both he and his victim had been wrongly identified in CCTV footage of the abduction. But an Old Bailey jury unanimously convicted him of murder after four hours’ deliberation at the conclusion of a six-week trial. He pounced on his victim as she was heading to work from her home in Burmer Road, Peterborough, in the early hours of August 12 last year. Ms Baliutaviciene would normally have . got a lift with a friend to her job at a potato factory, but the car . had broken down and she had to walk into the centre of Peterborough to . get a lift with someone else . ‘CCTV footage taken a short distance along her route shows her being overpowered and taken away by someone,’ said prosecutor Maureen Baker QC. ‘Then she simply vanished. Vanished: Ms Baliutaviciene had been on her way to work in a potato factory when Venclovas pounced . Preparation: Venclovas removed the seats and tinted the windows of his green Mercedes Vito van for the journey to Poland. This CCTV image shows him driving off the ferry from Dover . ‘That is until October 30, when a man gathering mushrooms in a wood in western Poland came across a shallow grave containing her remains. ‘It was established she had died a suddenly and violently as a result of manual choking. ‘The prosecution say that this defendant, her former husband, is responsible for both her kidnap and murder. ‘And, in doing so, did exactly what he always promised her he would.’ Ms Baliutaviciene and Venclovas had been together since she was just 17 and had a son together before marrying in 2007. They divorced in September 2010, but Venclovas persuaded her to allow him to come to the UK, using their son as a bargaining chip. Abuse: Venclovas had been questioned by police over previous assaults on his former wife . He was already bent on revenge after she announced she wanted to leave him and had torched a woodland home in Lithuania she had inherited from a relative two months earlier. Their relationship was punctuated by abuse from Venclovas who became obsessed by the idea his wife was having an affair. Describing a previous row, Ms Baker said: ‘He was telling her it was the destiny of her son to grow up without a mother, while hers was to be killed by him.’ He eventually fled the UK in February last year after he was questioned by police about an attack on his ex-wife. An investigation into an earlier assault the previous year was dropped on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service because of difficulties understanding Ms Baliutaviciene, who spoke little English. ‘Subsequent events have of course called that decision into question,’ said Ms Baker. After fleeing to Lithuania, Venclovas kept in touch with his ex-wife and their son over Skype and started plotting the killing when he found out she was seeing Ako Garib, a workmate from the potato factory. He made his first trip back to the UK in July last year when, despite still being wanted by Cambridgeshire Police for the second attack on Ms Baliutaviciene, he managed to enter and leave the country without being arrested. He used the visit to stalk his ex-wife and find out about her movements and to scout burial sites in the remote Fenland around Peterborough. Returning to his homeland, he enlisted a new lover to help tint the windows of his green Mercedes Vito minibus so nobody could see inside. Two days before the killing, he dropped hints about his plan to Ms Baliutaviciene’s mother, Vanda Cereneckiene, during a meeting at her home. ‘He was saying she would be kidnapped and sold,’ she said. ‘Those kinds of things. ‘He said she was a loose woman and that she goes with anyone in Peterborough.’ During a further visit after the killing, he told Ms Cereneckiene: ‘I’ve come to tell you that Vitalija’s not around any more.’ But instead of owning up, he accused her of cooking up a plot with her daughter to fake the disappearance so he would be denied access to their son. Venclovas, who was born Rimantas Baliutavicius, from Taurage, Lithuania, denied murder and kidnapping, but an Old Bailey jury unanimously convicted him of murder after four hours’ deliberation at the conclusion of a six-week trial. Venclovas showed no emotion at the verdict, yet giggled and smirked in the dock as Judge Mr Justice Fulford jailed him for life with a minimum term of 20 years. ‘This was no sudden rush of blood to the head but instead it was coldly planned and ruthlessly executed,’ the judge told him. ‘There is no mitigation and you have shown not an ounce of remorse. ‘Instead, you have been caught out by modern technology which with near pinpoint accuracy tracked your movements from beginning to end. ‘Indeed, it is to be observed in this case that if digital records from CCTV and other cameras across England, along with those for mobile telephone and satellite navigation devices across Europe, had not been available for police investgation, you would almost certainly have got away with murder.’ The judge said Venclovas’ previous attacks on Ms Baliutaviciene suggested he had subjected her to prolonged torture in her final moments by holding her ‘at the edge of unconsciousness’. ‘I am sure that on this occasion you would have wanted her to know exactly what was going to happen to her,’ he added. ‘And you would have guaranteed that her last moments were spent in the misery of the full realisation that her position was hopeless and that she was going to die.’ Venclovas, who appeared newly shaven-headed in court today, has previous convictions in Lithuania for using counterfeit documents, driving offences, theft and stealing State property - but no offences of violence.","Lithuanian Rimas Venclovas, 47, had already been investigated by UK police for assaulting Vitalija Baliutaviciene, 29 .

Devastated workers left jobless by the collapse of photography chain Jessops have resorted to sticking their pictures in the store window in a desperate bid to find work. Employees of the Warrington branch plastered the window with their images along with a sign that reads: 'Five unemployed and loyal staff seeking work. Can you help?' Former sales expert Lanza Martineta said he and his fellow team-members - some of whom have worked for Jessops for up to 15 years - wanted to show the 'real faces' behind yet another blow to the British High Street. 'Devastating effect': Staff from the Warrington branch of Jessops plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment . Around 1,370 shop staff were left jobless when Jessops closed its 187 stores across the UK last week. Further redundancies at the chain's head office in Leicester also look likely. 'Loyal staff': Mr Martineta's picture beneath the sign featuring the staff's call for help . Mr Martineta, 44, said their window display - which also includes a sign that reads: 'What's happening to our high streets?' - had created quite a stir in the town centre. 'It's brought quite a bit of attention,' said Mr Martineta, who said people had come in to sympathise with the team as they packed away stock and equipment inside the closed store. 'We have had literally hundreds of people knocking on our doors to tell us how sorry they were that we were going,' said the former salesman, who had worked for Jessops for around four years. 'They were saying it's now almost impossible to get your photos printed in the centre of town. 'We were packing up the goods for the administrators. It was really quite distressing. 'Each member of staff at the store was completely passionate about photography. 'I'm actually a photographer myself. I worked there because I genuinely liked it.' The team's collective enthusiasm for their work made the news of their fate all the more devastating according to Mr Martineta, who said staff only learned of the chain's collapse when a journalist called the Warrington branch for a comment. 'It was really out of the blue,' he said. 'We had no warning. 'I've seen my colleagues crying, wondering how they are going to pay their rents.' Mr Martineta said they were all hoping that their window display might encourage potential future employers to get in touch. High street casualty: All 187 Jessops stores nationwide have ceased trading . Final days: Customers browse in the Bath branch of Jessops on the day before stores across the country closed their doors . Mr Martineta, who in the meantime intends to concentrate on his professional photographic work after losing his position at Jessops, said this latest retail casualty indicated a bleak future for the British High Street. 'When Comet went down I did pay it some attention, but it doesn't really hit you until it happens to you,' said Mr Martineta, adding that Jessops had struggled to compete with internet retailers. 'People were coming in for our expert advice, then using that to buy stock online,' he said. 'I do think we could have adapted better. It is a crying shame. As Britain's only specialist camera retailer, Jessops had been a fixture on high streets nationwide for almost 80 years. Its collapse followed that of a number of familiar high street names over the course of last year, including fellow camera retailer Jacobs in June 2012, and Comet in November. Peacocks, La Senza and Clinton Cards also went under last year. Shocked by the disappearance of Jessops from Britain's high streets - and the loss of more than 1,000 jobs - a photography firm has offered an apprenticeship to one of the stricken chain's former employees. Blake Ezra, pictured right, who runs London-based Blake Ezra Photography, said the firm was keen to take on an apprentice and had decided to offer it to someone affected by Jessops' collapse. 'It's terrible that, in one year, Jacobs, Jessops and Comet have disappeared from our high streets, leaving very limited options for camera buyers and photography enthusiasts,' Mr Ezra said. 'We already have one apprentice and strongly believe in bringing young enthusiastic people on board to grow with us.' Mr Ezra said whoever was selected for the year-long apprenticeship could potentially go on to a long-standing career with the firm. 'Young people in the UK nowadays get a rough deal,' he said. 'There are many talented and passionate people who simply cannot get a break. 'I really believe that apprenticeships are a great way to find your feet in an industry that is increasingly difficult to break into,' he added. Former Jessops employees interested in applying for the apprenticeship with Blake Ezra Photography should e-mail their CV to info@blakeezraphotography.com. The apprenticeship is subsidised, and the successful candidate will gain an HND in photography over the course of the year.","Camera retailer closed its 187 stores across the UK after going into administration last week .

A London architect firm has been declared the winner of an international competition to design a new $1bn Iraqi parliament building in Baghdad. Assemblage architects was one of 130 firms to put forward a design for the £620million scheme. And the London firm came out on top after its design was whittled down to a shortlist of 32 before being announced as the winner by judges from a Royal Institute of British Architects jury. The proposed development would be built at a site close to the disused al-Muhanna airport, where a super mosque had begun to be built by Saddam Hussein but was stopped following the US-led invasion of the country ten years ago. Cutting edge design: London-based Assemblage architects have been declared the winners of an international design competition for this design of a new $1bn parliament building for the Iraqi government . Top design: Assemblage were picked out of more than practices who entered designs by judges from the Royal Institute of British Architects . The London-based architects designed a scheme which features clear and simple geometric forms within a maze of streets and courtyards. But while Assemblage received its $250,000 prize in August, the designs have only just been released as the Iraqi Government had remained in talks with a rival, which came third place in the competition, Zaha Hadid Architects, The Guardian has reported. The practice told the paper: 'At this initial meeting ZHA was made aware that the competition rules allow for any of the submitted design proposals to be selected for construction, irrespective of placement in the competition.' But Assemblage still hopes its design will be the one chosen to go ahead in the future. Assemblage's other designs for the region include a fully integrated settlement for 3000 people with schools, markets, health centres, and a variety of green spaces and playing fields. The settlement buildings proposed are low cost, architecturally advanced, use local resources, and have sustainability ratings rivalling western standards. The company has also designed a major regeneration scheme for the holy town of Kadhimiya in Iraq. Competition: The Iraqi Government is still in talks with Zaha Hadid Architects, which came third in the competition, but Assemblage is hopeful its design will be the one used . It describes the new structure as being . 'inspired by the morphology and poetics of the Baghdadi house' adding . that the plan 'resolves a complex matrix of religious, infrastructure, . and conservation demands' Practice co-director Peter Besley said: 'It would be great if our scheme was built and became a loved, well-used building.' Assemblage director Hannah Corlett, who previously worked on the Peckham Library which won the Stirling Prize 2000, said: 'We wanted to take an urban approach rather than propose a single mega-structure.' She said the scheme featured a series of streets and courtyards which will be home to government departments, officers and community functions including medical centres and libraries. Corlett and Besley jointly launched Assemblage relatively recently in 2003. The London-based studio consists of architects and urban designers who have worked on numerous private and public sector projects in the UK, Middle East and Australia.

"Mr Hutchins 'disappointed' at decision and claims there is no 'conflict' between his role as a magistrate and manager of a club . By . Emily Andrews . PUBLISHED: . 09:00 EST, 29 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:45 EST, 29 October 2012 . Magistrate by day: JP Steven Hutchins applied for a licence to open a strip club . As one of the country’s youngest magistrates, Steven Hutchins is committed to keeping the peace. However, he’s causing something of a brouhaha in his other role…as the manager of a string of strip clubs. The 34-year-old’s double life came to light after he applied to open a fully nude lap dancing club in Maidstone. The proposal was rejected by the local council but not before it caused a storm of protest among residents, some of whom questioned the wisdom of having a magistrate involved in the sex industry. Mr Hutchins was only 28 when he was sworn in as a JP for Medway, Kent, in 2007. Then, he said he worked in the leisure industry for a national company. Now, however, he is involved in a less salubrious business. He works as operations manager for the Aaron P Stone Group which owns strip clubs and runs a number of venues including Tenshi Gentlemen Nights – a Japanese-themed lap dancing bar. His proposal for Maidstone – which involved the setting up of a club with private booths and nude pole dancing – attracted more than 120 letters of objection. Speaking at a council meeting which later threw out the plan, mother-of-two Dorcas Kingsford said: ‘I don’t want my children to grow up thinking that the sex industry in Maidstone is all right. ‘By allowing sex establishments in the town, you as a council are telling our children it’s all right, and it’s not all right.’ In support of his club plan, Mr Hutchins said: ‘We’re not here to discuss moral concerns.’ Rejections: More than 100 residents complained about the application for a fully nude lap-dancing club . When asked after the meeting if he . used the services on offer at his establishments, he said: ‘Not really. I . go and visit other venues – you become a bit anaesthetised to it after . time.’ He also defended his dual role, . saying, ‘It’s important in law that you have a broad spectrum of life . experience – and that’s why you sit on a panel of three (magistrates).’ Mr Hutchins, who is married, said that . evidence showed sex entertainment venues attracted less antisocial . behaviour and crime than regular nightclubs. He said the sex club – to . be open seven days a week until 6am – was planned for the upper floor of . a larger nightclub and would not be advertised outside. He later said he was ‘disappointed’ with the decision to reject the club plan, adding: ‘I feel our . application has been misunderstood by the public, press and the . council.’ His company is considering whether to appeal. Local Sam Greening, 42, said: ‘It’s a . bit odd that a magistrate was behind plans to open a strip club. You . wouldn’t really put those two jobs together – there’s enough sleaze . around without having it in your face in the town centre.’ Full time operation: The strip club would have contained several private booths and remained open until 6am every day (picture posed by model)","JP Steven Hutchins applied to open a strip club in Maidstone, Kent .

Kelly Barnes, 32, claimed that her civil partner Jodie Barnes, 31, made the admission to her when they were on remand, charged with murdering retired bus conductor Barry Reeve. The drug addict couple, who both deny murder, are accused of targeting Mr Reeve, 67, as they believed he had large sums of money. Accusations:  Kelly Barnes, 32, right, claimed that her civil partner Jodie Barnes, 31, left, made the admission to her when they were on remand, charged with murdering retired bus conductor Barry Reeve . Norwich Crown Court heard how the pensioner was punched, stamped on and cut with a knife in an alleged attempt to ‘torture’ him and force him to disclose his PIN number. Mother-of-four Kelly admitted that they both visited Mr Reeve on February 9 last year after Jodie suggested that he might lend them or give them cash. But she told a jury that she had nothing to do with harming him and she claimed she did not see Jodie assaulting him at his home in Norwich, Norfolk. Kelly claimed that Jodie only confessed to her what she had done to Mr Reeve when they met up in the gym at a women’s prison in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. She said: 'I asked Jo die if she did it. She said she did. I was devastated. I don’t think I was angry. I was in shock in prison and did not know what to do.' Kelly said that Jodie had told her before they visited Mr Reeve that she had got to know the pensioner through her sister and he had previously given her money. Victim: The drug addict couple, who both deny murder, are accused of targeting Barry Reeve, 67, as they believed he had large sums of money . She admitted she was ‘staggering and light-headed’ when they went to his bungalow as she had taken drugs including heroin and had been drinking. Kelly said: 'Jodie knocked on the front door and it opened. She said, ""Can my wife come in?’.'I went straight into the living room. Jodie was in the hallway with Barry. The living room door was partially open, but more shut. 'I heard her say, ""Barry, can I have some money?’ I heard him say he didn’t have any.' Kelly admitted searching the living room for objects to steal and then did the same in Mr Reeve’s bedroom. But she insisted that she did not harm Mr Reeve and she was ‘positive’ that she didn’t see Jodie using any violence. She said she then saw Jodie looking through drawers in the pensioner’s kitchen and taking food from his freezer. Kelly said they took property away in five or six bags which they left in his garden by a tree. She said they went to a Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried to use a bank card in a cash machine. She claimed that she did not know at the time that the card belonged to Mr Reeve. They then caught a taxi back to Mr Reeve’s home to collect the stolen property from his garden before returning to the Sainsbury’s store where Jodie tried used the cash machine again. Kelly added: 'I can remember Jodie saying that she had done something silly. I said, ""What do you f*****g mean? I was a bit concerned. 'I don’t think she gave me any explanation to be fair.' Kelly admitted using Mr Reeve’s mobile phone after it was taken from his home. She claimed she did not know how Mr Reeve’s blood got on to her Nike trainers, but she said her clothing sometimes got ‘mixed up’ with Jodie’s clothes when they undressed at night. Under cross-examination by Mukhtar Hussain QC who is defending Jodie, she described the murder of Mr Reeve as ‘horrendous’. She also admitted that she had lied about some matters in the past including once falsely claiming that a social worker was a paedophile. Horrific: Norwich Crown Court, pictured, heard how the pensioner was punched, stamped on and cut with a knife in an alleged attempt to 'torture' him and force him to disclose his PIN number . Kelly denied that she was trying to shift the blame on to Jodie in revenge for her partner cheating on her. The court has heard that Mr Reeve might have been alive for at least 24 hours hours after being attacked. His body was found in his blood splattered home two weeks later after he had died of serious head injuries. He had also developed pneumonia. The court has heard that Mr Reeve’s blood was also found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie. Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but had been heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash. The trial continues.

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 07:18 EST, 30 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:25 EST, 30 July 2012 . An angry father flew into a rage and smashed up a shop that supplied legal 'bath salts' type drugs that put his son in hospital. Justin Avery, 24, was taken to New York's Samaritan Hospital after snorting a powder labelled 'glass cleaner' that his friends had called 'fake cocaine'. According to police reports, his father Dan then called the store where his son had paid $20 for the legal high and left a message saying: 'You sold my kid bath salts and I’ll [expletive] kill you'. Dangerous trade: 'Bath salts' and 'glass cleaner' are synthetic highs named after the innocuous products because they can be legally sold if they are marked as not for human consumption . Justin had never used any drug stronger than marijuana, he said, but snorted the glass cleaner for the first time one evening because he was upset and had heard . it would give him a buzz. But by 1.30am his heart was racing wildly, he was sweating heavily and his breathing had become so laboured he thought he would die. Three days earlier, a friend of the 24-year-old’s . had apparently called Avery Sr hallucinating, afraid that people were trying to kill . him. Justin said the friend had also used the so-called 'glass cleaner' bought at Tebb’s Headshop, according to syracuse.com. Avery drove to Tebb’s, based in a little strip . mall, carrying a miniature wooden baseball bat in his truck, as usual. The slight 5'7"", 120-pound man then chased off waiting customers, screaming, 'You need some bath salts?' Shop worker Trevor Harding arrived and opened up, while Mr Avery went to his 2003 Ford Explorer and slid the bat into his trousers. He then went into Tebb’s and pretended to be one of the customers he had just chased away. Bath salts are likely to be stimulant drugs such MPDV or ephedrine. The phrase does not refer to a single chemical, but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the US as long as they are not marked for human consumption – hence the misleading name. In high doses, such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour, and terrifying hallucinations. Here are just a few of the recent crimes said to have been triggered by the dangerous drugs: . He asked for bath salts or glass . cleaner, he recalled, and Harding put a round blue-and-orange . package on the glass countertop. He claims Harding then pulled out a magazine and opened it to a page that showed him how much glass cleaner to take. 'That’s . when I just went crazy,' said Avery. He pulled the bat out of his . pants and started swinging. He smashed the five-foot-long glass . counter and a couple of glass ashtrays. Then he started flinging . glass pipes from shelves at  Harding. 'Here’s a nice one,' Avery remembers yelling as he threw the pipes. 'Here’s another nice one.' He . chased Harding back and forth behind the counter and the pair grappled before Avery returned his bat to the car and gave Harding a lecture. He said he told Harding: 'You’re a sick man to sell this to these kids, knowing it’s gonna twist their minds. You’re pathetic.' Then he asked Harding for the store phone and called the police to tell them what he had done. After 10 to 15 minutes, police arrived and took him into custody. They charged him with two felonies – criminal mischief and criminal possession of a weapon – which carry a maximum prison sentence of seven years. The police report says Avery threatened to kill Harding in the store. but Avery said he only intended to scare the clerk. 'I wanted them to know why I did it,' he said. 'The cop asked me and I said, ""So people will know. So other parents who don’t even know their kids can buy this type of drug will be aware."" 'It sparked in my mind: It’s all over. I’ve lived my life for 30 years to do good, and tried to raise my kids to do good. But I couldn’t help it.' He said he had thought about letting authorities handle it, but the law does not consider those products illegal. The day after Avery’s violence, federal agents and local police raided Tebb’s and other head shops across the country. Agents seized the Watertown store’s supply of glass cleaner, among other products, Mr Harding said in an interview. He said said the store did not sell bath salts because they’re illegal, and claimed the shop was being wrongly accused of peddling harmful drugs. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent filed an affidavit last week in Syracuse federal court to get a search warrant for the store raids. In it, he listed glass cleaners as one of the names drug sellers use to disguise 'highly dangerous chemicals that are ingested by recreational drug users' as a substitute for marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy and methamphetamine. The raids follow months of horrific crimes by people disoriented by synthetic drugs. Another frustrated parent, a mother in Batavia, was charged with trespassing two weeks ago after she tried to buy bath salts at a head shop there, then started yelling at employees. Neither police nor prosecutors would comment on their plans for Avery. 'We don’t want people acting as vigilantes,' said police Sgt. Joe Donoghue. Jefferson County District Attorney Cindy Intschert said prosecutors would consider many factors when evaluating the case, as they do in all others. In his blog, Watertown Mayor Jeff Graham asked, 'What juror votes to convict the guy for busting up a head shop that was selling bath salts to his 24-year-old son?' Avery, who earns $2,400 a month setting up double-wide and modular homes, said he was worried about having enough money to hire a lawyer. 'I was being a father,' he added.","A mother was charged with trespassing two weeks ago after she started shouting at staff in a shop that sold 'bath salts'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:53 EST, 20 December 2011 . A snowstorm hammered the Great Plains . on Monday, unleashing snow and fierce winds that turned roads to ice, . reduced visibility to zero and jeopardized thousands of holiday . motorists' travel plans just two days before the official start of . winter. The storm was blamed for a fatal . accident in eastern Colorado, where a guard and an inmate were killed . when a prison van lost control along an icy highway. Eight other inmates and a prison . employee were hospitalized with moderate to serious injuries, according . to the Colorado State Patrol. Batten down the hatches: The snow will move north and east by Wednesday . National Guard troops and sheriff's deputies in the Texas Panhandle were called out on nearly 100 rescues after Interstate 40, a major east-west route, was closed Monday night from Amarillo into New Mexico. No injuries were immediately reported and several shelters were being set up, Oldham County sheriff's dispatchers said. From northern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle through Oklahoma and northwestern Kansas, blizzard conditions put state road crews on alert and had motorists taking refuge and early exits off major roads. The snow started falling on Santa Fe on Monday, seen here, and meteorologists warn that the snow and wind could make holiday travel dangerous, and even impossible, for some people . In northern New Mexico, snow and ice forced the closure of all roads from the town of Raton to the Texas and Oklahoma borders about 90 miles away. Hotels in Clayton, N.M., just east of where the three states touch, were nearly full. Linda Pape, general manager of the Clayton Super 8 motel said it was packed with unhappy skiers who had been headed to lodges in Colorado and elsewhere in New Mexico. 'They lost a day or two of skiing, and they had budgeted an amount of money they were going to spend, and now they have to spend more staying somewhere else,' she said. Pape said it's not uncommon for skiers to get stuck in Clayton during the winter, and she keeps two freezers and a refrigerator stocked in case roads are closed. Terrible visibility: Traffic on the I-25 in New Mexico . Heavy fall: Snow is cleared in Santa Fe, New Mexico on Tuesday afternoon . 'They are not happy, but we are not letting them go hungry,' she said. The storm came after much of the country had a relatively mild fall. With the exception of the October snowstorm blamed for 29 deaths on the East Coast, there's been little rain or snow. Many of the areas hit Monday enjoyed relatively balmy 60-degree temperatures just 24 hours earlier. The snow moved into the Oklahoma Panhandle early Monday morning, and 1.5 inches accumulated in about an hour, said Vicki Roberts, who owns the Black Mesa Bed and Breakfast in Kenton. Her inn sits at the base of the 4,973-foot-tall Black Mesa, the highest point in Oklahoma. Looking out her window, she couldn't see it. 'I have a mail route and I'm not going,' Roberts said. 'You just don't get out in this. We'll be socked in here. If we lose power, we'll just read a book in front of the fireplace.' Disruptions: A woman walks her dog on an uncleared sidewalk as snow covered cars pass her by . Travel throughout the region was difficult. New Mexico shut down a portion of Interstate 25, the major route heading northeast of Santa Fe into Colorado, and Clayton police dispatcher Cindy Blackwell said her phones were 'ringing off the hook' with calls from numerous motorists stuck on rural roads. Bill Cook, who works at the Best Western in Clayton, said he hadn't seen such a storm since the 1970s, when cattle had to be airlifted with helicopters and the National Guard was called in to help out. His hotel was packed Monday with people 'happy they have a room,' and some of the children were playing outside in the snow. Keith Barras, the owner of the Eklund Hotel, a landmark in Clayton since the 1890s, said guests were happily milling around the lobby and he expected to be full by nightfall. 'We have lots of board games, one of our customers has a guitar, we have a piano, so there'll be a party tonight,' Barras said. Though some drivers were inconvenienced, farmers and meteorologists said the storm was bringing much needed moisture - first rain, then snow as temperatures dropped - to areas of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas that had been parched by a drought that started in the summer of 2010. The big chill: The snow blowers were out clearing sidewalks in Santa Fe as dusk began to fall on Tuesday . Virginia Kepley, 73, spent Monday afternoon baking pumpkin bread to give as Christmas gifts while snow fell on her farm near Ulysses, Kansas. 'I decided to try to get as much done today in case the electricity goes off and I can't make it tomorrow,' she said. Kepley was grateful for the snow after some of her family's wheat never got enough moisture to sprout last season. A new crop had been planted in the fall for harvest next summer. 'It is wonderful for the wheat,' Kepley said. 'At least we have wheat we can see this year.' Shut down: Schools closed as the storm moved across New Mexico towards Texas and Oklahoma . In the Texas Panhandle, hotels were quickly filling up after I-40 and a handful of roadways heading north into Oklahoma were closed. The last available room was booked by 7pm at the Best Western Country Inn along I-40 in Vega, about 30 miles west of Amarillo, as blowing snow severely restricted visibility on the highway, hotel clerk Lena Patel said. 'I don't see anything,' she said, looking from the front window from the front desk. Long haul truck driver Frank Pringle stopped at a Love's Travel Stop in Amarillo earlier in the day, saying he intended to go as far west as road conditions would allow Monday. Slippery conditions: Parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Colorado were under blizzard watches or warnings this afternoon . Blizzard: More than a foot of snow and wind gusts of 50 miles per hour are predicted for some parts of the southwest and plains by Tuesday morning . His biggest worry was with four-wheel-drive cars because 'they will shoot past you and cut you off and you have to hit your brakes. And hitting brakes in the snow is not a good thing.""In the coming days up to 18 inches of snow is expected . in northeastern New Mexico, the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, . southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado, which were under blizzard . watches or warnings today through Wednesday. Weather service forecaster Kerry . Jones in Albuquerque, New Mexico is warned people in the region not to . be fooled by pleasant weather - the storm is potentially life-threatening and the snow started falling quickly on Monday. 'Those are tremendous amounts of . snow,' Jones said. 'Add to that the fact that that snow is going to be . blowing, and you're going to have winds easily in the 40 mph range if . not higher, it's going to be a very ugly, potentially life-threatening . situation.' 'We try to reserve these blizzard watches for very intense storm systems,' he added.","Eight other inmates and a prison treated in Colorado hospital .

This is the face of the brave 15-year-old who is determined to find out what happened on the night a  fire ravaged her features and almost killed her. Doctors at specialist burns unit in Chelmsford thought Terri Calvesbert, then just 18 months old, would die from the 90 per cent burns, but incredibly, she pulled through. Now, she wants answers from her estranged mother Julie Minter, who accidentally started the fire by leaving a lit cigarette in her daughter's bedroom at their Ipswich home. Scroll down for video . Pain: Terri Calvesbert, pictured left as a baby before the fire, and right today after more than 50 operations . Terri lost her hair, nose and eyes in the devastating blaze, but her 32-year-old mother refuses to set a date to meet and talk about what happened. Ms Minter was so wracked with guilt after the episode that she cut off almost all contact with her husband and daughter. Terri now lives with her 39-year-old father Paul, a community fire volunteer and stepmother Nicky, 44, but says she is still haunted by the past and desperate to know what happened. 'Only Mum can tell me what happened in that fire,' she told Closer magazine. 'But at the moment she can't or won't. 'It just makes me angry. It would mean so much to me to hear it from her.' Haunted by the past: The teenager wears a blonde wig and is studying for her GCSEs . In tears: Julie Minter, 39, walked out on her baby and husband Paul, right, because she could not cope with the guilt over the accident . Ms Minter left the family just two months after the accident, and Terri has had more than 50 painful operations since then to stretch her scarred skin. The teenager, who wears a blonde wig, will continue to need surgery and skin grafts for the rest of her life. Her plight has touched thousands of hearts and donations have poured in from all over the world. Her mother last spoke out in Closer magazine five years ago, when she said: 'I don't know what made me leave my cigarette... I play that moment over and over in my head.' Inspiring courage: Young Terri meets Prince Charles at St James's Palace . She tried desperately to save her baby but smoke and flames forced her back. 'I couldn't go in, I couldn't see anything,' she said. 'I went outside to see if I could smash the [ground floor] window but nothing worked. 'All I could shout was, ""My baby's on fire.""' Suffering: Terri says she has forgiven her mother for the accident, but it is harder to forgive her walking out . Horrifically, the firefighters who saved Terri thought she was a charred doll. Only the area under her wet nappy had escaped terrible burns. Ms Minter said she would have killed herself if she had stayed, and was only able to cry uncontrollably at the consequences of her actions. After moving out from the family's home, she eventually stopped visiting the hospital completely. In 2008, she asked her daughter to see her, and they met regularly for several months before the visits petered out. They now have not met for more than a year, although they text regularly. Terri now says she feels strong enough to know more about the fire - including details about why her mother could not save her. The teenager, who is studying for GCSEs in maths and science, says she has forgiven her mother for the accident - but finds it harder to forgive her for leaving afterwards. Ms Minter was unavailable for comment at the time of the interview. Terri appeared today on This Morning, where a clip of her in Channel 5 documentary Extraordinary People was shown. During one moving scene, Terri bursts into tears as a wig is fitted. The 15-year-old first appeared on the programme when she was just ten. Her father told the ITV show's presenter Holly Willoughby that he wanted people to see it was still possible to lead a normal life after such an episode. Endurance: Terri and her father appeared on This Morning today ahead of tonight's documentary on the strong-willed young woman . 'She's grown up a lot,' he said. 'It shows how independent she is.' Terri added: 'I wanted to get people to realise what I'd been through. 'If anyone else had been through the same they would know how to help people.' Mr Calvesbert added: 'It's something you live with all your life. Terri will always need skin grafts where she grows. 'If you had told me 13 years ago she'd be where she is now I wouldn't have believed it. 'It is something - you have to have hope and strength in your own mind, to bring Terri through it. 'At the beginning i was very shy, I wouldn't speak to anyone. It's given me a lot of encouragement.' Terri has had more than 40 operations, and is hoping to have a thumb constructed next. When she is 18 and has finished growing, surgeons will begin reconstructing her nose.","Terri Calvesbert nearly died from 90% burns after the fire when she was just 23 months old .

A series of bombings in different parts of Pakistan have killed 115 people today, including 81 who died in a sectarian attack on a bustling billiard hall in the southwest city of Quetta. The blasts punctuated one of the deadliest days in recent years in Pakistan, where the government faces a bloody insurgency by Taliban militants in the northwest and Baluch militants in the southwest. The country is also home to many enemies of the U.S. that Washington has frequently targeted with drone attacks. A series of bombings in different parts of Pakistan have killed 115 people today. Local police try to restore calm in Quetta where the attack hit . People shift an injured victim of a second bomb explosion to a hospital in Quetta. It is believed the figure includes 81 who died in a sectarian attack on a bustling billiard hall in the southwest of the city . Police check the site of the blast. Today saw one of the deadliest days in recent years in Pakistan . A U.S. missile strike today killed five suspected militants in the seventh such attack in two weeks, Pakistani intelligence officials said. The billiard hall in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, was hit by twin blasts about five minutes apart this evening, killing 81 people and wounding more than 120 others, said senior police officer Zubair Mehmood. The billiard hall was located in an area dominated by Shiite Muslims, and most of the dead and wounded were from the minority sect, said another police officer, Mohammed Murtaza. Many of the people who rushed to the scene after the first blast and were hit by the second bomb, which caused the roof of the building to collapse, he said. Police officers, journalists and rescue workers who responded to the initial explosion were also among the dead, police said. People wheel a man who was injured by one of the bomb explosions, into a hospital in Quetta . An injured man is helped after the blast. Police officers, journalists and rescue workers who responded to the initial explosion were also among the dead, police said . The sectarian militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack to local journalists. One of the group's spokesmen, Bakar Saddiq, said the first blast was carried out by a suicide bomber and the second was a bomb planted in a car and detonated by remote control. Radical Sunnis groups often target Pakistan's Shiite minority, whom they believe hold heretical views and are not true Muslims. Earlier in the day, a bomb targeting paramilitary soldiers in a commercial area in Quetta killed 12 people and wounded more than 40 others, said Shakeel, the senior police officer. The United Baluch Army, a separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack on the soldiers in calls to local journalists.

The White House on Saturday said that Israel had the right to defend itself against attack and decide how to respond to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. The White House is blaming the ruling Islamic militant Hamas group for starting the conflict. ‘We believe Israel has a right to defend . itself, and they'll make their own decisions about the tactics they use . in that regard,’ deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told . reporters during the president's flight on Air Force One to Asia. Conflict erupts: Smoke rise from a Hamas site after an Israeli air strike in the east of Gaza City (left), while two women take cover next to a car as sirens wail in the southern Israeli town of Yad Mardechay . Under fire: A Palestinian youth takes cover behind a makeshift barrier (right) during clashes with Israeli soldiers at the Qalandia checkpoint, in the occupied West Bank . Israel on Saturday hit Gaza with nearly . 200 airstrikes, expanding an aerial assault to include the prime . minister's headquarters, a police compound and a vast network of . smuggling tunnels. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are in agreement that a de-escalation of the violence is preferred, provided that Hamas stops sending rocket into Israel, Rhodes said. The Israeli government has called up thousands of reservists and massed troops, tanks and other armored vehicles along the border with Gaza, signalling a ground invasion could be imminent. Israel launched the offensive on Wednesday by assassinating Hamas' military commander, but Rhodes said the U.S. believes 'the precipitating factor for the conflict was the rocket fire coming out of Gaza.’ He added, 'These rockets have been fired into Israeli civilian areas and territory for some time now. So Israelis have endured far too much of a threat from these rockets for far too long, and that is what led the Israelis to take the action that they did in Gaza.'

Francis Sharrak, 44, of Farmington Hills, was acting as his own lawyer at the time. He asked for the laptop to . prepare arguments in his federal court sentencing for tax evasion in April. Sharrak was being held at the Wayne County Jail in Detroit in a cell for high-profile inmates. Jail officials acknowledge that Sharrak had the computer without proper permission but called it an isolated . incident. The case involved an employee who has since been fired for other . reasons, under-sheriff Daniel Pfannes said. During a recorded phone call from jail in January 2011, Sharrak can be heard saying: 'Now, I am the first one ever to have a computer in the history of this jail.' Federal prosecutors asked the judge to consider a transcript of the call when sentencing Sharrak. Pfannes said: 'We were misled initially by an employee who said there was a court order giving him access to a laptop computer.' Officials later learned there wasn't a court order and the department also changed policies to avoid a repeat in the future. On March 8, the sheriff's department seized the convict's computer. Sharrak filed a motion to have it returned, saying he'd had it since August 2010 and that it was essential to his defense. Scroll down for video .

Victory: Ned RocknRoll leaves London's High Court after winning his legal battle to prevent a tabloid newspaper from publishing semi-naked pictures of him . Kate Winslet’s husband today won his high court battle to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published. Ned RocknRoll, who married the Hollywood actress a few weeks ago, went to London’s High Court to prevent a tabloid newspaper from printing the pictures taken of him indulging in ‘silly schoolboy antics’. The images of the 34-year-old, who is a nephew of Sir Richard Branson, were discovered on a Facebook page. RocknRoll, who changed his surname . from Edward Abel Smith, was granted a temporary injunction last . Thursday, shortly after The Sun newspaper contacted Winslet’s publicist . about the pictures. The newspaper yesterday contested the injunction. This afternoon Mr Justice Briggs ruled in favour of Mr RocknRoll preventing the newspaper from publishing the photos. He will outline his reasons for the decision at a later date. Mr RocknRoll and Miss Winslet said . later in a joint written statement: 'We have stopped The Sun from . publishing semi-naked photos of Ned taken by a friend at a private 21st . birthday party a few years ago. 'The photos are innocent but embarrassing and there is no reason to splash them across a newspaper. 'We . recognise that in the internet age privacy is harder and harder to . maintain. But we will continue to do what we can, particularly to . protect Kate's children from the results of media intrusion. Kate Winslet's husband Ned RocknRoll, pictured together, went to London's High Court to prevent photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published . 'We refuse to accept that her career means our family can't live a relatively normal life.' The . Sun’s publisher, News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers, . argued the pictures, which were taken from a publicly accessible . Facebook profile belonging to RocknRoll’s friend, James Pope, were . already publicly available. The . group also said that RocknRoll is a public figure and has a lower . reasonable expectation of privacy than an ordinary private citizen. RocknRoll’s . lawyer, David Sherborne, told the court yesterday that the pictures of a . ‘partly naked’ Rocknroll in a fancy dress costume were taken at a . private party, which had the theme ‘outrageous’ and would cause distress . to him if they were printed. Mr . Sherborne told the court: ‘This application is not to hide some guilty . secret, as I said in the interim hearing. It is not to keep something . secret. The claimant is here because the defendant seeks to invade his . privacy. ‘It was a private . party with a private guestlist at a private family home so it is hard to . see these photographs as anything other than private family photos.’ He told the court and judge Mr Justice Briggs that the photos showed Rocknroll indulging in ‘silly schoolboy antics at this fancy dress party. It is embarrassing because of what you can see in these pictures.’ Privacy: Mr RocknRoll's lawyer David Sherborne said his wife's children would be bullied if the pictures were published . Mr Sherborne added that RocknRoll was ‘horrified’ at the prospect of the pictures being published. He explained that they were never intended for public consumption and would cause ‘considerable embarrassment and humiliation’ for Winslet and her children, who would face bullying and taunting if they were made public. He also said that he was not a role model and had been a ‘relative nobody’ prior to his marriage to Winslet in December. RocknRoll, who was previously head of marketing for Branson’s Virgin Galactic space-exploration firm before leaving to work as a sheep farmer, was in court wearing a blue pinstripe suit, married the Titanic star in a low-key ceremony in New York in December. The hearing follows the publication of a report in March last year by the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions that found there was no case for a new privacy law and that cases should still be judged by the courts on an individual basis. RocknRoll is the latest in a long line of figures and celebrities to use an injunction to prevent the publication of detail of their private lives. In 2011, Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced banker who took the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse, obtained a High Court injunction. The order, which bans mention of matters Sir Fred wishes to keep secret, was disclosed in the Commons by Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming using parliamentary privilege. Footballer Ryan Giggs also took out an injunction banning newspapers from printing details of his affair with model Imogen Thomas, despite his identity being widely discussed across the internet. Hemming again used parliamentary privilege to name the player, saying 75,000 people had already outed him on Twitter.

The Cape Breton teen, 16 at the time of the murder, was allegedly found by a witness standing over the girl’s mutilated body saying, ‘I had to. She cheated on me. I had to kill her.’ Slaying: A judge has sentenced Melvin Skeete Jr., now 18, to life behind bars after found guilty of slaying 17-year-old Brittany Green, pictured with her grandmother, when he was 16 years old . After found guilty of second-degree murder in August, Skeete rose to his feet on Monday yelling obscenities at the victim's family, police and the judge following his upgraded sentence as an adult in a youth court in Sydney. 'You guys ain’t gonna break me,' he shouted, according to the Chronicle Herald. 'I’ll still be smilin’.' An autopsy revealed that Miss Green was first bludgeoned by Skeete before she was stabbed 104 times using four knives during a night of drinking. Two knives he left in her side, one of which was found broken off. Skeete, who was first obtained by a police officer while walking down a road near the home, was found under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Young killer: Seen arriving to court on Monday, Skeete Jr., was sentenced as an adult after stabbing Miss Green 104 times in his grandfather's home . 'She was such a good person. It’s not . right, and to mutilate her body like that, no,' the girl's grandmother, . Theresa Brewster, told the Cape Brenton Post, her voice breaking into a . sob. 'He took so much away from us.

'We wanted people to know it's Melvin Skeete who did it to her, that's the main reason,' Miss Green's uncle, Raymond Brewster, told CBC. If sentenced has a youth he would have potentially served just four years behind bars and three years in the community. If receiving credit for time already served, with that sentence he'd have been back on the street within two years. Derrick ruled that a youth sentence would have neither held Skeete fully accountable for his grisly crime nor would it provide enough time for him to be rehabilitated. ‘F***k these people, man,’ Skeete said as he was led out of the courtroom on Monday. ‘F***k the judge, f**k the police, f**k the system.’ The defence did not return a message seeking comment.","Melvin Skeete Jr., now 18, was sentenced as an adult after found guilty of killing 17-year-old Brittany Green in 2010 .

V&A curator Michael Wheeler was charged with voyeurism today after installing a toilet camera . An expert in ancient manuscripts at the Victoria and Albert Museum, who installed a secret camera in a toilet and kept a collection of women’s clothes, wigs and make-up under his desk, was placed on twelve months supervision today. Michael Wheeler, 54, the award-winning Senior Paper Conservator at the V & A in South Kensington told police when interviewed: 'I suffer from a sexual addiction. The recordings were for my own use.' Wheeler, who had been at the museum for seventeen years and lectured all over the world, pleaded guilty to voyeurism on act August 10 in that he installed equipment with intent to observe others doing a private act for his own sexual gratification. He also admitted a second voyeurism charge of recording another person doing a private act for the purpose of his own sexual gratification. Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court heard Wheeler filmed himself installing the covert camera inside the toilet door’s coat hook. 'Clearly you gave some thought to this and there were two devices for recording,' District Judge James Henderson told Wheeler, also ordering him to sign the sex offenders register for five years, attend up to twenty-five counselling sessions and pay £85 costs. Prosecutor Mr. Tom Gill explained: 'On August the tenth at the Victoria and Albert museum, where the defendant was working as a conservator for seventeen years as an expert in his field, a female member of staff was using a staff disabled toilet on the fourth floor. 'She noticed a strange hook on the back of the door and it was found to be a covert camera. 'The memory card was viewed and among the images of males and females using the lavatory was this defendant attaching the camera and sitting back and viewing his handiwork.'

'He may have lost his job, but his wife is in employment and he has over twenty thousand pounds in savings and can easily afford these sessions. 'These images were for himself. They were not to be sighted by anyone else.' Mr. Henderson told Wheeler: 'You could go to prison for this. In theory for eighteen weeks plus, but that is for the most serious category, which is recording and distributing.' Wheeler, who lives on a boat in South Dock Marina, Rope Street, Rotherhithe, graduated from the University of Northumbria and specialises in Indian and Asian art on paper and architectural drawings. He has lectured in Australia, New Zealand, Holland, Finland, India and Singapore and advised on projects in India and Egypt.

Mrs Barton, whose children are aged from 23 to seven months, was at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children with seven-month-old daughter Phoebe after the Down's syndrome girl, who was born with a hole in the heart, had to undergo an operation to insert feeding tubes into her stomach, when her son called her to say her home was in flames. It is believed an electrical fault in a fridge freezer may have started the fire. There were no smoke alarms in the property. The 43-year-old dinner lady rushed back in the middle of the night to discover her terraced house destroyed. The house was empty at the time. The five children who still live with her were staying at their older siblings' homes in Brixham and Newton Abbot. Two miniature Yorkies died in the fire and a Bichon Frise was taken to the vet and put in an oxygen tank after suffering from severe smoke inhalation, but did not survive.

Boom: An extra 625,000 passengers flew in and out of Heathrow in 2012 compared to the previous year . Heathrow airport has enjoyed a record-breaking year, with the highest ever number of passengers travelling through Britain's biggest airport. The London airport handled almost 70 million passengers last year - 0.9% more than in 2011. The soaring passenger numbers have been driven by increased north Atlantic traffic and to the developing BRIC countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China. Despite the record performance, airport bosses say that the airport is operating at almost full capacity airport, with lost trade costing the UK £14 billion every year. The airport has been at the centre of a row about the the need for a new airport in the capital, with some suggesting a third runway should be built at Heathrow to deal with demand. An extra 625,000 passengers used Heathrow in 2012 from the previous year, according to figures released by the airport. Heightened interest in Brazil was one of the biggest factors in the increased activity, with a 21 per cent rise in traffic. An extra 109,000 passengers travelled to or from the country that will host the 2016 Olympics and boasts one of the world's largest economies. Fellow BRIC nation China saw traffic . rise by 5.9 per cent, while there was a 4.5 per cent increase in . passenger numbers to Russia. While traffic to Africa was down 5.7 per cent and Indian traffic fell 3.4 per cent, there was growth on routes to the Middle East and Asia. The economic situation across Europe contributed to a 0.5 per cent reduction in traffic, as routes to . Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain saw a collective passenger . reduction of 4.5 per cent. Greece experienced the largest . reduction, with a fall in passenger numbers of 7.3 per cent,  followed by Italy - down 6.8 per cent. Increase: Passengers pictured using Heathrow airport today.

Seminole County deputies and state wildlife officers searched last night using a sheriff's helicopter, equipped with heat-sensing technology, to circle Lake Jesup after dark. Scroll down for video . Jason Cobb (left) and Charlie Jackson of Volusia County are missing after launching a fishing boat on Lake Jesup. Friends and family have appealed for help to find them on Facebook . But so far they have found no trace of the pair. Searchers did find old shoes and white sneakers but could not confirm whether the items belonged to either man. Lieutenant Jeff Hudson of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission told the Orlando Sentinel: 'It's come up negative.' Mr Jackson's father Bill, 55, admitted: 'It doesn't look real good for them. I'm just facing reality.' Authorities planned to resume the search of the lake this morning with the helicopter and boats and ATVs along the marshy shores. Lt Hudson said Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and Seminole deputies also may enlist the help of the U.S. Coast Guard. Family members said the two missing men had attended a bachelor party before heading out on the lake after midnight on Saturday. The group launched Mr Jackson's 15ft Bass Tracker boat from the marina at Black Hammock Adventures in Seminole County about 1am, said Joy Hill, an FWC spokeswoman. Friends and family of two missing boaters look on as Lt Jeff Hudson gives an update on the search for them at the Black Hammock Fish Camp and Restaurant in Oviedo, Florida . The boat was found Saturday afternoon undamaged and with the keys in the ignition in cattails less than a mile north of the fish camp, near Bird Island. Two life jackets, two paddles, eight unopened beer cans and one partly empty can of beer were on the boat, Ms Hill said. 'It appears they may have been ejected from the vessel,' Hill said in a statement. Lt Hudson said Sunday's search concentrated on the wooded northwest shoreline near where a family friend found the fishing boat in a 'weeded area' He also said the family was briefed about the search efforts, which could transition into a recovery mission. Lt Hudson confirmed that Mr Cobb and Mr Jackson attended a gathering at the Black Hammock fishing camp prior to setting off on the water. The camp is a popular tourist attraction and private boat ramp for locals in a rural section of Seminole County. It includes a full bar, restaurant, wildlife exhibit and offers air boat tours. Lt Hudson would not say if the two men had been drinking.

Legal brief: John McCririck, 72,  is to sue Channel 4 for £3million over claims he was sacked because of his age . John McCririck has launched legal proceedings against Channel 4 seeking damages totalling £3million after his axing from the station’s new racing output. McCririck, who was arguably the best known face on C4 racing with appeal reaching far beyond the normal boundaries of the sport, was one of several familiar faces not retained when C4 changed the company producing their racing output from Highflyer to IMG Sports Media. Others who lost out included John Francome, Alastair Down, Derek Thompson and Mike Cattermole. But the 72-year-old, who became famous for reporting from the betting ring in his own unique style, has taken his removal hard, alleging the decision announced in October was ageist and that he has suffered public humiliation. In a statement, McCririck, whose appearances outside the racing world have included Celebrity Big Brother and Wife Swap, said: ‘Channel 4 and production company IMG Sports Media were yesterday each served a letter before action for age discrimination. ‘After 29 years with Channel 4 Racing, on a rolling annual contract, I have been sacked without any consultation or cogent explanation. I am 72. Fresh look: Clare Balding, pictured at Epsom race course, and Racing UK analyst Graham Cunningham (right) are part of Channel 4 Racing's revamped line-up .

This litigation should prove to be a watershed. ‘There's no upper limit to the amount of damages employment tribunals can award under the Equality Act 2010. ‘I am seeking a further exemplary, . punitive £2.5m, part of which will be donated to charitable . organisations helping to prevent negative prejudice in the workplace.’ McCririck said he was being represented on a no-win no-fee basis by . employment and sports law specialist solicitor Stephen Beverley, of the . London West End Cavendish Legal Group. He said his solicitor had . served papers on the executives he says are responsible for his sacking . He alleged they are Channel 4's chief executive David Abraham, . the broadcaster's creative officer Jay Hunt, sports editor Jamie . Aitchison and Carl Hicks, executive producer of IMG Sports Media.

Australian-born Mrs Davies claimed: . 'The status of the hotel had risen almost dramatically as a result of . her energy, enterprise and marketing skills.' She claimed she worked up to 17 hours a . day transforming the 60 bed hotel and was entitled to a 'fair share' of . the family assets.

Hundreds of President Obama supporters were today left frustrated and disappointed after a computer glitch denied them any chance of attending the inaugural ball that was open to the public. Tickets for the black tie event at Washington Convention Center on January 21 were scheduled to go on sale on Monday morning. Then a technical mistake by distributor Ticketmaster meant that all available entries were snapped up on Sunday night, before they were even meant to be on sale. Guilty conscience: Ticketmaster emailed some customers to say that they had 'inadvertently' put ball tickets on sale a day early . Ticketmaster emailed everyone who had registered an interest on Sunday, telling them that at some point on Monday they would receive a unique link. This would allow them to enter the 'first-come, first served' contest to buy a maximum of two tickets at $60 each. On Sunday night, however, Ticketmaster mistakenly sent out the link to the purchase page and began selling tickets. Ticketmaster later sent a follow-up email confessing to the problem. 'During testing of our email system tonight, you may have inadvertently received an invitation to purchase tickets for 2013 Inauguration events, including the Inaugural Ball or the Inaugural Parade,' read the message. What you could have won: President Obama and the First Lady dance at an inaugural ball in 2009 . 'Public tickets to these events were originally scheduled to go on sale tomorrow morning - you received the email tonight in error, and Ticketmaster takes responsibility for this mistake.' The note continued: 'A significant number of public tickets were purchased this evening, despite the early email. Ticketmaster will be in touch with any additional information.' Then came the crunch: 'All tickets are first-come, first-served including those sold tonight. There is no guarantee that you will be able to purchase a ticket at any time.' Customers that tried to login at this point were shown a count of zero tickets on the system. And those who tried to buy tickets in the morning were told that they were no longer available. Some registered customers got all the emails, some received a mixture, while others got nothing at all. Many were left frustrated by the episode, feeling cheated that they hadn't had a fair chance of purchasing tickets. Feeling cheated? The message users got when they signed in on the day tickets were supposed to be put on sale . June M. Jeffries, a retired assistant U.S. attorney, told the Washington Post: 'I stayed up four hours doing this.' She . added that Ticketmaster and the Presidential Inaugural Committee should . void the all sales and start again to ensure a fair process. The request to start again was echoed many times on the  Presidential Inaugural Committee Facebook page, where hundreds of users vented their frustration. Many . people were angry with the circumstances and a perceived lack of . official recognition. Other users expressed annoyance with Ticketmaster . and doubts that the company should ever have been trusted with the ball . tickets in the first place.

The Middletons have bought the right to sell merchandise based on Channel 4's Come Dine With Me . They may enjoy luncheons with the Queen at Windsor Castle. But that hasn’t stopped Carole and Michael Middleton going to the other end of the catering spectrum. The parents of the Duchess of Cambridge have bought the rights to sell merchandise based on Channel 4’s Come Dine With Me. They are selling a range of paper plates, place cards and menus based on the programme, in which contestants from different walks of life compete to host the most successful dinner party. And it seems the Middletons, who are selling the products through their Party Pieces website, have learnt lessons from previously using company logos without permission. The company, which Mrs Middleton started from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table, had a dispute with Britain’s Got Talent after using the ITV talent show’s logo on the site without permission. On another occasion it fell foul of strict advertising laws covering the London Olympics. It also rowed with James Bond film producers Eon Productions after using the logo for the latest 007 film Skyfall. The Come Dine With Me range offers a ‘showdown pack’ priced at £8.99 with menu scrolls and paddles to score each meal. Other offerings are place cards and badges (£3.99) with such witticisms as ‘lamb lover’ and ‘pesky-tarian’. The Middletons’ younger daughter Pippa has promoted the products in the online magazine Party Times. The company says on its website: ‘If you’ve watched Come Dine With Me and thought “I can do better”, team our kits with our stylish tableware and your dinner party will be sure to receive 10s  all round. ‘Bring out this sophisticated party range for special occasions that require the wow factor. We want  you to feel the sense of pulling  out Grandma’s finest gold-plated china for a special party – without the need to worry about chipping the china!’ 'Sophisticated' party range: The Come Dine With Me range offers 12 paper plates with garish gold decorations on sale for £4.49 . Other offerings include table games (pictured) as well as place cards and badges . And the ‘sophisticated’ party range? Twelve paper plates with garish gold decorations on sale  for £4.49. Although accounts for the company are not publicly available, it is clearly a success for the Middletons who put their three children through private school and recently bought a £4.7million country home. However the website, set up by Mrs Middleton in 1987, has previously landed the family in hot water. Many of their products have left them open to accusations that they are cashing in on the royal association with their daughter and son-in-law Prince William. Only weeks after Kate announced she was expecting her first child, baby products were launched with ‘Little Prince’ and ‘Little Princess’ titles. The party packs were described as suitable for American-style baby showers, christening parties or first birthday celebrations. The company previously offered paraphernalia themed around the royal wedding and the Diamond Jubilee. Its street party items included state carriage-shaped cardboard teapot vases, coat of arms cups printed with ‘Long Live G&T’, and flags featuring crown-wearing corgis. The chain posted a 15 per cent jump in turnover to £94.1million in the year to July 28. LK Bennett, which was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990 and  now has 51 standalone shops in the UK, said underlying earnings jumped 37 per cent to £11million in the period. The group last week unveiled Bond girl Rosamund Pike as the face of its spring and summer collection in 2013, saying she was chosen for her ‘English rose charm’.","Seems Middletons have learnt lessons from using logos without permission .

Steve Wright's weekly BBC 2 programme has been ruled to have breached the corporation's guidelines . It is the gentle Sunday morning radio show that encourages its listeners to phone in with heartfelt dedications for their loved ones. But fans of Steve Wright’s weekly BBC 2 programme were surprised to discover their romantic messages were not getting through…because it was pre-recorded. Sunday Love Songs has been ruled to have breached the corporation’s guidelines by failing to explain music requests made during the show would not be broadcast the same day. The audience was told to phone in ‘any time’ with romantic song choices and messages, without an explanation the show’s script was finalised three days earlier. It meant some listeners wasted time and money on calls when their requests had already missed the cut off point. They also spent time listening for their messages when there was no chance they would be included on the show, broadcast between 9am and 11am every Sunday. The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee said the failure to inform listeners properly breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience. It upheld a complaint by a listener who only discovered the show was not live when it was announced a reference to entertainer Andy Williams had been recorded before his death. The show is recorded on Fridays, but the playlist and script are decided each Thursday, meaning requests made after that point could not be considered for the next show. An answerphone message to callers only made this clear after they had already left a request. The BBC amended the on-air and phone messages to make it clear dedications would be considered for future programmes rather than the one being broadcast at the time of the call. The BBC Trust has upheld a listener complaint ruling the show breached Corporation guidelines . But the committee ruled the updated message still breached accuracy guidelines because it was not made clear requests would have to be made before the Thursday deadline to be included in the Sunday show. The committee found the fact the show was presented ‘as live’ despite being pre-recorded was not a breach of editorial guidelines. It added the BBC did not intentionally mislead its audience, saying: ‘the problem was essentially one of clarity.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘In light of the Trust’s findings on clarity for people leaving dedications for the programme, we have revised the wording in order to ensure the process is absolutely clear for listeners.’ Steve Wright is best known for presenting Radio 1’s Steve Wright in the Afternoon The veteran DJ, 58, moved to Radio 2 in 1996.",The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee said the show breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience .

Angry: Top food writer and broadcaster Ruth Watson has launched a legal challenge after inspectors gave her hotel The Crown and Castle just one star out of five for food hygiene . As a top food writer and broadcaster, Ruth Watson is used to giving advice to struggling hoteliers desperate to revive their fortunes. But it seems the 62-year-old could do with some advice of her own after her rural hotel restaurant received a damning critique. The former star of The Hotel Inspector on . Channel 5 has been left furious after The Crown and Castle in Orford, Suffolk, was . given just one star out of five for food hygiene. It means 'major improvement necessary' and has prompted Mrs Watson, who co-owns the hotel with her husband David, to begin the process to get a judicial review of the decision. She presented three series of The Hotel Inspector giving tips and advice to struggling hoteliers in a bid to turn their fortunes around. Suffolk Coastal District Council, which carried out the inspection on November 26, said that as a result of the rock-bottom rating certain dishes were removed from the menu. Changes were also made to the layout of the kitchen and how food was handled. Mrs Watson, who used to run the Fox and Goose in Fressingfield, and Hintlesham Hall, said in a statement: 'We strongly disagree with the score we have received from the environmental health officer for Suffolk Coastal District Council, removing our previous maximum score under the scheme. 'To validate our view we have taken independent advice from one of the UK's leading food safety experts. 'He has carried out his own assessment of the EHO's report and firmly believes that it neither follows, nor accurately reflects, Food Standard Agency guidelines.' She added: 'As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry for nearly 30 years, I fully accept there is always room for minor improvements. Criticism: The former star of The Hotel Inspector on Channel 5 hit out after The Crown and Castle in Orford, Suffolk, pictured, was given the devastating rating . Critic: Ruth Watson is pictured during an episode of Hotel Rescue . 'However, part of the problem appears to be that the boundary between taking food safety very seriously, as we always do, and being allowed to cook top quality local ingredients in the way our customers want, is being irrevocably blurred. 'We have made every effort to resolve our dispute with the food safety team as swiftly and amicably as possible, but remain unable to agree with their approach, and so we have commenced the first stage of a judicial review action to allow a court to determine the fairness of the inspection and the rating.' Poor: This image shows the food hygiene rating given to the Crown and Castle Hotel in November . A council spokesman, referring to the Orford inspection, said: 'The appeal against the rating considered fully the independent advice sought by the Crown and Castle. 'Our decision to confirm the rating was based firmly on the national guidelines set by the Food Standards Agency and we also took independent advice. 'We believe that our decision was a correct one and will defend it strongly if it is legally challenged.' The . 21-bedroom Crown and Castle, which is co-owned by the Watsons and Tim . Sunderland, calls itself more of a 'restaurant with rooms' than a . hotel. The venue says its restaurant, called the Trinity, is a lively bistro serving 'decent, unpretentious food'. The . controversy in Orford comes after the historic Angel Hotel in Bury St .

'He knows where the lights are in the cab, can turn the hose on and off and knows the difference between the fire, police and ambulance sirens. 'He also knows the call signs for the engines. 'He's even gone to watch training where the firefighters rescued someone out of a burning car. That was amazing. 'After he's been at the station after school he comes home and tells me what he's done then makes me salute him.'

The Boss: Lewis has a range of different coloured helmets but his favourite in the white one . Salute: Lewis Dudson (left) loves Fireman Sam (right) so much he wants to be a firefighter when he grows up . 'He always says, ""when I'm a fireman I will rescue people.' He knows the dangers because he always tells me to pull the plugs out of their sockets and turn off the switches.' Lewis has a collection of fire trucks which he loves to play with but because he is getting a bit older he now has London Burning DVDs from old second hand shops and he loves Chicago Fire and Real Rescue. 'Every time he hears a fire engine going by he runs out of the house to see it,' his mother said. She added: 'They all look after him at the station. They really take the time to show him what to do.

A restaurant worker was responsible for strangling a teenage girl and dumping her body 12 years ago, a jury heard today. Shahidul Ahmed, 41, murdered shop assistant Rachel Manning, 18, after she made a late night call from a public phone box in Milton Keynes, then drove her body to a golf course where he left it in the undergrowth, it is alleged. After killing her he disfigured her face with a car steering lock, it is claimed. Today, Ahmed, of Bletchley, . Buckinghamshire, went on trial for the murder, which was alleged to have . happened on Sunday December 10, 2000. The Bangladesh-born defendant denies . the charge. Russell Gumpert, prosecuting, said DNA found on the steering . lock matched the accused's. The lock was discovered by the road . 'on the direct route between the spot where the body was hidden and . Shahidul Ahmed's home in Bletchley'. Luton Crown Court also heard Ahmed sold his . car eight days after Miss Manning, who had been to a fancy dress party . then a nightclub, was murdered. The jury of seven women and five men . heard that Ahmed came to police attention in May 2010 when he was . arrested for an unrelated matter. It was at this point officers matched . his DNA to the unsolved murder, the jury was told. Mr Gumpert said the . victim was strangled with a soft ligature. 'Her body was deposited in the . undergrowth at Woburn Golf Club about eight miles from the centre of . Milton Keynes,' said the barrister. 'The prosecution case is that she was . murdered by Shahidul Ahmed and that he attacked her close to a telephone . box in Milton Keynes from which she had just made a call, before . driving her body to the golf club and disposing of it. 'There is no evidence which points to . any particular motive, although it seems likely that the impulse to . attack her would have been a sexual one. 'Whether he always intended to kill her, or only did so because she was not willing to comply with his demands is unknown.' Bangladesh-born Shahidul Ahmed, 41, is on trial at Luton Crown Court for murder . Miss Manning's boyfriend Barri White was convicted of her murder in 2002. His conviction was later quashed on appeal and he was acquitted at a retrial in 2008. Miss Manning had been to a 70s' theme party with Mr White and her friends on Saturday December 9, 2000. They went on to Chicago's nightclub and left at about 2.15am, with Mr White walking to stay at a friend, Keith Hyatt's, home. Miss Manning walked off alone, to catch a taxi. She phoned her home in Wolverton from the phone box at 2.43am and spoke to her flatmate to say she was upset. The flatmate, Chris Gardiner, phoned her back but the call failed. She then phoned Mr White and said she did not know where she was. The pair, who had been drinking, agreed to meet at a Blockbuster video store and he and Mr Hyatt would pick her up. When they arrived at 3.13am in Mr Hyatt's white van she was not there. The prosecutor said it was likely that she was already dead. Mr White went out again later on foot and called to see her at work the next day. When he heard she had not shown up he alerted the police.","Shahidul Ahmed, 41, accused of murdering Rachel Manning, 18 .

Tory MP Christopher Chope sparked a furious response from Labour for the way he described staff in Parliament . A Conservative MP was lambasted for being ‘out of touch’ when he described catering staff in the House of Commons as ‘servants’. Christopher Chope, the MP for Christchurch in Dorset, also called for the food prices in the lavish dining rooms of the House of Commons to be reduced to make them more affordable for MPs. The former barrister was trying to illustrate how few MPs were dining in exclusive restaurants next to him last week. Describing one particular lunch, he said: ‘The service was absolutely fantastic because there was three-to-one service: . 'Three servants for each person sitting down.' Labour MPs immediately pounced on his use of the word, shouting out the word ‘servants!’ in disbelief. But Mr Chope replied ‘exactly’ and carried on making the case for lower prices. Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow Leader of the Commons, immediately took to Twitter to admonish Mr Chope: ‘Tory MP Christopher Chope lets the cat out of the bag by referring to HoC waiters and waitresses as 'servants!'’ Labour whip Jonathan Ashworth also expressed disbelief, saying: ‘Good grief - a Tory MP in the Commons has just described the catering staff who work in the Commons dining rooms as 'servants'.’ Steve McCabe, a Labour MP, said: ‘It’s an outrageous slur on the hard-working staff in the House of Commons. It reveals how out of touch both he and the Tory party are if they think they can call people who work for them servants.’ Mr Chope said the cost of dining should be cut for MPs to encourage them to eat on the parliamentary estate . Within the confines of Westminster Christopher Chope is well known for one thing - his deep loathing of the European Union. The son of a judge, he was born in Putney in 1947, attending Marlborough College before studying for a law degree at St Andrews University. He was called to the bar in 1972 and elected as an MP 11 years later in Southampton Itchen. A junior minister for environment and transport in the Thatcher and Major governments, he lost his seat in the 1992 election. Returning to Parliament as MP for Christchurch, William Hague gave him a frontbench job but he left the shadow cabinet in 2005. An arch-Thatcherite and climate sceptic, he called for the minimum wage to be abolished in 2009. He sparked controversy last year when he made a last minute objection to a debate on the Hillsborough disaster, claiming a debate on MPs' was more important. A rebel, he once ridiculed George Osborne claiming plans for plain cigarette packaging will make it easier for the Treasury to work out policies 'on the back of a fag packet'. However Mr Chope – who once backed legislation to abolish the national minimum wage – was unrepentant. He told MailOnline he had not meant anything ‘derogatory’ with the use of the term ‘servants’. ‘Everyone who works in the House is a servant of the House of Commons. It certainly has been that way for the last 25 years,’ Mr Chope said. Asked if this applied to MPs, he said: ‘No, we are servants of the government – that’s a joke.’ Mr Chope said: ‘I was actually complimenting the people concerned.’ He added: ‘I was asking whether pricing mechanisms can be used to ensure we increase the use of the House of Commons dining rooms. When I was dining last week, one one occasion there were three people serving for every one person dining. ‘It is good for the Members but not very good for the [House of Commons] finances.’ Mr Chope confirmed that he did not have servants at home, saying: ‘My wife and I do not have any staff.’ However, if the authorities caved to his demands for lower prices, it would lead to a higher taxpayer subsidy. David Cameron pledged to raise the prices in the Palace of Westminster to stop taxpayers having to subsidise the food bills of £66,000-a-year MPs.","Christchurch MP Christopher Chope criticised for labelling catering staff .

Hundreds of Peugeot Citroen workers today occupied a French factory scheduled to be sold off, largely shutting down production in a protest against planned layoffs at the struggling automaker, union and company officials said. The Aulnay plant near Paris has been at the centre of a battle over the future of France's largest automaker. The CGT union said 300 workers stopped all production at the plant, while the company said around 230 were on strike - though many were also absent - and that very little work was being done. Hundreds of Peugeot Citroen workers today occupied its French factory (above) at Aulnay-Sous-Bois, outside Paris, largely shutting down production in a protest against planned layoffs at the struggling automaker . That's a small percentage of the 3,000 people employed at Aulnay, but the union said they were able to 'paralyze' the factory because most of the striking employees work in production. Anne-Laure Descleves, a spokeswoman for Peugeot, said the unions stage a strike once a month and the current one was only slightly worse than others. France's largest automaker announced last year that it planned to cut 8,000 jobs and close Aulnay as it struggles to compete in Europe's stagnant car market. The company reported a 819 million euro ($990 million) loss in the first half of 2012; it will announce its full-year results next month. Despite the vast numbers of unsold cars and idle production lines in the European car industry, the government said Peugeot's plan was unacceptable. It found a company - IG Logistics - to take over the Aulnay plant, but only with a reduced workforce of 600. Workers demonstrate outside the headquarters of PSA Peugeot Citroen in Paris last year after it France's largest automaker announced last year that it planned to cut 8,000 jobs and close the Aulnay plant . The state also offered Peugeot a lifeline loan of (euro) 7 billion ($9 billion), in exchange for having a say in its decisions. The action at Aulnay comes a day before Peugeot and unions are to sit down again to discuss layoffs at the plant. 'Employees at PSA Aulnay refuse to accept being laid off without anything. The false negotiations begun in November give absolutely nothing at all, the management is refusing to address the demands of the employees,' a statement from the CGT said. 'The striking workers demand that management restart the negotiations from the beginning."" Peugeot and unions are locked in discussions over how many jobs will be cut and what deal laid off workers will receive. Unions are pushing for early retirement incentives for those over 55.

A high school in Massachusetts is planning to tackle underage binge drinking at dances by breathalyzing students at the door. Belmont High School will test pupils for alcohol consumption before every school dance, perhaps as soon as the next event on February 9. The school has experienced problems with drinking before, such as an event in 2005 where 12 students were suspended, but it is now taking a direct approach. Testing times: Belmont High is planning to breathalyze students at the door to school dances . Dr. Thomas Kingston, the school's interim superintendent, told Boston.com, that: 'There have been problems in the past, as in most suburbs – students who binge in the parking lot and come in looking perfectly normal, but half an hour later, blotto.' 'We even had one incident where a student threw up on the shoes of the principal’s wife,' Kingston added. The superintendent told Myfoxboston.com that Belmont police officers will meet students at the entrance to the prom with breathalysers. But Kingston also says that the planning for the new regime is still at an early stage and it is not yet decided if the school will test every student, or just the ones that seem intoxicated. Secret binge drinking is problem at many high schools . The school is currently working with police and the local attorney's office to plan the new measures, while the school committee will have the final say. 'I’m not holding to a particular schedule,' Kingston told Boston.com. 'It depends on how confident we are that it is appropriate, and whether civil liberties are protected, and we’ve exercised due diligence.' During a Hawaiian-themed 'Luau' dance . in 2005, a number of severely intoxicated students were taken to local . hospitals due to alcohol poisoning. The event was cancelled and 12 students were suspended. Since . then Belmont High has tried a number of measures to crack down on . drunkenness at school functions. At a 2005 Luau-themed dance at Belmont High School numerous students were taken to hospital for intoxication and 12 were suspended . The school has vastly reduced the . number and the length of official dances. And in 2008 Belmont introduced . a 'promenade' event before attendees went to the prom. During the promenade, students are . made to walk down the aisle of the auditorium with their dates in front . of the whole school community, as well as family and friends. But it seems that students are still turning up drunk at dances and the school has now called in breathalyzers and the police for assistance.

A 10-year-old boy was today hailed Britain's most dedicated Cub Scout - after earning all 54 badges in just two years. Tristan Gee has achieved one new badge every two weeks since he joined his troop in 2010 and has so many he almost ran out of space on his cub jumper. The schoolboy joined just a handful of other cubs in Britain to complete every badge and was awarded his last one - map reading - on his final ever meeting before joining the Scouts this week. He first joined Romsley Cub Scouts, in his home town of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, when he was eight and set himself the challenge of earning every badge. He had to work almost every school night and weekend to achieve his goal. On Sunday, Tristan was presented with a special neckerchief and the Chief Scout's Silver Award - the highest award available to cubs - in honour of his remarkable achievements. Tristan said: 'It was phenomenal to do it really. I'm amazed that I've done this. 'Martial arts was the hardest because I don't like it much. Ice skating was another hard one. 'My friends and other Cubs think it's amazing too. I think I will try and do all the Scout badges now.' Tristan's diverse range of badges include those for map reading, DIY, martial arts, cycling, music, IT, swimming and horse riding. He has completed all 33 activity badges, all seven challenge badges and has 13 stage badges from the six categories. The 10-year-old almost lost out on his . dream when he struggled to perfect ice skating - falling more than 20 . times on his first lesson. Tristan's mother Kathryn (pictured left) said she was 'proud' he earned all the badges (pictured right) But after hours of practice he passed with flying colours, achieving a level three when he only needed a level one. His mother Kathryn said Tristan's father Paul, 43, and his sister Felicity, nine, were proud of him and he deserved the award. The 40-year-old personal assistant said: 'Tristan has been a cub since he was eight and it has taken the whole of cubs to complete the badges. 'He decided when he went there to try . and do it because he likes to achieve, he's quite a high achiever and it . was something to keep him motivated. Tae-Kwondo was one of the more difficult challenges for Tristan (pictured with his sister Felicity) Air activities was one of the 54 badges achieved by Tristan (pictured with his sister Felicity) 'He was really focused and he was doing it every night and weekend after his school homework. 'It is a very difficult thing to achieve, due to the range of badges that are available. 'The ones that have been the most difficult are the sport ones because he had to learn them. 'Things like martial arts and ice skating have taken a lot of commitment. He couldn't stand up when he started ice skating but now he can do it.

Thousands of cancer patients could lose out when the Government’s special drugs fund for England is wound up next year, claim doctors. Four out of five specialists say access to cancer medicines will revert to being the worst in Europe, with more than 16,000 patients a year being denied help. A survey found they have been able to prescribe up to 35 extra drugs as a result of the fund. Cancer charities are calling for the Government to pledge it will not go back to the ‘dark days’ – depriving patients of life-prolonging drugs on the NHS – by confirming the fund will continue beyond March 2014. A survey of 200 English oncologists found 82 per cent feel the end of the Cancer Drugs Fund will mean access to cancer medicines in England will be worse than the rest of Europe. Posed by models . The £200million-a-year fund, which began in April 2011, has led to 25,000 patients in England gaining access to drugs ruled out  on the NHS by rationing body Nice. They are five times more likely to be given a new drug than patients in Wales and three times more likely than Scottish patients. The Government’s aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. But it was a temporary stop-gap for three years, until a new method of assessment for drug pricing is brought in next year. However, MPs on the health select committee complained there was no certainty about the future for drug pricing – or the Cancer Drugs Fund. Commissioned by cancer drug manufacturer Roche, the survey found oncologists gained access to 35 additional drugs as a result of the fund . A survey of 200 English oncologists found 82 per cent feel the end of the CDF will mean access to cancer medicines in England will be worse than the rest of Europe. Three quarters are calling for future funding to ensure patients do not lose out. The survey found oncologists gained access to 35 additional drugs as a result of the fund. Commissioned by cancer drug  manufacturer Roche, the survey was carried out independently by research firm Adelphi. Almost two thirds of cancer treatments considered by Nice (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) are rejected. It is estimated that ending the CDF will deny more than 16,000 patients annually from receiving potentially life-extending drugs. Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, insisted the fund had been highly successful. He said: ‘There is evidence that patients getting drugs this way are still alive today who might not have been, and it appears not to have increased the cancer drugs bill. ‘The CDF has provided many of these patients with access to treatment options that were not previously available to them . ‘There is a risk that access to treatment will go backwards, returning us to the dark days of cancer drugs being denied to the patients who need them.’ Health minister Lord Howe said: ‘We will ensure arrangements are in place to protect individual patients who are receiving treatment with drugs funded by the Cancer Drugs Fund as the end of the fund approaches.’","Cancer charities call for Government to pledge that fund will continue beyond March 2014 .

But it is not their laughter, glamorous outfits and full-on make-up that alerts patrons to the entrance of Gladys, Linda, Kira, Carla, Liz and Tanya. It is the fact that all of them have been – or still are – men who prefer to be women. Girls just want to have fun: Kira, Linda, Gladys, Carla and Liz never fail to turn heads during their nights out . In an often intolerant world, the Buchlyvie Inn has become their haven. Antiques dealer Gladys Paterson, 76, who used to be Jim Robertson, is the ‘leader of the pack’. She and her friends visit the pub in the Stirlingshire village once a month. In 2004, Jim shocked his neighbours in Buchlyvie (population 586) when he went on holiday – and came back as Gladys, after becoming the oldest Briton to have sex change surgery. Her friends are all at various stages on the transgender trail. Linda Kelly, 48, was born John Kelly in Possilpark, Glasgow.

She underwent surgery seven years ago, but prefers not to reveal her male identity. Postie Carla Sandilands, 40, grew up in Renfrewshire as Craig and became Carla in 2008. Retired schoolteacher Liz Brown, 65, still ‘lives in the closet’ and will not give her male name. She revealed she has health issues which preclude her from physically becoming a woman. But she added: ‘In my head and in my heart, I am a female.’ Previous life: Craig Sandilands, left and  Jim Robertson, right . Tanya is the only member of the group who does not want to share any of her past. She said: ‘I’m a private person, but I am a woman and I’m happy.’ Gladys’ story is typical of all her friends, who find comfort in each other’s company. She said: ‘For years I wanted to shed the trappings of being a man – get rid of male clothes and everything else that reminded me that for more than 60 years I hadn’t been able to live as I wanted.’ When Jim Robertson was widowed, he spent a year on hormone therapy treatment and then had the operation. Gladys said: ‘If this opportunity had been denied me, I would have ended up in a psychiatric hospital. Relax: In an often intolerant world, the Buchlyvie Inn has become their haven . 'To me, the procedure was as vital as the heart surgery which had earlier saved my life. ‘Gladys is who I wanted to be since I was seven years old. I just didn’t think it would take 62 years. I’ve finally been able to live the life I believe I was supposed to lead – and I’ve never been happier.’ It is the reason why Gladys likes to support her friends, as she knows what they are going through. She added: ‘I try to be around for them when they’re having a hard time. We support each other.’ The nights out in the pub are very much part of that support. Gladys said: ‘The community and the pub is a hub of friendship.’ Buchlyvie Inn landlady Sandra Podesta said: ‘The girls are good customers and everyone is happy to see them. ‘I have known Gladys since she was Jim.

"Zimmerman's legal team has received a copy of Martin's school records, documents which they said ‘could be relevant’ to the case . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 02:00 EST, 17 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:54 EST, 17 January 2013 . The legal team for George Zimmerman, accused of shooting and killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, has received a copy of the victim’s school records, documents which they said ‘could be relevant’ to the case. ‘We are entitled to receive the school records because some information in Martin's file could be relevant in the defense of George Zimmerman,’ the website for Zimmerman's legal defense stated Wednesday. While the records from Miami-Dade, Florida, schools have not been made available to the public, portions could be revealed later, Zimmerman's legal team said. Relevant info: The legal team for George Zimmerman, pictured, accused of shooting and killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, has received a copy of the victim's school records, documents which they said 'could be relevant' to the case . ‘We are entitled to receive the school records because some information in Martin's file could be relevant in the defense of George Zimmerman,’ the website for Zimmerman's legal defense stated Wednesday. (Zimmerman pictured left, Martin pictured right) ‘If any detail of the school records should be considered relevant in the course of a Self-Defense Immunity Hearing, only the parts deemed relevant to the case will be entered into evidence,’ the website stated. That hearing is expected to happen in April. State prosecutors and Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's parents, objected to releasing the records, saying they were irrelevant to the case, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Since Zimmerman did not know Martin before the shooting, the teen's past was not a factor in the case, Crump said. The shooting took place on the night of February 26, 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claims that Martin attacked him so he shot him once in the chest. Moments before the shooting, Zimmerman had called the Sanford Police Department to report that he had spotted a young man in his neighborhood and thought his behavior seemed suspicious. 'Not relevant': Since Zimmerman did not know Trayvon Martin before the shooting, the teen's past was not a factor in the case, State prosecutors and Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Trayvon's parents said . Police took Zimmerman in for questioning on the night he shot Martin and later released him with no charges. But as news of the shooting spread nationally over the next couple weeks, calls for Zimmerman to be arrested and charged grew. Then on March 13, just before the case was handed over the prosecutors, police made several changes to their final report on the shooting. Around 9:40 a.m., their 10-page case summary recommended a second-degree murder charge and four hours later, they downgraded that charge to manslaughter. They also added criticism of Zimmerman for assuming Martin was preparing to commit a crime. 'The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialogue in an effort to dispel each party's concern,' the report said. 'There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity at the time of the encounter.' Origin of the case: The shooting of Trayvon Martin took place on the night of February 26, 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claims that Martin attacked him so he shot him once in the chest . Around 2:30, another paragraph was added to the report that said a doctor's office had diagnosed Zimmerman with a fractured nose and scalp wound the day after the shooting. In the last version, issued around 2:23 p.m., police added a final addition to the now-13-page case summary that noted Zimmerman had called Sanford police four other times since August to complain about suspicious young black men in his neighborhood. Zimmerman was eventually charged with second-degree murder despite the police agency's downgrade to his recommended charges. But defense attorneys are hoping to use the changed reports to help their case as it goes to trial on June 10. Zimmerman is currently free on $1 million bail. On October 19 Circuit Judge Debra Nelson granted the order to release Martin's school records, saying that Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, was entitled to the information. O'Mara apologized for the request but said he owed it to his client to look into Martin's past. The defendant has maintained that he acted in self-defense, while prosecutors maintained  said Zimmerman profiled Martin, assuming he was about to commit a crime and began following him. Crump said in October that releasing the victim’s school records would be wrong and could damage his legacy. Zimmerman's legal team said the information would not ‘demonize’ the late teen. ‘A number of parties have expressed concern that we will use information found in the school records to ""demonize"" Martin,’ the website for Zimmerman's legal defense stated.

BBC spin doctors cooked up a plan to save their boss George Entwistle by dumping blame for the Jimmy Savile fiasco onto the Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, it emerged today. They decided that sacrificing Mr Rippon - and thereby providing ‘a scalp’ - was the ‘only way to protect’ the former director-general. The details emerged through text messages which were uncovered by former Sky News chief Nick Pollard who carried out a £2million investigation into the scandal. Plan: BBC spin doctors cooked up a plan to save their boss George Entwistle, left,  by dumping blame for the Savile fiasco on Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, right . It followed the decision by Newsnight to drop an investigation into decades of abuse carried out by Jimmy Savile. As the crisis engulfed the corporation, . the Newsnight editor’s fate was being mapped out in mobile phone texts . between BBC press office chiefs. One ‘eye-opening’ text message suggesting Mr Rippon should quit was sent on October 20, this year, from Julian Payne, the BBC’s head of press, to the director of communications Paul Mylrea. The text, which referred to an error-strewn blog written by Mr Rippon to explain why Newsnight had axed its Savile investigation, said: ‘Thought of the hour: PR (Peter Rippon) changes blog and accepts he was wrong and goes, giving Panorama a scalp. ‘GE (George Entwistle) then goes into Select (committee) saying he backed his editor as you would expect. ‘Turns out he was wrong but he did the right thing and we all move on??? Scandal: The BBC discovered damning evidence . that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile but a Newsnight investigation was . dropped suddenly . Two days later, after the blog correction had been made, another message was sent from Mr Payne to Mr Mylrea saying: ‘Think am going to need to brief hard today that PR blog was the basis for all our position on this. Only way to protect GE.’ Pollard said that, by this point, Rippon’s now notorious blog had been ‘regarded by some as a means of insulating the Director General from criticism.’ Pollards investigation also showed that the decision to drop Newsnight’s . report into Jimmy Savile’s decades long campaign of sexual abuse plunged . the BBC into 'chaos and confusion'. Pollard concluded that management 'proved . completely incapable of dealing' with the fallout. 'The decision by their editor (Peter Rippon) to drop the original investigation was . clearly flawed and the way it was taken was wrong, though I believe it . was done in good faith. It was not done to protect the Savile tribute . programme or for any other reason,' he said. Findings: The details about the plan to save George Entwistle emerged through text messages which were uncovered by former Sky News chief Nick Pollard, pictured, who carried out a £2million investigation into the scandal . To come to this conclusion he examined 10,000 emails and documents which shed light on the events. Sensationally he found George Entwistle was first . warned of ‘the real truth’ about Savile in May 2010, in an email from . BBC executive Nick Vaughan-Barratt - but crucially he failed to ask . further questions about it. Head of events Mr Vaughan Barratt told Entwistle: 'I understand Jimmy is very ill. We have no obit and I am not sure we would want one. What do you think. 'I . have a personal interest here: my first job was on a JS (Jimmy Savile) show — I know him well and saw the complex and sometimes conflicting . nature of the man at first hand — if you know what I mean! Do you have . an opinion?' He later said: 'I’d feel v queasy about an obit. I saw the real truth!!!' A later email sent on the day after Savile died in October . 2011 also warned Mr Entwistle about the pervert . entertainer – but the man who ran the corporation for 54 days this year claims he . never read it. Commissioning . Editor for Music and Events Jan Younghusband told Mr Entwistle: 'I . gather we didn’t prepare the obit because of the darker side of the . story. So something celebrating a particular part of his TV career is . probably better than the (life) story as there are aspects of this which . are hard to tell.' Instead Mr Entwistle decided there was no . need for a quick obituary and BBC1 controller Danny Cohen even suggested a . special Christmas edition of Jim""ll Fix It. BBC director general George Entwistle (left) was . forced to resign in November over issues surrounding the corporation's . handling of the Savile case . Speaking about the warnings Mr Pollard . said today: 'If he had read the email…it would have given Mr Entwistle some . pause for thought about the planned Christmas tributes.' Pollard was able to examine texts sent between BBC staff so he could get to the bottom of what happened. A separate . investigation has also revealed why Newsnight later ran a second . controversial report, which wrongly . linked former Tory party chairman Lord McAlpine to child abuse . allegations. It resulted . largely from a failure by members of the team to follow the BBC’s own . editorial guidelines, the BBC Trust said today. The . broadcast on November 2 was a 'grave breach which had been costly to . all concerned' and resulted in the public being misled, the Trust’s . Editorial Standards Committee (ESC) found. It also cost George Entwistle his job. The then director general has a . series of disastrous interviews on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 5Live and . admitted he did not see the Newsnight show, had missed all tweets linked . to it and also the Guardian front page from the day before. That evening he resigned and received a £450,000 pay-off for doing the 'honourable thing' after just 54 days in the job.","The text messages were uncovered by Nick Pollard who carried out an investigation into why Newsnight ditched investigation into Savile .

MPs who demanded pay rises of up to 32 per cent were today branded ‘potty’ by Nick Clegg. The Deputy Prime Minister said it ‘beggars belief’ that MPs surveyed by the Commons expenses watchdog had said they should be earning tens of thousands of pounds more. A survey last week revealed that 69 per cent believe they are ‘underpaid’ following the introduction of a new expenses regime that forces them to provide receipts for all claims. Nick Clegg said MPs were wrong to demand vast pay rises when public sector workers were seeing salaries increase by just one per cent . The studies were commissioned by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is reviewing whether MPs’ pay should be changed from its current level of £65,738. On average, Tories said their salary should be £96,740, while Lib Dems thought the right amount was £78,361 and Labour £77,322. Mr Clegg said: ‘It just beggars belief apparently that some MPs have anonymously said they deserve a pay increase.’ Challenged over MPs pay on his weekly radio phone-in, he added: ‘They are living on a different planet to think that you can say to teachers and nurses and doctors “you’re only going to get a one per cent increase in your pay for the next several years but we deserve a [32 per cent] increase”. ‘I think it’s potty and it’s not going to happen, certainly if I’ve got anything to do with it.’ YouGov conducted online interviews with 100 MPs on Ipsa's behalf, and weighted the results slightly to represent the Commons by party, gender, year elected, and geography. Conservatives were the most likely to believe they were underpaid, with 47 per cent saying that was the case. Some 39 per cent of Labour members and 9 per cent of Lib Dems held the same view. One MP said they should be paid £40,000 or less. Some 5 per cent said £60-65,000 was fair, and 17% went for £65-£70,000. It was Mr Clegg's second week as a talk show host, appearing alongside LBC presenter Nick Ferrari to answer questions from callers on LBC 97.3 . Mr Clegg said he hoped Ipsa would do ‘the sensible thing’ and restrain pay, . Taking aim at the MPs who used anonymity to demand bigger salaries, he added: ‘I flatly and totally disagree with it. I don’t know who put their names to this. ‘Whoever did needs to think again and also needs to think about what signal it sends out to the constituents of MPs who are being asked to have real restraint and limits on how fast their own pay increases.’ For more from Nick's weekly show on LBC click here .","Deputy PM uses radio phone-in to condemn calls for bigger salaries .

Mr Dodson, 60, established the Waen Wen Fishery near Bangor, North Wales, digging out the lakes and filling them with £250,000 worth of fish. But then the agency set up the otter haven a couple of miles away on the River Cegin. Mr Dodson said his business never quite got off the ground and he decided to sell some of his stock in 2008 – but found that he had none. Carnivorous: Fishery owner Brian Dodson claims otters have decimated the fish at his lakes (library image) Carnage: These skeletons are all that remain of carp eaten by otters at another fishery . ‘When I netted one lake that I thought had 8,500 carp in nothing came out,’ he said. ‘This has ruined me financially.’ He said he has been unable to sell the fishery and it has now been taken off him by his mortgage company. He claims that over a period of years his valuable fish were decimated by the carnivorous creatures, ruining his business before it had got off the ground, the 60-year-old claims. Mr Dodson said that had the Environment Agency told him of the probability of otters re-colonising the nearby river he could have taken protective steps, like putting up a protective fencing. He is suing the agency for breaching the Environment Act 1995, claiming it had a duty of care to consult landowners when planning the otter initiative. Mr Dodson is seeking £2.5 million to cover the loss of income he believes he would have recouped from anglers using his fishery. Bad for business: Mr Dodson said he is unable to sell his Waen Wen Fishery, which lies empty and out of use . Unwelcome visitors: Mr Dodson took this picture of an otter feeding ground at his North Wales fishery . The matter will go before the High Court next month in what could become a landmark case for fishery owners across the country who have had similar issues with otters. Buzzards were almost extinct 30 years ago but there are now nearly 40,000 in Britain. But it caused red faces at Defra, which wanted tighter controls on the species to protect pheasants but had to scrap the plans last year after a public outcry. In Australia, cane toads were successfully introduced in the 1930s. But they have been blamed for a sharp dip in other predatory reptiles ever since. They have also been accused of putting quolls in danger, with the native marsupial partial to the toad's toxic skin. Britons are still shocked when they see a wallaby hoping around. The animal - a common sight in Australia - was brought into the wild in the UK in 1930s and sightings continue today. A more recent success in the UK is the beaver, which was reintroduced from Europe more centuries after disappearing. Since then they have returned to nearly every corner of Britain. But critics say the scheme has been ill thought as there is not enough food in our waterways to sustain their booming numbers. As a result otters - which have no natural predator - are said to have been picking off big and cumbersome fish from fisheries and putting them in jeopardy. Mr Dodson's Waen Wen Fishery, near Bangor, in North Wales, has lain empty and out of use for several years now. He said: 'This has ruined me financially and left me devastated. I built a fishery from scratch, there was nothing there at all before. 'I got all of the planning permission and it took me a few years to dig out the six lakes and filled them up with carp. 'In all that time didn't know the Environment Agency were promoting a nature reserve on the nearby River Cegin. Nobody said a word to me about the otters. 'We then started hearing all these stories about otters being spotted no more than two miles away from us. 'In 2008 I set about trying to sell off some carp to and when I netted a lake that had 8,500 carp in nothing came out. 'I brought a consultant in and we drained the lake and it was empty. I later found evidence of fish bones that had been stripped of its flesh. 'My case is that under the Environment Act 1995, the Environment Agency had a duty to carry out some sort of notice or consultation with me before the work began to encourage otters into the area. Price of success: Otters are flourishing across Britain thanks to a programme of reintroducing them to the wild . 'This case could open the way for . other fishery owners in Britain who feel they have not been given . sufficient warning about the rising otter population.' Mr . Dodson spent 22 years working as a process control engineer at oil and . gas refineries in the Middle East and saved up to start up his fishery . business. Curig Jones, a spokesman for Environment Agency Wales, said: 'We are preparing to challenge this claim robustly on all counts.' The four-day hearing is set to take place at the High Court in Cardiff on February 25.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 13:15 EST, 27 December 2011 . Thousands of barmy Brits took to the beaches on Boxing Dayy for the balmiest Boxing Day for 28 years. Temperatures around the country were up in the teens with Fyvie Castle in Scotland reaching 15.5C in 1983. And the unseasonably mild weather continued today, with the average temperature hovering around 10C and 12C across the country. The record temperature for December 26 is 16C in Haddington, East Lothian, and the next highest 15.5C in Raunds, Northamptonshire. But yesterday, according to the Met Office, across most of the country the temperatures never fell below 8C or 9C. Forecaster George Goodfellow said: 'The . only places where it got higher were in the fells of Northern Ireland . and on high ground. It has been unseasonably warm both on Christmas Day . and Boxing Day.' Balmy or Barmy? This woman in Redcar appears to be feeling the temperature as she takes to the chilly waters . Five hundred fancy dress-clad Boxing Day revellers took part in the Tenby Boxing Day Swim in the cold seas off west Wales resort . The picturesque seaside resort of Tenby became a magnet for hardy revellers seeking to shake off Christmas Day excess with a brisk sea dip . Boxer Tony Jeffries (right) was out at the annual Boxing day dip at Seaburn Beach, Sunderland, and the annual Aberdeen Lions Nipper Dipper Boxing Day event (left) attracted a few hardy souls . The coldest urban area in the UK is believed to have been Aberdeen, where the mercury fell to a hardly chilly 8.5C. The heat will remain on until the weekend when a north east wind is expected to blow in with a chill factor. Mr Goodfellow said: 'We're expecting more unsettled weather come on New Year's Eve and parts of the country will get some rain.' Charlie Powell, of the Met Office, said the weather was well above average compared to last year, and made a stark contrast to the chills of December 2010. 'Last year the country had the coldest December on record, since we started recording the temperatures in 1910. 'In Scotland temperatures fell to -20C in some places, it was exceptionally cold, so this year has been markedly different.' More paddlers showed off their costumes at Seaburn Beach . Bathers take to the water at the North Beach in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, in the resort's 41st Boxing Day Swim . Mr Powell said tomorrow would bring a . strong wind, with strong gales possibly reaching 80 miles per hour in central . and western Scotland. But he said the mild weather would continue with only blustery showers in the west of England, and the temperature dropping to a tolerable 7C to 9C. The south and east of England should get away with a largely dry day. By Thursday and Friday he said showers would continue to pepper the day, but the temperature was predicted to only drop to about 6C at its lowest, with some showers gathering to be a persistent rain. Among the swimmers braving the Boxing Day water were those taking a . dip in fancy dress at events in Tenby and Pembrey in west Wales and . Seaburn Beach near Sunderland. But the weather wasn't so good in . Shetland where around 500 homes are still without power after hurricane . force winds hit the islands on Christmas Day. At the peak of the problems, Scottish . Hydro Electric Power Distribution said there were 5,500 homes without . electricity as gusts of more than 100mph were recorded on the islands . yesterday. The power . company said it has drafted in engineers from the mainland who are . continuing to work to restore supplies to the remaining homes. Hundreds of people in fancy dress also took a plunge at Pembrey Park, west Wales, for this year's Walrus Dip . Company spokeswoman Samantha O'Connor . said: 'There are around 500 still without power, but most of them are . due to the same issue and we hope to have that repaired by 11pm. 'Fifty homes will definitely not have . power restored tonight because of an overhead network problem but we . have contacted all of those affected by this to keep them updated. 'We would like to apologise to all of those affected by the interruption to the supplies in Shetland.' The company said engineers will work . until 11pm today and resume early tomorrow morning to restore power to . the remaining properties. Mainland Scotland also experienced high winds with gusts of 80mph-90mph yesterday. The . high winds also caused difficulties for a coastguard helicopter as it . evacuated a female patient from the island of Yell to the main island of . Shetland at around 2.30pm yesterday. The helicopter landed at Sumburgh Airport and the patient was transferred to hospital in Lerwick by ambulance. Shetland Coastguard said the winds were hurricane force yesterday.

Crushed: Gloria Sekwena, 47, died in a stampede yesterday as she tried to register her son for a place at the University of Johannesburg. She was a nurse who lived and worked in London . A mother who died in a stampede as she tried to register her son for a place at university in South Africa was a nurse who lived and worked in London, it emerged today. Gloria Sekwena, 47, travelled back from Britain to South Africa late last month to help secure her son Kgositsile, 18, a position on a medicine course at the University of Johannesburg. But she died yesterday after being crushed amid a frantic scrum caused when a crowd of around 5,000 people stampeded through the institution's gates. Two other people were critically . injured and at least 17 more needed medical attention following the . chaotic scenes yesterday morning. Today . University of Johannesburg spokesman Herman Esterhuisen confirmed . university officials had since made contact with the dead woman's . family. He said: 'We can confirm that the woman who sadly died was Gloria Sekwena, who worked as a nurse and lived in London. 'It is our understanding that she returned to South Africa at the end of December to help her son get a place at university. 'It is obviously very sad indeed that she became caught up in what happened yesterday.' Mr . Esterhuisen said University of Johannesburg leaders had arranged to . meet Mrs Sekwena's family later this week and had offered to pay her . teenage son's tuition fees if he decided to study at the institution. He added: 'We are in contact with the family and we are offering all the support we can. 'As part of that we have offered to pay for the boy's tuition.' It . was reported today that Mrs Sekwena lived in London with her husband . Joseph, who remained in Britain and was informed of the tragedy . yesterday. Scroll down for video of the stampede . Evasion tactics: Students clamber over fences in a desperate bid to escape the crush as thousands surge through the gates of the University of Johannesburg yesterday morning . Tragedy: The mother of one student hopeful was killed and at least 20 other people were seriously hurt . Frantic: Around 5,000 prospective students had lined up outside the institution in the desperate hope of securing the remaining places for the next academic year . The couple, from Krugersdorp west of Johannesburg, are believed to also have another school-age son. South . Africa's Sowetan newspaper reported that Mr Sekwena was now making . arrangements to return to Johannesburg to support his son. The . publication quoted an unnamed family member, who told how Kgositsile . became overwhelmed by grief after realising his mother had died. Help at hand: Paramedics treat an injured woman among discarded clothing, shoes and litter . Melee: Some students fall to the ground as others desperately try to make room for themselves amid the chaos . The Sowetan reported: 'A sobbing Kgositsile was consoled at the university's centre for psychological services where he had to be tranquillised by a nurse and attended to by a psychologist. 'An emotional family member said they received a frantic call from a 'confused' Kgositsile, who screamed: ""My mum is unconscious. I need help. Please come"". 'We immediately switched on the TV and heard that someone had died. We didn't know what to think. Keen learners: Aspiring students queued for hours in the hope of gaining a sought-after place for next year . Patient: Places are highly competitive, leading some critics to call for entrance criteria to be raised . 'I wasn't sure what was going on and the next minute he called again, crying, saying, ""My mother is no more"".' The relative added that the teenager later explained the final frantic moments of his mother's life. They said: 'He said people started pushing and shoving, and that chaos erupted when someone jumped the fence to get into the university. 'He said he fell to the side and his mother was still in the crowd, people were stepping on her and pushing her. She disappeared in the crowd. 'He was looking for his mother and when he found her she was unconscious already. He was crying. She died within minutes. 'He just said, ""I don't have a mother anymore"".' The Sowetan reported that Mrs Sekwana sustained no significant visible injuries during the stampede but died from internal bleeding and shock. Her son was taken to a Johannesburg mortuary yesterday to identify her body. The South African government has ordered a full enquiry into the tragedy, which happened around 7.30am yesterday. University officials told how around 5,000 people formed a deadly crush as they rushed to enter the campus. Security chiefs opened a gate after realising people at the front of the crowd could be in danger, but several people were trampled amid the resulting stampede. Johannesburg emergency services yesterday confirmed at least 20 people had been injured in the incident, including two who remained in serious conditions in hospital. The institution's vice-chancellor, . Ihron Rensburg, said the tragedy happened as hopeful students and their . parents pushed to get through the university's main gates for the chance . to secure late registration for the new academic year, which starts . later this month. Moving on up: Hundreds of thousands of students received the results of the country's school-leavers exams last week . Addressing . a press conference yesterday, he said: 'When we opened the gates this . morning, the rush to get in created an unbearable crush on those at the . front. 'The outcome was that there was a lady who was the front who was crushed and she passed away. 'Two other people suffered very serious injuries and we fear for their lives.' Speaking about Gloria . Sekwena's death, he said: 'The situation was particularly tragic as the . young man was inside the registration tent and had no idea that this . had happened. 'We are offering counselling and support to those who have been affected by this. Experts have said they believe the stampede reflected the desperation among many South Africans to access higher education. The country's university system is believed by many to be under-resourced, with most institutions significantly over-subscribed for courses. The lack of widespread internet . access and poor careers advice in rural or township areas means . thousands of prospective applicants are forced to turn up in person to . register their interest in further studies. Experts believe the problem is . symptomatic of a higher education system which has failed to expand . adequately to South Africans' growing demand for university places . following the end of apartheid. Before the advent of democracy in 1994, university places were limited largely to the white population and a tiny black elite. However, students from all backgrounds . are now able to apply for further studies, with many choosing to do so . in a country where poverty and unemployment remain common. Some critics argue that standards at . South African universities have fallen in recent years and suggest . entrance criteria should be raised. The University of Johannesburg describes itself as a 'comprehensive' institution which offers diplomas alongside degrees. Last year, it received more than 85,000 applications for fewer than 12,000 places on its undergraduate courses. The tragedy on its campus came as it offered an opportunity for high-achieving students who had not already registered to do so at the last minute.","Devastated teenage son cried 'I don't have a mother anymore' when he realised she was dead .

In the dock: An artist's drawing of Symieon Robinson-Pierre, during his appearance at Inner London Crown Court . A pitbull owner whose devil dog called ‘Poison’ savaged five police officers leaving a scene like ‘the sickbay at the Battle of Trafalgar’ has been jailed for nearly two years. Symieon Robinson-Pierre, 25, was sentenced to 22 months in prison for failing to act while his dog sunk its teeth into four police officers after they called at his house to execute a search warrant. As they entered the property the large brown pitbull-doberman cross - which was of a banned breed - began attacking officers in a 15 minute rampage that left three of them needing surgery. Robinson-Pierre ignored pleas to call his heavily built dog off the officers and said: 'It is not the dog’s fault, you should have knocked and I would have let you in.' Poison, which weighed four and a half stone, pounced on officers as they raided the house in Stratford, East London, in March last year, and clamped its jaws around one officer’s thigh. It tried to drag him to the ground as another officer repeatedly hit it on the head with a metal battering ram, to no effect. He eventually prised the animal’s jaws open with his baton but the dog turned on him instead grabbing hold of his right forearm. It went on to attack other police officer in the front garden and was only halted after being shot dead by a police marksman. Prosecutor Sam Brown told Inner London Crown Court: 'If you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of the event, imagine the sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar and that will give you an idea - carnage.' Robinson-Pierre was jailed for what Judge Mark Bishop called 'an astonishing act of inhumanity and callousness' after he turned his back on PC Lee Bush as he was attacked. Violence: The dog's blood splattered the road after police shot the frenzied pitbull, who had inflicted severe injuries on officers in a half-hour attack . The charges related to the dog attack on PC Marc Merritt, PC Lee Bush, PC Paul Garrard and PC Steve Bones. He was prosecuted for the initial attack on PC Martin Corderoy as it happened inside the house. Judge Bishop said: 'To state these offences so baldly does not do justice to the mayhem which this out of control dog brought to a London street. 'It was an extraordinary scene of carnage in a London street. 'What was particularly shocking and what aggravates this is that while the dog was attacking PC Bush not very far from your front door the evidence is that you and other man came to the front door. Extreme measures: The dog was killed with four blasts from a shotgun after inflicting hand, arm and leg wounds on five officers who were unable to restrain it . 'PC Bush was screaming for help, asking . you to get the dog off him and one of you said ""There’s nothing we can . do"" and the other said ""You should have knocked, I would have let you . in.""' Judge Bishop continued: 'You were one . of these two people. You and the other man went back inside the house. That was an astonishing act of inhumanity and callousness. 'The dog was out of control and you did nothing to call it off or calm it.' Robinson-Pierre, who wore a grey tracksuit top, kissed his teeth and glared angrily towards the judge as he was sent down. PC Duncan West was with colleague PC Steve Bones when they received the call to the address. The . traumatised police officer hailed PC Bones 'selfless bravery' as he . grabbed the dog by the back of its neck and pinned it to the floor. Victims (from l-r): PC's Marc Merritt, Lee Bush and Martin Corderon on their way to give evidence against Robinson-Pierre . Judge Bishop echoed his comments today, saying: 'PC West said what PC Bones did was a selfless act of bravery - I agree with that. 'What PC Bones did was to go up to the dog and hold it by the scruff of its neck. 'In the process his fingers were severely bitten and indeed he thought one of his fingers had been bitten off. 'In holding it down it was then possible for other officers to restrain the dog with their riot shields. Even with the officers using their riot shields the dog was still trying to get out and bite the police. 'It was only with the arrival of an armed officer that it was unfortunately dispatched.” The dog also attacked PC Marc Merritt’s arm and was 'literally hanging off' it as he swung around in an attempt to shake him off. PC Martin Corderoy was left permanently scarred after being rushed for surgery and was off work for 85 days. Judge Bishop also recalled the victim impact statements of PC Bush, who had to undergo plastic surgery and PC Bones 'who has had nightmares and anxiety' since the attack. The judge condemned Robinson-Pierre’s irresponsibility as he sentenced him, saying: 'Living as we do in close proximity to others there’s no excuse for allowing the owner of a dog to let it get out of control in a public place. 'The sentence I pass is outside the top bracket of the guidelines because I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that I should pass this sentence. 'The sentence I pass is one of 22 months concurrent in each of the three offences.' Robinson-Pierre, of Albert Square in Stratford, had earlier admitted to owning a fighting dog. He was also banned from keeping a dog for five years.","Symieon Robinson-Pierre sentenced to 22 months for failing to act when his dog sunk its teeth into officers .

A senior RAF officer who served as a personal aide to the Queen was knocked down and killed by a van driver as he cycled home, a court has heard. Group Captain Tom Barrett from Beaconsfield, Bucks, was hit by transit driver Paul Luker as he rode home along the A40 in March last year. Gp Capt Barrett was rushed to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, but later died from multiple injuries. Trial: Paul Luker, left, is accused of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving after Group Captain Tom Barrett was knocked down as he rode his bike on the A40 . The 44-year-old was Station Commander of RAF Northolt and had served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He had also been awarded an OBE. Harrow Crown Court heard that Gp Capt Barrett, a married father-of-two, was an avid cyclist and often used his journey home from the base as a training exercise for races. The jury was told that on March 10 last year he left shortly before 5pm and joined the inside lane of the A40. He had travelled less than a mile when he was hit by a transit van being driven by Luker, 51, of Farnham Royal, Bucks. Motorists who witnessed the crash described hearing a 'loud bang' and seeing a 'twisted wheel' flying through the air after the crash. Adina Ezekiel, prosecuting said: 'He was thrown off his bicycle and he landed on the roadside. 'His life was pronounced extinct later that day.' Miss Ezekiel added: 'He sometimes used his journey home as an opportunity for training and this was one such occasion. 'When he left work, he was wearing cycling gear, including a helmet, heart rate monitor and dark clothing. 'He joined the A40 at the Polish War Memorial and it is agreed evidence that Gp Capt Barrett cycled before the collision was about 0.8miles. 'The result of the impact is that Gp Capt Barrett was thrown forward, his feet were clipped into his bicycle so they remained attached.' The court heard that Luker told police at the roadside that he was 'dazzled' by the sun. Gp Capt Barrett died of multiple injuries at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, following the collision with the van . He said: 'I was on the inside lane, . the slow lane, and the sun was low at the time, my sight was pretty bad . but before I knew it, I had hit the cyclist.  'I tried to move out of . his way but it was too late. 'My wing clipped him, I tried to brake but by that time it was too late and I just saw him flying off his bike.' But Miss Ezekiel said that Mr Luker told police he didn't see the . cyclist at all. He had been dazzled by sunlight and was not aware that . he hit Gp Capt Barrett. 'The prosecution are not suggesting . that Mr Luker set out deliberately or maliciously to collide with Gp . Capt Barrett's bicycle. 'But the question is whether the driving was careless or inconsiderate. 'The prosecution say he should have adapted his driving style if the conditions were not better for him to see.' Motorist Rakhi Mangtani, who was driving behind Luker, told how she head a 'loud bang' and saw a wheel flying through the air over the top of her car, after the crash. 'The wheel was twisted and other bits of black debris were flying in the air, which I swerved to avoid,' she said. 'The driver didn't seem to stop immediately after the wheel flew over my car, it certainly wasn't an emergency stop. Ms Mantangi added she then ran towards the scene of the crash. 'I could see the cyclist lying on the pavement. He was lying far over to the left on the grass verge.' Luker, who was not arrested until April 1, denies causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. The trial continues.

"By . Chris Slack . UPDATED: . 04:02 EST, 6 February 2012 . A ten-year-old girl who was born with no kidneys and has endured 27 major operations is celebrating after having her final operation. Alice Skinner, from Hartlepool, was born with stumps for kidneys after they failed to develop in the womb. But after years of treatment, tests and surgery, she is now looking forward to her 11th birthday next month. Celebrating: Alice Skinner has finally had her last operation after enduring 27 in the past ten years after she was born without kidneys . Her final operation took place two weeks ago after  three years of dialysis affected her legs and caused them to become bowed. Her father George, 41, said: 'There were times when we thought she wouldn’t make it. 'We see each birthday as a milestone. We never thought we would see this far. She’s a proper grown-up little lady now too.' Alice's condition affects just one baby in a . million born in the UK and she came close to death many times. When she was six months old she became the youngest person in the UK to receive dialysis . Her family then made trips three times a week to  the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle for dialysis as she waited for a transplant . Alice just after she was diagnosed with malformed kidneys when she was only six-months-old . Both parents were unsuitable as donors and doctors were running out of veins to place her on dialysis. In April 2008, she finally had a transplant with an imperfect match as no perfect match could be found. That operation allowed her to make up for lost time by drinking Coca Cola, eating chocolate and crisps and all the other food that had previously been banned. However a year later she suffered a setback which saw her needing brain surgery after fluid build-up in her head. Her father added: 'The surgeons were really quite surprised she got through it and said, ""We don’t know how she’s still here"".' He continued: 'Being on dialysis for . seven years took its toll on her. It affected her calcium levels because . there was no absorption through kidneys, so her knees bowed out. 'That has just been corrected in an operation. She’s had two hinges put into both her knee caps to stretch them out. “It’s a big operation, but she was looking forward to getting it done. 'After the operation she had an . epidural for two days to make sure she had no pain and after that she . was put on morphine, but she was out of hospital within days, tottering . around the house on crutches. 'She’s had 27 operations in 10 years and that’s quite enough for anyone. Proud: Alice's father George has spoken of her battle and said there were time when he was worried she wouldn't make it through . 'We hope that’s the last big one . though - she’ll need to have the hinges out at some point, but we would . like the operations to stop now, thank you.' Despite her problems Alice has taken up table-tennis, representing Newcastle as a member of the hospital's Children’s Transplant Games Team. Last year, she travelled to Belfast for the British Transplant Games and won a silver medal. She had previously been awarded a ‘Child of Courage’ award for her health problems when she was aged three.","There were times when we thought Alice wouldn't make it, admits father ."

A six-year-old girl who was left paralysed and brain-damaged after a head-on collision has received a £5million payout in what a judge described as the 'saddest case' he has come across. Cerys Edwards, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, will also get an annual £450,000 payout for the rest of her life. Cerys was just 11 months old when her family's car was hit head-on by driver Antonio Boparan in Sutton Coldfield in November 2006. Tragic: Cerys Edwards, pictured before and after the horrific crash in November 2006. The six-year-old has been awarded a £5m payout and £450,000 annual payment to help with her care . The massive impact caused spine and brain injuries, leaving Cerys paralysed, unable to speak and permanently dependent on a ventilator as well as a team of around-the-clock nurses. Judge Martin McKenna . Now after a long legal battle, Cerys' family have finally been awarded the payout by Judge Martin McKenna at Birmingham County Court. Speaking as he awarded Cerys a lump sum of £4,971,675 and annual payments Judge McKenna said: 'I've had the misfortune to deal with a number of cases with serious injuries but I think this is one of the saddest cases I've come across. 'While money can never compensate for Cerys' injuries, at least they (her family) have the comfort that her financial future is secure. 'So I will make the order and I wish the parents and Cerys all the best for the future.' Caring: Cerys, then aged five, is pictured with her mother Tracey and donkey Douglas, left. In the image on the right, a three-year-old Cerys is pictured at home with her mother. The child endured dozens of operations, spent seven months in Birmingham Children's Hospital, 16 months in a Surrey rehabilitation centre and two years in a temporary rented house . Smiles: Cerys beams at her mother, whose tireless campaign alongside her husband Gareth resulted in a change in the law and means drivers who cause serious injury in crashes can be jailed for up to five years . Speaking before Judge McKenna made the order, Cerys' representative, Paul Bleasdale QC, said: 'Cerys suffered catastrophic injuries in the accident. She suffered a traumatic brain injury and spinal cord damage. Edwards' family solicitor Richard Langton . 'She was nearly two years in hospital and Cerys now lives in her own home adapted for her needs. 'She's ventilated, fed by a tube, and wholly depends on a team of carers. 'The settlement is split between a lump sum and annual payments to maintain the around-the-clock dedicated nursing team.' Outside court, Mr Bleasdale said the £5million awarded to Cerys was one of the biggest compensation payouts he had heard of. 'If it isn't the biggest, it's close to it,' he added. 'It's definitely close, it's at the very top end.' Short sentence: Antonio Boparan, who was driving at 70mph in a 30 zone, served just six months of a 21-month sentence for dangerous driving. If Cerys had died he could have received 14 years . Boparan, from Sutton Coldfield, was driving at more than 70mph in a 30mph zone and was on the wrong side of the road in a powerful Range Rover Sport when he smashed into the Edwards' family car. The millionaire's son, who was just 19 at the time and had only passed his test six months previously, would have faced up to 14 years in prison if Cerys had died. Speaking at Birmingham County Court today, Boparan's representative, Margaret Bowron QC, apologised profusely for his actions. 'Those acting for the defendant are glad the case was settled without a contested case and hope it's some comfort to Cerys' family that her financial future is secure. 'Sadly nothing we can do will put her right but we hope we can do right by her with this settlement.' In a statement released after the compensation was awarded, the family's solicitor Richard Langton, said: 'No amount of money can put right the damage done. But Cerys' parents are pleased that their daughter's future is secure, which is the overriding fear of the parents of all severely disabled children.' Cerys' parents campaigned vigorously for a change in the law after Boparan served just six months of a 21-month sentence after being found guilty of dangerous driving in 2008. A petition was delivered to Westminster by Cerys' parents in July 2009. As a result, anyone convicted of the new offence of causing serious injury by dangerous driving will face up to five years in prison instead of the current maximum of two for dangerous driving. Crash: Boparan was on the wrong side of the road in a powerful Range Rover Sport when he smashed into the Edwards' family car, causing Cerys' injuries . Mr Langton said: 'Gareth and Tracey are grateful for the support they have had both locally and across the UK for their campaign to change the law. They hope that Cerys' Law may prevent further tragedies."" Cerys, who has been dependent on a ventilator and a team of nurses since 2006, received an interim payment of £800,000 from the Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group in 2008. The group has also paid towards her care costs since she moved into an adapted home at the end of 2010. Before returning home Cerys endured dozens of operations, spent seven months in Birmingham Children's Hospital, 16 months in a Surrey rehabilitation centre and two years in a temporary rented house .","Cerys Edwards will also receive a £450,000 annual payout for rest of her life .

David Cameron’s spin doctor was yesterday accused of threatening a newspaper planning to expose details of a Cabinet minister’s expenses. Craig Oliver, the Prime Minister’s director of communications, contacted the Daily Telegraph when he learned it was preparing to reveal that Culture Secretary Maria Miller’s parents lived in her taxpayer-funded second home. Mr Oliver telephoned the newspaper’s editor last Friday and allegedly suggested that any such story would be ill-timed when the issue of press regulation was being discussed. Culture Secretary Maria Miller leaves a cabinet meeting at Downing Street today . The newspaper claimed he indicated that the article may be poorly timed as ‘she [Mrs Miller] is looking at Leveson at the moment’. This was a reference to the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry into Press standards. He also said she was considering making a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission. Mrs Miller is in charge of implementing Lord Justice Leveson’s report, which proposes statutory underpinning for a new press complaints body. Joanna Hindley, a special adviser to Mrs Miller, also brought up the Leveson report, it is claimed, allegedly telling the paper she wanted to ‘flag up’ the fact that her boss was involved in implementing it.The minister claims the newspaper harassed her elderly father, and she was angry that he was quoted in the paper. Last night Downing Street issued a rebuttal, saying it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest that Mr Oliver had threatened the Telegraph’s editor, Tony Gallagher. Meddling minister claim: Daily Telegraph editor Tony Gallagher, left, was warned by the Government over a story about culture minister Maria Miller's expenses. Downing Street communications boss Craig Oliver was one of the advisers who called the newspaper to 'flag up' Ms Miller's role in regulating the press . But the interventions by Mr Oliver . and Miss Hindley come at a time of widespread concern about politicians . being given a role in overseeing the regulation of the press. Shocked MPs said they looked like an . attempt to threaten the paper with tougher regulation if it went ahead . with the expenses story. Last night Mrs Miller faced calls to remove herself from any involvement in the Government’s response to Leveson. The editor of The Times newspaper has resigned. James . Harding, 43, announced he was quitting after the owners - Rupert . Murdoch’s News Corp – made clear they wanted a new editor. The . move comes at a time when Mr Harding, one of the youngest journalists . ever to take charge of the paper, was heavily involved in the newspaper . industry’s response to the Leveson Inquiry. Mr . Harding, who has been in charge of the paper for five years, said: ‘It . has been made clear to me that News Corporation would like to appoint a . new editor of the Times. I have, therefore, agreed to stand down. 'I called Rupert this morning to offer my resignation and he accepted it. ‘I will be leaving at the end of the year and a new editor will be appointed in due course.' The national independent directors of The Times will be now be consulted on a replacement, a company spokesman said. In . Mr Harding’s leaving speech he said: 'This paper has an unrivalled . history and, I am extremely confident, a long and impressive future . ahead of it. 'It . is also something else: a wonderful place to work, full of smart, warm, . extraordinary people. I will miss it, but most of all you.' Mr Harding began his journalistic career at the Financial Times after studying at Cambridge University. Miss Hindley, 29, flatly denied that . her words were intended as a threat, and claimed it was ‘misleading’ to . ‘suggest it is anything to do with Leveson’, and Downing Street backed . the aide. A spokesman for Number Ten said: ‘For . the Daily Telegraph to suggest that Craig Oliver was threatening them . at any time is beyond absurd. Maria Miller had had a day of dealing with . her elderly father, who was very upset. ‘Mr Oliver phoned Tony Gallagher to discuss the story, who then sent through an apology for any distress that had been caused. ‘The conversation was about Maria . Miller being very upset at a time when she was extremely busy with a . whole load of things, including Leveson. ‘The suggestion, made five days after . the conversation, that that was some kind of threat is completely . ridiculous.’ The row began when the Telegraph, which broke the expenses . scandal in 2009, investigated Mrs Miller for billing the taxpayer . £90,000 for a second home where her parents lived. She has been claiming the cost of the . mortgage and other expenses associated with the large property in South . London. The taxpayer is liable for this because Mrs Miller claims that . for five years her main home has been a rented property in her . Basingstoke constituency. Her arrangements appeared to be at . odds with parliamentary rules. In 2009, Tony McNulty, the Labour Home . Office minister, was severely reprimanded for letting his parents live . in his taxpayer-funded second home. The Telegraph  sent reporters to the . address to check if Mrs Miller’s parents lived there, where they are . said to have held a  ‘brief conversation’ with Mrs Miller’s father. It . formally approached her office about the second home last Thursday. A reporter spoke to Miss Hindley, and . she pointed out that the Telegraph’s editor was involved in meetings . with the Prime Minister and the Culture Secretary over implementing the . recommendations made by Lord Justice Leveson. According to the Telegraph, she said: . ‘Maria has obviously been having quite a lot of editors’ meetings . around Leveson at the moment. So I am just going to kind of flag up that . connection for you to think about.’ Yesterday, neither Miss Hindley nor her department denied she used these words. Douglas Carswell, Conservative MP for . Clacton, said: ‘I don’t want to live in a country where politicians’ representatives are able to stop newspapers from holding politicians to . account. ‘If we become that sort of country then we will be a tin pot country.’ John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, . said: ‘This is the kind of thing you would expect in a Stalinist . dictatorship. It has no place in British democracy. But the Prime Minister’s official . spokesman said: ‘My understanding is that she [Miss Hindley] was raising . legitimate concerns about the way in which the investigation had been . handled.

The secrets are to obey him, avoid nagging, not spend any money on yourself and not to let him catch you curling your hair. He does not want to hear any news of his mother-in-law, only about his own mother. And if he is lying in bed, ill, for heaven’s sake do not fuss around him in a silk dress, else it will rustle and annoy him. Such invaluable advice apparently rescued many a marriage in days gone by. Advice: The Sunderland Daily Echo from October 19 1893, left, warned women that nothing annoys  man more than 'to be urged to tell, when he doesn't want to' while the Derby Daily Telegraph, right, carried a headline 'Vicar's advice to wives in March 1832 . The tips were a regular feature in a series of local newspapers published daily or weekly across Britain in the 1800s and early 1900s. Now they have been brought together in a set of articles unearthed by the British Newspaper Archive, a British Library project to preserve 40million pages from historical newspapers. From the digitised newspaper pages, researchers have found what can only be considered offensive articles by modern standards, with advice for wives ranging from, ‘Don’t expect new dresses all the time’, to warning them: ‘Don’t mope and cry because you are ill  - women should never be ill.’ The Isle of Man Times, on October 12, 1895, told its female readers: ‘Don’t argue with your husband; do whatever he tells you and obey all his orders. Don’t worry him for money and don’t expect a new dress oftener than he offers to buy you one. Don’t sit up till he comes home from the club; better be in bed and pretend to be asleep. If you must be awake, seem to be glad he came home early. He’ll probably think you an idiot; but that’s inevitable anyway.’ Collection: The British Newspaper Archive has put together a collection of articles from the 1800s and early 1900s offering advice on how to be a good wife. The Isle of Man Times from October 12 1895  is pictured, left, and the Western Gazette from August 1 1930 is pictured right . Another pearl of wisdom from the same ‘Advice to wives’ column was: ‘Don’t answer back; don’t spend money on yourself, don’t do anything he doesn’t want you to do. Then, if you are not a happy woman, your husband at least will be comfortable.’ The Derby Daily Telegraph of Monday, March 7, 1932, carried a front page report headlined: ‘Vicar’s advice to wives’, in which Dr W. M. Irwin, the vicar of Duffield, Derbyshire, said during a Mothering Sunday sermon: ‘Long faces and nagging did not get you your husband, and long faces and nagging will not keep them.’ The advice was often published alongside news stories about train crashes, crime stories and political scandals. In an article entitled ‘How To Keep A Husband’, the Sunderland Daily Echo of October 19, 1893, counselled wives not to ask too many questions, advising: ‘Nothing annoys him more than to be urged to tell, when he doesn’t want to’, and: ‘Nothing disgusts a man sooner than to learn that the girl who charmed him by her daintiness and attractiveness has developed into a wife who affects wrappers and curl-papers.’ Historic wisdom: The Bath Weekly Chronicle from April 13 1940, left,  and The Derby Daily Telegraph from March 7 1932, right . On January 19, 1834, the Derby Evening Telegraph warned wives nursing their sick husbands not to try cheering them up ‘by repeating gossip, or by telling him that coal has risen 10s, and that your coal cellar is empty’, adding: ‘Don’t wear your newest and most rustling silk dress or, if you do, don’t fuss about the room more than you can help’. In the Western Gazette, in Dorset, the following tips to ‘young wives’ were offered on August 1, 1930: ‘After you marry him - study him. If he is secretive – trust him. When he is talkative – listen to him. If he is jealous – cure him. If he favours society – accompany him. 'Let him think you understand him – but never let him think you manage him.’ Of course, it takes two to make a successful marriage, and the Bath Weekly Chronicle and Herald helpfully offered this advice to husbands in its edition of April 13, 1940: ‘Do you still court your wife, bring her an occasional gift of flowers and remember her birthday and the wedding anniversary? Remember these and she will darn your socks.’ Debra Chatfield, of the British Newspaper Archives, said: ‘These outrageous advice columns seem funny to us now, but at the time such advice was taken quite seriously by those who read them. ‘Reviewing newspaper articles from the past is a great way to track social attitudes towards gender roles, politics and popular opinion, and these articles are among many gems to be found in the archives.’ Between now and 2021, millions of old newspaper pages will be uploaded for public view on the project’s website www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk.","The collection has been unearthed by the British Newspaper Archive .

Esther Rantzen has launched a blistering attack on the Jimmy Savile police inquiry team over its concentration on arresting celebrities. The ChildLine founder claimed Scotland Yard’s high-profile Operation Yewtree’s focus on the famous could even jeopardise the chances of young abuse victims seeing justice. She said the £2million investigation – which has seen Jim Davidson, Freddie Starr and Max Clifford among those arrested – was in danger of trivialising and sensationalising child abuse. Unhappy: Esther Rantzen (left, in London in May 2011) has launched a blistering attack on the Jimmy Savile (right, also in London, in April 1998) police inquiry team over its concentration on arresting celebrities . Celebrities rounded up by the Metropolitan Police inquiry would forever be tainted even if no charges were ever brought, she said. Before he became the latest high-profile Yewtree arrest last week, comedian Davidson said the inquiry had become a ‘witch hunt’. In October, Miss Rantzen took part in the ITV documentary which exposed Savile as a predatory paedophile and memorably admitted: ‘We all blocked our ears to the gossip’ about the shamed star. But now she has turned on Operation Yewtree, which was set up to examine hundreds of claims of abuse in the wake of the Savile revelations. In a Sunday newspaper article, she wrote: ‘When Yewtree swoops – and celebrity after celebrity has been targeted by them – we assume they’ve uncovered yet more sexual abuse of children.’ Yet in many cases, she said, the stars were defending themselves against ‘historic’ allegations of sexual abuse brought by women who were in their twenties at the time. Protest of innocent: Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis (pictured in November 2012) has made clear that the allegations he has been questioned over do not relate to children or to Savile . Davidson, publicist Clifford and former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis have all made clear that the allegations they have been questioned over do not relate to children or to Savile. Each denies any wrongdoing. Miss Rantzen called on Commander Peter . Spindler, the officer leading Yewtree, to change the inquiry and avert . the risk of creating a public backlash. Jimmy Savile preyed on patients and staff . in a hospice for the terminally ill, it was claimed yesterday. Scotland . Yard is planning to list all the establishments – including hospitals, . prisons and schools – where Savile chose his victims over 60 years. His . association with Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor . hospitals is well known, but it is thought he may have abused people in . at least seven other institutions. Yewtree should be split up, with a different codename for allegations which have nothing to do with children or Savile, she said, otherwise victims could be deterred from speaking out. More than 500 women have come forward with allegations about abuse to Operation Yewtree. Detectives have divided the cases into three categories, the first two linked to Savile, and the third termed ‘Others’ – which have nothing to do with him. The allegations against Davidson, 59, fall into this third category. His lawyer Henri Brandman said last week: . ‘Two women have made allegations in respect of Jim that date back . approximately 25 years. The complainants were then in their mid-20s. Jim . vigorously denies the allegations. ‘He answered police questions as fully as he was able after this passage of time. He has not been charged with any offence.’ Eleven weeks after the launch of Operation Yewtree, police have recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape. Others arrested include Gary Glitter. By ESTHER RANTZEN . Arrested: Comedian Jim Davidson pictured with his wife Michelle in London in July 2004 . First, let me declare my interest. I took part in the notorious ITV programme, Exposure, which broke the news that the late Sir Jimmy Savile, at the time regarded as a national treasure and mourned for his charity work, was in fact a predatory paedophile. And as president of ChildLine, I am also a trustee of the NSPCC, who actively support the work of Operation Yewtree, the unit set up by the Metropolitan Police to look into allegations of abuse by Savile and others. So I must stress that my opinions are mine alone, not those of the ITV programme-makers, nor of the NSPCC. I personally believe that Operation Yewtree needs to change, and change quickly. Otherwise the policeman in charge, Commander Peter Spindler, dedicated to uncovering crime, runs the risk that he will create a backlash instead. Yewtree could make it harder than ever for victims of abuse to ask for help, or gain the justice they deserve. For the latest arrest of comedian Jim Davidson is deeply confusing. Yewtree is about child abuse, isn’t it? After all, it was set up as a direct result of the Savile revelations. The NSPCC is supporting the Yewtree investigations because it is a charity dedicated to protecting children against abuse. When Yewtree swoops, and celebrity after celebrity has been targeted by them, we assume that they have uncovered yet more sexual abuse of children. But it turns out that Jim Davidson has not been accused of abusing any children. He is defending himself against historic accusations brought by two women who were in their twenties at the time. He is of course innocent unless he is proved guilty, and he vigorously denies the accusations. But the danger is that he is now tainted, and will be for ever. And the taint is the false implication that he was somehow involved with the Savile crimes against children. Exactly why have Operation Yewtree arrested Freddie Starr, and Dave Lee Travis, and Max Clifford, and the others? Nobody has yet been charged; when and if they are, we will be better informed. But in the meantime, all these people have also been tainted. And even if no charges are brought, the damage will have been done, the taint will be there, simply by branding all these arrests with the Yewtree label. Operation Yewtree should go back to its original purpose, and focus on child abuse. The label should be limited specifically to allegations of the sexual abuse of children, by those who committed their crimes alongside Jimmy Savile. We must discover whether there was a paedophile ring. We urgently need to know if others over . the years also escaped justice. Their victims also deserve a voice. We . need to know the truth, if we are to learn lessons and move forward. 'Exactly why have Operation Yewtree . arrested Freddie Starr, and Dave Lee Travis, and Max Clifford, and the . others? Nobody has yet been charged; when and if they are, we will be . better informed. But in the meantime, all these people have also been . tainted' But let’s not label every sexual crime by a celebrity over the past 40 years as Yewtree. All sexual crimes are sickening, whether they are attacks on adult men or women, or on children. I’m not for one moment implying that complaints should not be taken seriously and investigated. Of course not. Just that unless it’s a crime against a child, don’t label it Yewtree. Commander Peter Spindler, split your unit, and find another operational name for accusations that have nothing to do with children, nor with Savile. And concentrate on the real question. Why did it take so long for the truth about Savile to emerge? Why was he never tried and convicted for his hundreds of crimes? The truth is that our legal system is so heavily weighted against children that most sexual abuse cases never reach the courtroom. When children give evidence they are subjected to cross-examination which many children have told me is as painful as the original abuse. One criminal barrister told me: ‘I don’t care how great a monster my client is, and what it takes to break down a child, it’s my job to do it and I will.’ So you can understand why the police were reluctant to take the cases against Savile to court. No jury in the world, they thought, would believe the word of a vulnerable child against one of the nation’s most skilled and most admired entertainers, knighted for his achievements for charity. And this is still happening. A few days ago I met a family, furious  and deeply distressed because a number of abused children were prevented from giving evidence, because one was reduced to tears by the cross-examination. So yet another dangerous abuser got away with his many crimes, and he is still at large. It would be wonderful if Operation Yewtree resulted in a better, safer world for children. But it would be tragic if the £2million police inquiry simply trivialised and sensationalised the whole operation. This is not about celebrity headlines. This is about real crimes against real children. The tragic truth is that it is still happening today. And unless we learn the crucial lessons, more children will be forced to suffer in silence. © Sunday Post .

In his role as Attorney General, he has spoken out repeatedly against the scourge of ‘petty hooliganism and anti-social behaviour’. But it appears Dominic Grieve has not always practised what he now preaches. The Government’s most senior law officer once threw a man off a bridge, it is claimed – and his alleged victim was none other than the current Police Minister, Damian Green. 'Undignified': It is claimed Britain's Attorney General Dominic Grieve, left, once hurled Police Minister Damian Green, right, from a bridge into the River Cherwell while they were both students at Oxford University . The story of the undignified incident from their Oxford student days resurfaced yesterday. According to a 1977 report, politics student Mr Green ‘could have drowned’ after being hurled into the River Cherwell where he narrowly missed being impaled on a set of rusty spikes. Among those in the group that propelled him from the 12ft stone bridge was said to be Mr Grieve, now a barrister and the country’s leading law officer. The two Tory MPs, both 56, now work together helping to shape UK policy on upholding law and order. Yesterday neither politician was prepared to comment on whether the report was an accurate reflection on the events of December 1977. But there would appear to be no residual animosity. When Mr Green was arrested in 2008, as part of a Home Office leaks investigation, it was Mr Grieve who rode to his aid by leading the public outcry. At the time of the bridge incident, Mr Green was the 21-year-old president of the Oxford Union when he was ‘set upon by a bunch of Hooray Henrys’. The story was unearthed by students working for Cherwell, the Oxford University newspaper. It appeared in the paper 35 years ago in a report co-authored by Michael Crick, who is now political correspondent for Channel 4 News. He wrote: ‘Green was grabbed by about a dozen Magdalen undergraduates and some of their guests, and forcibly carried to the bridge over the Cherwell at the back of the College. ‘There, Green was dropped from a height of about 12ft into one-and-a-half feet of water. ‘In his fall, he missed being impaled on some rusty spikes by only a few inches.’ Scene: According to a 1977 report Mr Green 'could have drowned' when he was thrown into the river from the 12ft stone bridge close to Magdalen College . Mr Green reportedly told the paper: ‘I could easily have hit my head on the bottom, been concussed, and drowned.’ Six undergraduates accused of being involved had their membership of the student union suspended a few days later, and Mr Grieve was said to be among them. The others were named at the time as being Nicholas Leviseur, Tim Clarke, Julian Chadwick, Simon Hardman-Lea and Gavin Grahame. At the time Mr Leviseur threatened to sue Mr Green for slander over his version of events. Yesterday Mr Green’s constituency agent, Gordon Wiliams, said: ‘I had never heard of this story but Damian works harmoniously with Dominic Grieve so if anything did happen, it is all in the past now.’ The other members of the ‘Cherwell Six’ group allegedly involved in the incident all went on to glittering careers. Mr Hardman-Lea is a leading consultant ophthalmologist, working at Ipswich Hospital, and Mr Chadwick is a lawyer and former chairman of Latin Mass Society. Mr Clarke became CEO of pub chain Mitchell and Butlers. Last night he said at his £1million villa in Birmingham: ‘I just don’t want to get involved.’ Mr Leviseur, now a barrister at 3PB Chambers, yesterday told the Mail he had ‘no reliable memories of much that happened at university given that 35 years had elapsed since then’.

Britain's first transsexual doctor is under investigation after one of his female  patients said she regretted the treatment she underwent to become a man. The woman had her breasts removed and underwent gender-changing hormone treatment before changing her mind. She is now one of three patients to complain about Dr Richard Curtis, a former woman, who is accused of allowing them to rush into sex-change procedures. The doctor, who charges patients up to £240 an hour, is being investigated by the General Medical Council. Dr Curtis, 46, became the first transsexual to be re-registered by the GMC and now runs the London Gender Clinic, a private sex-change practice. Based in Marylebone, Central London, it is billed as a ‘one-stop shop’, and patients seeking to change gender are charged £240 for an initial consultation, lasting an hour, and £130 for half-hour follow-ups. But Dr Curtis faces claims of breaching rules by prescribing sex-change treatments ‘inappropriately’. The allegations include commencing hormone treatment in complex cases without referring the patient for a  second opinion, or before they had undergone counselling. He also allegedly administered  hormone treatment at a patient’s first appointment, and referred patients for surgery before they had lived in their desired gender role for a year, as international guidelines recommend. One patient allegedly underwent surgery within 12 months of their first appointment. He is also accused of administering hormones to patients aged under 18 without an adequate assessment. One of the most serious complaints concerns a woman who now regrets embarking on the switc to become male. She had the double mastectomy, but never completed her ‘gender reassignment’. Concerns about Dr Curtis led to the GMC imposing a number of conditions on his practice in November 2011. Before: As Vanda Zadorozny before her sex-change (left) and aged seven (right) Investigation: The General Medical Council, headquarters pictured, stepped in after a series of complaints about Dr Curtis . These included a ban on prescribing hormonal treatments for potential sex-change patients, and on referring any patients for sex-change surgery, unless those patients have undergone a recent psychological assessment. Dr Curtis is accused of breaching some of the conditions. If the GMC decides he has a case to answer, he will be referred to a fitness-to-practise committee, which can strike a doctor from the medical register. He was born Vanda Lorraine Zadorozny, to an English mother and a Polish miner father who came to Britain after the Second World War. As Vanda, she grew up in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, with younger twin brothers. She studied medicine at St Bart’s Medical College, London, and became a GP in 1995, working at surgeries in London. But feeling she was ‘a gay man trapped in a woman’s body’, she underwent two years of ‘gender-specific’ counselling before having sex-change surgery in 2005 and becoming Dr Richard Curtis. She started with a £7,000 hysterectomy and had a double mastectomy six months later. As a man, he also took testosterone to lower his voice. Although Dr Curtis, who lives in Richmond, South-West London, has never married, he had three serious heterosexual relationships in his past life as Vanda, which he described as ‘emotionally and physically poor’. He is a keen sailor who won several races as a woman. His mother Margaret died before he underwent the sex-change, but his father Mario, then 80, was supportive. Dr Curtis said: ‘He said that after having been in a forced labour camp under the Nazis when he was 16,  nothing could really get to him. ‘He said, “Oh yes. I thought you sounded different the last time we spoke. It’s one of those things luvvie”.’ Yesterday neither Dr Curtis nor the Medical Defence Union, which is  representing him, wished to comment, citing ‘the ongoing investigation and his duty to patient confidentiality’. There is a Facebook page supporting him entitled ‘Dr Curtis is Cool’, which says he has ‘helped many people with gender issues’.

"By . Sam Greenhill and Paul Revoir . PUBLISHED: . 19:43 EST, 19 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:52 EST, 20 December 2012 . BBC chiefs were alerted to Jimmy Savile’s ‘dark side’ months before it became public, it emerged yesterday. They learned ‘the real truth’ about the twisted entertainer more than two years ago – while he was still alive. Yet nothing was done, and shortly after his death, fulsome tribute programmes were aired and a Newsnight expose of his paedophile past was scrapped. A damning report yesterday revealed ‘chaos’ and a ‘critical lack of leadership’ at the heart of the BBC. But in spite of the scathing conclusions, no one will be sacked. Pass the buck: George Entwistle made an 'ethically dubious' attempt to shift the blame over the Savile crisis . The report by former Sky News head Nick Pollard brands the corporation ‘incapable’ of getting to grips with the Savile crisis and said it was mired in ‘chaos and confusion’. It also revealed: . As the excoriating report was published, BBC deputy director of news Stephen Mitchell retired and Newsnight’s editor Peter Rippon and his deputy Liz Gibbons lost their posts. But incredibly, none of the bosses moved from their posts will be sacked. And director of news Helen Boaden – censured for failing to tackle the ‘meltdown’ in her department – returns to her desk today after a period of gardening leave. Tory MP Rob Wilson said the report suggested ‘the BBC lives in a separate moral universe from the rest of the country’, adding: ‘The public will be questioning why no one has been sacked as a result of these serious failings.’ The Savile case has become one of the biggest sex abuse scandals in British history, with 450 victims now saying they were abused by the DJ. Yet the BBC failed to unmask him as a predatory paedophile after scrapping its Newsnight investigation and failing to even pass on crucial evidence to the police. Were it not for an ITV documentary shown in October, his four-decade rampage of abuse may never have come to light. Culpability: Entwistle resigned less than a month after he took the director general role, but no one involved in the Savile debacle will lose their jobs . BBC executives and celebrities accused of turning a blind eye to Savile’s offending have repeatedly insisted they were powerless to act on mere ‘rumours’. But Mr Pollard said there was ‘real knowledge, not just rumour’ within BBC television ‘about the unsavoury side of Savile’s character’. Mr Entwistle was sent explosive emails warning of Savile’s ‘dark side’ as he prepared to order tribute programmes after the DJ died in October 2011. But Mr Entwistle – handed £450,000 of licence-payers’ money when he quit the BBC after the Lord McAlpine disaster – claims he never read the email warnings and did not ask any questions. His claims were undermined by forensic examination of Mr Entwistle’s two email accounts, which showed the emails had been opened. Withheld: The report also found that Newsnight may have sat on evidence about Savile's crimes for months . The first were sent to him on May 29, 2010 – a full 17 months before Savile died – by Nick Vaughan-Barratt, former BBC head of events, who warned he would feel ‘very queasy’ if the BBC produced an obituary for Savile when he died as he knew ‘the real truth’. But instead of finding out what was meant by this, Mr Entwistle says he does not recall the email. Then after Savile died, on October 29, 2011, BBC commissioning editor Jan Younghusband emailed Mr Entwistle about ‘the darker side’ of Savile. Mr Entwistle, then the BBC’s head of television, told the Pollard Review he ‘could not remember’ reading that email, and did not reply to it. Yet on the same day, Mr Entwistle did reply to a separate email suggesting the BBC produce a ‘homage’ to Savile, saying it was ‘a great idea’. Mr Pollard found that, as the Savile crisis threatened Mr Entwistle, the director general devised a strategy to save himself by heaping all the blame on his Newsnight editor. He told Miss Boaden and two other senior executives: ‘I have decided that I need to protect the BBC and BBC News within it, and I’m going to do a statement that makes it impossible for Peter not to resign.’ He backed down when ‘it was pointed out that this was an ethically dubious thing to do’, Mr Pollard was told. Miss Boaden has survived in her £340,000-a-year job while her 63-year-old second-in-command Mr Mitchell has resigned – leading to an old joke recirculating around the BBC that in times of crisis at the corporation, ‘deputy heads will roll’. Miss Boaden’s lawyers had suggested to Mr Pollard it would be wrong to criticise her and attribute failings to her during this period. But he said she ‘should have taken greater responsibility’. He said he was ‘surprised’ she did not take ‘a more proactive role’ particularly given that a ‘significant part of her division’ was in ‘virtual meltdown’. The BBC spent £2million on the Pollard Review to find out if corporation chiefs scrapped the Newsnight investigation to preserve their Christmas schedule, which was to include the Savile tribute shows. Mr Pollard concluded that although the BBC’s decision was ‘seriously flawed’ it had not been taken for this reason. Mr Entwistle said the report made clear that ‘I played no part in determining the fate of the Newsnight expose on Jimmy Savile’. He added: ‘As director general, in October 2012, as soon as I became aware of allegations of sexual abuse against Savile, I took the matter straight to the police and offered the BBC’s full co-operation with their investigations.’ No one is to be sacked over the second BBC scandal, in which Lord McAlpine was wrongly branded a paedophile after a disastrous Newsnight report. A separate probe published yesterday found bungling news executives failed to conduct ‘basic checks’ and ignored their own editorial guidelines. The fiasco, which prompted George Entwistle’s resignation as BBC director general, was a ‘grave breach which had been costly to all concerned’, said the report by the BBC Trust. But the report – based on an internal investigation by Ken MacQuarrie, director of BBC Scotland – did not recommend any sackings. A second report into the botched Newsnight investigation didn't recommend any sackings, despite 'basic checks' being ignored . It also failed to identify all those who ‘signed off’ the report for broadcast, causing one of the worst mistakes in modern journalism. There is no attempt to explain, for example, why the BBC’s highly paid army of lawyers failed to stop the damaging report being aired. However the BBC Trust said three BBC employees had been ‘subject to disciplinary action’. One is Liz Gibbons, who was editing Newsnight on November 2 when the report was broadcast, who has been moved to another job at the BBC. Lord McAlpine was wrongly linked to a child sex abuse scandal as a result of the Newsnight investigation. The BBC was forces to pay £185,000 in damages . Another is BBC Radio 5 Live controller Adrian Van Klaveren, who was overseeing Newsnight in the wake of Savile, and is to step down from his role. The third is unknown. The programme, which featured an interview with Steve Messham who said a senior political figure of the time abused him, led to the widespread naming of Lord McAlpine. The Tory peer, who had not been contacted by the programme, strenuously denied the allegations, and is now suing all those who wrongly named him. It later emerged that Mr Messham had not even been shown a photo of the politician – and when he eventually saw one, he realised he had made a mistake. The following week, Newsnight broadcast an apology, as well as apologies from Mr Messham. Lord McAlpine later received £185,000 damages from the corporation. The probe said matters were made worse by the fact that, in the hours prior to broadcast, Iain Overton, managing editor of the Bureau of . Investigative Journalism which worked on the report, tweeted: ‘If all goes well we’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile’. The MacQuarrie Report said this caused ‘alarm and consternation’ among the Newsnight editorial team, and acting editor Miss Gibbons asked Angus Stickler, the BIJ reporter working on the McAlpine programme, to call Overton ‘immediately and tell him to stop tweeting’. The Trust’s editorial standards committee said: ‘This was a high-risk report which required rigorous supervision and did not receive it. ‘The allegations were not based on sound evidence. They were not thoroughly tested and, whilst there was no suggestion that the programme-makers had sought to mislead the public, this had been the effect.’","Bosses ignored warnings about DJ's 'dark side'

A woman leapt to her death from a City rooftop restaurant after a Facebook stalker exposed her westernised lifestyle to her Muslim parents. Rema Begum, 29, plunged 80ft from the terrace of Coq d’Argent after sipping a glass of wine and climbing on to a ledge. She landed in front of horrified workers outside Bank Tube station and died instantly.

The Coq d'Argent restaurant, where Miss Begum jumped to her death . She was also suffering depression . after losing her manager’s job at the British Library following a row . with her bosses, an inquest at City of London coroner’s court was told . yesterday. Miss Begum feared she was living an . impure life and as punishment was worried she would not be allowed into . paradise. On September 4, she went to Sir Terence Conran’s Coq d’Argent . and ordered a glass of wine. At about 6.30pm, she put down her . handbag and glass, with a note underneath it, and diners saw her climb . onto a ledge and fall eight storeys. Sir Terence Conran owns the exclusive restaurant . Including Miss Begum, four people have plunged to their deaths from the building since 2007. A post-mortem revealed she was not drunk, and the court heard she had left a string of suicide notes dating back four months. In her handbag, police found anti-depressants, a bottle of vodka and a note containing contact details for her next of kin. In the days before her death, Miss . Begum, who had lived alone in Islington, North London, confided how she . was ‘struggling’ to reconcile her Muslim faith and her lifestyle. The . day before she died, Miss Begum had been to her local hospital with her . parents after she tried to hang herself – but insisted it was a cry for . attention and promised she would not do it again. Her university friend Avril Atkins . said she had been a ‘very happy, very bubbly’ woman ‘like the life and . soul of the party’, but had become reclusive. Although she came from a . ‘traditional Muslim family’ and followed some practices including . fasting, she lived a ‘western life’ independently and had non-Muslim . partners which her family had found out about, Mrs Atkins said. ‘She had some problems with Facebook. Somebody – she didn’t know who – had been sending letters to her parents . about her lifestyle and relationships.’ Miss Begum reported the abuse . to the police, before deleting her Facebook account and replacing it . with one using a different name, the inquest heard. Miss Begum, who was also grieving for a . relative, had her British Library contract terminated after falling out . with management last Christmas, the coroner was told. Her depression . began shortly after that. Mrs Atkins told the inquest: ‘Towards . the end she was having issues with one of her managers. It was causing . her a lot of stress. ‘One thing that did really worry me . was she did say to me she hadn’t been living a good Muslim life and that . she wouldn’t go to paradise and I was saying to her that she had done . nothing wrong with the way she lived her life, her family should be . proud of her.’ Miss Begum’s parents Abdul and Rufia Hakim did not attend the inquest. Coroner Paul Matthews recorded a suicide verdict. He said there was no doubt Miss Begum was suffering from depression.

A British student was in a coma on life support last night following a freak snowboarding accident in the French Alps. Emily Watts, 26, who is known as Mimi, was performing jumps off the side of a piste when she plunged into a 5ft hole covered by snow and suffocated after she landed face down and unconscious in a snowdrift. She lay there for up to 45 minutes before being spotted and rescued, during which time she was partially starved of oxygen and had a heart attack. Emily, known as Mimi, Watts is on life support after a snowboarding accident in the French Alps. She was trapped in a snowdrift for 45 minutes and suffered a cardiac arrest . Miss Watts was airlifted to hospital in nearby Annecy, where she is in intensive care in a critical condition. Last night, her mother Nicola McAllister said Miss Watts was brain dead and it was just a matter of time until her life-support machine was turned off. The 62-year-old said: ‘She effectively died on the slope – she won’t recover. She has no chance. We are devastated. It is in the hands of the doctors now when they turn her life-support machine off.’ Mrs McAllister, a former stockbroker, arrived in France yesterday with Miss Watts’s father Dominic and brother Rory, 27. Chamonix is a popular ski resort as Mont Blanc is the highest peak west of Russia. Skiers from throughout Europe and the world flock there every season . Although the accident happened on Saturday, they were not told until Sunday because Miss Watts was not carrying documents and police could not identify her. Speaking from the hospital, Rory, a graphic designer from London, said: ‘She was always breaking the boundaries and would make sure everyone was having fun. We will stay by her side now.’ Mrs McAllister, who runs an agricultural consultancy business in Lavenham, Suffolk, with her second husband Malcolm, said: ‘Her friends were ahead of her and didn’t know anything had happened until they got to the bottom of the slope. ‘She was the best snowboarder of the group and it had never crossed their minds she wouldn’t turn up.’ Miss Watts moved to Chamonix two weeks ago to look for a job. She had studied costume design and wanted to go to university in September and create a range of clothes for snowboarders. The day before the accident she texted her mother to say she had found work managing holiday flats and was ‘very happy’. Miss Watts’s father, a garden sculptor, said: ‘One thing we will hold on to is that she was doing what she loved. Before she went to Chamonix she said there was nothing more that she wanted to do than snowboard and do a season out there. ‘The day she had her accident it was a beautiful sunny day and she had had a great day on the slopes.’ Her aunt Shona Pollock, 58, had said . yesterday the whole family were in shock and devastated that she was . showing no signs of improvement. Describing Mimi as 'heavenly' and . with a 'passion for life', Ms Pollock said her parents and . brothers had rushed to be at her bedside. 'She is not doing very well at all really, and tragically she is not going to get any better. She is still alive, but she is not very well,' she said. No . other skier was thought to be involved, as Miss Watts came off her . board and 'fell down a steep incline' at high speed, reported local . police. A source close to the French emergency services said: 'She went just a couple of metres off-piste in an area dotted with small bushes and fell down a 1.5m ""hole"" created by snow ploughs. She fell head first into thick snow and was knocked unconscious. 'She had already been in cardiac arrest for dozens of minutes by the time rescue services reached the scene.' Ms Pollack said: 'They believe she may have fallen head first into fresh powder and probably knocked herself out. 'When they found her she had been smothered in snow, almost like her body had been drowning in snow - and her brain has been starved of oxygen. 'Short of a miracle I just don’t think she is going to get better. She had 45 minutes on the mountain with her heart stopped. 'It is truly devastating. She is so bright and sadly all of her plans for the future are to be no more. 'She is still on a life support machine but that is not for long - It sadly looks as though she won’t recover.

Pictured on boats, in nightspots and on glorious beaches, these are pictures of Hannibal Gaddafi enjoying the privileges that come with being the son of a multimillionaire dictator. In nearly all, he poses with his glamorous Lebanese wife Aline - the pair without a care in the world as his father controlled Libya with an iron rod, subjugating his citizens and stealing their wealth. Holidays, designer labels and various luxury items are all on show in the images, which have been released by soldiers of the National Transitional Council after they were found on a laptop. Getting away from it all: Hannibal Gadaffi and his wife Aline on a private yacht near the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh. The images were allegedly taken from a laptop found by rebel forces . In . racier shots, former model Aline drapes herself over a pool table at their home in . Tripoli, while another shows her in a daringly low bikini top and . cosying up to Hannibal in a restaurant in Tunisia. Even at home with their dogs, the . pair are dressed to the nines, with Hannibal sporting his best John . Travolta white suit in one hilarious photograph. Also on the laptop were found details . of huge bank transfers, totalling in the order of $23m - so it is . little wonder the Gaddafi children enjoyed such heady lifestyles. Libyan picnic: In this undated photo, Hannibal and Aline enjoy a luxury picnic in Libya. Aline's lapdog and Hannibal's Humvee can be seen in the background . Tunisia or bust: Aline leaves little to the imagination in this image, taken at an unnamed restaurant in Tunisia. The images show the carefree lifestyke of the Gadaffis before their reign came to an abrupt end . Revolutionary forces fighting loyalists in a key regime stronghold have revealed that one of their top commanders has been killed in a rocket attack. Osama al-Fasi says the commander, Daw Saleheen, was killed today by a heat-seeking rocket while fighting in Bani Walid, southeast of Tripoli.Saleheen was imprisoned for more than 20 years by Moammar Gadhafi's regime and was leading anti-Gadhafi forces in their battle for Bani Walid, one of the last remaining bastions of Gadhafi loyalists since the fall of Tripoli more than a month ago. Which only gives extra incentive to the rebels tracking down Muammar Gaddafi and the rest of his corrupt clan. Today, rebel forces claimed he was in hiding in Libya's southern desert, possibly in a vast area near the Algerian border. Two of his sons are believed to be holed up in cities besieged by revolutionary forces elsewhere. Col. Ahmed Bani, the NTC spokesman, said Gaddafi's son, Seif al-Islam, is in Bani Walid and another son Muatassim is in Sirte. Another military official said they had intelligence that Gaddafi is possibly under the protection of ethnic Tuareg fighters, whose nomadic community spans the desert border of Niger, Mali, Libya, Algeria and Chad, are among Gadhafi's strongest remaining supporters. 'We do believe that he is somewhere in that region and we do know that Tuaregs are supporting him, probably because he's paying them,' Abdel-Rahman Busin said. 'It's a very large bit of land to cover. We don't have the people to cover it all and he could move around quite freely,' he added. One report suggested Gaddafi was southwest of the desert town of Sabha. He also said a recent attack on the border town of Ghadamis raised suspicion that the fugitive leader was hiding in the surrounding region, a vast area near the Algerian frontier. 'Possibly they were just creating a diversion,' he said. At home: The couple show their fashion sense in this undated photo taken at their home in Tripoli . Striking a pose: Aline stretches out across a pool table in the games room of the Tripoli residence . Pets and plush surroundings: The couple pose in their finery once again, surrounded by household pets . Pro-Gadhdafi gunmen crossed the . border from Algeria to attack revolutionary forces in Ghadamis last . week, killing at least nine people. The fear is that Gaddafi may still be . able to stoke violence from his hiding place, raising concerns about a . protracted insurgency. Bani said revolutionary forces were . focused on consolidating control over the entire country and would hunt . for Gaddafi after all cities were secured. Speculation has been rife that Seif . al-Islam was in Bani Walid and Muatassim in Sirte as both areas have put . up a fierce resistance against surrounding revolutionary forces. The top commander of revolutionary . forces in Bani Walid was killed last night in a rocket attack, Bani . said. He said Daw Saleheen was on a patrol in the area, 90 miles . southeast of Tripoli, when he was struck by a heat-seeking rocket. Saleheen spent more than 20 years in jail under Gaddafi's regime. Anti-Gaddafi forces had conducted . negotiations with Seif al-Islam in Bani Walid a couple weeks ago, Busin . said earlier, but talks about his possible surrender had broken down. Yesterday, Syrian-based Al-Rai TV, . which has become the former regime's mouthpiece, aired video of Seif . al-Islam that it said was taken last week. The same video, however, appears to . have been uploaded to YouTube on March 6. A second YouTube video appears . to show the same event with an upload date of February 27, less than . two weeks after the Libyan uprising began.

Exodus: Families flee as anti-Gaddafi fighters clash with pro-Gaddafi forces near Sirte, one of the last bastions of support for the fugitive dictator . Seif al-Islam's last known public . appearance was on August 23 in Tripoli.

Revolutionary fighters also have been . unable to rout regime forces from Sirte on the Mediterranean coast.

"By . Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 04:55 EST, 20 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:42 EST, 20 April 2012 . Church officials have leapt to the defence of a bishop who provoked outrage by comparing President Barack Obama’s health care policies to the oppressive actions of ruthless dictators Hitler and Stalin. Bishop Daniel Jenky told his congregation that Obama is following previous governments that ‘tried to force Christians to huddle and hide only within the confines of their churches’. ‘Hitler and Stalin, at their better moments, would just barely tolerate some churches remaining open, but would not tolerate any competition with the state in education, social services and health care,’ he said, according to the Peoria Journal Star and Chicago Tribune. Outrage: Bishop Daniel Jenky's, left, comparison of the actions of President Barack Obama, right, to those of ruthless dictators Hitler and Stalin has sparked demands for an apology . ‘In clear violation of our First Amendment rights, Barack Obama - with his radical, pro-abortion and extreme secularist agenda - now seems intent on following a similar path,’ he added, referring to the amendment in the U.S. Constitution that protects religious freedom and other rights. His sermon during a Sunday homily at St. Mary's Cathedral in Peoria, Illinois, was met with fierce criticism and demands for an apology. But Diocese Chancellor Patricia Gibson rejected the outrage, explaining that Jenky ‘offered historical context and comparisons as a means to prevent a repetition of historical attacks upon the Catholic Church and other religions.’ She added: ‘We have currently not reached the same level of persecution. ‘But Bishop Jenky would say that history teaches us to be cautious. ... (He) is concerned that our government is truly treading on one of our most dear freedoms, which is religious freedom.’ Jenky's comments came a few days after the nation's Roman Catholic Bishops called for a national campaign in defense of religious liberty and urged resistance to laws church officials considered unjust. The bishops said Catholics must work to change recent state and federal laws church leaders believe violate religious freedom. The highest-profile clash has . been over the mandate in the Obama administration's health care overhaul . that most employers cover birth control costs for workers. The . White House has offered a compromise for church-affiliated groups such . as hospitals and universities, but bishops have said the changes don't . go far enough. History: Bishop Daniel Jenky was offering 'historical context and comparisons' aimed at preventing attack on the church when drawing links to Adolf Hitler, left, and Joseph Stalin, right, according to church officials . Calls to the . diocese from The Associated Press rang unanswered Thursday afternoon, . and Gibson did not immediately respond to an email request for further . comment. Americans United . for Separation of Church and State, meanwhile, filed a formal complaint . asking the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the diocese, . suggesting Jenky may have crossed a line that put the church's . tax-exempt status in jeopardy. The group noted that in addition to the comments about Hitler and Obama, Jenky went on to tell those gathered Sunday that, ‘This fall, every practicing Catholic must vote, and must vote their Catholic consciences, or by the following fall our Catholic schools, our Catholic hospitals, our Catholic Newman Centers, all our public ministries - only excepting our church buildings - could easily be shut down.’ ‘No rational person could believe the bishop was doing anything but saying vote against Obama’ in the November presidential election, said the group's executive director, Barry Lynn. Federal law prohibits churches and other tax-exempt nonprofits from endorsing or opposing specific political candidates, but churches are allowed to engage in a wide range of political activities and the IRS rarely revokes a church's tax-exempt status. The Anti-Defamation League also called on Jenky to apologize for his comments. Regional Director Lonnie Nasatir said Thursday that the bishop needs a history lesson on ‘religious intolerance and anti-Semitism fostered in society’ by Hitler and Stalin.","Bishop Daniel Jenky likened President's health care policies to attacks on the Catholic Church by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin .

The mother of a Navy SEAL Team Six member believes that her son and other members of the elite squad were marked for death after the Obama administration identified them as the team who took out Osama bin Laden. Karen Vaughn, the mother of Navy SEAL Aaron Vaughn, said in an interview that aired on Tuesday that her son was concerned for his safety after the team was outed. She doesn’t, however, believe Aaron was one of the commandos who raided the terror leader’s Pakistan compound in May 2011. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Billy and Karen Vaughn, the parents of Navy SEAL Aaron Vaughn, believe their son and other members of the elite squad became targets when they were outed by the White House . But when Vice President Joe Biden identified the elite team of commandoes that took out the world’s most notorious terror leader, the soldiers got nervous. Karen Vaughn told Fox News: 'Aaron called me and said, ""Mom, you need to wipe your social media clean of any reference to me or any of my buddies. Just disconnect completely""' She added: '[Aaron] actually said to me, ""Mom, there's chatter, and all of our lives could be in danger, including yours."" 'Then I realized all of those families, you know, you're talking about a community of around three hundred families who were all of a sudden made targets by this administration.' The soldier’s father, Billy Vaughn told the network that he wishes elected officials would be more responsible with the sensitive information they handle. Fallen: Aaron Vaughn's life was tragically cut short when a helicopter that he was riding in was shot down by Taliban militants . He said: 'We expect better out of the high-up's in our government. We, as American citizens, look to our government. 'We elect them, we look to them to take care of the best interests of the American citizen, and especially the warrior. And I believe what the administration did, then I believe it was criminal.' On August 6, 2011, three months after the bin Laden raid, Aaron Vaughn was one of 30 U.S. servicemen killed when the Chinook helicopter they were riding in was shot down by Taliban militants over Afghanistan. Karen Vaughn said that despite a new book detailing one SEAL’s account of the bin Laden mission, it’s the desire of Team Six members to stay private. She told Fox News: “I can tell you one thing, SEAL Team Six did not want to be identified. So it wasn't that they were trying to be proud of them, because those men do not need a pat on the back. 'They don't work for that. They spend their entire lives in this code of secrecy and privacy, and […] they do not want attention.' The book, No Easy Day, was written by a retired Navy SEAL using the name Mark Owen, but Fox News later identified the man as 36-year-old Matt Bissonnette. Aaron Vaughn, who was 30 at the time of his death, left behind two children. It was just hours before the fatal mission Vaughn had called his wife, and spoke to his son for the last time. Wreckage: Vaughn was one of 17 Navy SEALs who perished in the helicopter crash, which occurred three months after the bin Laden raid .

Newcastle United fans had their stress levels measured when cutting up pictures of their team and their partners. Scroll down to watch video . The eternal question: Researchers at the University of Bristol have tasked themselves with finding out who football fans love more - their wives or their team . Cutting things down to size: The Newcastle United football fans were asked to cut up photos of their wives and their team to see which affected them the most . Despite the fans telling scientists that they had as much affection for their team as their wives, results showed that they were far more stressed when destroying a picture of their partner. They also had to choose between sticking needles into voodoo dolls of their favourite player and injuring him for the next game or their partner and making them ill for a week. Some fans had no problem laying their wife up in bed for a week if it meant their team’s star player would miss a crunch game. Marcus Munafr, professor of Biological Psychology at Bristol University, said: 'The data that we collected seemed to quite strongly support the idea that actually when it comes down to it they feel more strongly about their partners than their football tam.

Tearing up the team: The men weren't as affected by cutting up pictures of Newscastle United as they thought . 'Men in the UK and around the world are undoubtedly passionate about the beautiful game. 'What we set out to do was measure it in a scientific way and particularly focus on using techniques which allowed us to find out what they, the fans, were secretly thinking even when their actions may have been telling a different story.' Roger Harrison, from Puma, who commissioned the research said: 'As football fans we often hear about fans who suggest their team is more important than their girlfriend or spouse, so we decided to have some fun and put it to the test.

A senior detective has been arrested over allegations he stole property from a police store to sell on the internet. Det Sgt Peter Yeates is accused of taking the goods which are believed to be expensive mobile phones from an internal police store. The items held at the station include valuable possessions such as jewellery and money seized by officers during raids, confiscated stolen goods or lost property handed in by the public. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has confirmed it is supervising the investigation being carried out by Dorset Police . The officer, who works for a major crime unit that deals with the most serious cases including high-profile murders and organised crime, is accused of selling phones to unsuspecting customers on the internet auction site eBay. Yeates, who is known by some officers as 'Posh Pete' and 'Yuppie Yeates' for his well-spoken accent attained while growing up in colonial Rhodesia and grammar school in England, was due to retire from the force in just three weeks. But the 50-year-old detective is currently suspended after being arrested last week and questioned about the theft of missing property. The Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed it is supervising the investigation that is being carried out by Dorset Police. A source said: 'It's been all around the stations that he's been arrested for allegedly stealing phones from the store and selling them on eBay. 'He's a detective on the major crime unit and ironically has even been investigating fellow officers who are suspected of committing fraud. The goods missing from the internal store are believed to be expensive smartphones . 'Yeates was due to retire in a few weeks. 'He's called Yuppie Yeates and Posh Pete because of his plummy accent, smart suits and the way he talks about going to Bishop Wordsworth's School in Sailsbury. I'm sure he's really upset about this happening especially as he is so close to retiring.' Yeates, who lives in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, has a 13-year-old son and spends his weekends coaching his local junior rugby team. He wrote on his Facebook account: 'I have a 13 year old son for whom I will do anything. At the moment I am concentrating a lot of my efforts to try and get him into the senior school of his choice. 'In addition I have been the lead coach in his club rugby, Wimborne and have taken the team to become one of the strongest in his age group in the area.' There are strict rules about how long police can hold property that has been seized or handed in by the public after being found. If it is not claimed within a certain time period then it can be sold at auction by individual forces with the money being given to charities or to fund community policing. Dorset Police refused to deny or confirm Yeates's arrest despite giving the age, address and reason for arrest to the press for nearly all members of the public detained by the force. A spokesman said: . 'Unfortunately we do not confirm the identity of anyone who may or may not be subject to a police investigation. 'Also, we do not comment on internal staffing matters.' An IPCC spokesman said it was aware of the arrest of a Dorset officer for alleged theft and had decided to take a supervising role while the force carried out its investigation. Mr Yeates said: 'I'm terribly sorry, I'm not making any comment.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Det Sgt Peter Yeates, of Wimborne Minster, Dorset, is accused of taking goods from an internal police store .

'There was a good rollercoaster with loops, where you are lying horizontally, face forward, like you are flying. 'That was my favourite ride. The water log ride (‘Splash Of Monster Blood’) was pretty good too.' She added: 'We didn't have time to see everything but the rides we did go on were great.' Francesca also commented on a massive staircase which ominously leads to a stone castle. What possible horrors could await thrillseekers at the top? Just a cafe. '400 steps to a castle with a cafe would have been awesome if it there was a ride at the top,' she said.

Killer: Bradford Baumet, 36, opened fire inside a Casselberry hair salon, wounding his ex-girlfriend and gunning down two other women . A man shot dead three women inside a hair salon, including one who was five months pregnant, before turning the gun on himself on Thursday, police said. Investigators say the gunman, 36-year-old Bradford Baumet, opened fire at 11am in the Casselton Corners plaza shopping mall in Casselberry, Florida. Seminole County Fire Rescue officials report three people died and one was injured inside Las Dominicanas M & M Hair Salon. Baumet’s . ex-girlfriend Marcia Santiago, 44, who managed the salon was shot five times, according to her ex-husband, William Ayala, who spoke to her sister. Ayala said he had a daughter with Santiago and the girl lived with him. 'I heard he was violent and had a criminal record,' he said. Both she and . the owner, Eugenia Marte, had filed domestic violence injunctions . against Baumet in recent weeks. Santiago was scheduled to appear in court at 1.30pm yesterday for her domestic violence case. During that hearing, a judge would have decided whether to make the temporary injunction permanent. Josefa Herrera, Marte’s mother, told the Orlando Sentinel her daughter is among the dead, though police have not confirmed this. She also added that she had warned both Marte and Santiago to be cautious with Baumet because he would harm them. Dominicanas . employee Noelia Gonzalez, 28, who was five months pregnant, was shot dead along with salon customer Gladys Cabrera, 52, of Orlando. One witness, who didn’t want to be identified, said the gunman was her family member and may have had some mental problems. 'My . cousin, he’s been having problems. He’s mentally, like, not there. We’ve been telling them to keep away from him, keep away from him. Get a . restraining order,' the woman said. Victims: The gunman's ex-girlfriend Marcia Santiago, right, was injured, while salon owner Eugenia Marte, left, was killed . Motive: A relative of Baumet said he had mental illness issues and was in a rocky relationship with Santiago . Massacre: A man opened fire inside Las Dominicanas M & M Hair Salon in Central Florida, killing three women and injuring another before taking his own life . Heartbreak: Friends of the victims react to the shooting at a central Florida beauty salon in Casselberry . Records in Florida and Rhode Island show Baumet has been previously arrested for domestic assault, felony assault, stalking, burglary and drug possession. The wounded victim was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in serious condition, Bay News 9 reported. Casselberry Police spokeswoman Sara Brady said two other women who were at the salon at the time managed to escape unharmed. The women hid inside a bathroom and one ran outside through a back door. Juan Diaz, who works at the nearby Metro PCS store, recounted to the Orlando Sentinel how he and his customers heard gunshots at around 11am and saw the gunman as he left the salon. 'We saw the guy with the gun in his hand…..coming this way…on foot with the gun in his hand. 'When . we realized the guy was gone … we went in the hair salon. And once we . were in the hair salon we just saw a bunch of dead bodies,' Diaz said. According to police, Baumet was found . with a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound at a friends' house in a . residential area of Winter Park about five miles from the shopping . center. Seminole County Sheriff's deputies said he told friends: 'I have problems I cannot remedy,' before shooting himself inside the property. Legal matters: Both Santiago, left, and Marte, right, both had filed domestic violence injunctions against Baumet . The shooter appeared anxious and agitated when arrived at the home in the 1300 block of Paradise Lane, telling the couple who lived there that he had some problems he could not remedy, police said. Shortly after, Baumet  committed suicide without revealing to his friends what he had done. Three people were at the house at the time of the shooting. Baumet had had many . run-ins with the law in the past, with dozens of arrests in Florida and . Rhode Island, for charges that ran the gamut from making obscene phone . calls to stalking and burglary. As recently as last Sunday, the 36-year-old was in police custody for . allegedly operating a vehicle with a suspended license. He pleaded no . contest and was sentenced to time-served and a fine. In 2004, Baumet was arrested on charges of stalking and burglary. He . pleaded no contest, spent a short time behind bars and got two years of . probation. That same year, a woman filed a domestic violence injunction against . Baumet in Broward County. Earlier this year in Seminole County, Baumet . was sentenced to nearly a year in jail after pleading no contest to . selling pirated music CDs, according to court documents cited by the . Sentinel. Tragic end: The suspected gunman was found with a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound in a residential area of Winter Park . Trail of violence: Baumet told his friends he had a problem he could not fix, but did no reveal to them what he had done . Orange County court . records show that on October 5, Baumet drove to the Casselberry salon, . banged on the locked door and threatened to kill the women inside. Just days later, both Marte and Santiago filed and obtained temporary injunctions against Baumet. ‘I am scared and feel my life is in danger,’ Santiago wrote in her injunction application. Santiago also told the court about previous incidents, where Baumet manhandled her, forced her to have sex and made threats on her life. ‘I did not file right away because Brafort [sic] threatened me that if I file an injunction that he will kill me,’ Santiago stated. ‘I got scared.’ Shortly after the shooting, about two dozen mourners gathered near the salon, located in a strip mall. Police taped off the parking lot and officers stood guard outside the business. Yellow paper covered up some of the glass windows. A Dominican Republic flag hung in the storefront along with a neon sign that read: Hair Cut. Color. Perm. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the shooting spree was the second time in three weeks that men hunted down their former girlfriends at central Florida workplaces and shot multiple people, then killed themselves.","Bradford Baumet, 36, opened fire in the Casselberry shopping mall at 11am on Thursday .

Cleo the American Staffordshire pup was treated with a bottle and a half of vodka to cure her antifreeze poisoning . A 10-week-old puppy in danger of dying from poisoning after swallowing anti-freeze was saved by a strong dose of vodka – a whole bottle and a half! A vet put Cleo, an American Staffordshire, on the emergency hard liquor treatment as an antidote and the unusual treatment saved her life. She was today still getting over a hangover in a Melbourne veterinary surgery, but her owner, Miss Stacey Zammit was delighted that her four-legged friend was on the road to recovery. Cleo fell gravely ill after licking deadly radiator fluid ethylene glycol off spare car parts in a garage. Within half an hour she was swaying, rejecting food and at serious risk of death from kidney failure. Miss Zammit, from the Melbourne suburb of Truganina, rushed Cleo, a Christmas present, to the vet, who realised the dog was just a few hours away from total renal failure. By chance, the vet had a bottle of vodka, which was also a Christmas gift, handy and Cleo was immediately hooked up to the liquor, Melbourne’s Herald Sun newspaper reported. ‘The next time I saw her (the vet) I asked if she was wasted – drunk – and the vet was like “Yeah!”,’ said 27-year-old Miss Zammit. ‘Cleo had really bloodshot eyes and she was pretty unsteady. She couldn’t move around much because she was so wasted.’ Her wobbly condition was not surprising - she had been given vodka every six hours for two days through a tube in her nose. In less than 72 hours she had consumed almost a bottle and a half. An American Staffordshire terrier, like Cleo: Although the puppy was left unsteady on her feet and with bloodshot eyes, the treatment successfully halted the chemical reaction that would have led to renal failure . Vet Dr Yenny Indrawirawan said the ‘hair of the dog’ treatment was rare but effective. ‘The alcohol stops a chemical reaction in the body,’ Dr Indrawirawan said. ‘Without the vodka Cleo was likely to develop renal failure.’ Miss Zammit said the pup had just about beaten her hangover the same way that humans do – trying to ignore it. ‘She slept a lot and she was eating a lot, but she seems really happy now,’ said Miss Zammit.","American Staffordshire pup Cleo was rushed to the vets after licking anti-freeze off spare car parts in a garage .

The home on State Line Road is one of several startup-friendly locations that have sprouted up in Kansas City in recent months. The catalyst is Google Fiber, the search-engine giant's fiber-optic network being tested in the Kansas City area that advertises speeds of up to a gigabyte per second - a rate that massively exceeds the average Internet speeds at homes hooked up with cable modems. Heart of the 'Prairie Valley': Matthew Marcus, founder of the Kansas City Startup Village, plans the next move at his desk. Google's fiber-optic internet network is encouraging tech companies to move to Kansas City . Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. The search engine giant's decision to test their new, ultrafast internet service in Kansas City has had many benefits in the region . The advantage here for startups is simple: A fast Internet pipe makes it easier to handle large files and eliminates buffering problems that plague online video, live conferencing or other network-intensive tasks. Though the Kansas City location presents challenges for startups, including the ability to raise money outside the traditional Silicon Valley venture capital scene, entrepreneurs like Synthia Payne believe it's the place to be right now for up-and-coming tech companies. Payne is one of those entrepreneurs hoping to launch her startup dream - an Internet subscription service for musicians who want to collaborate online - on the cheap. She shares the State Line Road house, known as the 'Home for Hackers,' with other startups under a deal that allows them to live rent-free while they develop their business plans. Kansas City, Missouri, which is profiting from tests of Google Fiber with startups flocking to the area . Google's network was attractive, Payne said, because her business plan 'is dependent upon really good, really fast Internet.' 'Without this on-ramp here I probably would have found it very difficult to come here,' said Payne, who in December moved from Denver to develop CyberJammer. Residents here were thrilled when Google announced last year that Kansas City, Kansas, and neighboring Kansas City, Missouri, would be its test bed for Google Fiber. The California-based company spent months and unknown sums installing optical fiber around the area. Google provides the full gigabit service for $70 a month and its own cable-TV like service for another $50. A slower Internet connection is free on a monthly basis after a $300 installation fee. The first homes were installed with fiber optics in the fall, with more 'fiberhoods' planned in stages over the next several months. Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, remain Google's only fiber market, though the company has said it plans additional roll-outs. Entrepreneur Synthia Payne stands in her workspace at The Home for Hackers collaboration in Kansas City, Kansas. Payne moved to Kansas from Denver as her business plan is dependent on a fast internet connection . Many in the tech industry believe Google's move could ultimately force broadband providers to accelerate their networks to compete. Making Internet access faster would give the company more opportunities to attract traffic and sell more advertising - the main way Google makes money. The 'Home for Hackers' and its unique business pitch is the brainchild of local web developer Ben Barreth, whose property was among the first wave of houses to be fiber-wired and is a block away from the Google Fiber offices. 'Hackers' who pass Barreth's application process and show a real intention to work on a viable project can live there rent-free for three months. Hotspot: Kansas City technology companies, like those at the Startup Village, are flourishing . Since starting the home in October after cashing in his Roth IRA and putting a down payment on the $48,000 home, Barreth has gotten applications from nearly 60 people seeking a spot in the home. 'The whole startup thing in Kansas City is like this huge growing beast,' he said. 'It's got this crazy momentum.' The house has been full since mid-December with Payne and two others. One of the rooms also is reserved for fiber tourists who want a place for a day or two where they can download anything faster than they could elsewhere. 'The hope is that these startups will move their operations to Kansas City and this will really bless Kansas City, bring jobs and taxes and we'll build a really cool tech scene,' Barreth said. Matthew Marcus works at his desk in the basement of Kansas City Startup Village. The Village now houses several startup companies . A few homes away from the 'Home for Hackers' is the headquarters of the Kansas City Startup Village, which was started by local entrepreneur Matthew Marcus and where Mike Farmer, founder of mobile search app Leap2.com, has his offices. Farmer said Google Fiber brought attention to Kansas City's startup culture, 'because it sort of ignites the imagination about what you can do with that sort of bandwidth capability.' 'Most every week I meet one or two or three people that are looking to come in from out of town,' he said. Despite the growth, it remains a challenge for startups to raise money from Kansas City, Farmer said. Silicon Valley venture capital groups in particular want startup entrepreneurs to be nearby in California, he said. 'I've had some really incredible conversations with some big name VCs, and their first statement is that when you're in this early stage you have to be here, right next to us,' he said. 'That is a hurdle.' Andy Kallenbach recently launched FormZapper.com, an online forms management site, and also has offices near the 'Home for Hackers.' He said Kansas City has no aspirations to be the next Silicon Valley and may never have a 'Facebook or a giant consumer-level company that takes over the world.' He said it may also be 'better for us' that it's more difficult to raise money in Kansas City.'The hardest thing about a startup is execution, OK? A lot of people can go out and raise money and get money for an idea or for some product or they can come up with some awesome presentation. But it doesn't matter if you can't build something that people will use,' Kallenbach said. 'I think here in Kansas City you have to at some point put your money where your mouth is. You have to ""do.""' Synthia Payne shows a room set aside for 'fiber tourists' at The Home for Hackers .","Google tests its new fiber-optic network, much faster than cable modems, in Kansas City .

Education Secretary Michael Gove was accused of being 'deeply frustrating' to work with by former children's minister Tim Loughton . Education Secretary Michael Gove was today accused of running his ministry like the department store in seventies sitcom Are You Being Served? Tim Loughton accused Education Secretary . Michael Gove, his old boss, of behaving like Young Mr Grace, the . out-of-touch department store owner in the comedy who barely knew the people who worked for him. And the former children’s minister slammed the ‘declining’ priority given to children and families' issues, accusing Mr Gove of ‘complete radio silence’ on the subject. Giving evidence to the Commons Education Committee, Mr Loughton painted a devastating picture of the Department for Education (DfE) as inefficient and bureaucratic with an ‘upstairs downstairs mentality’. ‘Most officials have never met the Secretary of State other than when he will troop out a few chosen people for the new year party, Mr Grace-like from Grace Brothers, and tell us we've all done terribly well and then disappear,’ he said. ‘That is no way to run an important department. It is terribly anachronistic, terribly bureaucratic, terribly formal.’ Mr Loughton said that when he was a minister, children and families had been a ‘declining priority’ within the DfE, which appeared to have been further ‘downgraded’ since the reshuffle last September. ‘There is a particular area around child exploitation where the department seems to have gone on complete radio silence at a time when sexual abuse of children has never had a higher profile in public consciousness and the media post-Savile,’ he said. Mr Loughton said Mr Gove was like the elderly Young Mr Grace (centre) in 1970s sitcom Are You Being Served? who rarely met or visited those working on the shop floor . ‘That is deeply, deeply worrying and I hope that doesn't signify any downgrading of the priority that it absolutely is.’ He said that when he became a minister he had been alarmed to discover that many of the officials in the DfE responsible for drawing up child protection regulations had never even met a social worker. ‘These were people who were drawing up the regulations, who were responsible for government safeguarding policy ... and too many people working in the Department for Education had never actually been out with a social worker before, which I found alarming,’ he said. There was a culture of not answering questions properly at the department, Mr Loughton told MPs . ‘If the department is going to be a delivery department, we need to have more people who actually know about the job and what it delivers rather than producing a nice glossy brochure and thinking that that's the end of the story.’ Mr Loughton also complained ministers never met without civil servants present and that the weekly ministerial meeting was frequently either cancelled or attended by ‘a cast of thousands’ which made it impossible to discuss strategic thinking. Mr Loughton also complained ministers never met without civil servants present and that the weekly ministerial meeting was frequently either cancelled or attended by ""a cast of thousands"" which made it impossible to discuss strategic thinking. 'Too often one was having to double guess what the boss (Mr Gove) might think. It was deeply frustrating,' he said. At the same time the way the department worked was 'deeply inefficient', with ministers denied open access to the officials working for them. 'There is a bit of an upstairs downstairs mentality. The ministers were all posted on the seventh floor. Officials were summoned to your office,' he said. 'When I just wanted to have a quick chat with a particular official about a query it had to be a diarised meeting and that person was summoned. Occasionally I played hooky and actually went to another floor. It was like a state visit. 'I literally had to give my private office the slip in order to go and have a two-minute conversation with an official.' He said there was a culture within the department of giving 'as little information as possible' when it came to answering MPs' questions, with the responses vetted by special advisers before they were signed off by ministers. 'The parliamentary question system is there for parliamentarians to ask for information to which they are entitled. I think we as ministers and we as a department have a duty to give it. That was not the culture in the Department for Education,' he said.","Former children's minister Tim Loughton takes aim at his old boss .

Workers have begun dismantling the crane on top of a London skyscraper which was hit by a helicopter yesterday. Hundreds of local residents are unable to return to their homes due to the damaged machinery dangling 500ft in the air on top of The Tower, St George Wharf in Vauxhall. A mobile crane belonging to a hire firm arrived at the scene of the accident at 9.30 this morning to start the process of securing the damaged crane. In addition, the UK's largest crane is on it way to the site to help with the operation of replacing the machinery with a new model. Scroll down for video . Repair: Workmen today on top of the crane which was hit by a helicopter in Vauxhall . Jeopardy: Workmen scaled the equipment today to assess the damage done to it by yesterday's crash . If contractors are still working tomorrow, they will have to contend with snow and high winds as well as freezing temperatures. The crane was damaged when it was hit by a helicopter piloted by experienced flyer Peter Barnes yesterday morning. Mr . Barnes died in the crash along with pedestrian Matt Wood, but two crane . operators were saved from certain death after arriving at work late. The . ongoing danger posed by the dangling crane means that homes and offices . nearby have been completely closed, while motorists are being urged to . avoid the area. Damaged: This crane at St George Wharf is dangling over the street after being hit by a helicopter yesterday . Debris: A section of the crane was left lying in Nine Elms Lane after the collision . Damage: Remains of a helicopter sit on the roof of a building today. Police cordons have remained in place . Fuselage: The damaged rotor of the plane was one of many pieces of the helicopter mechanism on the ground . Police barriers are expected to remain in place until the middle of next week, but this morning contractors from crane firm Ainscough were allowed past to begin working on the site. The UK's tallest mobile crane, which stands at 96m, is also set to arrive at the site later today and will start work on Saturday morning, according to Construction News. It will help remove the damaged crane and replace it with a new piece of machinery which will continue the construction on St George Wharf. 'We are taking down the jib and everything today,' Tony Pidgley, chairman of the tower's developer Berkeley, told Construction News. 'There’s only one crane in the country that’s big enough to get it out, and that’s been travelling overnight down from the North.' A spokesman for Ainscough said that . the firm would be unable to estimate how long it would take to secure . the crane until workers could survey the damage thoroughly. 'Our contractors are on site to help assist emergency service,' he said. 'It is difficult to know how long it will take to get it down until we get up there and assess the damage.' Removal: This huge vehicle arrived at the site this morning to start the process of removing the crane . Getting to work: Police closed off the area for the contractors hired to secure the building site today . Lengthy process: It is unclear when the area will be made safe for residents and office workers to return . The company's work could be delayed by the poor weather forecast for Friday and the weekend. The capital is set to be hit by perilous blizzards and sub-zero temperatures as up to four inches of snow are expected to fall. Local residents have been ordered to stay away from the area due to the danger posed by the crane and the debris strewn around the roads. New Covent Garden flower . market, where a trader was hit in the leg by the helicopter's gearbox, . remained closed today, although the fruit and vegetable market was open. Residents of the tower which was hit were put up at the upmarket Park Plaza hotel in Embankment by managers of the development. Preparation: Three trucks carrying crane equipment arrived at the site this morning . Cleaning up: A team of police officers inspecting the area around the crash site on Thursday . Tidying: Officials were seen today removing the parts of the helicopter which were distributed around the area . One resident, Stephen Swan, said officials had given no indication of when they might be allowed to return. 'It is annoying because we have been kept in the dark over when it will be,' he said. 'It could be today, it could be next week - we just don't know as they are not saying anything.' A . site supervisor who had been working at St George Wharf said the area . had been abandoned by workers over concerns the building was unsafe. 'There may be structural damage so the building has been locked down,' he said. Investigation: Authorities are removing the wreckage in order to determine the cause of the accident . Search: Forensic teams investigated the wreckage on the closed-off roads today . Tidy: Workers in hard hats were seen piling the wreckage into large bags . Hundreds of others are believed to have been evacuated from other buildings in Vauxhall - but although Lambeth and Wandsworth councils set up a rest centre for those affected, no one stayed there over Wednesday night. A spokesman for Wandsworth council suggested that most residents had been able to stay with friends or relatives instead, adding: 'You open up the rest centre because you have to - and you never know'. Train and Tube services were running normally today after Vauxhall station was closed yesterday, but Transport for London warned motorists and bus passengers to expect delays and diversions.

A young boy has been admitted to hospital with burns to his throat and stomach after he drank caustic soda while in a shop. Police were called shortly before 7.35pm on Monday by staff at the Manchester Children's Hospital after the two-year-old boy was admitted. The toddler was shopping with his mother when they went into the Safa cash and carry shop in Claremont Road in the Moss Side area of Manchester, on Sunday, a police spokesman said. Serious but stable: The toddler was taken to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital with throat burns . The child was strapped into his push chair and when his mother was not looking he reached over to a bottle containing caustic soda, took the top off and drank some. The toddler remains in hospital today where his condition is described as serious but stable. A joint investigation by Greater Manchester Police and Cheshire East Council Trading Standards is now under way. Superintendent Sarah Jones, from the South Manchester Division, said: 'Caustic soda is a highly toxic chemical commonly found in drain and oven cleaners. 'If it is touched, inhaled or swallowed it can cause severe burns. This little boy took a drink from a bottle and is now seriously ill in hospital.

A 14-year-old girl was killed from fumes by a barbecue her parents placed inside her tent to keep her warm during a family camping trip, an inquest heard today. Hannah Thomas-Jones died from the 'silent killer' of carbon monoxide after sleeping next to the fire, while the other members of her family were hospitalised after their exposure to the gas. Her parents wept as they told the hearing how they had taken pains to minimise the risk of a fire, but were unaware of the dangers posed by carbon monoxide. Tragedy: Hannah Thomas-Jones died of carbon monoxide poisoning in May last year . Holiday: Hannah, pictured, was camping with her family in Shropshire at the time of her death . Hannah, from Handforth in Cheshire, was pronounced dead by paramedics after they were called to a campsite in Bucknell, Shropshire in May last year. Her brother, mother and stepfather were treated in hospital for the effects of carbon monoxide, but the 14-year-old was the member of the family who was closest to the bucket-type barbecue which produced the fumes. Hannah's mother, Danielle Jones, frequently wiped away tears as she told the inquest in Wem, Shropshire how paramedics informed her that her daughter could not be revived on. Mrs Jones, who paid tribute to Hannah as a 'beautiful and wonderful' person, said several members of her family were staying at the Baron of Beef campsite, where they watched the FA Cup Final in a pub. Heartbroken: Hannah's mother Danielle, right, and stepfather Phillip, left, leaving her inquest today . After the football match had finished, the family had used the blue Tesco barbecue, which had three metal legs, to keep warm underneath a gazebo. But after Hannah went to bed, the barbecue was moved into the porch of the tent she was sleeping in. Mrs Jones, who said it was a cold night, told the coroner: 'We decided to take the barbecue into the porch area of the tent. 'We made sure that effectively it was fire-proof - that if anything fell out it wouldn't catch fire. 'Obviously, we didn't understand the dangers of the carbon monoxide.' Tents: The family used a portable barbecue at the campsite in Bucknell, pictured . Inquest: The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death on Thursday . When she awoke the next morning, Mrs Jones' arms and legs felt sore and she could not talk. 'Then I remember a lot of shouting - I remember both the sides of the tent being opened,' she said. 'I just couldn't do anything, I couldn't breathe.' Her husband, Philip Jones, told the coroner the barbecue had 'gone down' by the time it was placed in the tent, and was 'like hot bricks giving off heat'. Shaun Baker, of Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, recreated the effects of the barbecue during a detailed investigation of the incident. The fire officer said efforts had been made to highlight the dangers posed by carbon monoxide from barbecues in the wake of several deaths in similar circumstances. Mr Baker told the court many people did not realise that 'incomplete combustion' after flames had died down could result in the emission of carbon monoxide, which is odourless. Warning: Officials used the case to alert the public to the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning . Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning - including headaches or dizziness - can mimic many common ailments, and may easily be confused with food poisoning, viral infections, flu or simply tiredness. Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner John Ellery told members of Hannah's family: 'It's quite clear that you and many, many people were unaware of the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. 'The risk you were addressing when you brought that barbecue in, in its dying embers, was against fire. 'That was a risk you acted against, but sadly what was happening was that carbon monoxide was coming from those embers. 'I accept that those vapours went to the top of the tent and probably found their way down to the far end, where tragically Hannah's head was.' Mr Ellery said he hoped the case would help educate the public about the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.","Hannah Thomas-Jones died during Shropshire camping holiday last year .
