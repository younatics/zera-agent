"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When the Vatican switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, legend has it that riots broke out over the ""lost 11 days"" the shift caused. However, on the Pacific island of Samoa - which plans to skip Friday this week when it switches to the west side of the international dateline -- the mood is more typically laid back and Polynesian. ""Sure, people are excited,"" government spokesman Uale Papalii was reported as saying to foreign media. ""I myself am relaxed, (we are) only changing the calendar."" The decision to push the international dateline further to the east and go back to the future -- going directly from Thursday to Saturday -- was prompted by new economic realities rather than a need to be the first place in the world to celebrate New Year's Day in 2012. Samoan prime minister, Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi, said the move would put the Pacific island nation of some 180,000 people on the same footing as its key trading partners in New Zealand and Australia, taking advantage of those economies links to China and the Pacific Rim. ""In doing business with New Zealand and Australia we're losing out on two working days a week,"" he was quoted as saying in the English-language Samoa Observer. ""While its Friday here, it's Saturday in New Zealand and when we're at church Sunday, they're already conducting business in Sydney and Brisbane."" Currently, the archipelago is 21 hours behind Australia and 23 behind New Zealand, giving it just four working days a week that coincide with some of the Pacific Rim's largest economies. By moving the zig-zagging international dateline further to the east, Samoa will be just three hours ahead of eastern Australia and one hour ahead of New Zealand. The international dateline -- which follows roughly 180 degrees longitude but takes diversions around islands and territories to prevent it dissecting nations internally - already creates serious anomalies for Samoa. Its closest neighbor Tonga, little more than 800km to the south, is exactly 24 hours behind the island nation. The move, however, has raised alarm in the tourism sector which markets Samoa as the last place on earth to see the sun set and has run into opposition. ""It's a crazy idea. I see no reasoning behind a time change,"" Samoan resident Valentina Tufuga told the Samoa Observer. ""For years we have been trading well with Australia and New Zealand despite the time difference. I think it will just be a major loss to the tourism sector who can no longer boast that Samoa is the last country in the world to see the sun."" While the switch means Samoa gains a new status as the first place on the planet to see the dawn, the tourist industry has judged this to be a less romantic and lucrative option for beachside honeymooners. Tuilaepa has countered the tourist industry could easily set up a new draw card by marketing itself as destination where tourists can celebrate birthdays and anniversaries twice -- American Samoa, just an hour away by plane, will remain on the other side of the international dateline. It's not the first time Samoa has crossed the international dateline. In 1892, the then king of Samoa was persuaded to cross the line to fall into step with American ships sailing westward to San Francisco. That shift, which gave the Samoan calendar an extra day that had to be absorbed with two consecutive July the Fourths, is now coming back in the form of this week's missing Friday; a situation that local media has mockingly referred to as TGIF or Thank God It's Friday. Tuilaepa, whose Human Rights Protection Party has ruled Samoa since 1979, is no stranger to controversy. Two years ago the government switched to driving on the left so that expat Samoans in Australia and New Zealand could send used cars home to their relatives. Samoa had been driving on the right side of the road since 1900, when it was a German colony, and the change drew an outcry from motorists who defaced signs advising people to ""keep left"" and denounced the decision as a major hazard on the island's already dangerous roads. Bus companies, in particular, strongly opposed the move and called on the government to compensate them for the cost refitting their passenger doors on the left hand side.","Samoa plans to switch to the west side of the international dateline at the end of this week .

"(CNN) -- The stubborn Beaver Creek wildfire has 1,200 firefighters toiling tirelessly in Idaho to keep it from spreading. The wildfire scorching Sun Valley, Idaho, has already consumed more than 100,000 acres, and threatened 5,000 homes. Sun Valley is home to many pricey spreads, including second homes reportedly owned by actors Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis. Lightning ignited the fire more than two weeks ago. Over the weekend, firefighters benefited from cloud cover and higher humidity. But they only managed to establish 9% by early Monday morning. Photos: 'Wall of fire' threatens homes . The forecast for the next couple of days brings both good and bad news. The rain from thunderstorms could help quench the flames, while lightning might spark new fires. Gov. Butch Otter had nothing but praise for the crews. ""They look the worst for wear but you see that smile come across their face and their attitude about how they're being treated and how they're being supported by our local folks, by the county folks, the city folks (and) the state department of lands,"" he said. Academy Award-winning actor Richard Dreyfus was among those expressing gratitude. ""The #beavercreekfire is ravaging my family's hometown, Ketchum, ID,"" Dreyfus posted on his official Twitter account. ""Thank you, firefighters, and be safe. Houses aren't worth lives."" The fire isn't the only one burning up Idaho. At least nine large fires have scorched 407,883 acres across Idaho, which is experiencing the most wildland fire activity of any state, according to the Boise-based National Interagency Fire Center. Meanwhile, a brush fire in Polk County, Oregon, destroyed a family's private vineyard. Its cause? Fire officials believe the owner hit rocks witha lawn mower sparking it. ""That ignited the area around him, and before they could contain it, it started spreading, and as you can tell by the wind up here, it didn't take long for it to spread,"" Bill Hahn, fire chief of Southwest Polk, told CNN affiliate KOIN. Soggy South . Meanwhile, a stalled front stretching along the Gulf and Southeast Coasts will bring heavy rain through early this week, fueled by abundant moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Flood watches and warnings are in place from the Florida panhandle to the Carolinas. Soils in this region are saturated, creating a potential for flash floods. Six inches of rain soaked southern Mississippi Sunday, leaving First United Gospel Assembly church in Gulfport surrounded by waist-deep water. ""We were in service and we came out and it was flooded out here,"" Bishop Otis Rankin who told CNN affiliate WLOX, looking across the church parking lot. The only worse flooding, he said, was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The flood waters hit William Harold too. ""We're in a low lying area, so it floods from time to time, but I got up and there was actually two inches of water in the den,"" he said. ""So we grabbed all the towels we could and started sopping up what we could."" Rip currents . In South Florida, strong onshore winds and choppy surf stirred up rip currents throughout the weekend in South Florida, drowning an elderly couple off Miami Beach. Police said it was one of 50 incidents where swimmers had to rescued from the rough waters. The couple were swimming with a red float, appearing fine one minute and under water the next, witnesses told CNN affiliate WSVN. Beachgoers along with Ocean Rescue guards rushed to pull them from the water, according to WSVN. ""They were in cardiac arrest when fire rescue arrived,"" said Capt. Adonis Garcia, spokesman for Miami Beach Fire Rescue. ""We worked them all the way to the hospital at Mount Sinai when they were pronounced dead."" CNN's Dave Alsup, Jessica Jordan, Paul Vercammen, Indra Petersons and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Beaver Creek Fire has scorched more than 100,000 acres .

"Washington (CNN) -- Gay rights activist Kevin Cathcart remembers keenly the day President Barack Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage. There sat Obama, who for years had frustrated many in the gay community by not supporting same-sex marriage, telling ABC's Robin Roberts that conversations with his daughters and friends led him to change his mind. ""When it finished I hit the replay button and I watched it again,"" said Cathcart, executive director of LAMBDA Legal, a gay civil rights organization. ""Then I hit the replay button and watched it again."" Obama hosted a White House reception Friday in honor of Gay Pride month, an event that brought the president full circle with a community whose support helped launch him into the Oval Office. ""After decades of inaction and indifference, you have every reason and right to push loudly and forcefully for equality,"" Obama said at the event. ""But three years ago I promised you this, I said that even if it took more time that I would like, we would see progress, we would see success, we would see real and lasting change, and together that's what we're witnessing."" It is also a community that, according to a recent CNN analysis of the president's biggest openly gay ""bundlers,"" or fundraisers, helped add at least $8 million to Obama's campaign coffers between January and the end of March. ""President Obama has the enormous admiration and appreciation of not just gay people, but people who care about gay people: our family, loved ones and friends. He has shown moral leadership and taken tremendous steps to end discrimination against gays,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry. The president ""made such a heartfelt and personal description of how he had changed his mind (on allowing gays to legally marry). It's the very same journey that a majority of Americans have taken."" According to a recent CNN/ORC International Poll, 54% of Americans support legalizing marriages between gay and lesbian couples, with 42% opposed. Sixty percent of Americans also say they have a close friend or family member who is gay. This would seem to suggest good news for Obama, a man who Newsweek magazine recently dubbed America's ""first gay president."" Given his opposition to same-sex marriage and the pressure an openly gay staffer faced from conservatives, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will be hard-pressed to get similar support from the gay and lesbian community. ""My sense is that Romney perceives that not only to secure the nomination but to get the support of the Republican base he needs, he has to take a hard right stand on the issue of same-sex marriage,"" said Craig Rimmerman, professor of public policy and political science at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and author of ""From Identity to Politics: The Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States."" Romney has not received an endorsement from Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian GOP organization. Up until about eight weeks ago, some gay rights activists were feeling similarly tepid about Obama, Cathcart said. As a candidate in the last presidential election, Obama enjoyed rock star status among the gay and lesbian community. High-profile, openly gay figures such as musician Melissa Etheridge and DreamWorks SKG mogul David Geffen joined a grassroots army of supporters at campaign rallies for the Illinois senator. But once in office, President Obama's efforts at pressing the case for gay rights were more muted, gay rights activists said. Some in the community even felt betrayed. ""The administration has done a great deal, but a lot of it was under the radar and less visible and people were focused on the big things,"" Cathcart said. "" 'Don't ask, don't tell' took a long time and his evolution on marriage took a long time."" Still, some activists found reason to hope for change. The Obama administration criticized a measure in North Carolina, a swing state, that banned same-sex marriage and made civil unions illegal. The president took the same position on a similar Minnesota proposal. On Friday, when the Pentagon held its first Gay Pride event, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta highlighted the administration's biggest accomplishment in the gay rights cause: repealing ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the military's ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the forces. ""The successful repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' proved to the nation that just like the country we defend, we share different backgrounds, different values and different beliefs but together we are the greatest military force in the world,"" Panetta said Friday in a video message to troops. The administration's push to emphasize the White House's support of gay rights is meant to signal to supporters in that community that the president still stands with them, Rimmerman said. ""My sense is that it is going to firm up his support in the lesbian and gay community,"" Rimmerman said. Obama ""has been quite cautious in how he approaches significant policy changes. He was afraid to take the lead on this issue until he felt it could be politically justified. It suggests to me a degree of caution that's probably unwarranted given what he promised as a candidate.""","Obama has boosted his bona fides with gay community .

"(CNN) -- Outdoor dining, fresh ingredients and local festivals make summer the perfect season for food lovers to explore the world. Check out these 10 destinations for fresh summer eats. See more top summer food destinations . Istria, Croatia . In Istria, Croatia's northern peninsula, the land is bursting with all things green. Vineyards flank winding roads. Trees, heavy with figs and peaches, hang over garden gates. Croatia's 1,390-square-mile northern peninsula is known for its freshly caught seafood, terraced olive groves, hilltop vineyards and truffles. Head to 120-year-old Kabola, Istria's first green-certified winery, to taste wines that have been partly aged in amphoras, or clay vessels. The family vintners are especially passionate about regional Malvazija grapes; if you like red, don't miss the peppery 2009 Teran. Afterward, drive 15 minutes south to dine on cuttlefish in its own ink topped with silky puréed potatoes and a generous portion of black truffle shavings at San Rocco Hotel's restaurant. Beyond Croatia, summer's food groups are as distinctive as countries themselves. 10 surprising facts about turbulence . Northern Italy . The weather in northern Italy might be similar to neighboring Croatia, for example, but altitude and Austrian influences in the Dolomites means regional specialties include pork sausages and apple strudel. Regional specialties such as speck (smoked ham), cajinci (a ravioli with ricotta and spinach), and wild berries pair well with hikes and overnights in rifugios, or mountain huts, in this northern corner of Italy. Head there with Whole Foods' new tour company, Whole Journeys, at the end of August. The seven-day itinerary includes a hands-on cooking lesson—Alto Adige gnocchi is one menu highlight—a private dinner in a century-old vineyard, and yogurt-making classes on a dairy farm. Turks and Caicos . Whether you resort hop or hit local hotspots on the Turks and Caicos Islands, be sure to pair a cool Turks head beer with conch, a Caribbean specialty. You'll find the sweet shell meat fried, stewed and served ceviche style at weekly Island Fish Fries, where travelers and island residents mingle on the beach and local ""rake and scrape"" bands bang out tunes. Or head to haute restaurants such as Parallel23 at the Regent Palms Hotel, where new chef Ingo Möller serves up flaky sea bass and fresh crab rolls; meals end with dessert and cocktails on a moonlit beach. August also means lobster season on the islands, something Grace Bay Club's Anacaona restaurant celebrates with a decadent lobster tasting menu. America's best urban running trails . Portland, Oregon . Progressive culinary scenes in cities like Portland, Oregon, mean farmers and chefs have close relationships, so seasonal summer ingredients such as heirloom tomatoes, hazelnuts and sorrel don't travel far before landing on your plate at locally loved restaurants like Castagna. You could also sign up for a farm dinner or trip with Farm to Fork, a food, wine and agritourism event company that creates culinary experiences that directly link consumers with craft winemakers, food artisans and family farmers throughout the state. On a four-day canoeing trip down the Rogue River, for example, participants take cooking classes and stop by vineyards and leafy orchards. Montreal, Canada . It's no wonder that Montreal earns frequent comparisons to Paris: The city's culinary culture—influenced by 80 rich ethnicities and a genuine focus on local—is a favorite among foodies, especially during warmer summer months. Neighborhoods are dotted with patisseries and boulangeries and the city's restaurant scene—there are more than 5,500 to choose from—has standout options such as the hip La Salle á Manger, where spicy fried rabbit and halibut ceviche make the menu and Nora Gray, where chef Emma Cardarelli turns out rich venison tartare and house-made pasta. Madrid, Spain . Global capitals also vie for attention. ""Madrid is the place—do not hesitate!"" says Virginia Irurita of Made for Spain tour company, based in the Spanish capital. Her enthusiasm isn't just rooted in particular chefs and dishes, but also in Spain's summer food traditions: Café tables spread out along sidewalks and in park squares, and boisterous crowds sip Tinto de verano, a refreshing wine spritzer, until late at night. World's best airport spas . Cape Town, South Africa . While Cape Town is not at its weather peak in June through August, popular restaurants stay packed with travelers looking to bookend a South African safari with an urban jaunt. Among the culture capital's latest offerings, chef Bruce Robertson, formerly of Cape Grace and the Showroom Restaurant in Cape Town, now hosts bespoke dining experiences—a five-course, seafood-focused menu paired with South African wines—at the intimate Boat House in Scarborough just outside of the city. Colorado . Dining also heads outdoors in Colorado, where crisp, dry air and 75-degree days invite foraging excursions and food festivals. Here, cozy lodges' winter comfort foods and après-ski hot toddies have given way to farmers' markets and restaurants with sprawling terraces. Brooklyn, New York . Restaurant access alone is what defines summer dining to many New Yorkers. In Brooklyn, where up-and-coming restaurants are overrun by travelers in fall and spring months, hotter temps mean saying goodbye to tourists and finally getting seated at popular restaurants such as Battersby and Runner & Stone. Dubai . No matter what the season, you might still get denied entry to Dubai restaurants such as At.mosphere, the world's tallest at 1,350 feet, where doormen ask for a reservation code. With a $122 per person minimum, rejection might be a blessing in sleek disguise—and there are plenty of other posh options to choose from in the Middle Eastern culture capital.

"(CNN) -- Tyrone Garrett's father wasn't around while he was growing up. So when Garrett's girlfriend, Whitney Hammond, told him she was pregnant, he knew he had to make a change. Garrett, then 26, weighed 335 pounds. Like many members of his family, he had high blood pressure, but he refused to take medication. One time at work, his heart started beating so fast he could see it moving up and down through his shirt. Hammond rushed him to the doctor, who warned that he was dangerously close to having a heart attack. ""It was the scariest thing in my life,"" Garrett says. That experience, combined with the arrival of baby London, on March 5, 2011, finally inspired him to get fit. ""Being around for my only child was something I made a priority,"" Garrett says, his voice warming as he talks about his daughter. ""She's awesome."" Garrett bought a set of workout clothes and a pair of running shoes and headed to the gym. ""I remember it like it was yesterday,"" the Manchester, Connecticut, resident says. ""I was nervous in front of everybody because I was so obese."" His first workout included a little bit of everything. Without a trainer, Garrett followed his instincts. His only rule in the beginning was to sweat. A lot. After a while, he turned to the Internet to learn more about nutrition. He started watching what he ate and counting calories. He stayed away from foods that were high in sodium to lower his blood pressure and avoided sweets. In the first month, he dropped 50 pounds. Over the next year and a half, he lost 130 pounds. He has shed about 10 more pounds since then. Have you lost weight? Share your story . Garrett wakes up every morning at 3 or 4. He hits the gym, doing at least 45 minutes of cardio and two hours of weight training. Sometimes he swims laps. Other times he sits in the sauna to ""sweat out the toxins."" He brings light snacks such as bananas and protein bars to keep up his energy during the long workout. After three or four hours, he heads to work. He has a full-time job and two part-time ones to support Hammond and London. ""They are my drive and my support system on this (w)eight loss journey,"" he wrote on CNN's iReport.com. After work is daddy-daughter time. Occasionally, if there's time after London is in bed, Garrett heads to the gym again. Hammond fully supports her fiance's near-obsessive workout schedule. ""(He) just wants to maintain what he worked so hard for,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""And if I need him, no matter what machine he's doing, he will drop it and run to his family."" The couple met in high school and have been together for almost 13 years. Their wedding is set for June 15. ""His weight loss has changed his whole outlook on life,"" Hammond says. ""He loves his new lifestyle and only wants to go up from here."" Garrett's changes have crept into Hammond's life as well. She's altered her eating habits and takes her daughter on daily walks to stay active. She's looking forward to a long life with her future husband. Garrett doesn't allow himself full cheat days -- ""the fear of messing up and going backward is still there"" -- but he does splurge once in a while on some extra chicken wings or a bigger meal than usual. There are days when his legs and arms hurt and his bones ache from all the exercise, but he reminds himself that no one else can do the work for him. He's at 194 pounds and wants to reach 180. That said, any extra weight loss at this point is simply a bonus to being healthy. ""As long as I can wake up every morning and breathe in and out, I'm cool with everything else,"" Garrett says. He loves to go outside and play with his daughter without breathing heavily or sweating excessively. He likes not having to worry about going to the doctor or taking medications. He's thrilled that others have been inspired by his story; a co-worker lost 80 pounds and several family members have lost more than 50. ""It's coming from me,"" he says, almost in disbelief. ""You never would have thought I would be a lean guy. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it's real.""

"(CNN) -- A woman has accused George Zimmerman, the man charged in the fatal shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, of having sexually abused her for about a decade, beginning when she was 6 years old and he was 8. ""He would reach under the blankets and try to do things and I would try to push him off,"" said the woman, who is identified only as Witness 9 and whose account was released Monday in audio recordings that a judge ordered last week be made public. ""He was bigger and stronger and older. It was in front of everybody. And I don't know how I didn't say anything. But I just didn't know any better,"" she said. Zimmerman asks for another new judge . CNN spoke to the woman's father, who said neither he nor any other member of the family would be speaking on the subject. The woman did not respond to a request for comment. Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's attorney, released a statement Monday responding to the allegations. In it, he said his client was not yet 8 years old when the alleged abuse began, and that he was 17 when it was alleged to have ended. O'Mara said the woman is Zimmerman's cousin. In a motion filed June 18, O'Mara called the accuser's statement ""not relevant to the issues of this case,"" and said the allegations are inadmissible. He added that its disclosure risked leading to ""widespread hostile publicity which would substantially impair the Defendant's fair trial rights, and would pose a serious threat to the administration of justice."" ""Now that this statement is part of the public record, the defense will vigorously defend Mr. Zimmerman against the allegations,"" O'Mara said in his statement Monday. While on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" Monday evening, O'Mara continued to defend his client. ""There actually were some other events that happened in the family dynamics that we will get into if we need to,"" he said, calling into question her credibility. ""(S)he makes up allegations about sexual abuse, then also seemingly doesn't have any corroboration to them."" Witnesses tell FBI that George Zimmerman is no racist . The 28-year-old former neighborhood watch captain is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 death of Martin. The 17-year-old Martin was unarmed when he was killed while walking back to his father's girlfriend's house in a gated residential area of Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty. He has said he shot in self-defense after Martin attacked him. The woman said the abuse occurred when her family visited with Zimmerman's. ""Every time that we would go up there, I could just look at him and he would give me a certain look and I would know if it was going to happen when we got together for family gatherings. Because he just got this look in his eye like he was going to."" Referring to Zimmerman as ""Georgie,"" she said ""he just sucked up to my dad. He was like the son he never had. And he always was just, you know, very charming and personable with everybody in the family, and just always would laugh and entertain everybody. But he was different behind closed doors with me."" Trayvon Martin memorial removed but preserved . In a statement, the Martin family said the woman's testimony could be used in trial to show Zimmerman has a history of violence and manipulation. ""Zimmerman's mentality is very relevant to this trial,"" said the statement, which was sent to CNN by family attorney Benjamin Crump. It was not immediately clear how -- or even whether -- prosecutors planned to use the woman's testimony in their case against Zimmerman. ""We cannot discuss what will or will not be used,"" said Jackelyn Barnard, spokeswoman for Special Prosecutor Angela Corey. Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. ruled last week that Witness 9's statements and any jail calls turned over to the defense are part of the public record. ""This statement ... will simply be another piece of the puzzle to be relied upon by those who want to believe there was a racial motive to the shooting, and will be dismissed by those who claim that there was no such motive,"" the judge wrote. Zimmerman is free to disclose the nature of his relationship with Witness 9, though she cannot be identified publicly, Lester said. Timeline of events in the Trayvon Martin case .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl waiting for a lung transplant say they have asked U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules that keep children under 12 from being prioritized for donated adult organs. Attorneys for the family of Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Philadelphia girl with cystic fibrosis, have sent a formal letter to Sebelius, requesting that she ""set aside"" what they're referring to as the ""Under 12 Rule"" that, they say, is preventing Sarah from getting priority on the adult waiting list for lung transplants. Sarah could die within weeks without a transplant. She has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated. Adult lungs are far more available than lungs from children, and doctors believe modified adult lungs might save the girl's life. ""This is in the scope of (Sebelius') ability to change this law for all of the children rather than let her wait and die,"" Janet Murnaghan told CNN's ""Starting Point"" Monday. With just weeks left, Sarah fights the system for life-saving pair of lungs . Sarah's parents and attorneys are arguing that the rule is making it all but impossible for her to receive a lung, since children's lungs are so rare. As it currently sits, every adult on the list -- regardless of the severity of their illness -- would first have to turn down a pair of lungs before it could be offered to someone under 12. In the letter, attorney Stephen G. Harvey of Pepper Hamilton LLP in Philadelphia, called the rule ""discrimination."" ""The Under 12 Rule is unfair, arbitrary and capricious, inconsistent with the statute and regulations, and stands in the way of Sarah potentially receiving a set of lungs that she needs to live,"" Harvey wrote. ""It violates her rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution."" Harvey also argues that the Murnaghan family is not asking for the secretary to intervene ""in favor of Sarah to ensure that she receives a set of donated lungs."" ""They are only asking that you exercise your authority to direct that an inflexible policy ... be set aside so that medical professionals can exercise their judgment and Sarah can be considered for a set of donated adult lungs under the same requirement that apply to persons aged 12 and over."" Dying girl's plight sparks fight over organ transplants . Several lawmakers also urged Sebelius to act. Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and Rep. Patrick Meehan co-signed a letter to the secretary saying in part, ""You have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for Sarah and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs."" They asked that Sebelius ""direct OPTN (the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network) to conduct an experimental variance"" and that an example in Murnaghan's case would ""help better inform the medical community's understanding of how these transplants work in pediatric settings."" Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, wrote a separate letter to Sebelius, requesting her ""immediate attention to several crucial questions"" and would like answers no later than Wednesday. The questions include whether it would be possible for HHS to suspend the current system while Sebelius' requested review of the policy for children's lung transplants is carried out. Sarah is at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her six-state region. Sebelius has previously told the family that she doesn't have the authority to intervene in a particular case, but she also called for the policy review. Any change could take up to two years.

"(CNN) -- Calling it ""a stark wake-up call to everyone involved in college sports,"" the National Collegiate Athletic Association announced a $60 million fine against Penn State University on Monday and stripped 14 seasons of football victories from the late head coach Joe Paterno. NCAA President Mark Emmert said the unprecedented fine will be paid over five years to fund programs that serve the victims of child sexual abuse. The NCAA also banned Penn State from postseason play for four years and took away 20 football scholarships a year for four seasons, he said. The sanctions are part of the continued fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in late June of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims. They're a blow to one of college football's traditional powers, a two-time national champion. ""No price the NCAA can levy will repair the grievous damage inflicted by Jerry Sandusky on his victims,"" Emmert said. ""However, we can make clear that the culture, actions and inactions that allowed them to be victimized will not be tolerated in collegiate athletics."" Read more: Penn State board member resigns over Sandusky scandal . Penn State avoided the NCAA's ""death penalty,"" a suspension from play of a year or more. But Ed Ray, the chairman of the NCAA's executive committee, said the sanctions laid on the school ""should serve as a stark wake-up call to everyone in college sports."" Paterno, who coached at Penn State for 46 years, was fired after Sandusky's arrest in November. Graham Spanier, the school's president, was also let go. Two other former university officials face criminal charges in the Sandusky scandal. The Big Ten Conference also acted Monday, ruling that Penn State is ineligible for its conference title football game and that the Nittany Lions' share of bowl revenues for the next four seasons -- about $13 million -- will be donated to charities that ""protect children."" The NCAA action follows an independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, whose report held Paterno and other top Penn State officials responsible for failing to stop the abuse beginning in 1998. Penn State President Rodney Erickson said the university has accepted the decision and will not appeal. ""I think, for the whole university, what this calls upon us to do is to look at our whole value culture, our whole value set, our value base,"" Erickson told CNN. The school will have to ask itself ""what are the most important things in terms of a university, our mission, our educational mission, educational excellence in all of its dimensions,"" he said. ""Those conversations are going to go on from the top on down, from the board to my administration to the leadership of all of our various units, and drive those conversations down,"" he said. Paterno had been the all-time leader in major college football victories for a coach, with 409 wins. The NCAA's decision strikes 111 of those from his record, beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumps him from the top of the list. Photos: Paterno through the years . Paterno's family sharply objected to Freeh's findings and criticized the NCAA for following the report's conclusions. ""The sanctions announced by the NCAA today defame the legacy and contributions of a great coach and educator without any input from our family or those who knew him best,"" his family said in a statement released Monday. But one prominent advocate for sexual abuse victims objected to the NCAA's decision to spare Penn State from suspension. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests said the death penalty would have been ""the most effective deterrent to current and future cover-ups."" ""Vacating wins is a hollow punishment that will be forgotten by the time the next season begins,"" the group said. ""Bans from bowl games have been issued in the past because players traded championship rings for tattoos. This is not a punishment that is equal to the horrific crimes that happened at Penn State."" SNAP urged parents and and ""all who care about kids to remain vigilant"" about Penn State's compliance, warning, ""What we've learned from decades of similar scandals in churches is that agreements like this lack real follow-up."" Emmert defended the punishment in a CNN interview Monday night, saying the sanctions will deliver $60 million to aid sex abuse victims. ""That's 100 times greater than any fine ever levied in the history of the NCAA,"" he said. ""We have imposed significant penalties on a competitive end of the football program. The university has been very, very responsive in the openness of providing all of the information about this, and so we feel very comfortable where we are with these penalties."" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, meanwhile, called on Penn State to offer assurances ""that no taxpayer dollars will be used to pay the $60 million fine imposed on the university today."" University spokesman David La Torre told CNN on Monday that school will not use tax or tuition dollars to pay the fine. A recent university study said the football program had a $161.5 million impact on Pennsylvania in 2009. The football team made a $53.2 million profit in 2010, according to CNN Money. The school made $24 million more through general merchandise sales. ""One of the grave dangers stemming from our love of sports is that the sports themselves can become too big to fail, indeed, too big to even challenge,"" Emmert said. ""The result can be an erosion of academic values that are replaced by the value of hero worship and winning at all cost."" The postseason ban, which is also unprecedented, could damage the school's prestige in the eyes of potential recruits and will affect the program's bottom line through the loss of potential millions from the conference title and bowl games. The penalties also deal an emotional blow to the Penn State community, one fan said. ""By essentially taking away the main pillar of the university, you are almost pulling the university down,"" former student Ujas Patel told CNN. He complained of media coverage that fails to point out the good that Paterno, known affectionately by fans as ""JoePa,"" achieved through requiring his players to also succeed academically. ""Anybody who's gone to Penn State, that's something that really is going to bother people,"" he said. Former Penn State running back Matt Hahn said that football will return to the school, ""but I think that there are some things that are bigger priorities than that right now."" Hahn, who played for the Nittany Lions from 2004 through 2007, said his relationship with Paterno was ""excellent,"" and ""he never lied to me."" ""That being said, I don't really know what went on behind closed doors. I don't know how much information he did or did not know,"" he said. Former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden, who now becomes the winningest coach in major college football history, said Monday that he is ""not rejoicing."" ""I really don't think anybody can until this thing is settled, until those young men have their say so. ... Until then, nobody can be joyful about it,"" he told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""What happened, happened."" A lawyer for one of Sandusky's victims said the NCAA should have heard from his client and others who were abused. ""Throughout the past several weeks, PSU and the NCAA have imposed sanctions and taken what they perceive to be corrective measures,"" said Ben Andreozzi, attorney for the person identified as Victim No. 4 in the Sandusky case. ""I am disappointed that no effort was made to consult the victims in this case to ensure that their voices were heard in this process.Â After all, they are the ones who were victimized, not the NCAA or PSU.Â "" iReporter: This is an end of an era . Emmert said current players will be allowed to transfer to other schools without having to sit out a year, as is normally required, or they can stay and keep their grants, even if they don't play football. The restrictions mean that starting in 2014, the school cannot have more than 65 players on scholarship, and it can offer only 15 new scholarships each year for four years, beginning with next year's incoming recruits. ""I knew when I accepted the position that there would be tough times ahead,"" new coach Bill O'Brien said in a written statement. ""But I am committed for the long term to Penn State and our student athletes."" On social media, some players wrote they would return next season as a team with a mission. ""PSU vs The World - Day 1 - ,"" tweeted tight end Garry Gilliam. On Sunday, a 900-pound bronze statue of Paterno was removed from its place outside the 107,000-seat football stadium. Erickson issued a statement saying the statue is being stored in a ""secure location."" Another tribute to Paterno -- the university library that bears his name -- will remain as it is, Erickson said. Photos: Final tributes, Paterno statue removed . The statue was removed exactly six months after Paterno died of lung cancer. He died less than three months after he coached his last game. Under Paterno's tenure as head coach, the Nittany Lions went undefeated five times and finished in the Top 25 national rankings 35 times. The Freeh report found that several Penn State officials concealed evidence that Sandusky had sexually abused minors. Freeh concluded that Paterno could have prevented further sexual abuse had he taken action. Sandusky is expected to be sentenced in September. His legal team has said it will appeal the convictions. Two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal, and more charges are possible as the state's attorney general investigates what Penn State may have known about Sandusky's behavior.

"(CNN) -- The royal baby is great news for William and Kate, but is it also good news for British tourism? It's certainly a popular argument with fans of the British monarchy -- that the institution raises Britain's profile overseas and helps to boost tourist visits. The Daily Mail newspaper clearly hopes for such an effect from the recent arrival of the third in line to the British throne. ""Royal baby could cause tourism surge as well-wishers flock to UK,"" the paper trumpeted just after the birth of the new Prince of Cambridge. ""As London wakes up to the aftermath of a giant party on the Mall and the announcement that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a son, there are hopes that the birth of the new royal baby will spark a tourism boom as well-wishers flock to the UK to share in the joy,"" Britain's second best-selling paper went on in its picture-rich splash. ""The spell cast by the monarchy's 1,000-year history, combined with the international media frenzy around the royal baby, is extremely powerful at drawing people to England,"" Lady Cobham, chair of the tourist body VisitBritain, is quoted as saying . Not alone . The Daily Mail wasn't alone in predicting such an effect. ""Hotels and attractions"" in London were set to capitalize on the ""royal baby boom,"" observed the International Business Times. And that boom was apparently resonating beyond London. ""Royal Baby to spark rise in tourist visits,"" read an Edinburgh Evening News headline. ""Royal attractions in Edinburgh are expecting a surge in visitor numbers as tourists flock to share in the baby joy,"" the article said. Yet further afield (although still in a Commonwealth country) the travel editor of the Star, in Toronto, was not ""necessarily gung ho"" about the royal family but he still devoted a blog post to the ""bounce"" it was sure to give British tourism. On social media, ""A British Royal baby could spark a major boost to the UK tourism industry,"" was a typical comment from Airwise News. Where's the evidence? Looking for evidence for the widely touted princeling-tourism connection, the evidence becomes less clear. Certainly tourists flocked to Buckingham Palace in advance of the birth, awaiting confirmation of the baby's arrival. ""Our holiday was booked months ago, so we did not expect to be over here while the baby was happening [but we've] been told to bring back as many newspapers and souvenirs with the baby on as possible,"" Matthew and Donna Harold, from Michigan, told the Telegraph. A scan of social media reveals the odd international prince-fixated quote, such as this from a tweeter in Fort Lauderdale, Florida: ""Dear Kate Middleton, Please wait to have the Royal Baby until Thursday. Thank you, Annie Harley, an American Tourist."" But are there any hard numbers to support the idea of a baby-born tourist surge? The Mail did cite a statistical precedent. In 2012, it said, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, tourist visits (at 31 million) were at their highest level since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008. However, even if hotels near Kensington Palace are throwing caution to the wind with ""Tot-ter Around Kensington"" shop-and-stay packages and converting luxury suites into five-star nurseries for the occasion, that still doesn't turn correlation into cause. Negative effect? If anything, the numbers point the other way. A recent story in the Guardian refers to a document obtained under Freedom of Information legislation from Visit Britain on the marriage between Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson in 1986. ""We find that across the year as a whole there were 4% fewer visitors to Britain than in 1985, but that in July [1986] there were 8% fewer than in July of 1985,"" the document says. ""[S]uch as it is, the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism."" Graham Smith, chief executive office of the campaign group Republic, concurs. The argument that royal births, weddings and anniversaries benefit tourism is ""a complete fiction,"" he tells CNN. ""There's not a shred of evidence for it. People don't make holiday decisions on the basis of who's living in what castle. ""Tourists are here for our culture, our common language. They may come and look at palaces but the fairy tale side of it is there regardless of whether the monarchy is or not. ""People have nothing [substantive] to say in defense of the monarchy so come up with a financial argument."" Culture and heritage . ""We know that visitors drawn to Britain by the appeal of our culture and heritage spend over Â£4.5 billion annually and support around 100,000 jobs,"" a VisitBritain official tells CNN. ""This in part can be attributed to attractions and events with a connection to Britain's monarchs past and present."" Kate and William's wedding in 2011, VisitBritain says, ""brought record numbers of visitors for the summer opening of Buckingham Palace. More than 600,000 people passed through the gates to see the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress. ""That smashed the previous attendance figure set in 1994 and was an increase of almost 50%"" on the previous year, says VisitBritain. Such figures are compelling. But whether anybody actually booked tickets to Britain for the birth of George Alexander Louis or any other royal event, as so many people in Britain and beyond seem to think, is far less certain.","Monarchists and tourist bodies propose link between royal birth and tourism .

And while it might be true that there are plenty of quality regular people out there who can help you refine your game -- ski, fish, dunk, bluff, drive -- it's nice to get instruction from a legit superstar of the craft. But book a session with a big name -- an Olympic hero, a Bassmaster Classic champ, an NBA star, a World Series of Poker bracelet winner, a NASCAR legend -- and it's not (let's face it) just about improving. It's about luxuriating in the experience of doing something -- anything -- under the tutelage of a famous, field-tested elite. And, yeah, picking up your game a notch, too, and with you'll never believe who ... Ski with Tommy Moe (Jackson Hole, Wyoming) In 1994, Olympian Tommy Moe made history by becoming the first U.S. alpine skier to win two medals (a gold and silver) in the same Winter Games -- before he had a Super Nintendo game named after him. Today, when he's not running rivers or guiding heli-skiing trips in Alaska, Moe avails himself to the intermediate-to-expert skiing public at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort as a Ski Ambassador. For half or full days, groups of up to five can arrange for Moe himself to whisk them to some of his favorite spots on the hill. Included in the deal: field-tested Olympian ski tips and answers to all those pressing questions only a genial Super-G champion can answer, e.g. What's it feel like doing this at over 75 mph?

"(CNN) -- On February 26, 2012, George Zimmerman, a Hispanic Neighborhood Watch volunteer at the Retreat at Twin Lakes housing complex in Sanford, Florida, shot and killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American 17-year-old. Initially, Zimmerman was not arrested, and no charges were brought against him. Rallies, protests and a media firestorm followed, even eliciting a comment from President Obama that ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."" The Rev. Al Sharpton came to Sanford and admonished residents that they were ""risking going down as the Birmingham and Selma of the 21st century"" if nothing was done. Benjamin Crump, one of the attorneys representing Martin's parents and an instrumental advocate for bringing charges against Zimmerman after they were initially declined, maintains that the case is about civil rights. Whether the killing turns out to have been racially motivated, responded to in self-defense, the act of a resident concerned about the safety of his neighborhood or the act of a trigger-happy cop wannabe, race is an inescapable issue. In 2012: Did politics drive prosecution in Trayvon Martin case? Sanford is the county seat of Seminole County, Florida. Although it experienced explosive growth during the economic boom and has several large, modern upscale subdivisions, it remains relatively poor. With approximately 54,000 residents, it has a per capita income of only about $21,000, with about 18.5% of the city below the poverty line, according to the 2010 census. It is approximately 30% African-American and 20% Hispanic. It has a documented history of racial tensions between its police and its black residents. Contrast this with Seminole County. Seminole County is more than 80% white (including white Hispanics) and only about 11% black. Overall, only 10% of the population is below the poverty line, and that factors in Sanford. If Sanford is removed from the equation, Seminole County is overall a very affluent county, predominantly white and Republican and filled with pockets of substantial wealth and gated subdivisions. Seminole County has become more suburban, and as growth has skyrocketed, the white population has diluted the strength of Sanford's African-American vote and diminished its influence in elections. The prosecution of Zimmerman in the Martin killing has become a lightning rod for the racial discontent that has long been brewing in Sanford. Many are invested in believing this case to be representative of the bigotry that sadly still exists in certain quarters of the town. In 2012: Trayvon Martin shooting wasn't a case of racial profiling . A history of police indifference and societal prejudice has allowed this case, rightly or wrongly, to become the symbol for many of all things wrong with the criminal justice system and its treatment of blacks over the years, not only in Sanford but in many places throughout the country. It's a large part of the reason that there has been so much inflammatory rhetoric and passion attached to this case. As you see the lawyers from each side pick a jury over the next week or two, don't believe for a second that they are unaware of the strong racial issues that divide opinions. A deadly combination - guns and 'stand your ground' The chances of the defense seeking a black juror, especially one from Sanford, are slim. Conversely, the prosecution will do all it can to select such a juror. Neither will acknowledge that race is a factor in their selection, but they know the history, the passions and the statistics. Don't kid yourself for a minute that they don't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark NeJame.","Race has been an issue in the Trayvon Martin killing since the incident .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's new manager David Moyes started the new English Premier League campaign with a resounding 4-1 win away to Swansea City on Saturday. The reigning champions struck twice in each half to ease to victory in what was considered a potentially tricky first fixture for Moyes on the opening day of the new season. Blog: Can Moyes meet Man Utd challenge? Robin van Persie carried on from where he left off last year hooking a right-foot shot past Swansea keeper Michel Vorm in the 34th minute. Danny Welbeck doubled the lead two minutes later, tapping the ball home from an Antonio Valencia cross. Unsettled striker Wayne Rooney received a mixed reception when he came on as a second-half substitute and had to play second fiddle to van Persie yet again. The Dutch striker scored a superb second in the 72nd minute, ending a fabulous solo effort with a rasping left-foot drive. Striker Wilfried Bony scored a consolation goal for Swansea ten minutes later before Welbeck added a fourth goal moments before the final whistle. There was no first day celebrations for Arsenal as they slumped to a 3-1 defeat against Aston Villa at the Emirates. Christian Benteke scored a brace for Villa with Antonio Luna adding a late third after Villa had gone a goal down early in the game. Olivier Giroud gave the Gunners the lead in the sixth minute but Benteke leveled the scores with a header in the 22nd minute. The 22-year-old Belgian international converted from the penalty spot in the 61st minute to put Villa in front before Luna completed a miserable opening day for Arsenal fans with a strike five minutes from the end. Liverpool kicked off the new season with a 1-0 win against Stoke City at Anfield. A first-half goal by Daniel Sturridge was enough to earn the Reds all three points despite a spirited performance from Stoke, watched by new manager Mark Hughes. The home side were supported by a full house at Anfield that included Luis Suarez, who is serving the fifth match of a ten-game ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in April. The Uruguayan's future at the club remains in doubt with Suarez agitating for a move away from the club he joined in January 2011 so he can play Champions League football. But bids from Arsenal in excess of Â£40 million ($62 million) have been rejected with Liverpool owner John W Henry stating that the controversial striker is not for sale. On the pitch, things were more clear cut for Liverpool on a blustery and rainy day on Merseyside. Sturridge put Liverpool in front in the 37th minute when he unleashed a low shot from outside the penalty area which fizzed into the bottom corner of the net. The home side pressed for a decisive second goal in the second half but Potters keeper Asmir Begovic kept his side in the game with some fine saves. Liverpool fielded three new signings with both Spanish striker Iago Aspas -- signed for Â£7.2 million ($11 million) from Celta Vigo -- and Kolo Toure -- who joins from Manchester City -- making bright starts for the club. But it was new keeper Simon Mignolet -- signed from Sunderland -- who stole the show saving a penalty from Jon Walters at the death to ensure Liverpool's win. In Saturday's other fixtures, Norwich City came from behind to draw 2-2 with Roberto Martinez's Everton at Carrow Road while Sunderland lost to Fulham 1-0 at the Stadium of Light. West Bromwich Albion also opened their campaign with a 1-0 home defeat against Southampton. But West Ham United made no mistake against newly promoted Cardiff City with Joe Cole and Kevin Nolan netting for the Hammers in a 2-0 win. Jose Mourinho makes his Premier League return on Sunday as Chelsea take on Hull at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham Hotspur are also in action, traveling to south-east London to take on Premier League new boys Crystal Palace.","Manchester United give new manager David Moyes a winning start at Swansea .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Southwest Airlines jet that skidded down a LaGuardia airport runway on its nose on Monday touched down on its front wheels first, which then collapsed, according to federal accident investigators. The unusual landing, in which investigators said the plane's nose pitched down seconds before touchdown, is the surest clue yet to explain the accident involving the Boeing 737 that injured several people. The National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday that video and other sources provide evidence that the nose gear contacted the tarmac before the main wheels. Under a normal landing in a big jet, the main landing gear under each wing would touch the runway first and simultaneously -- absorbing the main stress of landing -- and the nose gear then lowered gradually as the plane decelerates down the runway. That model jet is expected to cross the runway threshold at about 140 knots or 161 mph, according to Boeing figures. Investigators said the pilot evidently adjusted the wing flaps less than a minute before landing, suggesting to veteran pilots who spoke with CNN that the plane may not have been on a stabilized approach as it neared the runway. Landing the way it did ""would potentially have overstressed the nose gear to the point where it would have failed,"" said Capt. Mark Weiss, a former 737 pilot and civil aviation leader at The Spectrum Group in Washington. The NTSB said the flaps were set from 30 to 40 degrees about 56 seconds prior to touchdown. ""What this brings into question is whether they were on a stabilized approach to make a normal landing,"" Weiss said. The safety board, coincidentally, is looking at whether Asiana Flight 124, which crashed-landed in San Francisco earlier this month, was also on a stabilized approach. Details released late Thursday about the New York accident show the plane changing its pitch suddenly in the final seconds of flight -- and in a direction opposite than desired. When the plane was just 32 feet in altitude, four seconds before landing, the plane was pitched 2 degrees nose up. At touchdown, the plane was pitched approximately 3 degrees nose down, the safety board said. Video shows the plane careening down the runway, the nose to the pavement, sending up showers of sparks. After touchdown, the aircraft came to a stop within approximately 19 seconds, the NTSB reported. Southwest said in a statement that the landing scenario the NTSB describes from video and other sources ""is not in accordance with our operating procedures."" Word that the landing was unusual could remove suspicion of a mechanical failure.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at Tuesday's kids' ""state dinner"" at the White House, an event thrown by the the first lady to welcome the winners of the second annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. ""Usually, at a state dinner, I get invited, so I don't know what happened on this one,"" the president joked. ""I hear the food is pretty good."" Obama went around to each table to congratulate the kids before leaving to get back to official business. ""This is what it's like to be a part of an official state dinner,"" Michelle Obama told the children and their parents gathered in the East Room. ""We mirrored it exactly to what people experience when we host world leaders here."" The kids, ranging in age from 8 to 12, even got to experience an arrival ceremony in which they were officially announced as they made their way through the booksellers' entrance of the White House. The Healthy Lunchtime Challenge is a recipe contest for kids across the country, launched in 2012 by Epicurious -- a website about food -- to promote healthy eating for children in the United States. It is part of first lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative, a program developed to ""solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation,"" according to the program's website. Last week, the White House Epicurious, and the departments of Education and Agriculture announced 54 winners from more than 1,300 entries. One winner was chosen from each of the 50 states, plus three territories and the District of Columbia. Each recipe had to meet the USDA's healthy meal criteria and had to represent each of the five food groups. Fruits and vegetables were required to be part of at least half of the recipe. ""We have seen that when kids like all of you get involved in creating your own healthy meals, the results can really be amazing and delicious and fun,"" Michelle Obama told the young chefs. ""You'll come up with ideas that none of us grownups ever thought of."" Winning recipes included Picky Eater Pita Pizza Pockets, made by 8-year-old Jacob Hirsch from West Bloomfield, Michigan, and Bring it on, Brussels Sprout Wrap! by 9-year-old Corbin Jackson from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Tuesday's event featured some of the winning recipes, many of which are considered finger food. ""Using your fingers is completely fine here. ... The first lady has said that it is OK!"" Michelle Obama exclaimed. The president took mock offense at his wife's comment. ""Michelle never said to me I can just pick up something with my fingers at a state dinner. That's not fair!"" he joked. Amber Kelley traveled to the White House from Woodinville, Washington, for the special event. The 10-year-old won for her Nummy No-Noodle Lasagna recipe and got to sit next to Michelle Obama during lunch. Amber explained the big secret to her winning recipe: ""Instead of putting in the noodles, you put in really thinly sliced zucchini. It tastes really good. Some people told me that you can barely tell."" Amber's mother, Yohko, was ""thrilled"" about her daughter's win and the visit to the White House. ""She's kind of been dedicating herself to healthy cooking for a while now, and this is the big crescendo at the end,"" she said. After lunch, recipe winners were treated to a performance by 15-year-old singer Rachel Crow before getting a tour of the White House kitchen garden. A complete list of winners and their recipes can be found here.","President makes surprise appearance at lunch for healthy eating contest winners .

"(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet have been evacuated as the bay turned black from an oil spill over the weekend. Authorities estimated that around 5,000 liters of crude oil have washed up on the island, having leaked into the ocean from an offshore pipeline belonging to PTT Global Chemical, Thailand's largest petrochemical producer. The total leakage is estimated at 50,000 liters. Due to its beautiful beaches and proximity to Bangkok -- the travel time from the capital is a little less than four hours by bus and then boat -- the island has long been a popular Thai weekend destination. Tourist activities on the island are largely ocean-oriented and include jet-skiing, snorkeling and banana-boating. Gallery: Oil spill on Koh Samet . Effect on tourism . It's still unclear to what extent the spill will affect local tourism, but the damage was initially reportedly limited to one beach, at Ao Phrao. There are 14 beaches on the island. ""We've had some hotel cancellations on Samet,"" Rayong province tourism authority director Chuchart Oncharoen told the Bangkok Post. ""Whether this has a long-term impact on the island depends on how quickly PTT cleans up the mess."" The affected beach is on the less populated Western part of the island, where resorts have closed and tourists have been evacuated to hotels in other areas. The island is currently in its tourism low season -- the high season is from October to April. ""By far the majority of tourists who go to Koh Samet stay at resorts and hotels on the eastern side of the island,"" Thailand travel blogger Richard Barrow told CNN. Gallery: Oil spill on Koh Samet . Spill 'worse than thought' However, an opposition MP has suggested the damage from the spill may be worse than first thought, reports Australia's ABC. ""If that (50,000 litres) was the real amount, they should have already eliminated it -- they should have solved the problem fast enough before it reached Samet island,"" said Sathit Pitutacha, from Thailand's Democrat Party. The environmental group Greenpeace also called the spill ""massive,"" according to the ABC, and called upon the Thai government to end oil exploration in the Gulf of Thailand. Some travelers to Phrao Bay have already posted about the unexpected change in their itineraries. ""The oil completely covered the beach when we woke up in the morning,"" wrote Tripadvisor reviewer MatJens about his curtailed stay at Lima Coco resort, one of the popular hotels in the area that has been closed. ""We rebooked to a hotel on Ko Chang and the personnel at Lima Coco were very helpful getting us there. We also got a voucher covering the days we paid in advance,"" wrote MatJens on Monday. A statement from PTT Global Chemical said the company had deployed booms to contain the oil as well as oil spill dispersant. It added that the Thai navy and approximately 300 workers from PTT Global Chemical are continuing to clean up the area.","One of the beaches on Thailand's Koh Samet island has turned black from Saturday's oil spill .

"(CNN) -- Paris and Rome are lovely this time of year, but they're also packed with summer travelers. For something a little quieter, consider Lonely Planet's latest list of top European destinations that offer café culture, history and outdoor adventures outside of Europe's most popular cities. This year's Europe list, developed by Lonely Planet's editors and writers, includes the next hot spots to visit as well as longtime favorites with something new to enjoy. ""We try to point out what's the next hot thing, what's been overlooked and deserving of more attention and places that people have heard about forever but may not know have been revitalized in recent years,"" said Andy Murdock, Lonely Planet's U.S. digital editor. ""It's food for thought for travelers looking to explore Europe more deeply."" 1. Porto & the Douro Valley, Portugal . Portugal's second-largest city has so much going for it, Murdock says. The birthplace of port, this picturesque hilly town in northern Portugal also has a thriving arts scene and up and coming culinary reputation. And it's a good value destination right now. (Many of the Port houses offer tastings and tours for free or a small fee.) ""Porto is really the best in show for this year,"" Murdock said. ""Porto is a great value for people interested in food and the arts."" The Douro Valley's wine and port scene is very easy to explore as a day trip. There you can visit some of the most famous Port houses, including Taylor's, W & J Graham's, Fonseca Porto and Casa Ramos Pinto. Check their websites for tours and tastings. 2. Budapest, Hungary . Budapest is starting to steal the cool from Berlin right now, Murdock said, with unique summer pop-up bars in old buildings and gardens. (The city's architecture is an eclectic testament to its previous rulers, showing the influence of the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Soviet regime.) ""There are a variety of different looks to them: Some are hipster weed patches with drinks, and others are manicured gardens,"" he said. ""It's a unique type of bar you're not going to find most other places."" These ""ruin bars"" are mostly open in the summer, although some are starting to winterize their locations, so they can be open for more than the May-to-September season. Although some bars often switch locations, Szimpla Kert is one of the oldest, and visitors can find other bars on the same strip. Sometimes known as ""the City of Baths,"" Budapest has thermal spring-filled baths and traditional Turkish baths to choose from. Murdock recommends the Turkish-era Racz Baths, which recently reopened attached to the modern luxury Racz Hotel. The Museum of Music History also had a recent update. Top U.S. travel destinations for 2013 . 3. Northern Iceland . While everyone seems to know that Iceland is a cool weekend for U.S. East Coasters, Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon Spa and the Golden Circle are the popular stops on that quick trip. For a look beyond those spots, take a quick flight north to check out the Northern Lights in Akureyri, Iceland's second-largest town (population 17,000). ""Explore lava fields, waterfalls like you've never imagined, horseback rides and great whale watching out of Husavik (an hour from Akureyri),"" Murdock said. Myvatn Nature Spa offers a mini version of the Blue Lagoon -- without the tourists. 4. Cinque Terre, Italy . The five villages of Italy's popular Cinque Terre are ready for visitors again. Repairs to the cliffside villages after the devastating floods of 2011 were made more difficult because of the Cinque Terre's remote, mountainous location. The towns are connected by trains and are served within the villages by public buses. A national park and UNESCO site, the villages don't allow cars or motorbikes. ""It's very well-known but hard to reach,"" Murdock said. But it's worth it if you're ready to walk, he says. ""They rebuilt the paths, the stone terraces are back, the vineyards are replaned, and the drainage is improved for the next flood."" The small, isolated beaches below the towns are also worth a visit. ""They have a sense of fishery stewardship, allowing line-caught fish only. There is really lovely seafood coming out of the waters in Cinque Terre."" 5. Moravia, Czech Republic . If you've been to Prague or shy away from popular cities that have been overtaken by tourists, try Moravia. It's known locally for bike tours and wine tasting, especially big robust reds. ""It's a lot slower pace (than Prague) and gives you a much different feel of the country,"" Murdock said. For a mini version of Prague, head to Olomouc, home of the country's second-oldest university, a lovely town square and the Holy Trinity Column (an 18th-century baroque sculpture on UNESCO's World Heritage list). For Gothic charm, head to Telc, which is also on UNESCO's list. The region's capital, Brno, has great museums. Airports where architecture soars . 6. Bern, Switzerland . When travelers land in the capital of Switzerland, they tend to head out into the mountainous region of Bernese Oberland, but the city itself is worth a visit. Named a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its medieval architecture, Bern is also home to one of Albert Einstein's homes and a Paul Klee museum designed by Renzo Piano that includes other artists' works. ""We're trying to call attention to Bern itself,"" Murdock said, calling it a very interesting mix of ""historical, modern and edgy"" things to do. Although people think of Swiss food as a bit stodgy, Murdock raves about the locavore restaurants on the river than runs through town. Try visiting in August, when the streets of Bern are filled with musicians, puppeteers, jugglers and other entertainers for the Buskers Bern Festival. 7. Marseille, France . This year's European Capital of Culture, ""Marseille is one of those incredibly historic seaport towns along the Mediterranean,"" Murdock said, and he's not kidding. The town dates to 600 B.C., when Greeks first settled in the area. France's second-largest city is trying to shake off its reputation as a ""gritty, dangerous seaport town,"" Murdock said. With the cultural capital designation, ""a lot of money has been poured into new museums and public transportation."" That includes the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations that opened June 7. And the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Marseille, housed in the left wing of the Palais Longchamp, has reopened after a renovation. The museum's exhibit, ""From Van Gogh to Bonnard,"" runs through October 13. Foodies can enjoy the city that's home to bouillabaisse at the Old Port, where maritime culture and fresh seafood mix. 8. Croatia . In some ways, Croatia's popularity is old news to American travelers, but a lot of people are seeing the coast. There will be a lot more attention on the country if it enters the European Union in July. ""Zagreb is an interesting and underrated European capital, with a huge coffee and café scene,"" Murdock said. ""If you have that image of Italy or Paris, sitting at a café and watching the world go by, that's preserved in Croatia. ""There's also an extension of northern Italian cuisine because the border in Istria (now Croatia) has jumped around, and the cuisine doesn't abide by the border,"" Murdock said, pointing to Croatians' ""same Italian love of cured meats and cheeses,"" and there's seafood on the Adriatic as well. For ""Game of Thrones"" fans, Dubrovnik is the place to visit to see King's Landing location shots. (Tours are available.) And you can find a hikers' paradise in the 16 turquoise blue lakes of Plitvice Lakes National Park, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. 9. Northern Ireland . If you're addicted to ""Game of Thrones,"" Northern Ireland should be on your itinerary, too. A lot of the scenery is in Northern Ireland, including the Causeway Coast and the Glens. The sites on the self-guided and tour-guide-led tours are so magnificent that fans and non-fans alike can appreciate their majesty. The Giant's Causeway is Northern Ireland's only UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it can be very crowded. Although its basalt columns can appear to look constructed by the might of giant Finn McCool, the causeway is actually the result of ancient volcanic activity. A new visitor's center opened last year. The truly adventurous can walk the 16-kilometer route from Giant's Causeway to Ballycastle, taking a moment to cross the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge. It's a 20-meter walk on the bridge to the island of Carrick-a-Rede, swaying 30 meters above the rocky waters below. It's not for those with a fear of heights, says Murdock, who loves it all. ""There are all these inlets, islands, castles and ruins and sea birds and stunning scenery,"" he said. Also not to be missed is Derry/Londonderry, this year's UK City of Culture. Remembering the religious strife in Northern Ireland, the walk and cycle Peace Bridge across the Foyle River opened in June 2011. It's considered a symbolic handshake across the river, connecting historically Catholic and Protestant sides of town. 'Game of Thrones' tours in Ireland, Croatia . 10. Copenhagen, Denmark . The Danish capital of Copenhagen is the place to visit for ecotourists and foodies. The city is a poster child for the green movement, where almost half of the residents commute to work by bicycle and hotels brag about their green construction. In the two-Michelin star Noma, the city boasts the No. 2 restaurant in the world (according to Restaurant magazine's annual rankings). ""It's the new Nordic cuisine with very clean and local experimental flavors,"" Murdock said. And there's a little more Swedish mixing into the city these days. Ever since the 10-mile Øresund bridge and tunnel system was completed in 1999, the residents of Copenhagen, Denmark, and Malmo, Sweden, are more easily connected. ""It changed the feeling of both cities once only connected by ferry,"" Murdock said.","Enjoy port tastings in the Portuguese town that made the drink famous .

"(CNN) -- A squabble over $32 led a nursing home resident to set the building on fire, killing 11 people, Chinese state-run media reported. Police said 45-year-old Wang Gui lost his temper after accusing another resident of stealing 200 yuan from him, the Xinhua news agency reported. Staff members at Lianhe Senior Nursing Home tried to calm Wang down. So did other residents. But nothing worked. Early Friday morning, Wang set fire to the home in the northeast city of Hailun, authorities said. The blaze killed 11 people, including Wang. Their ages ranged from 45 to 87, the Hailun public security bureau told Xinhua. Wang had been sent to the nursing home because he suffered a stroke and had no one to take care of him, according to Xinhua. About 32 people were in the inpatient building when the fire broke out, the agency said. The nursing home serves rural elderly residents who have no source of income.

"(CNN) -- Worsening violence amid anti-government protests in Egypt has led western governments to step up their travel advice. Yesterday, at least 23 people were killed, and hundreds injured, in clashes between supporters and opponents of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy at Cairo University. Since then, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office is recommending ""against all but essential travel to Egypt"" except certain coastal resorts, where unrest is less evident. Previously, the FCO advised travelers only to steer clear of ""all demonstrations and large gatherings"" within the country. The U.S. State Department continues to advise against all ""non-essential"" travel to or within Egypt. Tourism minister quits . Egypt's tourism industry suffered another blow Monday with the resignation of the country's tourism minister, Hisham Zazour. Zazour handed in his resignation along with five other ministers, including the foreign minister, over the violence sweeping the country. The present crisis was the last straw for a man with one of the toughest jobs in tourism. He had threatened to quit last month over the appointment as Luxor governor of a member of a political group associated with a massacre in the city 15 years ago that killed 58 tourists. Tourism vital . The pyramids of Giza, the Nile and the coastal resorts of Sharm-el-Sheikh are among the world's most popular tourist attractions. The industry is vital to Egypt's economy. Tourism employs around 10% of the Egyptian workforce and brought in $10 billion in 2012, according to UNWTO figures. However, anti-government protests beginning in 2011, part of the revolutionary movement sweeping the Middle East, have hit tourism hard. Visitor numbers have fallen by almost one-third, from 14 million in 2010 to 10.5 million last year. Will travelers still go? Should travelers still visit Egypt? There have been bargains aplenty as travel operators have tried to woo back tourists to what has long been one of the world's most popular sun-sea-and-sights destinations. Yet official travel advice is hardening -- while stopping short in all cases of advising against all travel or assisting foreigners to leave Egypt. In addition to deaths at public demonstrations, the British government notes reports of ""more than forty rapes and sexual assaults of Egyptian and foreign women."" Coastal resorts ""safe"" Yet the Foreign and Commonwealth Office exempts ""resorts on the Red Sea in South Sinai"" and certain mainland resorts from its advice against travel. It continue to state that ""most visits"" to Egypt are trouble-free. It is true that, as protests have surged and dwindled over the past two years, violence has largely been confined to Cairo and other cities, rather than the coastal resorts popular with package holiday tourists. ""July and August traditionally see lower numbers of holidaymakers traveling to Egypt than the rest of the year,"" the Association of British Travel Agents told CNN Travel Tuesday. ""At this stage, outside of Cairo it is very much business as usual, and holiday makers are enjoying their holidays without interruption."" U.S. citizen dies . In stronger advice than Britain's, the U.S. government recommends against all ""non-essential"" travel to Egypt. A U.S. citizen, Andrew Pochter, 21, died after being stabbed in the chest at a protest in the city of Alexandria last Friday. Political unrest in Egypt is ""likely to continue in the near future,"" the State Department says. Whatever the political outlook for the country, its vital tourism industry is likely to take years to recover from its violent recent history.","Advisories strengthened after more protest deaths .

"West Alton, Missouri (CNN) -- Residents of communities north of St. Louis fled the onrush of river waters this week, after two levees breached, but Wednesday brings relief, as rivers continue to retreat, weather forecasters say. Although some thunderstorms are approaching from the west, they should not drop enough rain to refill the receding currents of the the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers at St. Louis, according to CNN's weather unit. Downstream on the Mississippi, at Cape Girardeau, water arriving from St. Louis is expected to push the river's level to 45 feet, according to the National Weather Service. At currently just over 43 feet, it stands 11 feet above flood stage there. Levee breaches . A 100- to 150-foot section of levee gave way outside West Alton, Missouri, Tuesday near the point where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi, St. Charles County's emergency management office reported. Residents of an estimated 43 homes in the area were told to evacuate. The levee failed around noon (1 p.m. ET). By evening, authorities were scrambling to bolster about a three-quarter-mile section of levee near Portage des Sioux, about nine miles upstream from West Alton. The area is home to a nearly 1,000-megawatt coal-burning power plant, and officials were hauling truckloads of stone and heavy earth-moving equipment to the site in an attempt to prevent the levee from failing. On Monday emergency teams rushed to get hundreds of people to safety, after a levee breach on the Missouri River near West Alton. Many residents didn't need to be told twice to get out. ""I want to be safe rather than sorry,"" Heather Wendle said. ""I don't want to take the chances."" From trickle to torrent . After weeks of heavy rain in the upper Midwest, the Mississippi is still running above flood stage at St. Louis, in spite of dropping water levels, the Corps of Engineers reported. The flood waters stand in contrast to the near river drought a few months ago. The Mississippi had been running so low that the Corps feared it would have to close the waterway to barge traffic. In December, the Corps of Engineers had hundreds of tons of rock dug out of the river at Thebes, Illinois, about 125 miles downriver from St. Louis, to make sure barges could pass. But Monday, the Coast Guard shut down a section of the river at St. Louis -- because the water was too high for safe navigation. CNN's Holly Yan, Jennifer Feldman, Cristy Lenz and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","NEW: Rain in the forecast is unlikely to push river levels up significantly .

"Editor's note: As Syria's neighboring countries are struggling to accommodate an influx of refugees, no place is less prepared to cope than Iraq. Save the Children CEO Carolyn Miles recently returned from a visit to the refugee camps in Iraq where she saw the conditions firsthand. (Save The Children) -- Tiny baby Banaz sat sleeping peacefully in her car seat, unaware of the hubbub around her. Her beautiful 2-month-old face was the picture of calm. We sat on an old mattress in the heat and spoke with her parents, who had left Syria just one month before. They fled the violence and instability in the province of Hasakah in northern Syria to come to this teeming, garbage strewn spot near the northern Iraqi mountains. Her young father spoke of the day they decided to leave Syria, when the fighting got to be too much. The family of four -- mother, father, 2-year-old Zahraa and 1-month-old Banaz -- left with nothing but what they could carry on the walk to Domiz camp. Banaz and her family may be some of the lucky ones to get to the relative safety of this northern region of Iraq. The border at the crossing they came through was closed during our visit, with thousands of Syrian refugees, many of them Kurdish, now waiting along the border. They are escaping the fighting that has torn Syria apart and scattered its people. The border points for refugees trying to leave Syria can close unpredictably --just one more piece of uncertainty for a people brutalized by a war that has killed at least 70,000 and driven more than 1.7 million from Syria to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and here in Iraq. These refugees may be the most forgotten of this war, with the majority of the attention and funding for relief going to the large populations now living in Jordan and Lebanon. But Iraq now has more than 161,000 refugees -- most of them in northern Iraq -- and by UNHCR estimates that figure could reach a staggering 350,000 by the end of this year. The Kurdistan Regional Government, which leads three northern provinces of Iraq, has stepped up to try to help those flowing across the Syrian border, providing basic housing and services like meals and water. But the flow is becoming too much, with a camp developed last April for 10,000 now swelling to more than 50,00, with absolutely no capacity to receive any more of those expected to surge in again once the border reopens. The conditions in the camp are tough. More than 50,000 people are packed in a dense area outside the city of Duhok with no sewer systems, insufficient everything, and the threat of screaming wind storms, like the one that tore apart tents the day before our arrival. The smell and the heat -- 90 F when we were there, certain to be 110 or more by August -- follow you everywhere and trash is piled high along parts of the rutted dirt and mud pathways. Banaz's parents were doing the best they could, staying in the tent with a neighbor from their old village while they waited for a tent of their own and searched for work in the nearby village. The father was a roofer by trade and was trying to find a position that would allow him to get his family out of the camp to a better life. When asked if he would go back to Syria, he said of course it was his country and he loved it and would go back -- as soon as it was safe. As we finished our visit, Banaz's eyes fluttered open and she blinked awake. This little baby is clearly cherished in the midst of the squalor and hardship that is now her family's life. She and her parents and sister should not be forgotten in Iraq. It is an urgent and rapidly growing need, and we must all step up and help in a country that now faces yet another major challenge after years of war.

"(CNN) -- ""It's just interesting how sometimes you cross paths with people in your life,"" reflected Katharine McPhee in a 2012 interview with CNN. The words continue to ring true for the actress and ""American Idol"" alumna. Over the past two years, McPhee has been working with the nonprofit organization, Malaria No More, to save the lives of children half a world away. It all started when a chance connection brought McPhee from the California coast to the poor, landlocked country of Burkina Faso in West Africa. In 2007, a family friend living in Burkina Faso told her about a need for a new preschool in the Nioko District of the capital city, Ouagadougou. She and husband Nick Cokas agreed to help fund the project. McPhee was not able to travel to Africa when the doors opened in 2009 but kept in touch with the school's headmaster through e-mail. ""We were sort of losing connection with her ... and she e-mailed back, saying, 'I am so sorry. I have been sick with malaria more than once this year,' "" McPhee said. Students invent award-winning soap to tackle malaria . Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that, left untreated, can be extremely serious and even fatal, particularly for young children. However, malaria-related illness and death can usually be prevented according to the Centers for Disease Control. McPhee knew she had to help. ""Every minute, a child dies from malaria. Every minute. That is pretty stunning. If that was happening in the States, there would be action right away. It would be an epidemic,"" McPhee said. McPhee and the team from Malaria No More traveled to West Africa in 2012. She finally got to visit the school she helped build years earlier, but the team's main mission was to distribute mosquito nets and educate people in Burkina Faso and Ghana on malaria prevention. She continues the mission back at home by getting out the word on how to help. Lucy Liu's quest to help Syrian children . ""The message is that this is a disease that nobody should be living with, and if they do get infected, it's curable. They just need the right resources."" This year, she spoke to a room filled with college fraternity and sorority members, encouraging them to join with Malaria No More to end malaria related deaths by 2015 through Greeks for Good. She admits that it is easy to feel powerless in the face of a disease like malaria, but any action, however small, can impact a life. That is the idea behind Malaria No More's ""Power of One"" campaign, in which every dollar donated to the campaign will pay for one full course of treatment for a child with malaria. ""Every trip you go, every dollar you send, every organization you get involved with, you can make a difference,"" McPhee said.

"(CNN) -- Kellie Pickler calls them her favorite shows. ""When you get up onstage and you look out and you see a sea of soldiers or sea of marines or just a sea of your military in general, it's just so overwhelming, and it just really makes you feel good,"" Pickler says. The 26-year-old country music star has been singing for the troops as a USO volunteer since 2007. She has taken part in six USO tours to bring ""a little piece of home"" to servicemen and women stationed overseas, including those in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I've met so many amazing people on these USO tours,"" Pickler says, recalling one of her most memorable moments from a Memorial Day trip to Afghanistan in 2012. ""It was myself and my band and maybe 12 other soldiers that play guitar, drums, keys,"" she remembers. ""We all met at the chapel on the base, and we sat there all night, I mean probably two or 2:30, three in the morning playing old Johnny Cash songs to just everything you could think of. We just had a pickin' party."" Pickler's connection to the military is deeply personal. Her grandfather, a retired Marine, helped raise her. She says she developed ""a great deal of respect"" for the troops growing up in a military family, which inspired her to get involved with the USO. ""[The troops] need to know that we haven't forgotten about them and what they do,"" she says. ""And they need to know that we're back home supporting them and that we have their back because they have ours."" Pickler even tattooed three stars on her left arm as a reminder of her first few USO tours and her gratitude to those who serve. She encourages all Americans to find their own way to express their appreciation.

"(CNN) -- In Europe, high-speed rail has come to stand for ease and efficiency with point-to-point city center travel where journeys of four hours or less trump airplanes and the hassle of airport security. Deregulation of the rail industry across the continent has also cemented trains as a viable alternative to short haul flights. ""Airlines have already pulled out of certain routes -- they've given up competing between Paris and Brussels or between Paris and Lyon,"" says Mark Smith founder of rail website The Man In Seat 61. ""Airlines have been given a run for their money on routes like Barcelona to Madrid, Milan to Rome. They're going to have to retrench and go back to further long distance routes and not even try and compete on some of the short haul they do at the moment."" The airline industry has already seen an increase in competition and choice across the continent. Italy, Europe's fourth largest high-speed market after the UK, France and Germany, according to Amadeus Rail, saw its first privately owned rail company NTV break state-owned Trenitalia's monopoly with its red Italo ""Ferrari trains"". ""This privatization and competition drives more efficient businesses"" says Luca di Montezemolo, president of NTV. ""With more efficient businesses those benefits and savings can be passed on the customers. So service gets better, product gets better and pricing gets better."" Read more: China's need for speed . Trenitalia's Emanuel Carando welcomes the competition. The company recently invested $100m in upgrades to its fleet of high-speed trains, adding free Wifi and new features like a conference room in a business carriage. ""This is very positive because it is offering ecological solutions to the consumer so anybody investing in the train industry is very good for us,"" he says. However cross-border travel in Europe is not as easy as it could be with different systems in place for each country and no central booking system. SilverRail is one company that is trying to make the online reservation system more user-friendly, building an online rail ticket network of four of Europe's rail operators: Spain's Renfe, Sweden's SJ rail operator, ATOC in the UK and the Benelux countries' SNCB. ""Rail is actually pretty challenging to book,"" says Cameron Jones, Vice-President of Commercial at SilverRail. ""Each company has a very different tech space. It's very difficult for online travel agencies."" New rules in Europe have opened up the $80 billion rail travel market allowing operators to expand beyond their domestic platforms. Only 6% of high-speed rail in Europe is currently cross-border and only a fifth of tickets are booked on the internet. Rail operators are starting to realize their online potential. Read more: How Eurostar CEO aims to keep the company on track . ""Rail networks traditionally only have very strong brand recognition in their own country but not abroad,"" says Christoph Klenner, Secretary-General of the European Technology & Travel Services Association. ""Global distribution systems could take their content and distribute it to hundreds of thousands of travel operators and online travel agents."" Cross-border rail in Europe will be fully liberalized to include domestic as well as international passengers in 2019. In France, rail operator SNCF is preparing for increased competition by launching the first ever low-cost, high speed train. There's no food or drink sold onboard and prices start at around $32 from Paris to Marseille and Montpelier via Lyon. ""Liberalization and the introduction of competition (means) we need to have a low price system"" says Guillaume Pepy, chairman of SNCF. ""Some people would like to have a lot of flexibility, a lot of services and comfort. But other ones they just want the price."" France was the second country after Japan to introduce high-speed rail and Pepy believes it is crucial that the company still leads the way in innovation. Quiz: Test your knowledge of airline liveries . ""We are pioneers in that field. If (low-cost, high-speed rail) is a success I can imagine for cross-border lines the next years there will be opportunities to go to Brussels and Amsterdam, and perhaps from and to London and to Spain."" However Pepy remains realistic about the industry's future where there will be increased competition, but also more collaboration. ""If there is room for several different operators on routes, let's compete. Some other routes there is not so much potential --Frankfurt to Marseille -- so let's do the service together between Deutsche Bahn and SNCF so customers can just change trains without changing their tickets."" The aim is to make journeys as seamless as possible and even join rail to the end of long-haul flights. ""You can fly from Shanghai to Frankfurt or from New York to Charles de Gaulle and then connect to the high-speed train,"" says Pepy. ""The high speed system will be connected to airports -- look at the new stations -- Frankfurt is connected to the high speed line, Lyon is connected."" If high speed rail can effectively feed into long haul air networks and take over short haul routes, it won't just connect the dots in Europe but build alliances with airlines as well.","Deregulation of national rail networks in Europe means greater competition and collaboration .

"London (CNN) -- As Britain segues seamlessly through feelgood summer heat from Andy Murray mania to royal baby euphoria, let us at least spare a thought for the unfortunate newborn caught, through no fault other than his ancestry, in the global spotlight. No royal arrival has been so closely scrutinized since 1688 when Mary of Modena, wife of the widely disliked James II, gave birth watched by dozens of officials amid speculation that her pregnancy was a Catholic conspiracy intended to fabricate a male heir. Even their presence was not enough to quash rumors that the child had been smuggled into the birthing chamber in a bedpan, and within months James had been deposed; his son was destined to spend his life in bitter exile in France and Rome. At least the newborn prince and his parents are unlikely to be run out of the country, even if the flag-waving royalists celebrating the birth are hardly representative of a silent majority largely apathetic about the monarchy and more inclined to treat its modern incarnation as a publicly-subsidized soap opera largely staged for the amusement of American tourists. 'Wicked' author: Royal baby stands for hope . Nor did his mother suffer the indignity of having the home secretary in the vicinity of the delivery room, a custom for royal births only formally ended in 1948. And there have undoubtedly been worse times in history to be born into one of Europe's great royal dynasties. Paris in 1789 springs to mind, or St. Petersburg in 1917. Yet the life prospects of a boy now third in line to the British crown who, if as lucky in longevity as his paternal great-grandparents, might reasonably expect to see in the 22nd century on the throne, are hardly something to be envied. The Windsors may have recovered some of their respectability after the nadir in their fortunes in the 1990s that culminated in the 1997 death of Princess Diana, thanks in no small part to the fairy-tale mega-wedding of William and Kate in 2011 and Oscar-winning propaganda such as ""The Queen"" and ""The King's Speech."" To question the role of the monarchy and Britons' attachment to it is still to risk a public flogging from more reactionary sections of the British media, as author Hilary Mantel discovered when she found herself pilloried earlier this year for describing the Duchess of Cambridge as a ""plastic princess designed to breed."" The resulting furore missed the point that Mantel was trying to make, which was that members of the royal family, however privileged and luxurious their lives, are essentially prisoners of their own circumstances, trapped by their supposed obligations to an archaic and largely redundant institution. ""Our current royal family doesn't have the difficulties in breeding that pandas do, but pandas and royal persons alike are expensive to conserve and ill-adapted to any modern environment. But aren't they interesting? Aren't they nice to look at?"" said Mantel. Opinion: Baby helps make a monarchy better . If Mantel's point was essentially true of Kate Middleton, who, like a mafia wife, married into the firm of her own volition, how much worse must the situation be for her offspring, who will become public property from the moment he is displayed to the assembled world media on the hospital steps. The mainstream media may feign responsibility, keeping a respectful distance as the young family find their feet and honoring royal requests to leave the child alone, but he will still face near constant public intrusion, living a life framed by the ubiquitous lens of the camera phone. And in an age obsessed with the oxymoronic phenomena of ""reality"" and celebrity, the young royal will be forced to perform a gilded simulation of a normality that he will never experience for real, ultimately embracing the stiflingly conservatism of a British establishment of which the monarchy remains the apex, and allowing their personality to be airbrushed according to public tastes. It will be ""The Truman Show"" with footmen. Royals, for better or worse, once inhabited worlds of intrigue, conspiracy and high drama, their lives, relationships and deaths entwined with the rise and fall of nations and empires. The feats and misdeeds of kings, queens and their progeny were fodder for Shakespearean epics. Yet it is centuries since the British royal family played anything more than a decorative role in the life of the nation -- and this new heir may have to wait the best part of this century before assuming even those diminished duties. Opinion: How to raise a royal baby . Royal heirs have traditionally passed the years waiting for their relatives to die by becoming champions of worthy causes. Prince Charles is famed for his woolly opinions on environmentalism and architecture, while Prince William has leant his support to the campaign to tackle homelessness. Perhaps, out of enlightened self-interest alone and with time on his side, the prince could one day become the first royal to embrace the cause of republicanism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Hooper.","All eyes have been on Duchess of Cambridge ahead of the birth of her first baby .

"(CNN) -- The lines extended into the street at times, voters waiting to pick their choice to succeed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Some 70% of some 50 million registered voters -- men and women, young and old -- turned out according to state broadcaster Press TV, to pick a man who'll deal with high-stakes challenges domestically and internationally. And now the results are starting to trickle in. Based on two sets of still very early results, centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani had more votes than any other candidate, Interior Ministry officials said early Saturday. As of about 7:15 a.m. Saturday (10:45 p.m. ET Friday), Rouhani had 834,859 votes; Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf had 320,562; Saeed Jalili had 257,822; Mohsen Rezaei had 214,368; Ali-Akbar Velayati had 106,144; and Mohammad Gharazi had 25,324. Even counted cumulatively, these votes represented a small fraction of the total vote. If the 70% turnout figure is correct, there would be about 35 million votes; the early results reflect about 1.76 million. When the final tally does come in, that doesn't necessarily mean the election is over. If no single candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two finishers will face off in a runoff next Friday, June 21. That victor will take Ahmadinejad's mantle as one of the most visible figures, at a time it's dealing with widespread sanctions tied to international anger over its nuclear program. But he won't be Iran's most powerful man: That distinction belongs to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been Iran's supreme leader since 1989. He's got plenty of backing, from conservative citizens to paramilitary to, most notably of all, the Revolutionary Guard. ""Whoever is president, he's going to have his hands relatively tied by the Revolutionary Guard if they don't really like what he's doing,"" said Alireza Nader, a policy analyst at the Rand Corporation think tank. Centrist candidate complained of irregularities . This reality of Iranian governance, though, didn't prevent 680 men and women from officially seeking the office. The Guardian Council -- a non-elected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader -- narrowed that group down to eight. Two others subsequently dropped out. The final six contenders don't include any women. Nor do they include Ahmadinejad's aide and protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who was among those excluded by the Guardian Council. Velayati, Ghalibaf and Jalili, who is Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, are considered close to Khamenei and would be unlikely to challenge his authority. Of the three, Jalili has seen the most popular support going into the vote. Rouhani, meanwhile, has the backing of the highly influential former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Hours into the voting, Rouhani had complained of a voting irregularity. A reform candidate, Mohammed Aref, who dropped out of the race earlier in the week, is still on some ballots. Rouhani is worried that voters may mistakenly select Aref, which would amount to a vote thrown away. It was not clear how many ballot papers were concerned. CNN's view on the streets of Tehran . Iran's semi-official Mehr News reported via Twitter that voting lines got longer in the afternoon, and that there were insufficient voting slips in some polling stations. CNN's Erin Burnett on 2013 vs. 2009 elections . 2009 chaos . Images of bleeding and dying Iranians flickered across social media four years ago after allegations of election fraud sparked protests and clashes. Police and the Basij, a feared paramilitary group, cracked down on the protests. Protesters were jailed, and human rights groups alleged many were tortured and killed behind bars while the government quashed the uprising. Reform politicians representing the movement, including Ahmadinejad's election rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi, have remained under house arrest. Despite the unrest, Ahmadinejad's re-election was formally certified by the clerical establishment. Since his reelection, conservative politicians close to the supreme leader have assailed Ahmadinejad for being too liberal, and he has often been at odds with Khamenei. Some of Ahmadinejad's associates have faced heavy repression, and hardliners attempted to link the president to the largest embezzlement case in the country's history. Ahead of the vote this time round, campaigning was more muted although Khamenei's office repeated his call to the ballot boxes Friday with posts on social networking site Twitter. ""I humbly expect from our nation to participate all in #IranElection & do this as soon as possible,"" the supreme leader's post said. Voting is not mandatory in Iran, but there are major incentives to push people to the polls. An active voter has a better shot at promotions in the workplace and preference when it comes to collecting social welfare benefits. This can be vital in an economy that is chronically weighed down by international sanctions over nuclear concerns. Khamenei also tweeted a jab at the United States, which has often led the charge to tighten those sanctions. ""I have heard that #USpoliticians said they don't recognize #IranianElection. Hell with their recognition!"" he said. Clampdown on dissent? Rights group Amnesty International said this week that it was ""concerned by evidence that the Iranian authorities are intensifying their clampdown on dissent"" in the run-up to the vote. ""Those targeted include political activists, journalists and other media workers, trade unionists, advocates of greater rights for Iran's religious and ethnic minorities, students and others. In many cases, the full reasons for arrest and detention are not known; in others, those arrested have been brought before the courts on sweeping but vaguely worded charges, convicted and sentenced to prison terms,"" it said. The head of language services for BBC World Service, Liliane Landor, also complained Thursday of ""unacceptable harassment"" of its staff and other independent journalists in Iran. ""The BBC is very concerned by the unprecedented levels of intimidation being suffered by families of BBC Persian Service staff living in Iran in the final days of the presidential election campaign,"" she said. ""The harassment has included threats that relatives will lose jobs and pensions and be prevented from traveling abroad. For the first time the lives of BBC Persian TV staff living in the UK have also been threatened."" Iran's Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Mohammad Hosseini, said more than 2,000 local reporters and 450 foreign journalists were covering the election in Iran. The head of the Foreign Reporters Bureau within the ministry, Alireza Shirvani, said the number of foreign reporters covering the presidential election had increased by about 15% compared with four years ago. CNN's Neda Farshbaf, Azadeh Ansari and Sara Mazloumsaki contributed to this report.","NEW: Centrist candidate Rouhani is top vote-getter in very early results .

"(CNN) -- Following a CNN investigation, The University of Kentucky released some data on its pediatric heart surgery program, showing a 5.8% overall mortality rate from 2008 to 2012, slightly higher than the national average of less than 4% mortality. The data was first requested in December 2012 by a local journalist, and again in January 2013 by the Kentucky Attorney General's office. The University repeatedly declined to release the program's mortality rate, saying that information would compromise patient privacy laws. The newly-released data shows that in 2012, the year of the program's suspension, the mortality rate climbed to 7.1%, according to the University of Kentucky.

""Anytime a question is raised about a clinical program or a patient's care, we bring all involved parties together and review the situation and circumstances in a 'no holds barred' manner,"" wrote the University of Kentucky in a statement last Friday. ""Sometimes we even choose to put a program 'on hold,' until we are certain that we are doing everything necessary to provide the highest level of care. This is what we did with our Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery program."" ""The mortality rates ranged from 4.5 percent to 7.1 percent. These ranges are comparable to national mortality rates averaging 5.3 percent for programs of similar size to ours,"" says the University statement. Comparing oneself to programs of a similar size isn't good enough, says Tabitha Rainey. Smaller programs often have slightly higher mortality rates than largest programs. ""These smaller institutions want to go open these programs, but they don't have all the correct measures to take care of these kids, and then they don't want to explain, and they end up losing their kids rather than sending them to a bigger facility that's more rehearsed in this,"" says Rainey, who began a change.org petition asking the hospital to release their mortality outcomes.

"(CNN) -- An Army social worker who was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan in 2009 told a military court Monday that she thought the shooting at Fort Hood was a training exercise. She comforted a soldier who later died, she said. Capt. Dorothy Ellen Carskadon was in the Soldier Readiness Processing Center for a final checkup on November 5 that year when admitted gunman Maj. Nidal Hasan began shooting. She dropped to the ground, she said at Hasan's court-martial. Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in the shooting rampage at the Army post near Killeen, Texas. Carskadon said she heard Pvt. Francheska Velez screaming ""my baby, my baby"" as she cradled her stomach. She crawled to Velez and tried to comfort her, telling the private that it would be OK and that the training exercise would end soon. Velez died in the attack. Carskadon noticed blood dripping from her own head and tried to stand, but her leg went numb. As she fell, she was shot in the stomach. She collapsed and thought to herself, ""I'm through with this field exercise and I chose not to move anymore."" She awoke in a hospital intensive care unit with four gunshot wounds: one that grazed her head; another through her right hip; a third lodged in her right leg; and a fourth in the abdomen. Also Monday, a nurse relived the chaos as she hid from Hasan and called 911. Shanika Hairston choked back tears as prosecutors introduced the 911 call she made as gunshots rang out while she administered immunizations to soldiers who were about to be deployed. The 911 operator was periodically drowned out by gunfire and screams. After the recording finished, Hairston described seeing a man shot to death in front of her. ""Solider behind me stood up, his eyes got real wide, and then he fell,"" she said. Hairston maintained her composure throughout her testimony and was excused by the court. As she exited the courtroom, loud sobs could be heard through the heavy wooden doors. At the beginning of the day, Hasan excused a member of his defense team from the proceedings, saying that Lt. Col. Christopher Martin needed to do an unspecified task on his behalf.","An Army social worker, shot 4 times, thought the Fort Hood shooting was an exercise .

"Singapore (CNN) -- At nearly the length of four football pitches, the container ship Eugen Maersk takes some stopping when traveling at full speed -- around 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) before it can come to a complete halt. It can also burn through 250 tons of highly polluting bunker fuel each day when at sea, but while berthed in Singapore last month the ship was trying its best to keep a low profile, at least in terms of its impact on the environment. The 397-meter long vessel was running on a low-sulfur fuel while in port, something its owners say reduces toxic sulfur dioxide emissions by 85%. Financially, the shipping industry is in the doldrums, suffering from over capacity and high oil prices. With tough times have come new ideas on how to cut costs and improve the environmental impact of shipping. These days many shipping lines believe that bigger is better, not just for the shipping companies' bottom line, but also the environment. ""The bigger the ship the lower the fuel consumption, that's one thing,"" said Thomas Riber Knudsen, Asia Pacific CEO of shipping line Maersk. ""The most important thing that we're doing (to reduce costs) on all our ships is we're reducing speed so simply sailing slower than we would normally do. ""There is a benefit in financial terms. Our biggest financial cost is fuel consumption; (cutting it) happens to be very good for the environment so probably there is shared interest there."" As well as travelling slower, new ships like the Eugen Maersk have other fuel-saving and potentially environmentally-friendly features, such as a redesigned bow and special paint to reduce friction through the water. Built-in measures to make vessels more efficient are increasingly important believes Knudsen, as there is a growing awareness in the industry that it needs to take a long view on its environmental impact. Shipping's international regulator, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has embarked on a greenhouse gas reduction program, part of which will come into action in 2013, which for the first time includes CO2 emissions. The IMO believes the new measure could reduce CO2 emissions by 180 million tons annually by 2020 and save $34 billion to $60 billion in fuel costs. So far the most toxic of pollutants from ships, like sulfur dioxide, have been the main focus of the IMO program and also other regional regulations. In some areas of Europe and the U.S., ships have been required by law for years to use low-sulfur fuel when in port. Currently Asian countries lag behind others in environmental regulations, relying instead on voluntary initiatives like the one introduced in Singapore last year. Its Green Shipping Initiative offer incentives such as reduced port fees for ships in return for using low-sulfur fuel. Maersk say that despite the financial sweeteners from Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority the company is actually losing money by using low-sulfur fuel that can cost twice as much as ordinary bunker fuel. ""Its' very difficult to stand out as a single shipping line to do this...What we would like is to have comprehensive rules spanning the globe, so we don't have areas that are different from each other,"" said Knudsen. ""We think the industry has a responsibility (to the environment) but it's very hard to be the one standing out and doing it as a competitive differentiator."" Some believe that retrofitting ships with equipment like ""scrubbers"" that remove harmful emissions from vessels could help the industry to clean up its act. Critics of existing scrubber technology however point out that the technology only removes the toxic chemicals from the atmosphere at the expense of depositing them in the ocean as contaminated waste water. The Singaporean company Ecospec, supported by the country's government, believes it has avoided this problem with its emission abatement system developed over the last ten years. According to the company it removes not just sulfur dioxide, but also carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. However the company's managing director, Chew Hwee Hong is sanguine about the potential for any green shipping technology to succeed without the push of uniform regulations. ""I would say a good 95% of (shipping industry green initiatives) is incentivized or is driven by international regulations,"" he said. ""You get 5% who are volunteers, who are green advocates; they want to do it by themselves, irrespective of whether there are those regulations."" Until firmer international regulations emerge, linking cost-savings with environmental action is the best way to encourage the industry to do more, believes Manish Singh, of shipping consultancy, Ideocean. ""I don't expect fuel prices to go down but if they did and still the industry as a whole had become a lot more efficient, I think that efficiency will stay with us,"" he said. ""The fact they remain high today is helping to get the opinion and the action done. There is a genuine commitment to the ecological cost but I suppose the fact that we have a very strong economic reason to take action adds to the urgency.""","Shipping accounts for around 3% global CO2 emissions, according to IMO .

"(CNN) -- Even during difficult times, Iraqi Airways is aiming high. Earlier this year Iraq's national carrier started expanding its route network for the first time in 23 years. It added flights between Baghdad and London, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, and even Kuwait. In the next few months, the airline is planning on adding connections to Copenhagen, Stockholm, Kuala Lumpur, and destinations throughout China, hoping ultimately to expand its network from 15 to 40 by 2017. ""The main draw right now is for Iraqis visiting family and friends. There are four million Iraqis living outside of Iraq, so that's a big market,"" says Saad Al Khafaji, a spokesman for the airline. John Strickland, an independent transport consultant, notes that the country's position as a recovering post-war country actually puts the airline in good stead. ""There's a short-term boost from all the workers going in to get the country back on its feet, including NGOs and construction companies. Now that it's on the mend, there's a lot of potential, and as the oil industry continues to grow, it will continue to generate a lot of interest,"" he says. Read more: Iraqi women push to play . The carrier first attempted a comeback in 2010, but was thwarted by a $1.2 billion lawsuit by Kuwait, which claimed Iraq owed it for aircraft destroyed during the first Gulf War. Now that the suit has been settled, Iraqi Airways seems eager to again reach for the skies. Al Khafaji says the company has invested $700 million so far on a new fleet, including ten Boeing 787 Dreamliners. ""If you look at the planes Iraqi Airways is ordering, they're really moving towards the next generation aircraft,"" says Strickland. ""Given Iraq's location, it will put them in a position where they'll be able to reach most places in the world on a non-stop basis."" The Iraqi government is also making significant contributions on the ground. The country's vast oil revenues (it is now OPEC's second biggest producer) are helping to renovate libraries, museums and archaeological relics -- such as the 1,500-year-old Arch of Ctesiphon. ""The government's objective is to show Iraq isn't just about bombings. There is actual movement to restore the museums, and bring back some of the tourists,"" says Denise Natali, a Middle East expert at the National Defense University in Washington. Iraq's Ministry of Transport is also investing heavily in its airports. Plans are currently underway to add three new terminals to Baghdad Airport, doubling its annual capacity to 15 million passengers. Similarly ambitious airport projects are in the works throughout the country, backed partly by the premise that a transport hub will spur growth in the surrounding cities. Read more: World records in Dubai . ""The cities will grow towards the airport,"" says Layla Kareem, the project manager for yet-to-be-built Middle Euphrates International Airport (MEIA). The airport, which will have a capacity of 60 million passengers annually after the completion of the first stage (projected 2017), will be situated near the holy city of Karbala, a place of pilgrimage for the region's Shiite Muslims. There is still the issue of ongoing violence in the capital and other parts of the country that the tourism industry has the contend with. The last few months have been the deadliest in the country for five years. According to the United Nations mission to Iraq, last month witnessed 1,045 violent deaths, and another 712 in April, leaving one to ponder whether the country's investment isn't premature. ""There's this idea that the government isn't functioning due to infighting. The truth is, in spite of the terrible bombings in Baghdad, you have considerable progress in the North and South. Those are areas the violence hasn't really touched,"" says Natali. ""At the end of the day, it's the airports that bring in the people that are going to make Iraq stronger. As the airports develop, so too do the cities and towns around them.""","Iraqi Airways is expanding its fleet and destinations .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, the two men vying to be Australia's prime minister in the September 7 national election, offer contrasting views on China, the country that looms largest on Australia's economic and strategic horizon. Rudd, the Chinese-speaking incumbent prime minister in the Labor-led government, says the China resources boom is over and Australia needs to prepare for that transition, given how important China has become as a trade partner in the past decade. China is a key destination for Australian resources such as iron ore, coal and LNG. But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. On the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific ""strategic road-map"" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region. READ MORE: Rudd: Better second time around? The Opposition's view on China . Abbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of ""shared values."" But he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. In a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached ""the warmth that we take for granted with America."" Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. Like his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing. Howard, he said, ""understood that you could make a new friend without losing an old one."" Abbott said Australia accepted China's modernization of its armed forces and so Australia's strong military relationship with the United States should be seen more as a means of ""building trust than picking sides."" His objective in government would be engagement with China rather than containment, and cooperation rather than strategic competition. Where they agree . Where Rudd and Abbott are in agreement is on the need to wrap up a free trade agreement with China that has been in the works since 2005. The two countries recently began their 20th round of negotiations, but differences over agriculture, investment access and intellectual property protection continue to stymie a result. In contrast, neighboring New Zealand signed a free trade agreement with China in 2008 and has seen its exports of meat, dairy and other foodstuffs grow significantly. READ MORE: China orders NZ dairy recall . There has been some bilateral progress this year. During a visit to China in April, Julia Gillard, the Labor leader who took over when Rudd was dumped by his own party in 2010 before she suffered the same fate at Rudd's hands on June 26, signed a ""strategic partnership"" agreement with President Xi Jinping that calls for annual high-level leadership meetings. Rudd has already invited Xi to visit Australia next year. Abbott has said that if he wins government, his first overseas trip would be to Indonesia, and his second would include China. He has also pledged to sign a China free trade agreement within 12 months of taking office. But Abbott has also expressed wariness about Chinese state-controlled investment in Australia. ""Chinese investment is complicated by the prevalence of state-owned enterprises,"" he told the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. ""It would rarely be in Australia's national interest to allow a foreign government or its agencies to control an Australian business."" In that same speech, Abbott pushed the need for Chinese political and legal reforms. ""In the long term, China should prosper even more if its people enjoyed freedom under the law and the right to choose a government, despite the difficulty of managing this transition in a country with a tumultuous history,"" he said. But whatever disagreements Australia had with China, Abbott said it was important to acknowledge the vast improvement in living standards that Chinese people had enjoyed since the 1970s. Where Abbott is comfortable with U.S. primacy and policy, Rudd argues that it is up to both China and the United States to take the lead in creating a more integrated, secure and prosperous Asia-Pacific. Rudd's record in China . The first time Rudd was Australia's prime minister (2007-2010), he irritated the Chinese leadership through his criticism of China's human rights record in Tibet during an April 2008 speech to university students in Beijing. Rudd, a lifelong student of Chinese history and a fluent Mandarin speaker from his time as a diplomat in the Australian Embassy in Beijing in the 1980s, maintained he was simply speaking frankly, as befitted one of China's ""zhengyou"" or ""true, critical friends."" Rudd's enthusiasm for all things Chinese hasn't waned. For the last year he has been banging the drum about the need for a new China-US strategic road map -- something that may have seen its formative steps in the informal discussions between U.S. President Barack Obama and President Xi at Sunnylands in California in early June. Rudd believes that Xi is ""a Chinese leader that the Americans can do business with."" In a speech to foreign correspondents in Sydney late last year, Rudd described Xi as ""experienced, confident and self-assured and because of his family's political pedigree (his father Xi Zhongxun was a Politburo member), comfortable with the mantle of political leadership."" READ MORE: Rudd writes on China's leadership change . Certainly the Sunnylands meeting between Obama and Xi looked to have increased the personal chemistry between the two leaders. Unlike some of his predecessors, Xi is relaxed in an international setting and has spent considerable time in the United States. Rudd sees a role for Xi that goes beyond the development of long-term U.S.-China relations to one that involves ""shaping the broad architecture of a new rules-based order for Asia."" This is how Rudd described Xi just before the latter's elevation to the top job in China: ""Given the formidable strategic and economic challenges that lie ahead, both for China itself, and China's place in the region and the world, on balance I believe Xi Jinping to be the man for the times."" Road map for China . Rudd's road map for U.S.-China ties includes more regular meetings between the U.S. and Chinese presidents -- about five times a year -- and the appointment on both sides of an undisputed ""point person"" who would be the main channel for the relationship, in the style of Henry Kissinger in the Nixon era. For the U.S., that person is current National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who replaced Tom Donilon on July 1. For China, Xi's top foreign policy advisor is former ambassador to the U.S., former foreign minister and current State Councillor Yang Jiechi, though academic and Politburo member Wang Huning is also regarded as an influential ""behind the scenes"" figure. In Rudd's view, any U.S.-China strategic road map for Asia should seek to include Japan and China in a new Trans-Pacific Partnership that ideally would become a ""genuine free trade area of Asia and the Pacific."" Rudd is the first to acknowledge the difficulties in getting China and Japan together. To achieve this, he says, would require proactive political leadership from Beijing, Washington and Tokyo. For his part, Abbott says that while U.S. policy is not infallible,""its interventions abroad are invariably in favour of democracy and human rights, not against them."" Because of the history and values shared by Australians and Americans, Abbott said there were easy returns for Australia from the relationship with Washington. But to get anything like comparable returns with China, Australians would have to work much harder.","Australian election pits incumbent Kevin Rudd against Tony Abbott .

"(CNN) -- Leaping from rooftops and doing backflips off walls is when Prince Haydar feels the most free. The 25-year-old from Baghdad is one of the city's small band of freerunners, who take every opportunity to practice parkour in a city striving for normality and currently facing a resurgence of deadly violence. ""When I do parkour, I get rid of all the scattered thoughts in my head and empty all the anger from inside me,"" said Haydar. From the streets of Paris in the 1990s, where parkour was first popularized, to Zawra park in Iraq's capital, freerunning has become a global phenomenon. The sport evolved from French military training and involves running through urban environments using only the body to overcome obstacles and objects. In Baghdad, the challenges are even greater than in other cities. Haydar says his fellow freerunners have to contend with a public unsure of what to make of a group running and leaping through the city's largest public park. There is also the threat of bomb attacks and indiscriminate violence in the city. ""It is dangerous and it is difficult to practice parkour anywhere,"" he says. ""Sometimes we are exposed to arrested or misunderstanding from some people and there is the deteriorating security situation."" But despite these challenges, Haydar is committed to improving in his sport, and teaching its benefits to others. He was first turned on to freerunning in 2007 when he watched the film ""District B13"" that featured parkour in many of its stunt sequences. Inspired, he sought out internet clips of the sport in order to learn parkour techniques. ""We are a small group of young people and there are no parkour classes,"" he says, noting that the group -- aged between 18 and 25 -- support and teach each other, going as far as pooling their money to rent a gym. ""It's small and does not meet the purpose,"" he says. ""It's very far from our homes, but despite of all these difficult circumstances we go."" ""I love parkour because this sport is the art of movement and freedom and this art has made me know true freedom in this difficult life.""","Prince Haydar is one of Baghdad's exponents of parkour .

"(CNN) -- Those countries in the Middle East that have been spared political upheaval find themselves enmeshed in a different sort of battle of late. As Qatar, the UAE and Jordan split what's left of the region's tourists, each is fighting to pull in the lion's share. Their weapon of choice? Theme parks. Currently, Abu Dhabi and its scrappier sibling, Al Ain, are duking it out with Doha for the rights to build the region's first Angry Birds theme park. Not surprisingly, the Middle Eastern version of Angry Bird Land (there are already outlets in Finland, Singapore and the UK) would also be the world's largest. ""[The competition] is getting quite fierce,"" says Nigel Cann, director of operations and development at Gebal Group, the local agents for Lappset, who first developed the brand's entertainment complex. Read more: The Middle East's changing butler class . ""They all want to find a space for it, and to do it as soon as they can. They all want to be first."" As one of the most downloaded apps of all times (the game has amassed 1.7 billion downloads since launching in 2010), Angry Birds' name recognition is almost unbeatable. Though is a global phenomenon, it's proved particularly popular in the region. Over a fifth of all downloads come from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Rovio Entertainment, the developers of the game, are even toying with the idea of creating a localized version of the game. ""Everyone recognizes the game, from little kids to adults,"" notes Cann. ""It's a brand new concept to the region. No one has it, and everyone wants it. They want to be ahead of their neighbors all the time -- they want to beat them at everything."" At $60 million, the budget for Angry Birds Land is fairly modest, by entertainment complex standards. According to John Gerner, a theme park consultant and the managing director at Leisure Business Advisors, it makes for a fairly inexpensive investment. ""It's really a great concept for the Middle East, especially for areas looking to grow their attractions,"" he says. ""The scale is small, but it still has a brand name associated with it, and a very current one at that. It gives [whoever wins it] a name attraction without the risk of a more expensive brand."" Read more: Dubai cops have Lamborghinis . Angry Birds Land is just one of several ambitious projects proposed in the region. Other cities are starting to come up with theme park concepts that are either branded, big, or bizarre. In addition to courting Angry Birds, Abu Dhabi has expressed interest in a Michael Jackson-themed resort. According to Abu Dhabi newspaper The National, Jermaine Jackson has been in talks to build it on Yas Island, adjacent to Ferrari World. Jordan, a country who relies more on cultural tourism than man-made gimmicks (UNESCO-listed Petra is the most popular destination, attracting over 600,000 visitors in 2011), seems to be taking a tip from its neighbor. RGH Themed Entertainment are developing a $1.5 billion entertainment resort in Aqaba, complete with Star Trek themed rides and a flight simulator attraction. Before the 2008 recession, Dubai had several entertainment-themed developments in the pipeline, mainly slated for the still undeveloped neigborhood of Dubailand. Though some -- like the largest Six Flags theme park outside of the United States -- were shelved in the downturn, others have found their legs in Dubai's recent economic resurgence. One of these projects includes IMG World of Adventure, which has a soft launch scheduled for December as part of the City of Arabia residential and commercial development. It plans to usurp Ferrari World as the world's largest indoor theme park, and will include four zones, which, separately, would be a massive undertaking. Perhaps the most unique is The Lost Valley, a Jurassic-themed segment that will include animatronic dinosaurs. Two other zones are dedicated to the characters of Marvel Comics and Cartoon Network. ""We want this park to be one of the center points in the future of Dubai,"" explains Adam Alexander Page, the vice president of marketing for IMG Group, the developer behind the project. ""As such, you don't want to build something that won't get global attention, and if that means it's big, that's what you do. There's no point in building it small.""","Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Doha are competing to for the rights to build the Middle East's first Angry Birds theme park.
Though the details aren't finalized, the park will also be the biggest in the world.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- An Ethiopian military cargo plane crashed at an airport in the Somali capital of Mogadishu early Friday, killing four crew members, African Union peacekeepers said. The plane ""burst into flames immediately on crashing"" at the international airport, according to the African Union Mission to Somalia. It was carrying arms to the African Union forces in Somalia when it crashed as it landed just before 8 a.m. local time, airport staff said. AMISOM expressed condolences to the government and people of Ethiopia. Established in 2007, the peacekeeping force has more than 17,000 personnel from across Africa helping the Somali government battle Islamist militants in the nation. Backed by the United Nations, its role is to help maintain peace and support Somalia's federal government, as the African nation struggles to emerge from more than two decades of conflict. Journalist Omar Sheik Nor reported from Mogadishu and Samira Said from Atlanta.","The plane ""burst into flames immediately on crashing""

"(CNN) -- The United Nations is urging countries to invest in green jobs working with ""sustainable forest management"" to address the growing problem of unemployment worldwide. A deforested area appears in a rain forest in Brazil's Para state  in October. At least 10 million such jobs could be created, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization will say in a report to be released this week. The report does not mention any countries but is aimed at ""mainly regions with substantial rural unemployment and degraded land areas,"" said C.T.S. Nair, chief economist in the U.N. Forestry Department and one of the authors of the report. While all countries could benefit from investing in these green jobs, Nair said, Asia and Africa -- and to some extent Latin America -- could benefit the most. India, China and almost all countries in Africa stand to benefit, he added. The United Nations said it already is seeing indications that some countries -- such as the United States, India and South Korea -- are interested and taking action to invest in sustainable forest management by making it part of their economic stimulus plans. Sustainable forestry aims to prevent depletion of forests by managing them and making sure their use does not interfere with natural benefits or the local environment. For example, in forests where wood is being removed, the United Nations is suggesting that people be hired to monitor and manage how much wood is taken out to ensure the forest does not become depleted and can grow back fully. Managers also would make sure the wood harvest wouldn't affect biodiversity and the water supply. The report will be discussed and analyzed next week at the U.N. Committee on Forestry meeting in Rome, Italy. The Food and Agriculture Organization has designated next week as World Forest Week.","U.N. says countries should invest in green jobs for ""sustainable forest management""

"(CNN) -- A deadly bus crash in Thailand has raised further concerns about travel safety in a country increasingly known for not just its beautiful beaches but also the high volume of road-related deaths that occur every year. At least 19 people died Tuesday morning at about 4 a.m. when a Bangkok-bound chartered bus collided with a truck and burst into flames. According to police, the truck driver was on his way to a factory when he dozed off at the wheel and lost control of the vehicle. The crash comes a day after reports that a tour bus making its way to Bangkok from Phang-nga province crashed in the southern province of Prachuap Khiri Khan, injuring 22. For people who live in Thailand, news headlines highlighting passenger bus and mini-van accidents have become an almost weekly occurrence. The country has one of the world's worst road-safety records, according to figures from the World Health Organization (WHO). Government concern . With Thailand welcoming more than 22 million visitors in 2012, according to Tourism Authority figures released in January, the country's safety record is an ever-present issue for foreign governments looking to stop their citizens from being included in Thailand's deathly road statistics. Several countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom and United States, have issued warnings to tourists and expats against the bad road conditions and lax enforcement of safety measures in the country. Last week, the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) released its annual ""British Behavior Abroadâ€³ report, which analyzes assistance provided by consular staff from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013. In it, Thailand is singled out as a destination where many British citizens require help. ""Thailand has seen a significant increase in hospitalizations and deaths, despite fewer cases worldwide,"" says the FCO report. While acknowledging that an aging population attributed to the increase, ""road traffic accidents, many involving young people on mopeds"" are also a factor. 'Poor safety standards' The FCO's official advisory on Thailand also points to ""serious accidents involving other vehicles including cars, coaches and mini-buses"" as being a risk to its citizens. ""Many accidents are due to poor vehicle and driver safety standards,"" reads the advice. ""Motorcycles or scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and can't be used legally on a public road,"" it adds. Earlier this year, the FCO launched a website aimed at keeping British nationals safe while driving in foreign countries. Part of a new road safety campaign, the site was developed in response to reports of a high number of road traffic incidents affecting British tourists and expats in popular destinations, such as Thailand, Australia and Spain. ""In Thailand, a country with 50,000 British residents and over 870,000 British visitors per year, there were 68,582 road traffic incidents resulting in 9,205 deaths involving both Thai residents and tourists in 2011,"" says the U.K. government post announcing the new campaign. ""In contrast 1,901 people were killed in road accidents in the UK in 2011."" 'Laws disobeyed' The U.S. Department of State has a similar warning on its Thailand travel advisory page, updated in March 2013. ""Speeding, reckless passing, and failure to obey traffic laws are common in all regions of Thailand,"" warns the advisory. ""Commercial drivers commonly consume alcohol and amphetamines. Bus crashes occur frequently, especially on overnight trips, and sometimes result in fatalities. Congested roads and a scarcity of ambulances can make it difficult for accident victims to receive timely medical attention."" According to the WHO's most recent report on global road safety statistics, in 2010 Thailand had an estimated 38 road traffic deaths per 100,000 people, making it one of the world's deadliest places to be on the road. The report says 74% of Thailand's road traffic deaths were attributed to motorcycle accidents. ""Helmet-wearing campaigns,"" would help to reduce the carnage on the country's roads, said Avi Silverman, from the Make Roads Safe campaign, along with ""better road infrastructure -- safe crossing points and more pavements -- properly enforced speeding legislation, better post-crash care and better coordination among regional countries all suffering the same problem."" CNN's Meng Meng contributed to this report.","19 people killed in Tuesday morning crash in Thailand .

"(CNN) -- It started a few years ago, as I was spiraling down one of Wikipedia's endless information rabbit holes. I already had as many trains of thought as I had tabs open, and yet, somewhere between the fall of the Roman Empire and the chemical properties of copper, another little thought managed to burrow a space for itself: I started to consider the process by which all this information had been amassed, ordered, published and argued over -- the massive collaborative effort shared amongst so many contributors, and the exponential benefit such a resource provided. Over time that initial little moment of wonder grew into a fascination with the culture around shared information - code and designs that can be studied, modified, and redistributed by anyone, for any purpose. Check out this demo of 3D printing pen . But no matter how many documentaries I watched, books I read, and blogs I followed, I remained a spectator. The conversation about remix culture and self-replicating machines was between hackers, engineers and Harvard professors, and I didn't feel I could contribute. I made music videos, not circuit boards. Before this year I had never used a 3D printer, never written a line of code, and about the only thing I could make myself was an omelette. But in this inexperience I saw an opportunity to share the story and the struggles of a complete beginner, trying everything for the first time. Since August 1 2012 I've been living a ""Year of Open Source,"" exploring how the systems and culture of free and open-source software work in other areas. For a year, I'm using or developing products and projects that are shared under open licenses, made to be copied or built upon by others -- which also means not buying any traditionally copyrighted or patented products. I've been applying this concept to as many areas of my life as possible and documenting the results in blogs and videos. Digital tattoos, mind-reading headphones: The shape of things to come? Some lifestyle changes have been welcome -- swapping Mac software for Linux was much easier than I expected, and I'm never going back. ""Researching"" open source beer is also a pleasure. People often ask me what I miss. Without any hesitation, it's cinema! Open-source, remix-friendly films aren't too common. I haven't been to the movies in 10 months and it takes just the faintest murmur from the nearby open air cinema before I find myself anxiously wiping phantom popcorn grease from my fingers. Similarly, avoiding ""all rights reserved"" music has left me with a hollowed-out collection: some dusty public domain blues, and a sparse selection of new music under certain Creative Commons licenses. If you were to compare my music library before, and my music library now, you could never claim it was an improvement. But this project is not about what I'm missing out on. The value of my new music is that it's truly mine to use however I like. When you're expressly given permission to use something, it starts a creative process. I use open-source photos, video and music freely in the videos I make, promoting the original artists while allowing my work to be remixed and reused by others in the same way. Using the commons means I never have to start from zero. I'm currently creating an open educational curriculum for teaching video editing, but I can use existing ideas, resources and examples as a framework. Makeblock: open source 'Lego for adults' My DIY skills have come a long way -- making scarves, wine, soap and toothpaste, though it seems like whittling sticks when compared to the possibilities of open hardware and digital manufacturing. The online sharing of 3D files allows people around the world to collaborate and create intricate physical objects using laser cutters, 3D printers and CNC mills. It's not as easy as clicking ""print"" but I've been able to develop projects that would be impossible using traditional techniques. Thanks to the help from Fabienne Serriere and her hacked knitting machine I was able to survive the Berlin winter with an open source woolly hat. Its pattern draws on public-domain snowflake images, and a knitted QR code leads to the hat's source files. Although 3D-printed underwear is a long way off (plastic chain mail, anyone?) I thought computers could still take some of the difficulty out of making your own clothes. People don't all fit neatly into small, medium and large, and patterns should reflect that. At my local co-sewing space I met a talented tailor and designer who helped me make a parametric underwear pattern -- you type in your waist measurement, and the pattern adjusts its shape to fit. Read this: My open-source cure for brain cancer . This community is growing fast. Berlin's first Fab Lab is just starting to plug in the 3D printers and warm up the soldering irons, already attracting a diverse collection of people who are exploring digital manufacturing for the first time. With each step there are technical challenges, and other difficulties along the way -- a lack of budget, as well as the time spent researching and organizing collaborations. Progress is slow. I haven't yet tackled big issues like an open-source approach to electricity, internet service or land access, and I'm running out of time. On August 1 2013, the restrictions will stop and, yes, I'm heading straight to the movies. But now, I need no impetus to look for open-source solutions wherever possible -- it's automatic. The year might be ending, but this process is not. The main lesson I've learned is that if you want to make things yourself, if you want to help others, or express yourself creatively, you don't need any special skills or background to get started. There is an ever-growing wealth of information, tools and designs in the commons, which you already have permission to use. Share and share alike. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sam Muirhead.","Sam Muirhead is using only products shared under open licenses .

"(CNN)  -- It is possible more U.S. troops could be added in Afghanistan if the new U.S. commander there needs them, but Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he does not expect a significant increase. U.S. Marines sweep for bombs in  Afghanistan this week. During a visit to troops at Fort Drum, New York, on Thursday, Gates said he is waiting to hear what Gen. Stanley McChrystal recommends after he completes a review of operations in Afghanistan. McChrystal is expected to complete a classified report for Gates by the end of this month, assessing  where the war stands, and what needs to be done. He will tell Gates whether he needs more U.S. troops to fight the escalating conflict, according to a senior U.S. military official. Gates asked McChrystal  to ""state his requirements for resources,"" said the official -- who did not want to be identified because the report is not completed. The review is also expected to recommend that the number of Afghan troops be increased beyond the goal of 134,000, other military sources said. During a speech and question-and-answer session with troops at Fort Drum, Gates acknowledged he would consider a recommendation to boost U.S. troops beyond the level of 68,000 already approved. ""We'll see what Gen. McChrystal recommends,"" he said. ""But I think there will not be a significant increase in troop levels in Afghanistan beyond the 68,000, at least probably through the end of the year. Maybe some increase, but not a lot."" Gates has made clear in the past he is reluctant to approve additional major increases in troop levels, preferring to keep the U.S. at a lower profile in the nation. About 57,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, with the other 11,000 to arrive by the end of this year. Gates has said he wants to see if that level of troops would be sufficient. Gates' press secretary, Geoff Morrell, told CNN the Fort Drum comments ""are not necessarily a foreshadowing of what's to come."" He said Gates ""doesn't want to impose an artificial troop cap on the commander,"" but does want to see if the strategy can be carried out with the approved troop levels.","Defense secretary would consider it if U.S. commander says he needs more .

"Washington (CNN) -- Mo Elleithee was a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign but he says his new job as communications director for the Democratic National Committee has nothing to do with his former boss' plans for 2016. ""This has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton. I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again. I suspect she doesn't know yet if she's going to run,"" he said. Elleithee, a strategist who also played key roles in Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential bid, Wesley Clark's 2004 White House campaign, and Senate victories by Tim Kaine and Mark Warner in Virginia and Tom Udall in New Mexico, is confident the Democrats can hold the Senate and make House and gubernatorial pickups in next year's midterm elections. And he says the DNC's debt won't hinder such efforts. Since starting on the job Friday, Elleithee has already hit the cable circuit, appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley"" and MSNBC's ""Hardball with Chris Matthews."" On Monday Elleithee talked to CNN about his new job. Zelizer: Obama did Clinton a huge favor . Q: What is the DNC's mission this cycle? A: Our mission is pretty straightforward. It is to support the president's agenda and it is to support Democratic candidates up and down the ticket in 2013 and 2014. I think we are well positioned to do that. We're doing it on a bunch of different levels, with the communications shop providing communications assistance, but also at the organizing level, helping state parties do the same. So we're just going to be very aggressive on both those fronts and there's a lot of work to do on both those fronts. Q: With Organizing For America, which has a strong grassroots outreach program, no longer part of the DNC, is the party committee going to be less of a player when it comes to grassroots outreach? A: No. I only think you're going to see it step up our grassroots operation, for a couple of reasons. One, there's plenty of grassroots work to go around. But two, you have to remember, OFA is a non-political entity, and so the DNC is still the place to be for political organizing on the Democratic side and I think everybody is committed to seeing that continue to happen. Q: Let's talk money. It's no secret that the Republican National Committee is having a great year when it comes to fundraising. The RNC doesn't have any debt. The DNC incurred a lot of debt in winning last year's election. When it comes to money are there concerns that you won't have the cash to do what you need to do and how will you retire that debt? A: A couple of things. One, you're right -- we went into debt to win, we did. The other side is having a good year. They will likely have more money that us this cycle, but remember, they had more money than us last cycle. The Republican Inc., the Republican and affiliated groups drastically outspent Democrats and affiliated groups last time and it didn't work. So it isn't all about the money. But sure, it is an important part of it. We are going to have what we need to accomplish our goals this cycle, but we're still working to retire that debt and Democrats can help us out by going to Democrats.Org and giving what they can. Q: What are your goals this cycle. Are there specifics you can share? A: We want to hold on to the Senate. We want to win seats in the House and we want to win governorships. That's the goal. And I think there are a lot of places where we can do that. I think there are going to be a lot of competitive races. There are going to be a lot of competitive races where we can pick up seats, we think. Just looking at governors' races, I think Virginia is a huge opportunity for a Democratic pickup. I think Florida and Ohio are huge opportunities for Democratic pickups. Those are just governors' seats. In the Senate we feel very comfortable that can hold the Senate. And based on what I'm seeing I think we feel comfortable that we can pick up seats in the House. So we're going to do what we can to support, we have some great Democratic campaign committees out there, at the DGA, the DCCC, the DSCC. They are doing the heavy lifting and at the DNC we are going to be helping them out however we can, while really helping to do what we can to help the president's agenda. It's all tied together."" Q: There's speculation, because of your role in Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, that this was part of some grand design to have someone from Hillary World take over communications at the DNC in advance of a possible second Clinton bid for the White House. A: This has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton. I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again. I suspect she doesn't know yet if she's going to run. But this has nothing to do with whether or not she's going to run. I'm over here because it's a great opportunity to help all Democrats, to help the party, to help the president. You know, 2016 will come soon enough, but before I came here to the DNC I was among those getting incredibly frustrated by the fact there was so much attention paid to 2016 when we've got a lot of work to do before then. That's why I'm over here. We've got important races in 2013. We've got a lot of important races in 2014.

"(CNN) -- Committing such heinous crimes as sex abuse and murder are unthinkable enough to most of us. But it's almost equally mind-boggling that the perpetrators would then confess, or even brag about, such acts on the Internet. Even so, in cases as mundane as vandalism or as horrifying as gang rape, accused criminals are exemplifying a growing truth of the social-media age: To some, nothing is too sacred, private or damning to share online. ""Social media exposes the crimes, along with the poster's need to feel important or powerful,"" said Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center at the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology. ""However, in most cases, it appears that the need for bravado is much greater than any concerns about getting caught."" The latest high-profile instance happened Thursday, when a Florida man allegedly killed his wife and posted a photograph of her body, along with a confession, on his Facebook page. ""Im going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife,"" wrote Derek Medina, 31, of South Miami. ""(L)ove you guys miss you guys takecare Facebook people you will see me in the news."" The gruesome image was shared thousands of times before Facebook was alerted and deleted it several hours later. It shocked his own Friends list. Among the responses: ""WHAT??????"" ""What happened???? derek."" But social-media posts about crimes are surprisingly common. Just a few of the most widely publicized in recent times: . -- An investigation into the rape of an unconscious 16-year-old girl by high school football players in Steubenville, Ohio, began after some of the accused posted pictures and video of the girl on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. -- The alleged 2011 rape of Rehtaeh Parsons, then 15, in Novia Scotia by four teens was discovered after the teens reportedly shared a photo of her online and via text messages. Two of them, now adults, were charged with child pornography this week. Parsons, at age 17, hanged herself and, in April, was taken off life support. -- In 2011, a Pennsylvania teen pleaded guilty to raping an intoxicated 15-year-old girl, then turned to Facebook, looking for a hit man to kill her. "" ""I got 500 on a girls head who wants that bread?"" he wrote. ""Hit me up anyway possible."" The man who responded was, in fact, an undercover detective. -- A Hawaii man was charged after posting a video titled ""Let's Go Driving & Drinking!"" in which he appears to open and drink a beer while driving and talking to a camera for more than five minutes. READ: When oversharing online can get you arrested . Michele Nealon-Woods, national president of the Chicago School of Professional Psychology, notes that criminals were publicly confessing or boasting of their crimes long before anyone heard of Mark Zuckerberg and tweeting was something done by birds, not humans. In 1888, the notorious ""Jack the Ripper"" is believed to have sent at least three letters to London police, taunting them and telling them when he planned to kill again. In northern California, the so-called Zodiac Killer did much the same nearly a century later. He sent dozens of letters to police and the media in the late 1960s and early '70s -- some of them cryptic puzzles that have never been solved. Throw in timeless tales of jailhouse confessions and barroom braggarts and it's clear that the base instinct here is nothing new. ""The new part of it now, though, is that when people did very dangerous, aggressive bad things to other people in the past, they didn't have the medium with which they could share the information,"" Nealon-Woods said. ""There is that aspect associated with aggressive crime that we've always seen. ""What social media has done is give people with those propensities a whole new platform."" But Nealon-Woods thinks there's more to it. Social media, she says, is a tiny blip in the long and evolving history of human communication. And no on one can be really sure what, if any, impact it will ultimately have on the way we behave. ""It's one of those things that are evolving,"" she said. ""It has been a major, really disruptive innovation in our lives and, like anything that us human beings do, it's taking us quite a while to adapt and change and respond."" While millions, if not billions, of people use social media in healthy, happy ways every day, Nealon-Woods said there are some -- and not just criminals -- who haven't adjusted so well. Their inability to pick up the new social norms result in behaviors ranging from Internet trolling to oversharing to the sort of misguided posts that can embarrass users or land them in jail. The physically isolating aspect of social media is probably part of the equation, she said. When we can communicate with other people without seeing or hearing them, something in the brain makes it harder to remember that there are still consequences for what we say, she said. ""We've removed that human interaction, and that is giving people a false sense of the extremes they can go to,"" Nealon-Woods added. ""I really do believe that's one of the main reasons that people are posting things where other people are saying, 'Oh my gosh!' "" Social media is a young form of communication that will take time for some people to adjust to, she said. In the meantime, Rutledge, the Massachusetts researcher, notes one upside of when awkward online behavior and crime mix. ""The good news is that compulsion to brag about getting away with these activities increases the probability of getting caught,"" she said. ""Without social media, it would have been much harder to find the culprits, much less prosecute (them).""","Crimes, both minor and major, get confessed on social media surprisingly often .

"(CNN)  -- A new smartphone application allows users to carry out a virtual dissection of a human body. The iPhone app, ""Anatomy Lab,"" allows the user to move between 40 body layers to enable dissection. The iPhone app, called ""Anatomy Lab,"" has been developed by researchers from the University of Utah and provides images of a real human cadaver. Utah professor Mark Nielsen told CNN that the application is aimed at medical and anatomy students who might not have the opportunity to dissect a real human body, but it's also proving a hit with medical practitioners. ""A lot of medical professionals, especially in physical therapy and rehabilitative medicine, are using it to educate patients and show them the body parts they're discussing,"" Nielsen told CNN. ""Anatomy Lab"" lets the user move between 40 separate body layers, zoom in to view different structures and rotate them to get different view points. It started out as a computer program showing the dissection of a cadaver, beginning with the skin and moving on to subcutaneous tissue, nerves, veins, and muscles.  See some of the best health monitoring apps » . Nielsen said the iPhone's touch screen is perfect for the interactive nature of the application. ""The program's so logically set up for the iPhone -- you can pinch the screen to rotate and enlarge, and tap on things to identify them,"" he said. Nielsen's son, Scott Nielsen, a physics major at the University of Utah, wrote the code for the iPhone version, which has so far sold more than 3,000 copies.

"(CNN) -- What's better than hanging out in Hawaii and enjoying a warm heater on the beach? Apparently, hanging out in Hawaii and not enjoying a warm heater on the beach -- yours or anyone else's. Honolulu mayor Kirk Caldwell has signed into law two bills that ban smoking in public places across Oahu, including beaches, parks, tennis courts, softball fields and public pools. Municipal golf courses are excepted from the ban. The laws will take effect on January 1, 2014. Unanimously approved by the Honolulu City Council, the new laws expand existing regulations banning smoking in public places. It's already against the law on Oahu to smoke within 20 feet of entrances to stores, restaurants, bars and other workplaces. Smoking has been illegal at the island's popular Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve snorkeling site since 1993. According to CNN affiliate KHON, the ban is part of a statewide effort to reduce cigarette-butt litter and address public health concerns about secondhand smoke. The law goes so far as banning smoking in the ocean in areas fronting public lands. ""If someone wants to walk out into the water and wants to smoke a cigarette here it will be enforced and they will be told to stop,"" Mayor Caldwell told KHON. First time offenders would face fines of $100. Fines for additional offenses escalate up to $500. E-cigarettes aren't covered by the ban and can still be used on Oahu beaches. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, between 1993 and 2011, smoking bans were imposed on 843 parks and 150 beaches around the United States.

"(CNN) -- Google Glass, the tech giant's Internet-connected headset, isn't on the market yet. But that hasn't stopped one lawmaker from trying to keep the eyewear off the highways in his state. In a pre-emptive move, West Virginia state Rep. Gary G. Howell introduced legislation Friday that would amend existing laws against texting while driving to prohibit ""using a wearable computer with head mounted display."" The bill doesn't mention Google Glass by name, although Howell told CNN he was inspired to amend the law after reading an article about the gadget. If passed, the law would make West Virginia the first U.S. state to ban motorists from wearing Google Glass while driving, a Google spokesman said. The law would take effect July 1. ""The primary thing is a safety concern,"" Howell said in an interview. ""It (the Glass headset) could project text or video into your field of vision. I think there's a lot of potential for distraction."" Announced last year, Google Glass is an augmented-reality headset that looks like a thin pair of eyeglasses and can be controlled by voice commands. Above and to the right of the wearer's right eye is a small screen that can display Google search results, e-mails, reminders and other information. The device also comes equipped with a tiny camera that can snap photos and record videos. Google Glass is not expected to go on sale until late this year at the earliest. A price has not been announced, although the company has been selling a limited number of pre-order models, targeted at developers, for $1,500. Asked about the proposed West Virginia law, a Google spokesman sent the following statement: . ""We are putting a lot of thought into the design of Glass because new technologies always raise new issues. We actually believe there is tremendous potential to improve safety on our roads and reduce accidents. As always, feedback is welcome."" For example, Google has said its Glass headset could offer turn-by-turn navigation, with voice commands, to enhance the driving experience. Google has said one goal of its Glass project is to make technology available when users need it but unobtrusive when they don't. The company said the screen on its Glass headset actually sits above the wearer's normal field of vision, not unlike a car's sun visor, and is meant for quick glances, not prolonged viewing. Google Glass has generated a lot of buzz in tech circles and beyond, with many wondering aloud about its practical applications, potential privacy concerns and its promise, for better or worse, of constant connectedness. Although he doesn't want to see it on his state's roads, even Howell says he is intrigued. ""I think it's pretty interesting,"" the state representative said. ""I wouldn't mind trying it.""","Lawmaker introduces legislation in West Virginia to ban motorists from wearing Google Glass .

"(CNN) -- Six inches of snow in Chicago. A foot or so plastering the Upper Midwest. And up to 20 inches expected just west of Washington. Surely, there's a silver lining to these snow clouds though, right? Don't they bring much-needed moisture to parched states? Not quite. Snow is very fluffy, and it takes up to a foot of it to squeeze out an inch of rain, meteorologists say. Snowfall is ""definitely a benefit, but not a drought-buster,"" said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. Many drought-stricken states need a foot of rain, not snow. Frozen ground . When the ground is frozen, little of the moisture left by snow sinks into the soil. ""All of the snow that has fallen over the winter by and large remains on top of the landscape,"" said Minnesota's state climatologist Greg Spoden. Winter storm moves in on D.C. When the sun comes out, it melts the snow first, while the ground remains hard, causing the water to flow off into lakes and rivers, or evaporating, instead of sinking in. Lake City, Minnesota, has received 11.5 inches of snow since Sunday morning, which amounts to about an inch of rain. Not much for a state with levels of soil moisture near all-time lows, according to Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources. ""Even flooding at this point won't alleviate a drought,"" the agency said. But the recent snow will give river and lake levels a nice bump. The snow sent motorists sliding off of slick roads Tuesday, in spite of widespread coverage with salt spread by trucks. Plains states have it worst . Comparatively, Minnesota doesn't have it that bad, according to U.S. Drought Monitor. About half of the United States is now ""abnormally"" to ""moderately"" dry, or worse. Things look particularly bad west of the Mississippi River. When 21 inches fell on Wichita, Kansas, in February, it broke a monthly snowfall record set in 1913. But the state is still plagued by ""severe,"" ""extreme"" and ""exceptional"" drought, U.S. Drought Monitor said. Oklahoma and Kansas will keep more of the moisture the snow left behind, because the ground there isn't frozen, said meteorologist Joel Widenor. Only one state is drier, Nebraska, where U.S. Drought Monitor is located at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. Most of the state is going through an ""exceptional"" drought. Climate change and snowfall . Record snow falls combined with record drought comes as no surprise to climatologists studying climate change. Total snowfall in the western half of the country is dropping, said Princeton climatologist Sarah Kapnick, which will mean less accumulation of moisture from snow. At the same time, the storms that sweep the United States should grow more intense, said meteorologist Marshall Shepherd from the University of Georgia. With global warming, ""we're loading the dice or stacking the deck toward more intense blizzards,"" he said. River water levels . Snowfall has bolstered water levels on the Mississippi River, which had dropped due to drought, said Ann McCulloch, spokeswoman for American Waterways Operators. When high temperatures dried out much of the country last summer, barges were restricted to floating at a depth of nine feet instead of 12 feet. Recent snows have pushed water levels up enough to allow barges to run at 12 feet of depth again. McCulloch is afraid this might not hold, when the summer heat returns. Water where it's not needed . As the current storm reaches the Atlantic coast, dumping snow on the nation's capital, the white precipitation should become slushier and deliver more moisture per foot of snow, according to CNN's Weather Center. The District of Columbia and Baltimore are bracing for potentially significant accumulations, according to the National Weather Service. Snow plows have been readied. Airlines have canceled flights to and from Washington's Dulles airport ahead of the storm's arrival: United 650, U.S. Airways 350, American 20. But by the time the storm gets there, it could turn to rain. The Northeast doesn't need it. It is already plenty moist, Drought Monitor said. In the parched Plains states, snow hasn't helped enough. They could use that rain. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Dana Ford and Phil Gast contributed to this report .","It takes up to a foot of snow to deliver an inch of rain .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- If George Zimmerman were a 28-year-old black man who shot and killed a 17-year-old white teenager under the same circumstances as alleged in Trayvon Martin's death, would he have been immediately arrested? After 30 years as a trial attorney, I can unhesitatingly say, ""Of course."" Herein lies the cultural and racial inequity which has largely led to the polarization and division over culpability in Trayvon's death. It's perplexing that some have criticized my belief that we must withhold judgment on the case until we have all the facts and evidence, especially the forensics. Many people have made up their minds and refuse to listen to other points of view -- newly discovered facts and evolving evidence be damned. When I criticize the prosecutor's handling of the case or suggest hypothetical situations that are consistent with the evidence, some interpret those comments as pro-Zimmerman. They flatly reject any scenario other than that of George Zimmerman racially profiling Trayvon Martin and then shooting and killing him. The late, great Andy Rooney captured this dynamic best when he commented, ""People will generally accept facts as truth only if the facts agree with what they already believe."" Although Trayvon Martin's killing is a tragedy at the highest level, his death and the prosecution of George Zimmerman symbolize so much more. The issues they raise belong in the public discourse, but should not influence or cloud the facts or outcome of the case. Many African-American men have been killed since Martin's death and undoubtedly more will follow. It's likely that none of their names will be well-known. But Trayvon Martin has become a rallying cry for all the wrong that still exists in America regarding race and unequal treatment in the criminal justice system. It's rare that a person of color in America hasn't experienced some sort of bigotry or profiling. Most of them, their families or friends have experienced unequal treatment, bigotry, sneers, insults, misplaced suspicions or police misconduct that was racially motivated. Martin's shooting death represents an opportunity to express and address the injustices which still regularly happen but mostly remain unanswered or unaddressed. Racial equality has advanced far from where it was, but the struggle is not over. African-Americans know injustice still exists. From what I know, regardless of how the evidence plays out and the discovery unfolds, the Sanford Police Department bears great responsibility for the firestorm of this case. If Zimmerman had been immediately arrested, or if the Sanford Police Department had conducted a thorough investigation before it announced there would be no arrest, then it's likely the controversy would not have reached such enormous proportions. To much of the public, it appears as if authorities were dismissive when confronted with the case of another young black male being shot and killed. Trayvon Martin and his grieving family deserve more. George Zimmerman deserves to have his case decided on its merits and not as public retribution for societal sins. What is inescapable to me, though, is that the institutional and insidious prejudice which still permeates many law enforcement agencies is the cause of so much of the outrage surrounding this case. I will continue to ask for judgment to be reserved until the evidence, discovery and forensics are received and reviewed. I want the truth. But I understand why facts might not make much difference to many people. Trayvon Martin's death represents so much more to so many. For them, the chance to finally be heard benefits the greater good. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark NeJame.","Mark NeJame: Zimmerman would have been arrested if he were black and Martin white .

"(CNN) -- In signing Argentina's same-sex marriage law, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said debate over the issue would be ""absolutely anachronistic"" -- archaic, out of date -- within a few years. Striking down California's Proposition 8 two weeks later, Judge Vaughn Walker was more specific, saying there was no evidence for old-fashioned stereotypes that painted gays ""as disease vectors or as child molesters who recruit young children into homosexuality."" Banning people from marrying based on sexual orientation, the President Reagan appointee explained, is ""irrational."" ""Often courts will make decisions that are predictors of what public opinion is going to be a few years from now,"" said Brian Powell, an Indiana University sociology professor and co-author of the upcoming book, ""Counted Out: Same-Sex Relations and Americans' Definitions of Family."" As Walker indicated, attitudes are changing, and waning are concepts that homosexuality harms children, defies biblical teachings or destroys the fabric of society. ""Public attitudes don't change really quickly, but this is one that's changing really, really quickly,"" Powell said. The trend is similar abroad, especially among younger people, said Suzanne Goldberg, a Columbia University law professor who heads the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law. The center has handled asylum cases for gay people fleeing persecution in countries including Jamaica, Brazil, Uzbekistan and Ivory Coast. Research indicates younger people are beginning to see sexual orientation as ""benign variation, so that the differences between gay and nongay couples are simply not so interesting,"" Goldberg said in an e-mail. ""Once that happens, societies have less interest in distinguishing between relationships of gay and nongay couples,"" she added. Before 2008, Massachusetts (via a court ruling) was the only U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage, while the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Canada and South Africa were the only countries. Since then, four U.S. states, five countries, Washington, D.C., and Mexico City have legalized same-sex marriage. Watch why same-sex marriages are on hold in California . While some of these entities have track records of defending civil rights, some may appear more curious. South Africa resides on a continent particularly hostile to gay rights, and in some African countries same-sex relationships are punishable by penal labor, flogging, imprisonment or death, according to the International Lesbian and Gay Association. Mexico City, Portugal and Argentina, all of which legalized same-sex marriage this year -- and Spain, which OK'd it in 2005 -- are staunchly Catholic, and the church has made clear its aversion to same-sex relationships. Goldberg said she believes, in the Catholic countries, the emphasis on religion is trumped by a drive to ensure equality. ""My sense is that the shift in the Catholic countries to recognize same sex-couples marriages stems from a complex set of political and social reasons and has been, in some nations, an indication of the church's shrinking political clout,"" she said. Argentina may fit the bill, as the country is 92 percent Roman Catholic, yet only 20 percent of the population is practicing. Watch couple comment on Argentina's first same-sex marriage . A recent CNN poll said Americans were split 51 percent to 49 percent against granting gay and lesbian couples the right to wed. Proposition 8 was approved by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, but Powell noted referendums ""do not necessarily reflect the will of the people."" Older people tend to cast more ballots than younger folks, he said, and heated issues draw special interests into elections, which can skew demographics. Powell has been collecting data on American attitudes since 2003. While the full data will be released in his book in September, his research adds a layer of nuance to the poll numbers: Though many Americans simply do or do not recognize gay couples as families, 80 percent of Americans consider gay partners a family if they have children. His research shows American definitions of family are becoming flexible, he said, likening the same-sex marriage debate to the rumblings preceding the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision authorizing interracial marriages. Before the miscegenation ruling, researchers found younger people, those with liberal religious views and voters with higher education levels had fewer qualms with interracial marriages. Similar lines hold true in today's same-sex marriage debate. Powell added another variable: gender. Women have a ""more inclusive"" definition of family, he said. Goldberg said demographics were also at play in other nations, ""reaching a tipping point"" on same-sex couples. These societies have had long-standing commitments to end discrimination against gays at work, in courts and elsewhere, she said. iReport.com: 'Army of lovers' fights for rights . There is also ""an increased demand by same-sex couples together with an increased recognition that there really are not nonreligion-based reasons to exclude same-sex couples from marriage,"" she said. The more open discourse on a topic, the more acceptance it garners, Goldberg and Powell concurred. Look to the tube. When Ellen DeGeneres kissed Laura Dern on her sitcom, ""Ellen,"" in 1997, there was enormous backlash. Today, same-sex smooches are ratings grabs and shows with prominent gay characters, such as ""Modern Family"" and ""Glee,"" are up for Emmys this month. ""Once there is more discussion about it as a result of court cases, as a result of media representations, people become more comfortable,"" Powell said. Added Goldberg, ""It's also true that as gay people live openly and as same-sex couples' relationships are recognized more broadly, fears that the sky will fall because of same-sex couples' marriages tend to fade away from the mainstream."" Change is not swift everywhere, as the degree of acceptance around the world presently runs the gamut. Read Time.com's history of international gay marriage . In 2008, the U.N. General Assembly saw 66 countries declare they would support rights for gays and lesbians, yet a 2010 International Lesbian and Gay Association report said 76 countries punish people based on sexual orientation. The number last year was 77. India dropped off the list when its court changed the penal code in July 2009. ""One country less compared to the 2009 list may seem little progress, until one realizes that it hosts one-sixth of the human population,"" the report said. There are countries such as Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, which can put people to death for certain types of sexual behavior, according to the report. There are places such as Aruba and Israel that will recognize same-sex marriages but won't perform them. There are also about 20 countries or parts of countries that recognize civil unions. Goldberg said policies in Uganda, which drafted an anti-homosexuality bill that would strengthen the nation's maximum sentence from life in prison to capital punishment, and in Iran are stark contrasts to the rest of the world, which is reluctant to condemn gays openly. As for countries embracing civil unions, it's a compromise, Powell said. People are in favor of many gay rights, just not marriage, he said. Goldberg described it as ""typically political, where the pro-equality communities have enough power to gain substantial recognition for same-sex couples but not enough to overcome resistance from the more conservative segments of the political community."" To those fighting for gay rights, Powell said, any step forward helps because it increases dialogue and people's comfort levels. ""Contact makes things less scary, makes it more comfortable, and the more comfort you have the less opposition you're going to have,"" he said.","Proposition 8 judge blasts stereotypes gays  are ""disease vectors,"" ""child molesters""

"(CNN) -- For Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, it was a global virtual black eye. Instead of seeing his photo on the new European Union site, launched this week as Spain took over the presidency, visitors were greeted by Rowan Atkinson's comic character of Mr. Bean. And if you clicked over to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Web site, you'd see that hackers took him on, too. The text on his site was replaced with a note remarking on the death of ""my favorite singer Michael Jackson"" and ""my favorite voice Neda,"" the woman killed last year during protests over Iranian elections. It ended with a request that God smite Ahmadinejad and ""my favorite dictator [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei in 2010."" Millions flocked to mock and clicked to laugh at worldwide leaders -- but security experts say the truth is that the real joke could have been on them. ""The reality is, this is sort of the 21st century form of a street protest, except [hackers] have a global reach, and these leaders are being embarrassed in a very public, global way,"" said Danny McPherson, chief security officer and security expert at Ann Arbor Networks. And the embarrassment was ugly. In a technology-age version of residents flooding streets holding signs or drawing glasses on a politician's poster, Facebook and Twitter users joined in and swarmed the Internet, sharing links to the sites and remarking on the hilarity of the two attacks. But, McPherson said, most of those people probably didn't think about whether they, like the leaders, could have also fallen victim to the hacks. ""It's a pretty ugly proposition from a risk-management perspective,"" he said. ""The site is being compromised, and not only that, but it can be used to compromise anyone visiting the site, which is far worse than any traditional protest."" Although it's unknown whether the sites were hacked merely to send a message or as a goof, McPherson said hackers could just have easily uploaded malware -- malicious software -- that would attack any visitor's computer. And with the growth of viral Internet videos and pranks, millions of users could easily click on links to the site, especially if it mocks well-known celebrities or leaders and is shared on Facebook or Twitter. And once the word is out about a site being hacked, McPherson said, the ripple effect could be huge. ""With both of those sites, given the political climate in Iran or the EU president site, either of these could have equally been used to distribute malware for journalists or people going to the sites for very valid reasons,"" McPherson said. And hacking of government Web sites, for security intelligence or just for a global joke, isn't as uncommon as you might expect. The antivirus company Symantec said in 2007 that 80 percent of attacks on Web sites happen in the same way as the attacks on the EU and Ahmadinejad sites: through loopholes that allow hackers to upload scripts to change Web sites. And in an age of cyber sit-ins, McPherson says, the threat will only grow until companies continuously work to ensure the security of their sites. Ironically, cybersecurity is one of the issues Zapatero and Spain plan to tackle as part of a digital agenda while it holds the EU presidency. And now, after the hack on the EU Web site, bloggers and commenters around the world have piled on, saying the task may be hefty for Spain, which couldn't keep its new site safe from a cyberattack for a week.","Hackers replaced photo of Spain PM with Mr. Bean on new European Union site .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've rescued 165 migrants who were apparently kidnapped as they tried to cross into the United States. The victims were held for weeks in the northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, Mexico's Interior Ministry said Thursday. One hundred fifty of the migrants are from Central America. Another 14 are Mexican nationals, and one is from India, the ministry said. They were crammed into a house and held in squalid conditions for two to three weeks, officials said. Photos released by the interior ministry showed blankets, shoes and buckets scattered on the fenced-in home's patio. ""The victims said that they had the intention of entering the United States of America, but they were held against their will while a suspected criminal group contacted their families by phone and demanded different sums of money that were sent to their kidnappers,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Eduardo Sanchez said. Rather than taking them across the border, human traffickers apparently handed the migrants over to criminal groups, he said. An anonymous tip describing people with weapons at a home in the city of Gustavo Diaz Ordaz led Mexican soldiers to the scene. In front of the house, soldiers spotted a gunman who tried to flee with they arrived, Sanchez said. They detained suspect Juan Cortez Arrez, 20, and handed him over to prosecutors. Drug cartels that operate in the area are known to have kidnapped migrants in the past and requested ransoms for their release. Sanchez did not identify any criminal group that could be involved and declined to respond to questions. Amnesty International has said that immigrants in Mexico ""face a variety of serious abuses from organized criminal gangs, including kidnappings, threats and assaults."" At least 11,333 migrants were kidnapped during a six-month period in 2010, Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights said.

A Black Man's View of America."" Visit his Web site for more information. He is hosting ""No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET on CNN while Campbell Brown is on maternity leave. Roland Martin says Miss California, Carrie Prejean, is being slammed for being honest about her beliefs. (CNN) -- A lot of folks are always saying they like to keep it real, that they want authenticity and straight talk. Yet when someone actually does it, there is hell to pay. Welcome to the world of Miss California, Carrie Prejean, who, since she answered a question regarding same-sex marriage in Sunday's Miss USA pageant, has been savagely attacked by those who oppose what she had to say. Leading the burn-her-at-the-stake parade is media opportunist Perez Hilton, the self-described gossip queen, and the individual who kick-started this controversy by asking the initial question as to whether the issue of same-sex marriage should be left up to the states. It seems that Hilton, who is gay, was none too pleased that Prejean chose to actually give her personal opinion on the issue, and ripped her on his blog after the show, using crude obscenities as he continued to attack her at every turn on his media blitz. Hey, Hilton, from a real journalist to a wanna-be who traffics in gossip: Never ask a question if you're unprepared for the answer! Frankly, this whole story is pretty stupid. Isn't the whole point of asking a question to get someone's true feelings, rather than the plastic and superficial answers we are all used to receiving? Sure, Prejean could have gone the safe route and given one of those answers that reveal nothing and is hard to decipher -- you know, the ones politicians give all the time -- but no! She actually gave her real opinion, and is now being torn to shreds for it. She opposes same-sex marriage. OK, fine. So what if she had said, ""Hey, I'm in full support of same-sex marriage."" Would she now be celebrated on gay-focused blogs, magazines and Web sites? Would her detractors actually be saying how open she is and that she's a great person? Same-sex marriage is undoubtedly a hot button issue. And being from California, the site of Proposition 8, the ballot initiative that voters approved outlawing same-sex marriage, Prejean has surely had to hear the debate go back and forth. But her remark isn't outside the mainstream. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll shows that 55 percent of Americans are against same-sex marriage, and Proposition 8 did pass in her state 52-48 percent. iReport.com: Prejean 'should step down' What's interesting about this is that many of the same folks who are slamming her for her remark voted for President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who both have the same belief: that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Even Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made it clear that she has the same view, and it was her husband, President Bill Clinton, who signed the In Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law that forbids states from having to recognize gay marriage in other states. In other words, four of the biggest liberals in the country have the same belief as Prejean, but a beauty pageant winner is being torn to shreds. Hello, hypocrisy! Those who criticize Prejean have the same right as she does to express their viewpoints. But enough with all the political correctness, where someone says she should have danced around the issue, smiled and move on. iReport.com: 'Thank you, California!' At the end of the day, we all have to be true to ourselves. Whether it's a gay gossip writer who favors same-sex marriage or a heterosexual woman who is against same-sex marriage. The day we condemn folks for speaking honestly is the day we become a bland society. Maybe we're already there.

"(CNN) -- Pamela Anderson is set to bring a little Hollywood glamor to motorsport after becoming part owner of a sports car racing team. The former Baywatch star has linked up with the Race Alliance team, which is competing in the inaugural FIA GT Series. The Playboy pin-up ventured into motorsport in March 2012 when her and occasional racing driver Markus Fux fronted the Downforce1 European Le Mans teams. Following the failure of that venture Fux and Anderson have teamed up with the Race Alliance team for the final three races of the GT Series' 2013 season. ""We want to make Race Alliance a recognizable name and have looked for the best drivers possible,"" a spokesman for the team told Autosport.com. ""The plan is to contest the full FIA GT Series next year, as well as the Nurburgring 24 Hours, and then look to NASCAR after that."" In Vitantonio Liuzzi and Mathias Lauda the Austrian team boasts two drivers of considerable pedigree. F1 Inforgraphic: Deals on wheels . Liuzzi spent six years in Formula One, including one season with Red Bull, while his teammate Lauda is the son of Austria's triple F1 world champion Niki Lauda. Liuzzi and Lauda will be behind the wheel of a Ferrari 458 Italia when the team debuts in Slovakia this weekend. Three dates remain on the GT Series' 2013 calendar, with Spain and Azerbaijan hosting races after Slovakia. Competing against Anderson's team will be one led by rally driving legend Sebastian Loeb. The Frenchman won a record nine World Rally Championships in a row between 2004 and 2012 and now heads the Sebastian Loeb Racing team.","Pamela Anderson becomes joint owner of a racing team .

"(CNN) -- Authorities reopened Interstates 10 and 20 in west Texas on Friday afternoon after crashes in blizzard conditions caused their closure earlier in the day. Snow plows and crews from the Texas Department of Transportation were still working in the area, DOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said. ""Please drive to conditions and avoid driving if at all possible,"" she said. ""Watch for ice and snow."" Blizzard conditions had hampered efforts to reopen large sections of Interstate 10. Portions of a 240-mile stretch of the interstate were closed in both directions from El Paso to Fort Stockton, Beyer said. There were several accidents, including a police officer who was hit by a car while trying to get to another accident on Interstate 10. The officer was hospitalized Thursday evening with minor injuries, CNN affiliate KDBC reported. Heavy snow also caused the closure of U.S. Highway 62/180, east of El Paso to the New Mexico state line.

"Beijing (CNN) -- It's the Chinese crime story of the century and a major embarrassment for the country's all-powerful Communist Party. In late July, Bo Xilai, a former darling of the party, was finally indicted on corruption charges. His trial is expected to begin on Thursday, August 22, the latest chapter in a gripping tale of murder, betrayal and political factionalism. The authorities claim he abused his official state position to seek financial benefits, resulting in ""huge losses to the nation and the people."" ""The circumstances are extremely serious,"" a statement in the state-run Xinhua news agency declared a few days later. But a source close to the Bo family for decades says the claims are ""ridiculous."" ""The charges go way back when Bo was in Dalian. That's more than 20 years ago. So they cannot find anything more recent?"" READ MORE: Bo Xilai indicted for corruption . Until March 2012, the charismatic, populist leader was a member of the policy-making politburo of the Communist Party and party chief of Chongqing, a megacity in southwestern China. Bo, 64, is currently in detention, awaiting a trial that could cap the biggest political scandal to hit China in decades. He has not been seen in public since news of the scandal emerged, and he was stripped of his role as Chongqing party chief and later his prestigious politburo post. TIMELINE: Bo's fall from grace . Bo stands accused of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. According to the indictment documents, as a civil servant he took advantage of his position to seek profit from others and accepted an extremely large amount of money and properties, Xinhua reported. The documents don't quantify the amount of bribes allegedly accepted, but published reports say it could be as much as 20 million yuan ($3.3 million). What are the allegations about? Concrete details are not forthcoming. Bo's lawyer did not respond to request for comments, but sources close to Bo who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, gave CNN their thoughts on how he is preparing to defend himself. The accusations, according to those sources, may be linked to the case of Xu Ming, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur who owned several companies in Dalian, a bustling port city in eastern China where Bo Xilai served as mayor for nearly nine years. Xu has not been seen for more than a year and is believed to be under detention for alleged corruption. The sources believe that, of the 20 million yuan in alleged bribes, 16 million ($2.6 million) may be related to the purchase of a house in Nice, France that Xu bought some years ago. Prosecutors may allege that Xu gave the house to Bo's wife and son. ""The Bo family says they are aware that Xu bought such a house, but they have no connection with its purchase and ownership. It's believed to be an old house that Xu may have bought as an investment or for use as vacation house,"" one source said. READ MORE: Bo's wife convicted of murder . What punishment awaits Bo? China's legal system gives much discretion and flexibility to the local courts in imposing punishment. For the same charge of bribery, for example, Zheng Xiaoyu, former head of the State Food and Drug Administration, was convicted in 2007 of taking more than six million yuan (about $1 million) in bribes. He was sentenced to death and executed later that year. In 2009, however, Chen Tonghai, former chairman of Chinese oil giant Sinopec, was convicted of taking 196 million yuan ($31 million) in bribes. He was given a suspended death sentence. Family sources say while they worry for his life, they want Bo to be ""strong-willed."" ""We hope he will not fall for any offers of compromise or blackmail, like if you co-operate we will leave your son out of this, or will give you and your wife leniency."" READ MORE: Bo's son submits statement in mother's defence . They are also concerned about the in-fighting at the top leadership and its impact on how Bo's case will be settled. ""Although Bo may not be sentenced to death, we still worry,"" the sources said. ""It is also far from over for (Bo's wife) Gu Kailai, who is serving suspended sentence. They still hold much leverage.""","Source close to Bo Xilai's family reject charges against him .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The increasing use of the Internet by political campaigns presents hackers and spammers with growing opportunities for abuse, according to two Internet experts. Oliver Friedrichs is director of emerging technologies for Symantec. Oliver Friedrichs, director of emerging technologies for Symantec, a computer security firm, said he has seen attacks of only moderate severity but warns much more damage could be done. Those attacks include: phishing, or e-mails designed to look legitimate but which take respondents to fraudulent sites; adware, or ads that appear through pop-ups or banners on Web pages; and spyware, which secretly monitors computer users. Fraudulent Web sites and plain old lies are also used. ""Campaigns, extremists and others who may not be associated with the campaigns are very likely to start participating in these types of attacks, if not in this election, then in future elections,"" Friedrichs said in a presentation this week to a Black Hat computer information security conference in Washington. According to Symantec, an e-mail was sent last week to several hundred people urging them to click on a link to see a video of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton. The people who did so inadvertently downloaded a malicious code that made their computers start spewing spam. Other incidents have involved the theft of money and personal information. In 2004, for instance, supporters of the Democratic presidential ticket of John Kerry and John Edwards received an e-mail soliciting donations. It provided a link to a site on which people were directed to enter their credit card information. It was bogus. Authorities don't know how much money was collected, where it went or how much credit card information was compromised. With Internet fundraising proving to be a blockbuster success for candidates, Friedrichs said he believes more thieves will try to exploit it. Some cons operate through ""typo squatting."" For $8 a month, anyone can register a domain name that closely resembles the Internet address of a campaign. If an attacker then establishes a Web site that closely resembles a candidate's, unsuspecting supporters could make donations. The campaign would never get the money, but the attacker would. Friedrichs said his research shows that typo squatting is in wide use. Hundreds of domain names close to those of the presidential candidates have been registered, some of them in India and China. These domain names have been used to establish Web sites on which to sell advertising or make political points. Others are used to mock candidates. A slip of the finger while navigating to Clinton's Web site, for instance, could send a user to Hillaryclingon.com, which portrays the former first lady as a character from ""Star Trek."" Candidate Web sites themselves also can be hacked, and visitors to the sites could find their computers infected with viruses or worms. ""I'm sure it is happening now, "" said Tom Kellermann, vice president of security awareness for Core Security Technologies. Kellermann said all Web sites, including political ones, are targets. ""Web sites are being attacked on a daily basis by individuals, non-state actors, organized criminals and state actors,"" he said. ""Web sites are seen now as the perfect storm because you can attack the users that use them to access the information and visitors who use those sites, who trust those sites."" The Internet might also be used to distribute disinformation about candidates. Politically motivated hackers could even post inaccurate information on a candidate's site, Friedrichs said. Attackers are rarely caught, according to Friedrichs. It is easy for ""attackers to remain completely anonymous and to never be discovered,"" he said. If the exploitation and corruption of political information on the Internet grows as Friedrichs predicts, he said he fears the public could become wary of Internet fundraising and even become suspicious of political information available on the Web. ""It certainly has the potential to not only disrupt but potentially cause voters to lose faith in the electoral system,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Ahead of her Super Bowl halftime show, singer Madonna promised there would be no ""wardrobe malfunction."" What she didn't guarantee was no obscene gestures. Rapper M.I.A. provided a middle finger salute to network cameras Sunday night during the 12-minute extravaganza, when she joined Madonna during a performance of the latter's new single, ""Give Me All Your Luvin'."" The apologies from the NFL and the broadcaster, NBC, came quickly -- they blamed each other. ""There was a failure in NBC's delay system,"" said Brian McCarty, the league's vice president of communications. ""The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans."" ""The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show,"" NBC said. ""Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers."" The episode was reminiscent of the 2004 Super Bowl when singer Janet Jackson's nipple was briefly exposed during a performance with singer Justin Timberlake. The infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" episode, as it came to be known, prompted the Federal Communications Commission to fine broadcaster CBS $550,000. In November, a divided 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the FCC improperly punished the network. Since then, the NFL has maintained tight control over the show's production. After the Jackson-Timberlake showstopper, the halftime show largely relied on classic rock artists such as Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, The Who and Tom Petty. Fast forward to Sunday when the New England Patriots were again playing in the big game, just as in 2004. M.I.A., along with Nicki Minaj, Cee-Lo Green and LMFAO, joined Madonna as she treated fans to a greatest hits medley that included ""Vogue,"" ""Music"" and ""Like a Prayer."" The ""spontaneous gesture,"" as NBC called it, came during a performance of Madonna's latest single. M.I.A. not only flipped her middle finger but uttered, ""I don't give a sh*t."" A source close to M.I.A. said the rapper ""was nervous and not thinking, and adrenaline took over."" ""It wasn't meant as a gesture or statement of any kind,"" said the source, who is not authorized to speak on the record. ""She feels horrible for putting Madonna in that position. She messed up."" The Parents Television Council, a nonprofit group that advocates for family friendly programming, blamed the mishap on both NBC and the NFL. ""They chose a lineup full of performers who have based their careers on shock, profanity and titillation,"" the group's president, Tim Winter, said in a statement. ""Instead of preventing indecent material, they enabled it."" Madonna did not issue a comment. But on Twitter, where the halftime show generated 8,000 tweets per second, the reaction was swift and mixed. ""What was that singer M.I.A. thinking?! Flipping off America during halftime can't be a good career move,"" Will Ripley of Denver tweeted. But Devon Soltendieck of Montreal was less concerned. ""Can we all stop pretending #MIA flipping the Finger during the halftime show is offensive in 2012?"" he asked. Said Josh Jackson, editor in chief of the music magazine Paste: ""M.I.A. Didn't flip us all off. She just had a middle finger malfunction."" CNN's K.J. Matthews contributed to this report .","NEW: Rapper M.I.A. was ""nervous and not thinking,"" a source says .

"(TIME.com) -- Pepsi's latest refresher claims to fend off fat. But is a healthy soda an oxymoron? ""Pepsi Special,"" the new drink distributed by Pepsi's partner in Japan, Suntory Holdings Limited, contains dextrin, a dietary fiber that dissolves in water and is found in fiber supplements such as Benefiber. Eaten appropriately, in fiber-rich foods such as vegetables and fruits, fiber helps to regulate the digestive system, lower cholesterol and may lower the risk of heart disease. A Suntory news release claims the drink acts by ""suppressing the absorption of fat"" and can inhibit the rise in triglycerides after a meal, making it, potentially, the first ""healthy"" soda. Because of these purported health benefits, Pepsi Special has received the label ""FOSHU"" in Japan, a government designation that stands for ""Food for Specified Health Uses."" A Japanese government website states that ""FOSHU"" products are meant to be consumed ""by people who wish to control health conditions, including blood pressure or blood cholesterol."" Spokespeople for Pepsi did not provide more information about the ""low-calorie"" drink. TIME: Soda machines will post calorie counts on vending machines . As odd as the fiber-packed cola sounds, however, it's not the first to debut in Japan. Kirin, the Japanese beer company, launched the country's first ""FOSHU"" beverage with dextrin in the spring called Kirin Mets Cola, a sugar-free beverage geared towards ""health conscious"" men in their 30s. Is there anything to the dextrin trend? A 2006 study conducted by researchers from the National Institute of Health and Nutrition in Tokyo found that rats fed both dextrin and fat absorbed less fat than the rats who did not eat the fiber. But that research, alas, wasn't extended to people. In fact, too much dextrin could make you sick. ""Studies of humans ingesting dextrin suggest short-term risks including stomach pain, gas, and bloating,"" says Lilian Cheung, editorial director of Nutrition Source, the Harvard School of Public Health's nutrition website. ""The long-term risks have not been studied."" Dr. Walter Willett, chair of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, added in an email statement: ""Unless Pepsi can provide data from controlled studies in humans to the contrary, their claim should be regarded as bogus and deceptive."" In fact, Pepsi may face challenges if it decides to bring Pepsi Special to the United States, since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tends to frown on such potentially suspect nutrient-boosting of essentially unhealthy products in an attempt to make them healthier. In fact, its regulations specifically discourage such fortifying: . ""The Food and Drug Administration does not encourage indiscriminate addition of nutrients to foods, nor does it consider it appropriate to fortify fresh produce; meat, poultry, or fish products; sugars; or snack foods such as candies and carbonated beverages."" ""You shouldn't add good things to bad things because that could encourage people to eat something that isn't healthy for them,"" said Michael Jacobson, Executive Director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a food safety and nutrition consumer advocacy group. TIME: Cutting out soda curbs children's weight gain, studies show . In the U.S., soda companies have been called out for making exaggerated health claims about their sugary drinks. CSPI recently sued 7UP's parent company Dr Pepper Snapple Group for making specious health claims about its Cherry Antioxidant, Mixed Berry Antioxidant, and Pomegranate Antioxidant varieties, arguing that drinking a soda with a small amount of Vitamin E is not as healthy as consuming antioxidants from fruits, as the company implied. (The company decided to discontinue the line.) In 2008, the FDA sent a letter to Coca-Cola, arguing that the company ""misbranded"" its ""Diet Coke Plus"" because it did not provide enough nutritional information to justify the word ""plus."" So as appealing as it sounds to down a healthy dose of fiber from a can, health experts say it's probably best to get your daily allotment from food if you want to truly take advantage of the good things fiber can do. ""I would assume it's a soda and treat it that way,"" Vandana Sheth, a registered dietitian in the Los Angeles area and spokesperson for The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, says about the beverage. ""Whole grains, vegetables, barley, beans, lentils have significant positive effects like lowering blood glucose, and some of that will make you feel more full. It is also more satisfying to chew and swallow real food rather than to drink a beverage."" TIME: Study shows too much sugar increases heart risks . Not to mention that guzzling soda and sugary drinks contributes to health problems like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and may raise blood pressure as well. ""Adding a fiber to a drink made from caffeine, caramel coloring, phosphoric acid, sugar, and high fructose corn syrup doesn't make it healthy,"" says Alissa Rumsey, a dietitian at New York Presbyterian Hospital and spokesperson for the New York State Dietetic Association. ""If people think they're going to lose weight by drinking a beverage like this, then they are more likely to drink more soda and therefore consume even more calories.""

"(CNN) -- Deciding when to upgrade is a funny, sometimes expensive thing. Carrier contracts that subsidize the cost of a new iPhone are usually for two years, so it's traditional to upgrade every other model or less. You also want to time it just right, during the iPhone development cycle, so you don't buy a phone months before it's outdated. If you are an iPhone owner who is pondering an upgrade to the new iPhone 5, here are some things to consider: . Do you long for more screen space/watch a lot of movies? Perhaps you've heard that the iPhone 5 is taller. This is true. After testing its tallness we've found that there is more space on the screen, which is no longer as short as the previous iPhone screens. The phone retains its width but is now 9 millimeters taller -- that's one extra row of icons. The dimensions are perfect for watching widescreen movies, which were previously smaller and letter-boxed. The space also gives all other apps a bit more breathing room. Third-party applications must now redesign their apps to fix the new aspect ratio -- which requires time and resources -- so until then, older apps will be shown at normal size, the bar of unused screen space cloaked in mourning-black. There is a market for much larger smartphone screens, and companies like Samsung have delivered with spacious, high-resolution smartphones. This is largely a matter of preference, but if you find that the iPhone 5's screen is still just too small for you, you may need to defect to something like the Samsung Galaxy S3 which has a 4.8-inch screen. Does your current phone feel slow? Each iPhone is typically faster than its predecessor, and phones tend to slow down over time. Apple has added a speedier processor to the iPhone 5 in the form of an A6 chip. The company claims it is up to twice as fast, and after testing, the difference is definitely noticeable. Holding on to a slightly slower iPhone might not be much of an issue if you primarily use it for common tasks -- calls and texts, e-mailing, Twitter and Facebook, reading, even watching movies. If you don't find yourself grumbling at how slow your phone is, and you're still reeling from the speed improvements over the last iPhone you bought, you can probably carry on blissfully unaware of the difference. However, if you use your iPhone for bigger tasks like playing graphic games, the speed is a very welcome bump indeed. Another place it's a noticeable improvement is the camera (more on that in a moment). There are also free steps you can take to try and speed up your current phone. Free up some hard drive space by uninstalling apps you never use, emptying Safari's cache and clearing out photos, videos and music (see exactly what's taking up space in Settings->General->Usage). Make sure you regularly close any apps running in the background. Is your iPhone your primary camera? Thanks to decent image quality and the ability to share photos and videos instantly, the iPhone is probably more popular as a camera than a telephoning device. The iPhone 5 has the same 8-megapixel camera sensor as the iPhone 4S, but Apple did make a few hardware tweaks to make it fit into the thinner body and to improve image quality. The best camera improvement is actually just plain old speed. You can take rapid-fire shots as fast as your finger can tap on the shutter button. Tapping to focus is instant. For anyone who has ever missed a moment because of the iPhone's lagging trigger, this is just awesome. Apple added a new panorama feature to the Photos app, and while there are numerous third-party panorama apps available, such as Microsoft's Photosynth, the Apple feature manages to beat them at their own game. The stitching is both faster and higher quality than competitors, and the final image is higher resolution. Other adjustments to the camera include improved low-light images and reduced noise. Do you use your phone for navigation? If so, there is a slight caveat. Every iPhone release comes with its own bit of drama. Sometimes it's overblown, like Antennaga2te, when holding your case-less phone in a very specific position could cause it to drop calls. iPhone 4S users reported battery issues. For the iPhone 5, the issue de jour is its new maps app. Every iPhone 5 comes with iOS 6 pre-installed. That means the old maps app is automatically out, replaced with Apple's first go at a map application. It adds turn-by-turn directions and nice 3D graphics, but drops transit directions and decreases accuracy. Apple has always excelled at design and smart user interfaces, but it is not a data company. While it continues to work to make this app what it should be, the best solution is to wait for Google to release its own third-party maps app for iOS. (The company is mum on when exactly that will be, but it will probably happen soon.) In the meantime, there are many other map apps in the Apple App Store, and you can still access Google's service through Safari, though the experience is slower and less intuitive. Do you like beautiful things? The most impressive part of the new iPhone is its design. Apple is comparing the level of construction to a ""finely crafted watch."" Like a luxury item, its design is impeccable, the attention to detail visible on every seam and surface. It also tells time. Not everyone integrates their iPhone 5 into an outfit like a Rolex. If you are one of the many people who protect their iPhone with an opaque case, the details won't be visible to people around you. In that situation, you still get the satisfaction of a well-made device, but previous iPhones were also finely crafted and are still in perfectly good shape. The most dramatic physical difference of the new phone is that it is thinner and lighter. But while a great overall improvement, that's not enough of a reason to warrant upgrading unless you find yourself constantly bemoaning how heavy and fat your existing phone is. If you wear skinny jeans, this might be the one upgrade you were waiting for. Do you have anything older than an iPhone 4S? If you have an iPhone 3GS or earlier, upgrade. Do it for the screen. The retina display introduced on the iPhone 4 has been further refined for the iPhone 5 and in side-by-side comparisons with all screens at full brightness, the colors do look more vivid on the iPhone 5. If you have an iPhone 4, the decision is harder. Consider what new features you really need. If you would get a lot of use out of the Siri voice-assistant, for example, this is a good time to upgrade. If you are a hardcore mobile gamer or serious iPhone photographer, the speed is worth it. But if you find that your two-year-old, well-crafted iPhone is holding up nicely, perhaps stick it out for another year. IPhone 4S owners should just relax and enjoy their current phones. Wait a year for the next iteration, when your carrier will offer you the upgrade at the subsidized price and all the iPhone 5 owners will suddenly be stuck with old technology.","The iPhone 5's speed is a significant upgrade for gamers and photographers .

"(CNN) -- A March storm, its eyes set on Washington, D.C., broke a snowfall record in Chicago and prompted the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights for Wednesday. The system was expected to dump up at least 4 inches in Pittsburgh beginning Tuesday evening as it moved toward the District of Columbia and Baltimore, which braced for potentially significant accumulations, according to the National Weather Service. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had 6 inches of snow by Tuesday afternoon, besting a 1999 record for the date by 2.2 inches. It was the first 6-inch snowfall in the Windy City since the Groundhog Day blizzard of 2011, the National Weather Service said. United Airlines said about 650 flights systemwide for Wednesday were canceled, most to and from Dulles International Airport near Washington. ""They will try to get as many aircraft out of Dulles today (Tuesday) as possible so they are not sitting in a snow storm,"" United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy told CNN.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission must make a decision on whether to issue a permit for the long-term nuclear waste storage project at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, throwing into question plans to shutter the facility. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a 2-1 decision, ordered the commission to decide whether to approve or reject the application for the storage project. ""At this point, the Commission is simply defying a law enacted by Congress, and the Commission is doing so without any legal basis,"" the order read. Yucca Mountain -- 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas -- was to be the solution to the U.S. nuclear waste problem: a final destination for the tons of hazardous nuclear waste accumulating at commercial reactors in 33 states. In 1987, Congress directed the Department of Energy to dispose of waste in the mountain beginning in 1998. But political opposition to the plan has been relentless, and the Energy Department was unable to meet the deadline. In 2008, the Energy Department submitted a license application to the NRC seeking to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, with a goal of opening it in 2017, a date later delayed until 2020. In March of 2009, following the election of President Barack Obama, the secretary of energy announced plans to terminate the Yucca Mountain project. The NRC has argued that the $11 million Congress appropriated for the permit application is insufficient and that Congress will not provide the additional funds necessary to complete the application. The NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board suspended the application until there was enough money to make progress. But in the court's view, the appropriation bill is a mandate by Congress to proceed with the licensing process, regardless of the approval of additional funds that may be needed. ""We would certainly hope that Congress would step in before the current $11.1 million is expended, so as to avoid wasting that taxpayer money. And Congress, of course, is under no obligation to appropriate additional money for the Yucca Mountain project,"" the court order read.","In a 2-1 decision, judges order NRC to approve or reject the permit for the storage project .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Angela Sauaia and her colleagues intended to study the impact modernized playground equipment had on lowering children's injury rates. They ended up studying kids' injury rates from guns instead. The associate professor of public health, medicine and surgery at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora said she was neither motivated by the recent mass shooting in her area nor driven by politics. ""My colleagues and I were doing a study on playground injuries, because they were doing some remodeling projects here, and we wanted to see if that would change the playground injury rate,"" Sauaia said. ""When we started coding the trauma data, which includes all types of childhood injuries that turn up at these trauma centers, and we noticed the morbid pattern of gun violence-related injuries for children ... that shifted the focus of the study to document violence related to injuries involving gunshots."" The data, she said, showed a surprising number of children were being injured, many of them seriously, by guns. ""We had the impression that mass shootings caused so many injuries and those normally do get a lot of national attention, but in looking at the numbers, gun violence was happening to children on a routine basis, and it was mostly happening out of the spotlight,"" Sauaia said. ""These are not isolated tragedies."" She and her colleagues knew they were on to something, putting together a research letter called ""Firearm Injuries of Children and Adolescents in 2 Colorado Trauma Centers: 2000-2008,"" which was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The data covers some of the years between the two mass shootings in the Denver area -- the 1999 one at Columbine High School that resulted in 13 deaths and more than 20 injuries before the shooters took their own lives, and July's mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora that killed 12 people and wounded 58. Columbine survivor: No child should worry about gunmen . ""In the years we studied, we didn't expect to see this many childhood injuries due to everyday gun violence,"" Sauaia said. ""And far too many of these were self-inflicted."" Intentionality was difficult to determine from the data -- some of the self-inflicted wounds were suicide, while others appeared accidental in nature. The bottom line, said Sauaia: Children having access to guns. ""No matter what side you are on in the gun debate, I've never met a person that believes kids should have easy access to guns,"" Sauaia said. ""The data clearly shows this is a real public health concern for children."" Overall, 6,920 youths were injured and cared for by these trauma centers between 2000 and 2008, according to the research. Of those, 129 had injuries from firearms, and those injuries were extremely serious compared with the others. Of the gun injuries, 50.4% required intensive care, compared with 19.3% for other trauma-related injuries. Some 13.2% died, compared with the 1.7% injured in another way. A total of 14% of the gunshot wounds were coded as ""self-inflicted."" Once-unlikely win for gun control in Colorado . The research is a good and descriptive small-scale study, said Jon Vernick, an associate professor and co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, but it also is a good reminder that public health experts need to do more of this kind of research. ""This study shows firearm injures are more likely to result in a death or a treatment in the ICU than other injuries,"" he said. ""That should make the case for how important it is to find ways to prevent those kinds of injuries from occurring."" Historically, he argued, public health studies such as this one have led to positive changes. Because people studied why car accidents happened in the 1960s, for instance, public health advocates knew how to improve injury rates from such crashes, Vernick said. Consequently, such injuries declined dramatically. ""They didn't just try to make drivers safer or try to criminalize (drunken) driving -- that alone wouldn't have worked,"" Vernick said. ""Because we had the research, we also knew we had to make cars safer, make the environment safer, change the social norm to make it socially unacceptable to drive drunk. ""All of this concerted effort was a public health success story, and it came about because we had the research. We haven't had the same robust research agenda on gun violence over the last two decades, and so we are not seeing the same dramatic decline in deaths and injuries."" How we can keep kids from shooting people . Data, Sauaia said, are available from trauma centers, but there is limited funding for studies. Federal funding for gun research, however, is rare, outside of federal grants that are available to study other injuries. That's deliberate. Since 1996, federal law has prohibited all Department of Health and Human Services agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health from using funds, ""in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control."" The National Rifle Association pushed for the legislation, maintaining that government research into gun violence is unnecessary. ""What works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others don't have access to firearms,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN in January, ""not to carry out more studies."" How the NRA wields its influence . A strongly worded editorial published in JAMA Internal Medicine in January called the federal government's ""neglect"" of firearm injuries as a public health issue a ""national shame."" It asked President Barack Obama to ""make a concerted effort to get the restrictive language about using federal funds ... out of future appropriations bills."" ""If the United States were to get serious about preventing firearms-related injuries and deaths, thousands of lives could be saved each year,"" the authors wrote. ""We can wait no longer to protect public health."" Sauaia said she wants her paper to inform today's debate and inspire other projects. ""We do know a lot more about how someone died of a heart attack than just how many people were injured by guns,"" Sauaia said. ""The data is out there; we just need the funding to be able to do this kind of work, and then hopefully we can find ways to address this major public health problem.""

"(CNN) -- For many people, New Year's Eve can be disappointing -- there's so much hype in the lead-up to the event that when it actually comes around, it often falls short of the mark. Madding crowds, endless taxi lines and even longer lines to get to the bathroom -- it's no wonder so many people choose to stay at home with a good movie and a bottle of bubbles. Howvever, certain destinations around the world offer such spectacular greetings to the new year, that you may want to seriously consider braving the throngs for a front-row seat. Hong Kong . Hong Kong's harbor dazzles for most of the year, but on December 31 it really glows. This year, for the first time, the city's midnight fireworks display will journey across town, beginning at the sea and moving along Victoria Harbour to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The best places to view the action? The Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, the promenade from the Avenue of Stars to Hong Kong Cultural Centre, the promenade at Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai and the area near Central Pier. Come back in February to witness the whole spectacle again as the city prepares to ring in the Chinese New Year (February 10). See also: 10 unforgettable Hong Kong experiences . New York . More than one million people brave sub-zero temperatures to be part of New York's ball drop celebrations on New Year's Eve, with live entertainment this year provided by the likes of Taylor Swift, Psy and the Neon Trees. As it has done for the past 105 years, the ball -- some 3.6 meters in diameter, studded with 2,688 Waterford crystals and lit by 32,256 LEDs -- descends from the flagpole atop One Times Square, dropping 21 meters in 60 seconds. At the stroke of midnight, a blizzard of colorful confetti is released from the rooftops and party-goers are treated to renditions of Auld Lang Syne and Frank Sinatra's New York, New York. Berlin . Berliners warm up on New Year's Eve with the annual Berliner Silvesterlauf: a fancy dress running race that sees participants flipping pancakes along the way. In the evening, party gear replaces gorilla suits as the city descends on the Brandenburg Gate for one of the world's largest open-air celebrations. This year, a stage at Pariser Platz will host international and local musicians, while DJs entertain crowds along the city's ""Party Mile"": a two kilometer strip of dancefloors, stages and bars behind the Brandenburg. As midnight approaches, a laser and light show brightens the sky, with more than 2,000 fireworks and a New York-style ball drop as the clock strikes 12. See also: The inside guide to Berlin . London . It's been a big year for London, having hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Games as well as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. And the English capital intends to see out 2012 with more pomp and ceremony. Secure a riverside perch, book a Thames cruise or even better, secure a spot at the London Sky Bar -- the views from here are unmatched -- and count down to the annual fireworks display launched from the foot of the 135-meter-tall London Eye Ferris wheel. With 2013 in full swing, hit the streets for the New Year's Day parade, which will see more than 10,000 musicians, dancers and acrobats take over the town for the 2013 event, themed ""Hats Off To London -- Celebration Capital of the World."" Edinburgh . Edinburgh is cast aglow at its annual New Year's Eve (Hogmanay) festivities, which kick off on December 30 with a torchlight procession involving more than 25,000 locals. The parade is led by Shetland's Up Helly Aa vikings, with their pipes and drums, and culminates atop Calton Hill with a fireworks display. There's more to come on New Year's Eve, when an expected 80,000 people will take to the streets to sing Auld Lang Syne -- apparently the biggest and loudest rendition of the song in the world -- and party; this year, entertainment comes courtesy of British bands the Maccabees and the OK Social Club, while Simple Minds will headline at the city's Concert in the Gardens. Sydney . If there's a famous Australian who knows how to have a good time, it's Kylie Minogue. And this year, the pint-sized pop star is the creative ambassador for Sydney's New Year's Eve extravaganza. Prepare to party. The entertainment launches early in the day with a series of aerial acrobatic shows, followed by a traditional indigenous cleansing ceremony: smoke flows across the harbor from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vessels, removing the water of negative spirits. There's an early fireworks show for families and a flotilla of boats is transformed with waves of color and light, but the real draw is the midnight fireworks show on Sydney Harbour Bridge. This year's theme is a guarded secret, although according to organizers it will include ""exciting new effects."" See also: Sydney's craft beer week . Samoa . Samoa went back to the future last year when it skipped a full day, changed sides of the International Date Line and went from being the last country to the first to see in the New Year. If you're visiting the island nation on December 31 this year you can look forward to events that are less about fireworks and fanfare and more about family. After visiting elders, Samoans traditionally welcome January 1 with song and prayer services at large, and loud, choral exhibitions. You won't go hungry -- village banquets are very generous -- or thirsty for that matter, with all festivities beginning and ending with a kava ceremony. Don't forget your ukulele. Kyoto . In Kyoto, New Year's Eve revelers are encouraged to make some noise. Crowds flock to the city's shrines, where stalls sell omikuji (fortune notes) and taiyaki (fish-shaped pancakes with green tea, chocolate or red bean fillings). As the clock ticks toward 2013, temples across town ring large bronze bells 108 times, a Buddhist tradition said to rid humans of earthly desires. The Yasaka Shrine and Chion-in Temple are particularly busy on December 31 -- the latter features a bell that weighs more than 70 tons and takes a team of 17 monks to strike it, crying out ""Ee hitotsu"" (One more!) and ""SÅ .","CNN has highlighted 10 top destinations in which to welcome 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Florida legislators won't hold a special session to take another look at the state's controversial ""stand your ground"" law. While 47 state lawmakers voted in favor of holding a special session to discuss the law, 108 voted against it, Secretary of State Ken Detzner said in a letter Tuesday. State law requires a three-fifths majority of both houses of the Florida Legislature to convene a special session, Detzner said. The law drew national attention last year after George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's defense never cited ""stand your ground"" laws in its case, but jurors were instructed to consider them during deliberations in the high-profile trial. The jury acquitted Zimmerman last month of all charges in the shooting of Martin. But national debate over racial issues raised in the case and ""stand your ground"" laws hasn't slowed. Days after Zimmerman's acquittal, a student-led group occupied Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office and asked him to call a special session to overturn the ""stand your ground"" law. Scott met with them a few days later to hear their demands but told them he would not call the special session. About 20% of Florida's lawmakers had filed a request to convene a special session over the matter, Detzner said. But a majority of lawmakers opposed that approach. ""Demands for a special session to repeal the law disregard the very foundation of our representative democracy by presuming that a law passed by the majority of a constitutional body should be reversed by the objections of a few,"" Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford wrote in an editorial published by The Tampa Tribune earlier this month. Weatherford, a Republican, said he had asked a House committee to hold a hearing on the law this fall. ""Our evaluation of its effectiveness should be guided by objective information, not by political expediency,"" he wrote. The Florida version of the law states, ""A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" Eight other states have laws worded similarly, while 22 total states, including Florida, have laws stating that residents have no ""duty"" to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Civil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the laws ""try to fix something that was never broken"" and now encourage ""violent situations to escalate in public."" But just as adamantly as the laws are decried, the National Rifle Association has stood by the measures it helped many states adopt. ""The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept; it's a fundamental human right,"" said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. ""To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","A majority of Florida lawmakers voted against holding a special session .

"(CNN) -- One of the emergency responders at last month's deadly Texas fertilizer plant explosion is now charged with possessing materials for a pipe bomb, a court document states. Authorities on Friday said they are launching a criminal investigation into last month's blast in the town of West, but have not said if the arrest of Bryce Reed is connected. Local sheriff's deputies were called on Tuesday to a residence where they found components for a pipe bomb, according to a criminal complaint affidavit. The officers determined that Reed had given the materials to the resident of that home last month. Among the materials found were a galvanized metal pipe, a fuse, coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders, the affidavit states. Reed, who was arrested early Friday, is charged with possession of a destructive device. ""At this time authorities will not speculate whether the possession of the unregistered destructive device has any connection to the West fertilizer plant explosion,"" the U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Texas said in a release. If convicted, Reed would face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Reed spoke last month at a memorial for the victims at Baylor University. The arrest details came as authorities said they conducting a thorough criminal investigation into the April 17 fire and explosion that killed 14 in the small town of West. ""This disaster has severely impacted the community of West, and we want to ensure that no stone goes unturned and that all the facts related to this incident are uncovered,"" DPS Director Steven McCraw said. On Monday, the state fire marshal's office said it ruled out four potential causes: weather, natural causes, anhydrous ammonium, and ammonium nitrate in a rail car. The fire began in the fertilizer and seed building, but authorities still were trying to figure out the exact spot, the fire marshal's office said Monday. The blast happened about 20 minutes after the first report of a fire at the fertilizer facility. It registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake and could be felt 50 miles away. The explosion damaged numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school, all of which were built within a few hundred feet of the plant. West is about 70 miles south-southwest of Dallas, . Scores of investigators have followed up on scores of leads relating to the explosion. At least 60 investigators have been on site each day and have conducted 411 interviews in trying to determine how the fire started and what caused the explosion. ""The citizens of McLennan County and Texas must have confidence that this incident has been looked at from every angle and professionally handled -- they deserve nothing less,"" McLennan Sheriff Parnell McNamara said. West Fertilizer Co., which operated the facility, had been cited by federal regulators twice since 2006. In 2012, the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer $5,250 for storing anhydrous ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning labels. The agency originally recommended a $10,000 penalty, but it was reduced after the company took corrective action. In 2006, the EPA fined it $2,300 and told the owners to correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality also investigated a complaint about the lingering smell of ammonia around the plant the same year.","NEW: Bryce Reed had the materials to make a pipe bomb .

"(CNN) -- This past Friday, Iran held the third and last presidential debate before polling day on June 14. Unlike the previous two debates, the question of Iranian foreign policy took center stage. This turned the debate into one of the most animated political clashes aired on Iranian state-run television in years. Exchanges were so heated that the candidates were later accused of having revealed national secrets during the debate. One candidate linked with the reformist movement, Hassan Rouhani, has since been warned that he may be barred from running in the elections because of confidential material he revealed about Iran's nuclear program during the two hour-long debate. Read more: 2 candidates withdraw from Iran elections . Critics will dismiss the presidential debates held in Tehran as mere theatrics. The eight candidates [now six after Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel and Mohammad Reza Aref withdrew this week] have, after all, been carefully approved by the Guardian Council -- the regime's top vetting agency -- and cannot therefore be considered as individuals likely or able to greatly shift the trajectory of the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic. From the perspective of the critics, the elections on June 14 are just window dressing by Iran's Supreme Leader, the unelected Ayatollah Ali Khamenei whose stringent Islamism and anti-Western worldview has characterized his tenure since he came to power in 1989. The reservations held by the critics are perfectly justified. The June 14 elections are undeniably tightly orchestrated. Some 678 individual hopefuls were after all barred to even enter the race. Nevertheless, there is also no doubt that the eight men who were admitted to the race do not see eye-to-eye about the regime's foreign policy record or the best path ahead for this large Middle Eastern country of 76 million people. Read more: Presidential elections without buzz . In this third debate, the then-eight candidates threw some convincing punches, smearing the record and policy plans of each other in a spiteful battle to lead the pack. The conventional fault line separating reformists from hardline candidates was very hard to detect, with the most bitter exchanges taking place among hardliners. One of the most heated exchanges took place between Ali Akbar Velayati, foreign minister from 1981 to 1997, and Saeed Jalili, who is judged by many to be favored by Ayatollah Khamenei. Jalili has been leading Iran's nuclear negotiation team since 2007. Velayati questioned Jalili's diplomatic aptitude, accusing his team of pointless intransigence when negotiating with the world powers about Iran's nuclear program. ""Negotiations are about give-and-take and not about reading out loud your own manifesto,"" Velayati shouted at Jalili. Velayati's charge was remarkable because the bland Jalili -- who has no political base of his own -- has over the years been regarded to simply represent the views of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Meanwhile, all the candidates agreed that Tehran has to adjust its nuclear posture during negotiations but no one raised the logic behind having the program in the first place. That would be breaking one taboo too many and Ayatollah Khamenei has made it clear he will not allow the regime to give up the program. Another taboo that was nearly broken came when Mohsen Rezaei, a long-time former commander of Iran's feared Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), accused Jalili of having wasted an opportunity to reach a compromise with the Americans when the two sides met in Baghdad in May 2012. Here was Rezaei, who led the IRGC when Jalili was barely a teenager in the heyday of Iran's anti-Americanism in the early 1980s, speaking of not meeting with the Americans but compromising with them as well. No one would have blamed Rezaei if he had argued for less interaction with the world. Rezaei is after all the only candidate for whom there is a valid ""Red Notice"" -- issued by Interpol at the request of Argentina, for his alleged role in the 1994 terrorist attack against a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires. And yet even Rezaei argued against Iranian isolationism. Read more: Jerusalem Post article on Rezaei's candidacy . Among the candidates, points of agreement were few and far between but all eight men agreed on one point: that the 8-year record of sitting President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had been a disaster for Iran. Ahmadinejad was blamed for pursuing an unnecessarily adventurist, incompetent and costly foreign policy. Each candidate made the claim that Ahmadinejad's bombastic sloganeering abroad could not hide the lack of substance behind his actions. Attacks on Ahmadinejad's performance have become so prolific that the sitting president has asked for airtime on national television to defend his record. On Saturday, Ahmadinejad went further and said he ""had nothing to do with the nuclear program"" and ""someone else is responsible for it."" Read more: Rouhani -- The man to revive Iran's reformist movement? This was an abdication of responsibility and the ""someone else"" was an obvious reference to Ayatollah Khamenei. No Iranian politician can look the Iranian people in the eye and take credit for the painful economic sanctions, which have come about as a result of the nuclear standoff. And Ahmadinejad has a point. He can't blame all of his many shameful statements on Khamenei -- such as denouncing the Iranian Green opposition as ""dirt"" or denying the Holocaust -- but the fact is he never single-handedly controlled Iran's nuclear policy. The presidency in the Islamic Republic just does not have that kind of clout. The main message from the debate is that Iranian foreign policy is in shambles and a new page has to be turned. There were differences in nuance and each candidate claimed particular strengths but the consensus is that Iran cannot become another North Korea. As Velayati put it ""it is good that we now have circles of friendly states in Africa and Latin America, but that is not enough."" Again and again, the need to overhaul ties with the United States and European countries was raised, leading at times to shouting matches about which candidate has the knack to defuse the crisis with the Western world. Nevertheless, while there was broad agreement that Iran has to do a far better job at paving the path for a compromise with the West, no one directly touched the elephant in the room: the role of the unelected Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in shaping Iran's foreign policy. They did so only in a roundabout way. All admitted that Khamenei is a central voice in any strategic decision-making and yet no one dared to openly question the wisdom of the 73-year old Supreme Leader. But if Khamenei watched this third debate -- as he surely did -- then he could not have missed the writing on the wall. Even among these very carefully regime-approved candidates the cry for an overhaul of Iranian foreign policy could not have been any louder.","Iranians head to the polling booths on Friday June 14 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court turned aside Friday a gay rights group's request to temporarily suspend enforcement of the controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on gays in the military. The justices issued a brief order allowing the policy to remain in effect temporarily, until the full appeals process is completed. The Log Cabin Republicans had filed an emergency request with the nation's highest court to reverse the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision allowing the military to continue with ""don't ask, don't tell"" while the government appeals a lower court ruling that the law is unconstitutional. The appeals court, in San Francisco, California, is debating the constitutionality of barring openly gay and lesbian people from service in the U.S. armed forces. Until the larger questions are decided, that court had allowed the current enforcement policy to remain in place, prompting the time-sensitive appeal to the high court. The justices were, at this stage, being asked to rule only on the narrow enforcement issue. They are likely to tackle the constitutional questions after the appeals court issues its ruling, if Congress or the White House does not act first to repeal the current law. ""Log Cabin Republicans are disappointed that the Supreme Court decided to maintain the status quo ... but we are not surprised,"" Log Cabin Executive Director R. Clarke Cooper said in a written statement. ""We are committed to pursuing every avenue in the fight against this failed and unconstitutional policy."" Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said the Defense Department ""believes the decision upholding the stay was appropriate."" The high court's two-paragraph order noted that Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the decision. As solicitor general in the Justice Department before joining the high court in August, Kagan had been involved in preparing initial briefs in the case. In September, California U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips declared the military's ban on openly gay troops to be unconstitutional. She later granted an injunction barring enforcement of the policy. The Justice Department requested a temporary stay of that ruling, which was denied by Phillips but granted by the appeals court. The appeals court later overturned the district court's injunction. The appeals judges also noted that legislation pending before Congress to repeal the policy would render the case before them moot. The House of Representatives has already passed a repeal provision, and the Senate may consider it as part of a broader defense authorization bill when it returns for a lame duck session in mid-November. The appeals court is set to hear oral arguments in the case next February. The losing side would probably ask the Supreme Court to step in once again, but the justices have the discretion not to accept the case for review. President Obama wants to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell."" He reached an agreement with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on a process that includes a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian troops serving alongside straight colleagues. The three men would then have to certify the repeal. Gay rights groups say the policy violates the due process and First Amendment rights of military members. In their appeal, the Log Cabin Republicans said allowing the policy to remain in effect pending appeal is unacceptable and would cause ""irreparable harm."" The government presented ""no evidence to support a finding that open service by gay and lesbian individuals harmed the military's interests, and ... both civilian and military leaders admitted that DADT actually impairs military interests,"" the appeal said. ""Deference to military judgment here tips the scales against a stay, rather than in favor of one,"" it says. But the Obama administration, supported by Pentagon officials, argued that suspending the 17-year-old policy and forcing the military to immediately change course while the case is being appealed would cause problems during a time of war. ""The military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years, particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas,"" the government said in its high court brief. The case puts the administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal, but filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned. The legislation before Congress includes the process for repeal agreed to with Gates and Mullen. In response to the court case, Gates recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under ""don't ask, don't tell"" by ordering that it be done only by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force. In a memo written to the heads of all the military services, Gates said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding ""don't ask, don't tell"" law. Since Gates made the change, no service member has been discharged, according to Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell. CNN's Jennifer Rizzo and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report .","Obama officials want the policy repealed, but oppose a court ruling to end it .

"(CNN) -- In most of the old TV Westerns, there was a moment at the end where the cowboy rode away. He's delivered justice, empowered the townsfolk and ended the crisis. The good guy knows he will be needed elsewhere. It's mythology, of course; the historical American West was bloody and brutal and often without honor. But there were still a lot of people who hoped the cowboy icon was precisely the self-image Texas Gov. Rick Perry was realizing as he took the stage to make an announcement about his ""exciting future plans."" But this is not the scene where the cowboy rides away. It's a bit more like the one where he refuses to leave the saloon and has to be thrown out onto the street. In spite of promoting his Monday event in San Antonio for a week, Perry didn't speak in any detail about his plans. Democrats and progressives had a bit of excitement, however. The governor said he was not running for re-election to the state's top political job. It will be 18 months before Perry leaves office after a 14-year tenure as the longest-serving governor in Texas history. And that final year and a half and what he's going to do with it is where Perry exercised his skills at being politically vague. Which is why pundits tend to say Perry is hard to predict. But he's not. Since the day he switched political parties under the tutelage of Karl Rove almost a quarter century ago, Perry has been an extreme conservative who gave away hundreds of millions in taxpayer money to corporations. And when the tea party metastasized into Texas politics, he walked his conservatism over to the right edge of the flat earth. His lust for guns and God and his hatred of abortion rights and gay rights make him a strong Republican primary candidate among the activist voters, but an unlikely voice for most of America seeking a president in 2016. But he's still going to try, bless his heart. Perry will use his remaining time in office to raise money. The signal for this was the site of his announcement, which was a Caterpillar plant outside San Antonio. The manufacturer's chief executive reportedly has given Perry more than $680,000 since he became governor, and Caterpillar received millions in tax abatements and a $10 million grant from the Texas Enterprise Fund, which has disproportionately awarded money to generous Perry campaign donors. An Emerging Technology Fund and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas offered the same fiduciary delights for GOP business leaders that are believers in Perry. In fact, the institute's operation was so political all of the top scientists drawn to the project resigned and the district attorney in Austin launched a criminal investigation. When the district attorney was arrested on a driving while intoxicated charge, however, Perry vetoed funding for her unit, which was investigating his potential misconduct. Case closed. It's good to be king. And he kind of is in Texas. No one should expect anything new out of Perry. He will keep traveling the country annoying other state leaders while talking about jobs in Texas and acting like he persuaded God to pour dinosaur wine into our soil and then seduced California tech companies into moving where real estate and labor are less expensive. Texas has always been a job engine because of natural resources, weather and people, not politicians. No mention will be made by Perry of the fact that a large number of jobs lured to Texas using taxpayer money are minimum wage, nor will he talk about how Texas is 50th in the percentage of population with a high school diploma, or how it's first in the nation with 28.8% uninsured. The governor will keep arguing against Obamacare regardless of the fact it insures 3 million more Texans and reduces the uninsured overall to 12%. Don't expect him to detail, either, that his state is 50th in per capita spending on health care, 51st in benefits for the Women, Infants and Children program, and, even though he is pushing abortion restrictions, Perry will certainly not let anyone know he presides over a state ranked 50th in the percentage of women receiving prenatal care in their first trimesters. And if his leadership has been so inspiring, why is it that Texas is also last in the percentage of the voting age population that actually votes? Instead, look for Perry to associate more publicly with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative state think tank founded by one of his biggest donors. He'll try to gin up a little gravitas on issues, work on keeping three items in his head at one time, and launch a Super PAC that he can use to support conservative candidates in 2014, and then call upon them for returned favors when he runs in 2016. The two Super PACs associated with his previous presidential stumble have about $500,000 already, and Perry has been consistently skilled at leveraging the governor's office to raise cash for his political fantasies. The Texas governor has a good life. And he knows it. He's already drawing his $7,698 a month pension from the state, and his $150,000 salary, living in a beautiful mansion in downtown Austin, and traveling on jets with an entourage of security and sycophants. But that's nothing compared with being president. So, no, the cowboy isn't riding away. He's hanging around the saloon. And trying to get another drink. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of James C. Moore.","James Moore: Rick Perry says he won't run for governor again but was vague on future plans .
Moore: Perry will run for president, even though his extremism is out of step .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's transitional federal parliament has unanimously backed the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in the country after a vote over the issue was brought to parliamentarians Saturday. The vote will boost new President Sharif Ahmed's efforts to defeat the hard-line Islamic group of Alshabab, which opposes his government. Alshabab previously declared that it would continue fighting until Sharia law is imposed in Somalia. ""Calling us anti-Islamic lawmakers is now over,"" said Osman Elmi Boqore, deputy speaker of the Somali parliament, after voting ended. The parliament's vote comes amid high tension in Mogadishu after the killings of key supporters of Ahmed's government in recent days. The new form of law would replace the traditional charter, which was not as strict as Sharia law. The strict interpretation of Sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. -- Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","Somalia's parliament unanimously backs introduction of Islamic Sharia law .

"(CNN) -- 2011 has been a year for young people in the Middle East and North Africa. More than two thirds of the region's population is under the age of 25, according to the Arab Thought Foundation, and they have emerged as the drivers of the Arab Spring uprisings. At the second ""One Young World"" conference in Zurich, Switzerland, this month, 1,600 under 25s from 194 countries spent three days sharing ideas and hearing from global leaders in business, politics and activism. Here, we profile some young people from the Middle East and North Africa who could be the region's leaders of tomorrow. Internet activist, Bahrain . Esra'a El Shafei, 25, founded the website Mideast Youth, which campaigns on a diverse range of initiatives. El Shafei set up Mideast Youth five years ago and has concentrated on issues that do not receive much mainstream media attention, such as the plight of migrant works or the rights of religious minorities. One of its recent projects is CrowdVoice.org, a user-powered service tracking voices of protests by crowd-sourcing information. El Shafei said: ""I founded CrowdVoice out of my own frustrations of desperately needing a tool to organize the dissemination of assorted information and current events about topics that mattered to activists worldwide. ""CrowdVoice made its mark with thousands of users when the revolutionary protests began in Tunisia and Egypt."" How Arab youth found their voice . Campaigner for education reform, Egypt . Jamal Dayem, 23, is an engineer by trade but passionate about improving education in Egypt. He said: ""The real dream is to implement an education reform movement such as 'Teach for India' in Egypt, where high caliber Egyptian university graduates teach full time in low-income schools around Egypt. ""The education institutions in Egypt have been one of the most affected by the decades of corruption in the country."" Daymen's mother is a teacher in a government school and has spurred his desire to change the system . ""There is no question that the education system in Egypt needs a revolution,"" he said. ""In Egypt universities graduate a plethora of extremely capable students every year that are bulwarked by an unemployment rate of 20% for their age group. ""If we as a country are able to harness their energy and passion to fuel the education of the succeeding generation we would be more effective than any curriculum change or incentives given to already dormant and corrupt members of education."" Entrepreneur, Jordan . Rami Al Qadi, 25, is an entrepreneur and electrical engineer who has designed a wind turbine that works in low wind speeds. His entrepreneurial ideas range from bringing wind energy to Jordan to manufacturing sand buggies. Al Qadi is worried that this year's unrest across the Middle East has made conditions harder for growing businesses, particularly those which depend on tourism. He wants to see regulations eased for entrepreneurs and an end to corruption in Jordan. ""Young people are very important in the Middle East because they represent the majority of people,"" said Al Qadi. ""If a small percentage takes some action then a change might happen."" Ten must-read blogs from the Middle East . Youth ambassador, Egypt . Raghada Abdel Hamed, 28, is Egypt's Youth Ambassador for Arab Thought Foundation, an organization which promotes innovation in science, culture, literature, arts and education. Hamed said: ""My main goal is to represent the organization in my country and spread awareness on its objectives."" She has represented Egypt at numerous youth conferences since 2004, and works for the United National High Commissioner for Refugees interviewing people vulnerable to abuse and ensuring they are referred for support. Hamed was involved in the revolution in Egypt and is keen to help build her nation's future. She said: ""I have seen by my eyes the sacrifices made to this revolution to succeed. ""Therefore, we will work hard to achieve what we paid a great price for: better governance, better social justice, job creation, less corruption and above all a generation who are aware of their rights and duties, so that they can always stand up and fight for it."" Youth employment trainer, Jordan . Mohammad Abulawi, 25, wants to help young people find jobs in his native Jordan. Abulawi is training co-ordinator for Jordan Career Education Foundation, an organization which aims to give vulnerable and disadvantaged 18 to 24-year-olds a sense of hope and dignity by training them for work. He said: ""My hope is that parents and children fully understand the importance of education and that the numbers of uneducated youth decrease in Jordan. ""I also wish that the 'culture of shame,' where Jordanian youth do not work in certain jobs, is tackled and that the youth become the biggest segment of the workforce in Jordan."" Social entrepreneur, Egypt . Mahmoud El-Refai, 27, co-founded It'sOneHummanity, a global social network for humanitarians that lets them share their work and ideas. He is also a climate-change ambassador for an international project, an engineering graduate and a corporate strategy officer for Siemens. El-Refai said: ""I'm working on bridging the gap between the private sector, the public sector and the civil society to create projects that can benefit the people at the 'bottom of the pyramid.' I believe that business must be for profit, but profit must also be for purpose."" He added: ""I dream of an Egypt where human rights are respected and where social equality prevails. I imagine an Egypt that is in the top 20 countries in the world, a leading country in the political, social and economic arenas."" Researcher and women's advocate, United Arab Emirates . Graduate student Sarah AbdulRazak, 23, is on the board organizing a ""Women As Global Leaders"" conference in Abu Dhabi next year. AbdulRazak would love to see more women in public life in the United Arab Emirates and other Middle Eastern countries. She is also passionate about education and promoting dialogue between the east and west. AbdulRazak said: ""Young people are the voices and torchbearers of a progressive future, especially in the Middle East where they are currently underrepresented on the global stage."" Inventor, Jordan . Abdel Rahman Alzorgan, 21, and his younger brother Mohammad were named among the best young inventors in Jordan after winning fourth place in an Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in the United States. The pair's invention was an automated irrigation system they had been working on since they were in elementary school. Abdel said: ""We got a patent for it, so we are known now as the youngest inventors of Jordan. At the moment we are working on five other research projects, mainly to do with environmental solutions."" Alzorgan, now an engineering student, also works on awareness campaigns involving politics, fighting hunger and HIV.","More than two thirds of Middle East population is under 25 .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A dolphin who died in the southern Chinese city of Sanya Monday has sparked nationwide anger after pictures surfaced of tourists near the shore mistreating and posing with the dying animal were spread on Weibo, China's most popular social network site. The dolphin died off the shore in Dadonghai, a resort in Hainan Province, due to injuries to its tail, likely from a collision with a fishing boat, according to state news agency Xinhua. The injured dolphin was found on a beach Sunday. A witness surnamed He said the animal was still alive when tourists start to take pictures with it, according to local portal news hinews.cn. Photos on China's microblogs showed that tourists -- instead of helping the dolphin -- were lifting and mistreating it before rescuers arrived. One of the pictures showed a man flexing his muscles in front of a group of swimmers holding up the dolphin soon went viral on the social network sites.

"(CNN) -- The Army sergeant who admitted to gunning down 16 civilians in a 2012 rampage through two villages near his outpost in southern Afghanistan is expected to take the stand at his sentencing hearing and will apologize. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty in June to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts. The plea spares the 39-year-old Bales the prospect of a death sentence in the killings. He now faces life in prison, but a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel will decide whether he will have a chance at parole. ""Yes, Bob will take (the) stand ... Yes, Bob will apologize,"" Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne said in an e-mail to CNN. Bales admitted to slipping away from his outpost in southern Afghanistan and going on a house-to-house killing spree in two nearby villages in March 2012, a massacre that further strained ties between American troops and their Afghan allies. Afghanistan shootings Fast Facts . But he has not offered an explanation for his actions. ""I've asked that question a million times since then. There's not a good reason in the world for the horrible things I did,"" Bales said when he pleaded guilty, according to Drew Mikkelson of CNN affilliate KING, who was tweeting from the courtroom. Mikkelson also tweeted from the sentencing hearing, which began this week at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington. So far, a number of Afghan civilians have taken the stand for the prosecution to talk about what they saw and survived. Haji Mohammed Wazir lost 11 relatives -- his wife, mother, two brothers, a 13-year-old nephew and six of his seven children -- according to KING. ""My life has never been the same,"" Wazir told the jury. It's been more than a year since the massacre, but Wazir said: ""I feel like it's happening right now,"" the affiliate reported. KING's Mikkelson tweeted that a 12-year-old boy who survived the rampage testified about seeing his father and sister get shot. Another witness broke down on the stand and cried out: ""For God's sake, don't ask me any more questions,"" Mikkelson wrote. In addition to the murder counts, Bales pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted murder, seven of assault and the use of illicit steroids and alcohol. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice. Bales is a member of the Army's 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an element of the 2nd Infantry Division. His attorneys have said the service made a mistake in assigning Bales to another combat tour despite evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury suffered during a combat tour in Iraq.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Thousands of mostly Syrian prisoners were exchanged Wednesday for a few dozen Iranians in Damascus, a Turkish charity said. The Syrian government released 2,130 civilians, 76 of them women, in exchange for the release of 48 Iranians who had been held by Syrian rebels, said Huseyin Oruc, deputy president of the Humanitarian Relief Foundation in Turkey. Iran has backed the Syria government during the nearly two-year war that has pitted rebels against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Iran's semi-official news agency FARS reported Wednesday that the released Iranians were pilgrims who had been ""abducted by terrorists in Syria in August."" Al-Assad and Iran routinely refer to Syrian rebels as foreign-backed militants or terrorists. The exchange took place after a speech delivered Sunday by al-Assad in which he vowed to continue to push back against the rebels. ""It's a huge victory for us,"" said Louai al Miqdad, a political and media coordinator for the Free Syrian Army. It's a huge victory for the revolution. And it's a huge victory for the Syrian people."" He added, ""It shows the whole world that Bashar al-Assad only understands the language of force. Today, we released them by our hand."" Oruc told CNN in a telephone interview that four Turkish nationals and one Palestinian were also released by the Syrian government as part of the deal. The foundation's teams in Damascus handled the exchange, which took place at various police stations, he said. By late Wednesday, the freed Iranians were in Damascus and the freed Syrians had returned to their homes, he said. Read more: What's next for Syria in 2013? According to the charity, the swap is the result of three months of negotiations. Among the freed Syrians and Turks were four ""bride activists,"" women who were wearing their wedding dresses when they were arrested protesting violence in their country, Miqdad said. Some of the Syrian and Turkish prisoners had been held in the capital's main prison, and others in a prison run by the intelligence branch, Miqdad said. Read more: Snowstorms thrash Middle East . He said the released Iranians were members of a group abducted last August by rebels in Damascus. The Iranian government denied rebel claims that the freed Iranians were members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Tehran says they are Shiite pilgrims who were in Syria visiting a holy site in Damascus when they were abducted by ""foreign-backed militants."" Opposition leaders accused al-Assad of valuing the freedom of a few dozen Iranians above the release of thousands of Syrian loyalist soldiers believed to be in rebel custody. ""One Iranian person means more to him than a thousand soldiers,"" Miqdad said. ""The command came direct from Tehran."" Read more: Report describes brutal torture in Syria . ""The big prize for the regime is the Iranians, keeping them happy,"" said George Sabra, vice president of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. ""The regime never cared about the lives of the civilian population or even his own armed forces."" Syria's state-run SANA news agency reported that ""Iran hoped that permanent, comprehensive security and stability return to Syria"" and said the Iranian Foreign Ministry had characterized the exchange as a release of Iranians who had been abducted in Syria. It urged respecting principles declared in international agreements that ban the attacking of innocents and consider the abductions as contradictory to the principles of human rights.

Meanwhile, as the Syrian war ground on, the United Nations said Wednesday that Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria, would meet Friday with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns. The meeting, to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, would be ""aimed at furthering their discussions to arrive at a political solution to the crisis in Syria,"" a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. But on the ground, blood kept flowing. A car bomb rocked the Damascus suburb of Modamieyah on Wednesday, with reports of deaths and injuries, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group. Fighting also continued in the Taftanaz area of northern Syria, where rebels were engaged in a battle for a key Syrian air base. Al-Nusra Front, a militant group that the United States has designated as a terrorist movement, is among three rebel factions attacking the base in Idlib province, rebels have said. Elsewhere, wintry weather appeared to put a brake on some military operations. Read more: Scavenging for food, Syrian children witness war .

"(CNN) -- Watching Peter Dearman at work amid the clutter in his garage cum workshop, it's easy to see why one of his sons refers to him as a sort of ""nutty professor."" The British inventor has been tinkering with ""liquid air"" engines at his home in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire for more than three decades. ""I don't think it's any good having ideas and not being able to make them. It's very difficult if you just go to people with ideas -- you can't actually show them it working,"" Dearman says. All that hard work is starting to pay off, as interest in the 61-year-old's invention -- which has applications for both motoring and renewable energy storage -- gathers pace. Liquid air is essentially air which has been cooled to very low, or cryogenic, temperatures (around -190 degrees Celsius or -310 degrees Fahrenheit) and can be stored in insulted containers. Read: Mine Kafon: The low-tech tumbleweed minesweeper . When exposed to heat, the liquid starts to expand as it turns back into a gas. If this process of reheating is conducted in a confined space, say, an engine cylinder, it creates high pressure air which can drive a piston. Whilst building a car powered by liquid air is nothing new -- a model was demonstrated as early as 1903 -- Dearman's adaptation is. ""The unique thing about this engine is that it uses a heat exchange fluid (in this case, anti-freeze) which is placed on top of the piston in the cylinder,"" Dearman explains. ""Into that we introduce liquid nitrogen which is atomized and gives us good heat contact. The heat exchange fluid keeps the gas warm (as the piston moves up and down) and increases the efficiency."" Dearman has come a long way since he developed his first working prototype using a modified a lawn mower engine. Today, he demonstrates a custom-built car which runs smoothly around a farmyard near his home. Read: Shutter shades creates new fashion code . The technology has caught the eye of British engineering company Ricardo who are currently building an engine based on Dearman's design for use in agricultural vehicles and mining equipment. The company say the engine has ""numerous practical applications in the future market place ... and is likely to compete with hydrogen fuel cell and battery electric systems."" Liquid air could also help store surplus energy generated by wind and solar. ""[Energy storage] is essential because, with any renewable energy source, it's variable. So you have to be able to store a certain amount of it to cope with peak demand,"" Dearman said. A pilot power plant in Slough, Berkshire -- the first of its kind in the world -- is currently trialing the technology. Read: Toy chopper takes mental concentration to new heights . A huge vacuum flask at the facitlity holds 60 tons of liquid air, but instead of anti-freeze, they mix it with waste heat coming from the neighboring power station. But the principles are exactly the same, Dearman says. ""We take a large tank, heat it with waste heat and that creates the pressure that runs the turbine which creates electricity ... simple,"" he says. The plant run by Highview Power Storage -- a company co-founded by Dearman and jointly funded by the UK government -- can generate 500 kilowatts of power, he says, but there is nothing to stop them being made on a much larger scale. Using waste heat also raises efficiency levels up to 70% -- not as high as the 80% battery storage can achieve, but competitive. It also has one crucial advantage, Dearman says. ""Batteries aren't really scalable, you can't use them worldwide because there's not enough materials to make batteries from. So you need a system that doesn't use scarce resources,"" he said. The UK's Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) recently launched a working group investigating the potential of liquid air storage. Speaking in October, IMechE's Head of Energy and Environment, Tim Fox said: ""Liquid air and liquid nitrogen are an exciting alternative we should explore to store energy. It seems to address many of the challenges we face and is affordable, uses mature components and is highly scalable."" All this is rich encouragement for Dearman, who isn't driven by money, but by a lifelong fascination with energy and a desire to help make the world a more efficient place. ""It's not right that one generation should use up most of the world's resources during their lifetime. So, the more we can do to alleviate that the better, I think.""","British inventor Peter Dearman develops novel engine powered by ""liquid air""

"(CNN) -- The University of Kentucky has settled its case with the state over the release of safety data for its embattled pediatric heart surgery program, which was closed last year following patient deaths. The dispute stems from a request last year by a local radio reporter for information about the program. The university declined to give that information, citing patient privacy laws, but then released it August 9 when a CNN investigation caused an uproar among parents of children with congenital heart disease. ""We are pleased that the litigation has been resolved,"" said university spokesman Jay Blanton. ""The university was not put in the position of having to disclose patient and family information that would violate either peer review or privacy laws -- both of which are protected by federal laws."" The Kentucky attorney general got involved in December when the university declined to provide the safety data requested by Brenna Angel, then a radio reporter for WUKY. The attorney general asked the university to make the information public, but the university declined, and sued Angel in order to keep it private. After the CNN report, the university revealed that the pediatric heart program had a higher mortality rate than the national average. The university still hasn't released all the information Angel had asked for under the state's open records law, but she issued a statement last week saying she had agreed to a dismissal of the case. ""UK's release of its mortality rates in the pediatric cardiothoracic surgery program has achieved in large part my purpose for filing the open records request,"" wrote Angel, who now works in the Lexington mayor's office. ""Families who are entrusting their children to UK Healthcare now have access to this type of information."" Among the pieces of information Angel asked for that still have not been released are documents relating to the evaluation and accreditation of the pediatric heart program and the date of the last surgery completed by the university's chief heart surgeon, who has since resigned. ""The University is not required to disclose any documents, remaining mortality statistics (which are protected by federal law), or any dates,"" William Thro, University of Kentucky general counsel, wrote to the board of trustees on August 16, adding, ""We could see further litigation involving other media outlets."" The university is planning to reopen its pediatric heart surgery program after conducting a review, which it anticipates will be completed in the next few weeks, according to Blanton, the UK spokesman. ""When the review is completed, we will release as much of the final report as federal and state law allow,"" he said, adding that the report will be ""focused most intently on how best to move forward than as a retrospective examination."" Tabitha Rainey, whose infant son, Waylon, went into heart failure after having surgery at UK, said she's concerned the university will keep crucial parts of the review a secret. ""They've used federal and state laws before when they didn't want to give statistics, so what's to say they won't do that again?"" she said.","University of Kentucky settles case over release of safety data .

"(CNN) -- Ryan Braun must now sit at home in shame. If press reports are accurate, Alex Rodriguez and about a dozen other Major League Baseball cheaters might do that too. But the homes they sit in are million-dollar mansions. That seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroids scandal. Sure, they look bad. But both Braun and Rodriguez have millions of dollars to fall back on. What's most troubling about this affair is how many of today's young people believe cheating might be the only way to break through in sports. In a recent Zogby poll, nearly half of males ages 18 through 25 thought that taking performance-enhancing drugs is critical to making it in professional sports or helping one's athletic performance. And well more than half of those polled thought that at least one-third of the major leaguers in the recent All-Star Game had used performance-enhancing drugs, often called PEDs, to get where they are. The problem is, for every Braun and A-Rod, a thousand young men will never make the majors -- but are willing to risk their health, even their lives, by taking PEDs. These young athletes need to hear more about Taylor Hooton than Ryan Braun. Taylor Hooton was a star high school pitcher who turned to steroids to get to the next level. Although the steroids bulked up his body, they wreaked havoc on his emotions until one day he hanged himself. His father, Don Hooton, has committed his life to trying to help other young athletes steer clear of steroids. Tragic decisions come when you combine motive with opportunity. That's what we have here. Young athletes see juiced-up athletes in a number of sports get fame and glory and multimillion contracts. They want to be like them. They can go online and find dozens of websites that offer to sell anabolic steroids and other PEDs online. They don't have to find a shadowy figure lurking on a corner in a long overcoat. Teenagers know how to find just what they think they need on YouTube, eBay and other websites that parents haven't even heard of. But these children know nothing about the dangers of even the purest of steroids, not to mention those that are contaminated with dangerous substances. The Taylor Hooton Foundation has found PEDs that contain contaminants such as lead and other heavy metals, liquid mixers such as cooking oil, horse urine and other filthy contents. What can parents do to keep their kids safe? Pay attention to sudden fluctuations in weight and muscle growth. If your son or daughter suddenly bulks up, it could be cause for concern. Additionally, pay attention to an extreme shift in personality. Teens are prone to mood shifts, but if suddenly your teen athlete is filled with unexplained rage, speak to him or her about what may be causing the extreme emotions. It's also important to pay attention to Internet and credit card use. Many teenagers have credit cards, which can be easily used to purchase PEDs online. Recently, the consumer group I head, Digital Citizens Alliance, made four purchases online, and the illegal drugs arrived in just under a month. Talk to your teenagers regularly about why they shouldn't be using PEDs. To use them is cheating, they are illegal to possess without a prescription, and they can do serious damage to teens' bodies and their minds. It's a sad fact that if they play high school or college sports, these youths probably already know of someone who has taken PEDs. Don't assume it's someone else's problem. Most important, don't ignore the warning signs, even if it leads to a tough conversation. Make sure young athletes hear the whole story. Most of the media coverage around the MLB scandal is whether the PED use is ""worth"" the risk of millions of dollars in lost salary and the shame that comes with getting caught. But the real risk for young athletes is their health. The young athletes who appear to be our fit and finest could be facing decades of health trouble -- including liver abnormalities and tumors, increased risk for heart attacks, depression and more -- from taking PEDs. Make sure that for every story about A-Rod, they hear about Taylor Hooton. Let them know that fame and money -- and the risk of shame -- are not what really is at stake here. When they use PEDs, they are risking their lives and their health. And that is never worth the risk. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Galvin.","Tom Galvin: Ryan Braun, Alex Rodriguez still have millions despite baseball scandal .

"(EW) -- In ""Elysium,"" Neill Blomkamp's shrewdly revved-up and exciting dystopian thriller, Matt Damon's character, Max, spends most of the movie with a spidery black-metal exoskeleton implanted in his skull and spine. The surgically attached machinery serves several functions at once. It's there to make Max strong — a boost he critically needs, since he's been exposed to a dose of radiation that will leave him dead in just five days. It also allows him to download the contents of someone else's brain. But the most important purpose served by that added hardware may be visual and symbolic: It transforms Max into a hulkingly damaged yet superheroic man-machine — a variation on the title character of ""RoboCop."" And it has the unmistakable look of a cross that he's been nailed to. Box office preview: 'Elysium' may lift off faster than 'Planes' Max isn't just fighting to save himself or his fellow earthlings. He's a guy who's been souped up into a post-apocalyptic, action-movie Christ. ""Elysium"" confirms the talent — for razory mayhem and shocking satire, for the crazed spectacle of future decay — that Blomkamp showcased in his amazing first feature, ""District 9"" (2009). I've never forgotten that film's images of gargantuan alien spaceships hovering in the air, or of droid wars as bloody and frenzied as a heavy-metal version of the Crusades. In ""Elysium,"" Blomkamp comes up with sci-fi conceits that sear themselves into your imagination. The film is set in 2154, and much of it takes place in a crumbling shantytown Los Angeles. Earth has become a great big slovenly police state, with citizens kept in check by clanging robot officers programmed to presume that you're guilty. Max, a former car thief who now works on an assembly line (that's where he gets zapped with radiation), is hauled before his parole officer, who turns out to be an old carnival mannequin that speaks like a voicemail menu and says things like ''Stop talking!'' 'Elysium': EW Exclusive Action Shots . Suspended above this hellhole society is a twirling, man-made satellite called Elysium, where the elite live. From a distance (it can be glimpsed in the noon sky), Elysium looks like the steering wheel of a '60s Chrysler. Up close, we can see that the vast metal rim contains a sprawling prefab suburban paradise — acres and acres of pristine lawns and McMansions. The people who live there have all they want, yet Blomkamp's sly joke is that even the world that everyone on Earth covets is a paper-thin and almost virtual place. The key advantage of living on Elysium is that each home is equipped with a healing chamber that will cure everything from flesh wounds to cancer in five seconds. That's why Max, joining forces with his old underworld cronies, will do anything to get there: It's the only way his irradiated body can survive. ""Elysium"" takes off from a pure existential thriller situation (which it borrows from the great 1950 film noir ""D.O.A.""), and it's been shot in an incredibly effective mode of raggedy, quick-cut anxiety. Yet apart from that health care allegory (and the 1 percent--versus--99 percent theme it emerges from), the plot is fairly basic. I wish that the film had more of the tasty futuristic detail promised by that dummy parole officer. I also wish that Blomkamp took us deeper into the world of Elysium. Max has to outwit the fascist politician who's plotting to take over (she's played by Jodie Foster with angry clipped diction and not a lot more). But once he's up there, Elysium turns into a virtuoso gun battle that might be taking place almost anywhere. What makes it matter is Damon, who has kicked butt before but never with this kind of underlying brotherhood-of-man melancholy. Grade: B+ . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- ""American Idol"" lost two stars this week when judges Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez announced they would not be returning next season, but the hit Fox show could gain itself The Queen. Aretha Franklin, an 18-time Grammy Award winner who Rolling Stone proclaimed the greatest female singer of all time, told CNN in an e-mail Saturday that she is interested in joining the show as a judge. Franklin, 70, who wowed the Essence Music Festival crowd last week in New Orleans and is now performing in Las Vegas, says she has long been a fan of the show. Now instead of watching it with the rest of America, she's ready to play a vital role in choosing the next ""American Idol."" And as the Queen of Soul would do, she's already thinking about bringing along a sidekick: songstress Patti LaBelle. Fox declined to comment on Franklin on Saturday night. The addition of Franklin could help Fox stop the ratings slide of ""Idol,"" which saw it lose its spot as the top show of the year to NBC's ""Sunday Night Football."" The addition of similar singing contests to primetime television has increased the competition for viewers.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is having a tough time. The defeat of the gun control legislation was devastating. Despite strong public support for tighter regulations and the backing of a bipartisan coalition, a furious blitz from gun lobby groups persuaded enough senators to kill the legislation. The bill's sponsors could not find the 60 senators needed to stop a filibuster. One would think that the horrific tragedy of Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were shot and killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, would be enough to move lawmakers to impose some regulations, such as tougher background checks. But it wasn't enough. Now the president faces another challenge with immigration reform. A bipartisan group in the Senate, led by Charles Schumer and Marco Rubio, has put together an immigration bill that includes a path to legalization for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in this country and tighter border control. It appears that the bill has a chance to pass the Senate. But will House Republicans subvert the deal? Opinion: Did we learn nothing from Newtown? Immediately after Congress killed the gun control legislation, critics started pointing to the president's hesitation to twist arms and lean on members of Congress. In what has become a familiar refrain, Obama was no Lyndon Johnson. Yet Obama's trouble has much more to do with the way government works than his skill, or lack thereof, at working Capitol Hill. Too much emphasis is placed on the small picture of what he does or does not do in his personal interactions with Congress, or his ""messaging."" Actually, it's not so much him as the government. Obama understood this when he ran for president in 2008. He spoke constantly about the need to reform the government and the way in which our political processes hamper the ability of Congress and the president to take action. Yet once he was president, Obama put the issue of reform on the back burner. He decided to focus on the policy challenges ahead, generally dismissing the idea that there was much chance for him to make government work better. In certain cases, such as with the use of private money and political action committees, he decided to join the game and make sure it worked to his advantage. The decision has come at a cost. Opinion: Gun control fight just beginning . Throughout his presidency, Obama has struggled as private interest groups have continued to exert enormous power over the legislative process. When Obama pushed his health care law through Congress, he felt the need to abandon hugely important measures that would have imposed tough cost controls. He did so to placate powerful interest groups in the medical industry who were dead set against these measures. The financial regulations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in response to the financial crisis of 2008, have struggled as interest groups continually undercut their effectiveness by persuading legislators to avoid any kind of tough implementation. This time around, gun rights organizations -- from giants such as the National Rifle Association to smaller operations -- conducted a massive and unyielding blitz on legislators. Even bipartisan support, a rarity in Washington, was not enough for the bill to succeed. Other issues, such as tax reform to close loopholes, have simply been abandoned because they seem so impossible given the power of lobbyists and campaign contributors who lurk on K Street. The power of money makes it extremely difficult for politicians to go out on a limb. The filibuster has also remained the chronic obstacle for Obama. With the constant threat of the filibuster against almost any piece of legislation, almost every bill requires a 60-vote super majority in the Senate. This makes it hard to build a coalition behind legislation and in most cases allows small factions within a party to subvert presidential proposals. Presidents usually need bipartisan support to get 60 votes, and bipartisanship is almost impossible nowadays. Opinion: One way to fight guns . This was certainly a challenge for gun rights, and could make immigration reform vulnerable in the final stages of debate. As with money and politics, the filibuster has also made other issues altogether impossible to consider even. When the immigration bill reaches the House of Representatives, the trouble will begin. House members in gerrymandered districts care about the party activists who tend to be the loudest voices. The situation to avoid is one where the Republican caucus drifts further to the right even while counterparts in the Senate and public opinion support immigration reform. The truth is we will never know what was possible in that transformative moment that followed Obama's historic election or after his re-election in 2012. But without reforming our government, the path to gridlock is not going to disappear. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: The defeat of the gun control bill was devastating for the Obama administration .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer, hampered by a back injury in recent weeks, pulled out of the Rogers Cup in Montreal with the U.S. Open just around the corner. ""I am disappointed not to be playing in Montreal next week,"" Federer said in a tournament press release sent to CNN. ""It is a great tournament with amazing fans. I look forward to competing there in the future."" Although no reason was given for his absence, Federer said after a surprise defeat to Daniel Brands in his native Switzerland last week that he had been having ""serious problems"" with the back and needed to take anti-inflammatory medication. The withdrawal continues a disappointing spell for the 17-time grand slam champion, who turns 32 on Aug. 8. Federer appeared to be headed in the right direction going into Wimbledon when he won his first title of 2013 in Halle, Germany on grass. But Federer was upset in the second round by Sergiy Stakhovsky at the All England Club, marking the first time he failed to advance to the round of 32 at a major since 2003. When the new rankings were released after Wimbledon, he dipped to No. 5, his lowest position in 10 years. Federer decided to enter tournaments in Hamburg, Germany and Gstaad, Switzerland with a larger racquet -- a significant change for a tennis player -- but lost to opponents outside the top 100 and top 50, respectively. ""A change like this is very important but I honestly can't tell right now due to my low level,"" Federer said in Gstaad, when asked about the new racquet. ""It's hard to analyze anything. ""I still don't have even enough information to try and explain. I have no clue where I am right now with the racquet change."" If Federer plays at the U.S. Open -- which begins Aug. 26 -- he would participate in a 56th consecutive grand slam tournament, tying the men's record in the Open era. As one double-digit grand slam winner skipped Montreal, another is set to return. Rafael Nadal arrived in the Canadian city having not played since a first-round loss to Steve Darcis at Wimbledon.

""I will try to arrive competitive in Montreal because seven weeks without playing isn't ideal for competing in such a difficult tournament,"" Nadal was quoted as saying by the ATP's website. ""But I'll do everything possible for things to go well."" Andy Murray plays his first tournament, too, since ending Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles winner at Wimbledon.

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman failed to identify himself twice during a confrontation with Trayvon Martin and missed opportunities to defuse the situation that led to the death of the teen, a detective says in a newly released report. Zimmerman, who served as a neighborhood watch volunteer, is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of Martin, 17, in Sanford, Florida. The report is part of information Florida prosecutors released Tuesday. It includes a previously undisclosed portion of a video of Zimmerman showing injuries he said he suffered in the altercation with Martin. Zimmerman, 28, told police he shot the teenager in self-defense and has pleaded not guilty. But Martin's family and civil rights activists have said Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, racially profiled Martin and ignored a 911 dispatcher's advice not to follow him. Among the documents released was a report from an officer who conducted computerized voice stress analysis tests on Zimmerman. Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case . ""Mr. Zimmerman was subjected to two exams, and was found to be classified as No Deception Indicated,"" the report said. Also released Tuesday was an unredacted capias request, a request that someone be taken into custody, prepared by the lead police investigator in the case, Christopher Serino. ""Investigative findings show that (Zimmerman) had at least two opportunities to speak with (Martin) in order to defuse the circumstances surrounding their encounter,"" Serino wrote in the report. ""On at least two occasions (Zimmerman) failed to identify himself as a concerned resident or a neighborhood watch volunteer."" The detective also said Zimmerman's actions ""are inconsistent with those of a person who has stated he was in fear of another subject."" In the same report, Serino wrote that Zimmerman's injuries were ""marginally consistent with a life-threatening violent episode as described by him."" Zimmerman's defense attorney, Mark O'Mara, filed a motion Wednesday asking that his client be allowed to appear at a Friday bond hearing in ""civilian clothing instead of a prison uniform and without restraints."" Video and photos of Zimmerman shackled and wearing jail garb could prejudice prospective jurors, O'Mara said. In response to the document release, O'Mara said Tuesday it will be up to a judge and jury to interpret what Serino's report means to the case. ""I don't want to get into a battle with investigator Serino's report considering what he believed after it seems he made the decision that charges should be filed,"" he said. ""His suggestion that it's marginally consistent, again, is up for review. Those people will have to look at it, whether it'd be Judge (Kenneth) Lester in a motion hearing where the jury will also make that determination, whether or not those injuries give rise to a reasonable belief in George's mind that he was a victim of great bodily injury or potential death."" Martin's family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said he agrees with the detective's assertion. ""The lead detective made the determination at least on two different occasions Zimmerman had opportunity to defuse the situation. When he got out the car, he could have at least said, 'I'm a neighborhood watch volunteer' to defuse the situation and it's likely Trayvon Martin would be living today,"" Crump said. George Zimmerman: Trayvon Martin threatened my life . Also released Tuesday was a previously undisclosed portion of a video re-enactment of the incident that police taped a day after the shooting. In the video, Zimmerman, bandages on his head, talks about how his wife is treating his injuries. ""I have a broken nose. She says I could use stitches, but she'd rather not put them in -- as long as I didn't mess with my head. My skin is already healing nicely,"" Zimmerman said. Also Tuesday, the Sanford Police Department announced that Serino had ""voluntarily"" asked to be moved from detective to patrol officer. Sanford Sgt. David Morgenstern said the change is not a demotion and he said he did not know why Serino requested the move. Crump said the move was clearly a demotion. ""The lead detective today got demoted and that's one of those things we have to question. He told what he thought was the truth,"" Crump said. Zimmerman had been released on bond after his arrest. But he was ordered back to jail this month after a Florida judge revoked his bail, citing about $150,000 in donations in an account controlled by Zimmerman that he had not disclosed at the April 20 bond hearing. O'Mara is asking Lester, a Seminole County Circuit Court judge, to set a bond similar to the $150,000 bond initially granted Zimmerman, arguing that he poses no danger to the community, is not a flight risk, and ""cooperated fully"" with police before his arrest.

"Yeosu, South Korea (CNN) -- An unassuming town on the southern tip of South Korea is an unlikely place for one of the world's most advanced buildings. Until August 12 the city of Yeosu is hosting Expo 2012 and among the new buildings containing educational displays on ocean conservation is the Korea pavilion. It stands out as one of the most technologically advanced, if aesthetically underwhelming, of them all. Korean architecture firm Samoo Architects & Engineers designed it to resemble the Korean 'Taegeuk' -- the yin and yang symbol of balance -- but inside the structure that concept of harmony is taken even further. At a cost of around $19.5 million it combines the latest in hydrogen fuel cell technology, photovoltaic solar panels and geo-thermal energy to provide power, cooling and heating, making it carbon negative --taking out more CO2 from the atmosphere than it produces. Korean firm Hyundai provided the fuel cells that are key to the company's development of next generation hydrogen-fuelled cars, while architects from Samoo say that other engineering elements, like the seawater thermal pipes, are there to demonstrate their potential future use. While Expos have long been associated with experimental and iconic architecture -- the World's Fair of 1889 gave Paris the Eiffel Tower -- not much of it has stood the test of time. The Korea pavilion however will be one of the few structures that remains on the site once the Expo has ended. Another is the Theme Pavilion that tests architectural and engineering limits in a different way from its national namesake, by being as low-tech as possible. The Austrian architects were not even sure that the structure could even be built. ""The biomimetic principles (of the building) had not been built before on that scale,"" said Kristina Schinegger of Soma Architects. One vast side of the building is covered with reinforced fiberglass ""gills"" that can be opened and closed to either provide shade or ventilation. ""Really it's based on material performance; it's not a mechanism moving but the material itself, transforming,"" said Schinegger. ""It's an idea deduced from plants, how you can configure the geometry and how you can use certain characteristics (of the building) so you use less energy."" German renewable energy engineers Transsolar installed the solar panels on the roof and have designed a seawater heat exchange system that will provide additional cooling and lead to 80% of the building's energy originating from renewable sources. As well as the importance of eco-friendly elements, Schinegger says that the spirit of adventure and experimentalism, in keeping with the history of Expos, was a key part of the design process. ""The architectural scene (at Expos) at least is something where you can really see things that are being tried out. The task is not to make an envelope for a function but to do something that is an experience in itself,"" she says. ""On the one hand the architect has to do less, but on the other side much more. It has to be extraordinary, which is why architects love Expos.""","Expo 2012 in South Korea is site of cutting-edge experimental buildings .

"Cleveland (CNN) -- Michelle Knight was rescued last week from more than 10 years in captivity, but her family still doesn't know exactly where she is. There were joyous reunions for Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus after they were freed from the Cleveland home where police say Ariel Castro held them captive. But a level of mystery surrounds Michelle Knight, who was rescued along with the others, but who has apparently not been reunited with her family. Even as of Friday night, Knight hadn't spoken yet with her mother, Barbara, a family spokesperson said. In fact, Knight's family had no idea where she was and had asked police for information on her whereabouts. Castro, a 52-year-old bus driver and musician, faces charges of rape and kidnapping in connection with the prolonged captivity of the women. What little is known about Knight's whereabouts comes from a source close to the investigation, who told CNN that Knight ""is in a safe place and very comfortable."" The source did not specify further. There were reports that Knight was at the DeJesus home, and there was a lot of activity there Saturday morning, but Knight was not there. Her grandmother, Deborah Knight, had gone to the same home on Friday because she'd also heard Knight might be there and ""besides, Gina's parents here have been waiting to meet us."" Other questions surround Knight, whose disappearance generated far less publicity and attention than did those of Berry and DeJesus. Cleveland police removed Knight's name from an FBI database of missing people in November 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said. They did so after ""failing to locate a parent, guardian or other reporting person to confirm that Ms. Knight was still missing."" Police said, though, that her missing person's case remained open and was checked on as recently as November 2012. Cleveland police have been subject to intense criticism from some quarters over their handling of missing persons cases, but city officials have said they did everything they could to find the missing women. Knight was discharged from Cleveland's MetroHealth Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Tina Shaerban-Arundel said Friday, hours after the hospital said in a Facebook posting that she was in ""good spirits"" and ""extremely grateful"" for the flowers, gifts and the support of the Cleveland Courage Fund. The latter is a vehicle for raising that helps nonprofit organizations provide services to the three women. Berry and DeJesus were released days ago and are now staying with relatives. The Cleveland public relations firm of Hennes Paynter Communication is representing all three women, said Barbara Paynter of that company. Paynter said that her firm of crisis management specialists is working pro bono after being ""asked to help them out,"" joining a team of like-minded individuals that includes lawyers and counselors. The rescued women, none of whom have spoken publicly since being freed, are set to issue a full statement at 10 a.m. Sunday, according to Paynter. According to initial police report, the women told investigators that they were chained in the basement of the home, but later moved upstairs to rooms on the second floor. They were allowed out of the home only twice, and then just briefly, according to the document. Castro would frequently test the women by pretending to leave and then discipline any of them if they had moved, according to a law enforcement source. Meanwhile, the FBI is continuing the process of sealing off and boarding up the areas near the home of the alleged captor that they have checked for evidence. On Saturday morning they were boarding up and closing off an abandoned house to the right of Castro's home. The abandoned house had been searched Thursday, and authorities were seen removing evidence from that home. The neighbors continued to express their shock to learn that three girls were prisoners so near to their own homes. No one imagined that Castro could have been living a double life. ""This dude was cool, I'm telling you,"" Charles Ramsey, a neighbor hailed as a hero for helping Amanda Berry escape, told radio host Rock Newman of WE-ACT Radio on Saturday. ""This type of cat you'd put in your car ... just because you want someone to talk to,"" Ramsey said. ""You will ride him around and waste gas with this dude."" CNN's Pamela Brown reported this story from Cleveland; Mariano Castillo wrote it in Atlanta.

"New York (CNN) -- The parents of two children allegedly slain by their nanny in New York City last year are expecting a child this fall, roughly a year after the nightmare deaths, according to a Facebook post. ""We are very happy to let you know that Marina is expecting a baby in the fall,"" parents Marina and Kevin Krim said Thursday on the ""Lulu & Leo Fund"" memorial page, established for their late daughter Lucia ""Lulu"" Krim, 6, and her brother Leo, 2. Police say on that October 25, 2012, the children's mother returned to the family's Upper West Side apartment, found Lucia and Leo dead in the bathroom and saw the nanny stab herself with a kitchen knife. Krim left two of her children with the nanny, Yoselyn Ortega, 50, to take her 3-year-old child, Nessie, to a swim lesson at a nearby YMCA, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. She had expected to meet the nanny around 5:30 p.m. at a dance class, but when Ortega failed to appear, the mother went back to the apartment. Ortega was arrested in November and later indicted on first- and second-degree murder charges, court documents show. Ortega has pleaded not guilty and has been ruled emotionally fit to stand trial, according to prosecutors. The children's grandmother, Karen Krim, told CNN on Friday: ""We are thrilled."" ""Nessie can't wait to welcome her new baby brother,"" the children's parents say on their Facebook post. ""We are filled with many emotions as we look to the future, but the most important one is hope."" Kevin Krim is a senior vice president for CNBC Digital and a former Yahoo executive. Ortega, a native of the Dominican Republic, has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 10 years. Friends introduced the family to Ortega, and she had worked for them since Leo's birth, police said. Ortega was not a live-in nanny, but Marina Krim's blog, ""Life with the Little Krim Kids,"" offered the loving mother's view of a family life that included Ortega as a member. In February 2012, the Krims traveled to the Dominican Republic, where they met Ortega's family. ""We spent the past nine days in the Dominican Republic,"" Marina Krim wrote on February 18. ""We spent half the time at our nanny, Josie's sister's home in Santiago and the rest at Balcones de Atlantico in Las Terrenas, a condo-style hotel where the 'Real Housewives of Dominican Republic' and their families hang on weekends. It was wonderful."" She added, ""We met Josie's amazing familia!!! And the Dominican Republic is a wonderful country!!"" One photograph showed the families together, Ortega holding the girl who was learning how to swim at the time her siblings were killed.","Marina and Kevin Krim say child is expected this fall, about a year after children's deaths .

"(CNN) -- English footballer Joey Barton will have to wait until November to make his Ligue 1 debut for Marseille after the French League confirmed he must serve the remainder of his 12-game ban. Barton was handed the lengthy suspension by the English Football Association after he was red-carded in Queens Park Rangers' final Premier League match of last season at Manchester City. After training with English lower league side Fleetwood Town, Barton was then left behind as QPR toured Malaysia during preseason, and he completed a season-long loan move to Marseille before the August transfer window closed. ""Upon the transfer of Joey Barton from Queens Park Rangers to Olympique Marseille, the English Football Association transmitted to the French Football Federation the disciplinary sanction he was subject to in the English league,"" said a French League statement. ""In accordance with article 12 of FIFA's Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players, the sanction is applicable in France."" However the suspension only relates to Marseille's league and cup games, allowing Barton to play in the club's Europa League campaign, which kicks off with a trip to Turkish club Fenerbahce on September 20. Controversial Barton handed 12-match ban for Man City antics . The confirmation of the ban means the 30-year-old midfielder will have to wait until November 17 to make his Ligue 1 debut when Marseille travel to Bordeaux. Barton, who has a long history of controversy, is seen as a risky acquisition for Marseille. ""We wouldn't have taken this player,"" Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas told Canal Plus after his signing was completed. ""We wouldn't have taken such a risk. We have some guidelines inside the club, partners, and things we can't afford."" In May's EPL finale, Barton was sent off for elbowing Carlos Tevez, then kicking the striker's fellow Argentine Sergio Aguero before appearing to aim a headbutt at City captain Vincent Kompany. He was also given a $117,000 fine by the Football Association in addition to his lengthy ban. It was the latest in a long line of Barton's misdemeanors. He was sentenced to six months in prison while a Newcastle United player for an assault in Liverpool city center and later transfer-listed by the club after criticizing its hierarchy on Twitter. Prior to that, at Manchester City, he was fined for stubbing a cigar out in the eye of a youth team player and, in a separate incident, was sent home from a tour of Thailand after an altercation with a 15-year-old Everton fan. Despite that violent past, Barton has carved out a reputation as one of football's more cerebral thinkers, building up a Twitter audience of 1.7 million followers thanks to his musings on philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and lyrics from songs of The Smiths. He also has his own website, where he has written about his excitement in starting a new career in France. ""I already feel like a kid debuting again, I literally cannot wait. I hope my countrymen and women will be cheering me on and have a new interest in Olympique de Marseille,"" Barton said. ""My core driver to break from the Prem is to fall in love with the game again, I said it when Fleetwood was on the cards. Reducing the ban was always complete nonsense from the media, Mark Hughes and I never saw it that way since I'd have to serve the ban somewhere and sometime, it's not going anywhere unfortunately. It's common sense.""","QPR's Joey Barton must serve the remainder of his 12-game ban in France .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Thousands of joyous Bahrainis retook a major square in the heart of the island nation's capital Saturday -- a dramatic turn of events two days after security forces ousted demonstrators from the spot in a deadly attack. The sight of citizens streaming into Pearl Roundabout came as the Bahrain royal family made moves designed to end a turbulent week of unrest capped by calls from world leaders to talk with opposition leaders with an eye to reform. Crown Prince Salman ordered the removal of the military from the Pearl Roundabout, a top demand by opposition forces, and told CNN's Nic Robertson that citizens would be permitted to stay in the spot without fear. ""We have, under the leadership of his majesty, decided that the best way to handle the situation without any further loss of life or injuries is through dialogue,"" he said. The crown prince said he was deeply sorry for the deaths of protesters. An investigation will be launched and those responsible will be held accountable, he said. ""This is a terrible tragedy for our nation,"" he said. Salman also said the government will be embracing talks with all parties, a sign that the government is stepping back from confrontation and embracing dialogue. ""All political parties in the country deserve a voice at the table,"" he said. Bahrain's military withdrew from the square after issuing a statement saying it ""successfully completed"" its mission of ""safeguarding vital areas in the center of the capital."" Police were placed in charge but withdrew from the roundabout on the heels of the military. Thousands of people streamed into the roundabout, the focal point of protests in central Manama, waving flags, praying, dancing and honking horns. ""I'm feeling freedom,"" one protester said moments after soldiers and police retreated. ""It's the beginning, the beginning of our freedom."" While there was anger in the crowd over longstanding grievances, it was a sharp contrast to deadly confrontations early Thursday and Friday evening. Many of the protesters are Shiite Muslims, who make up 70 percent of the residents of the island kingdom and have long harbored deep political and economic grievances against the Sunni ruling family. Bahrain is one of several countries in the Middle East and North Africa to face a surge of dissent following the revolts that toppled longtime autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt. This week's ferment upended the kingdom, a tiny but strategically critical country that's a key U.S. ally and home to the U.S. Navy's Fifith Fleet, and left 10 dead and many injured. Two protesters were killed early this week. Four people died after security forces stormed the Pearl Roundabout early Thursday, ousting an encampment of sleeping demonstrators and taking control of the location. Four others died on Friday evening after demonstrators attempted to approach the square and the security forces fired bullets and tear gas at them. World leaders have urged the Bahrain government to open talks with protest leaders. As international condemnation rolled in over the military's use of force against peaceful demonstrators, the royal family urged a dialogue with all sectors of the society to resolve the situation. In a nationally televised address Friday, Salman offered his condolences, cautioned citizens and security forces to restrain themselves, and said the country wants a nation where neither Sunni or Shiites are favored. After Salman's TV appearance, King Hamad announced that the crown prince is to lead a dialogue ""with all parties and sections of Bahrain, without exception."" But a leading member of parliament from Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, al-Wifaq, told CNN that there can be no dialogue with the government while the military controls the streets. The crown prince ordered the military Saturday to withdraw from Bahrain's streets and left the police in charge to ""oversee law and order."" He appealed for calm and said ""the situation is going back to normal."" ""We are starting a new stage, a stage that we will discuss all our issues with all honesty and integrity,"" he said. ""To all the citizens of Bahrain, I hope that we be shoulder to shoulder, collaborate with each other, and communicate with all the political forces.""

"(CNN) -- Hostilities were resumed in the oldest international rivalry in football Wednesday and although billed as a friendly England and Scotland served up a fiercely competitive encounter at Wembley settled by a dream winner from debutant Rickie Lambert. The 31-year-old Southampton striker was summoned off the bench by England manager Roy Hodgson just after the hour mark and within moments had put them 3-2 ahead with a thumping header from a corner. Lambert replaced Manchester United's Wayne Rooney, who has been the subject of continued speculation about his future with Chelsea keen for his signature. Rooney looked short of match practice and had few opportunities to add to his international tally of 36 goals but a near capacity crowd had plenty of action and atmosphere to soak up. The two sides first played in 1872 with Scotland always keen to beat the ""Auld Enemy"" and in particular at Wembley Stadium. Annual matches between the two ended in 1989 but to mark the 150th anniversary of the English Football Association, the fixture was revived as a one-off, the first clash between the teams for 14 years. The thousands of fanatical Scottish fans, who drowned out the home support at times, were celebrating first when James Morrison put them ahead with a dipping shot which deceived England goalkeeper Joe Hart. Theo Walcott soon equalized after racing on to Tom Cleverley's through ball, but Scotland went ahead just after halftime when veteran striker Kenny Miller found space to turn and shoot home. Again the lead was short lived and Manchester United's Danny Welbeck headed England level again. The script was written for Lambert, who had spent much of his early career in the lower leagues, to come on and score a fairytale winner, rising to connect with a pinpoint delivery from Leighton Baines. Lambert might have added to his tally as a later effort thumped the post, but it sent the England fans home happy ahead of crucial World Cup qualification matches next month. ""I've been dreaming of that all my life. It means so much,"" Lambert told ITV Sport. In other key friendlies Wednesday, Paraguay held Germany 3-3 in Kaiserslautern but led 2-0 and 3-2. Miguel Samudio put them ahead for the final time until Lars Bender salvaged a draw for Germany with a 75th minute equalizer. Argentina did not miss Lionel Messi as they edged Italy 2-1 in Rome. Gonzalo Higuain and Ever Banega put them in control with second half goals. Lorenzo Insigne pulled one back late on for the home side. 2014 World Cup hosts Brazil crashed to a 1-0 defeat in Switzerland, a 48th minute own goal from Dani Alves sinking Luiz Felipe Scolari's men in Basel. A Jozy Altidore hat-trick helped the United States to a 4-3 win in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic emulated him as Sweden thumped Norway 4-2. In competitive action, Russia's hopes of World Cup qualification were dented by a 1-0 loss to minnows Northern Ireland in Belfast. Martin Paterson scored the only goal to sink the Fabio Capello's men, who remain two points behind Portugal but with a game in hand. Portugal were playing to a 1-1 friendly draw against the Netherlands with Cristiano Ronaldo grabbing a late equalizer.","England beat Scotland 3-2 in friendly international at Wembley .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Two Iranians detained for years in Iraq by U.S. troops have been freed and are headed home, officials at the Iranian Embassy in Baghdad told CNN on Friday. The release comes as the mothers of three imprisoned American hikers visit their incarcerated children in Iran. The mothers have been imploring the Iranian regime to release them. But Iranian officials said the release of the two in Iraq has no connection to the status of the three hikers. Hikers' moms meet relatives of once-detained Iranians . Ahmed Barazandeh was arrested six years ago by U.S. troops in the Iraqi city of Samarra. He had been traveling from Najaf to Samarra on a religious pilgrimage and was detained after he separated from his group. The second man -- identified by officials at Iran's Baghdad Embassy as Abdullah Maleki and by Iran's Press TV as Ali Abdulmalek -- was arrested by U.S. troops more than two years ago because he was not carrying a passport when he entered Iraq. The U.S. military in Iraq issued a statement saying that a detainee named Ahmad Barazandeh had been transferred to Iraqi control in June 2009 and another named Ali Abdolmaleki had been transferred in October 2009. Barazandeh was captured in March of 2004 and Abdolmaliki in November of 2007, it said. Hassan Kazemi Qomi, Iran's ambassador to Iraq, is quoted by Press TV as saying the abductees were arrested on ""baseless charges and (for) not carrying passports."" The ambassador said both men were on a pilgrimage to Iraqi holy cities when they were seized. The Iraqi government secured their release from a prison controlled by U.S. forces within the framework of a security agreement signed between Baghdad and Washington in 2008. The move could be significant because Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly called for a swap when asked in a newspaper interview in May about the possible release of the hikers. Last week, a French woman arrested in Iran on espionage charges was released and an Iranian who had been in a French prison for 19 years was freed. But it is not known whether that was a swap.","Release comes as 3 mothers seek freedom for their adult children in Iran .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods completed the victory formalities at the WGC-Bridgestone tournament Sunday and immediately turned his attentions to the final major of the season, which starts later this week. Woods has been marooned on 14 majors for five years, but his form in 2013, this was his fifth win of the season and by a resounding seven shots, gives him hope that drought will end by next weekend. He will head for Oak Hill in New York as overwhelming favorite for the PGA Championship and with renewed confidence. ""I'm really looking forward to it,"" he said after completing a final round of level-par 70 on the Firestone Course at Akron, Ohio. ""I feel like my game is pretty consistent and I'm hitting it pretty good."" Woods admitted to adopting a conservative approach to his play on the final day of a tournament he has now won a record eight times. The World No.1 was never threatened with playing partner Henrik Stenson concentrating on his battle for second place. The Swede made a testing two-putt on the final green to also close with a 70 and finish in a share of the runners-up spot with reigning champion Keegan Bradley on eight-under. Woods, who finished on 15-under 265, will be paired with Bradley and Davis Love II for the first two rounds of the PGA Championship on Thursday and Friday. He will be hoping to repeat the sort of heroics which saw him card a joint career best nine-under 61 on Friday to open up a massive lead in the WGC event he has made his own on a course which he said ""fits my eye."" Tapping in for par on the last, Woods was winning his 79th PGA Tour title and 18th WGC crown. Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez and Zach Johnson finished tied for fourth on six-under. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who will be defending his PGA Championship title, was well off the pace again on two-over. Woods, whose last victory at a major came in the 2008 U.S. Open, has flattered to deceive in this season's three to date, with indifferent play on the weekend wrecking his chances. He is chasing the all-time record of 18 by the great Jack Nicklaus.","Tiger Woods wins WGC-Bridgestone Invitational .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams was extended to three sets by one of the next generation of stars hoping to assume her No.1 mantle before advancing to the third round of the WTA event in Cincinnati Wednesday. 19-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard is ranked 62nd in the world but showed enough to suggest she will be aiming higher very soon. She took the opening set 6-4 before Williams turned the match around in her trademark fashion to level a one set apiece. Bouchard, who beat former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic at Wimbledon this year, kept battling but Williams had too much experience to run out a 4-6 6-2 6-2 winner in one hour 47 minutes. Williams is coming off winning the title in Toronto at the weekend as she continues her dominant form on the WTA this season. Only surprise defeats at the Australian Open to Sloane Stephens and at Wimbledon to eventual runner-up Sabine Lisicki have interrupted her winning run and she will be heavy favorite to defend her U.S. Open crown later this month. Fellow American Stephens shocked World No.3 Maria Sharapova Tuesday at the hard court tournament in Ohio where top billing is shared with the ATP event. Serena's older sister Venus Williams' disappointing 2013 season continued as she lost in three sets to world No. 23 Elena Vesnina. Williams missed Wimbledon due to a back injury and has not a WTA title since the Luxembourg Open in 2012. Fifth seed and defending champion Li Na recovered from a slow star to eventually beat American wildcard Lauren Davis 4-6 6-1 6-1, while No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska won 10 games in a row to overcome Uzbekistani-born American Varvara Lepchenko 6-4 6-0. World No.2 Andy Murray got his campaign in Cincinnati off to a winning start with a 6-2 6-3 victory over Mikhail Youzhny of Russia in an earlier match. The Wimbledon champion had lost his third round match at the Montreal Masters last week on his return to the circuit after his historic triumph, but made no mistake here. The 26-year-old Scot broke service five times on his way to victory in just 70 minutes. It extended his career record against Youzhny to 4-0 having beaten him in the fourth round at Wimbledon. Murray has won the Cincinnati trophy twice, beating Novak Djokovic both times in the final. ""I think it's important for me to try to get a few matches this week, if I can,"" Murray told the official ATP Tour website. ""I did what I wanted to do and got through the match."" He was joined in the third round by top seed Novak Djokovic, who beat Juan Monaco of Argentina 7-5 6-2. The Serbian is bidding to complete his set of the nine Masters 1000 titles this week, coming off the back of a semifinal loss to returning Rafael Nadal in Montreal. Twelve-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal is also safely through after a straight-forward 6-2 6-2 defeat of world No. 100 Benjamin Becker. Veteran German Tommy Haas earned a third round match against Roger Federer after beating Marcel Granollers 6-4 6-1 in 74 minutes.","Andy Murray back on form at the Cincinnati Masters .

"(CNN) -- They were living in hell, and Ariel Castro did all he could to make sure they'd never escape it. He tied and chained them up, removed handles from doors and replaced them with padlocks. He rigged entrances to the house with makeshift alarms, threatened them with a gun and fed them only once a day. He covered windows to keep them out of view and sunlight out of their rooms. But Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus focused on the light at the end of the long, dark tunnel. They nurtured the faith that they would one day be free. They clung to each other. They persevered and emerged from years of hell to find new life. In their rare public appearances since, people have expressed surprise over how intact and at times cheerful they appear after all they have been through. Photos: Cleveland's missing women . Frank Ochberg, a pioneer in trauma research who testified in the case Thursday, lauded the three women's survival and coping skills as ""marvelous, compelling examples of resilience."" Ochberg testified when Castro was sentenced to multiple lifetimes behind bars. Resilience. It's that state of mind that allows people to survive natural disasters, wars, the loss of whole families, even torture, and keep on living and eventually, hopefully, thrive. ""It means bouncing back,"" says the American Psychological Association. Knight's ordeal . On Thursday, Knight took a brave step in that direction. She endured Castro's torment the longest. It has been said that, of the three women, she has had the roughest recovery so far. The accounts of the abuse Castro doled out to her were some of the most shocking. Photos: Evidence against Castro . When he made her pregnant, he pounded her belly, the women have said, until she miscarried. He has steadily denied the accusation. She bravely walked into a Cleveland, Ohio, courtroom Thursday to face her tormenter, cast off the shackles of 11 years of his torture and sexual abuse, and wish him a life in hell. Castro kidnapped her in 2002, when she was 21. He tore her away from her little boy, who was age 2 at the time, for what felt like forever. ""Days never got shorter. Days turned into nights. Nights turned into days. Years turned into eternity,"" she sobbed. Would your kids go home with a stranger? As she read her prepared solemn sendoff to Castro, tears drenched her face, filling one handkerchief after the next. But she kept on. She let him know that while he descended into the depths of life in prison, she would emerge from this. ""I spent 11 years in hell, and now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all of this that happened. From this moment on, I will not let you define me or affect who I am."" Taking hold of the situation and defining it for oneself is an important part of resilience, psychologist Rebecca Bailey told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday. Knight and the others are developing ""an understanding that you can move forward past these events,"" she said. They need to, so they can let go. Resilience is ""ordinary"" The strength in the face of their suffering may make Berry, DeJesus and Knight seem exceptional. But most of us are capable of the same spirit, the APA says. Photos: Timeline of the kidnappings . ""Research has shown that resilience is ordinary, not extraordinary."" It points as an example to the large number of Americans who lost loved ones in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and how they rebuilt their lives. ""Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have,"" the APA says. ""It involves behaviors, thoughts and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone."" Some of what Knight said Thursday indicates that the three did that together. Caring relationships . The most important part of resilience is to develop caring relationships, the APA says. In court Thursday, Knight credited DeJesus -- whom she shared a dark room measuring about 7 feet by 11Â½ feet -- for saving her life. ""I never let her fall, and she never let me fall,"" Knight said. ""She nursed me back to health when I was dying from his abuse. My friendship with Gina is the only good thing to come from this situation."" She returned the favor, at a cost to herself. She placed herself in between Castro and DeJesus, taking on physical and sexual abuse herself to protect her friend, Ochberg testified. Being the oldest, Knight often served as doctor, nurse and pediatrician for Berry and her young child. She acted as the midwife, when it was born, delivering Berry's baby in a plastic swimming pool. Look to the future . It is important to see a horrible situation as something you will get out of, the APA says. Somehow, Knight, Berry and DeJesus kept hope. As Knight said, ""We said we'll all get out alive some day and we did."" She has said that she wants to make a life helping others who have been in her situation. She wants them to ""know that there is someone out there to lean on and to talk to."" ""I'm looking forward to my brand new life,"" she said in a statement. Keep processing . The pain does not simply disappear, the APA says. It recommends writing about the feelings and thoughts attached to the trauma. The women kept diaries on their torments. It also recommends spiritual practice. Knight has turned to her belief in God to find comfort. ""Emotional pain and sadness are common in people who have suffered major adversity or trauma in their lives. In fact, the road to resilience is likely to involve considerable emotional distress,"" it advises. ""They have life sentences,"" said Ochberg of the girls' emotional state. ""I think they will -- with the love and support of the whole community -- they have a good chance to live a good life. But that doesn't mean that they'll ever be free of the damage that was done,"" he said. While they're no longer locked up in the hell Castro built for them, it is still inside of them, and they may need to let some of it out. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report .","Ariel Castro wanted his victims to think they could not get away .
They kept believing that they would; they held together and persevered .
For what they've been through, many are surprised how resilient they've been .
Resilience is something most people can develop, psychologists say ."
"(CNN) -- A Kansas City-area man proposed to his girlfriend during a Royals baseball game this week, after she gave him one of her kidneys earlier this year, according to CNN affiliate KSHB. Taesha Benson donated a kidney to Travis Spire-Sweet just before Valentine's Day. Spire-Sweet was born with only 25% of a functioning kidney, and Benson was a perfect match, the station reported. The chances of unrelated people being this close of a match for kidney donation is about 1 in 30,000, according to the University of Kansas Hospital, where the surgery was performed. Every 10 minutes, someone is added to the waiting list for a donated organ, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Some receive the organ they need.

"(CNN) -- With all passengers and crew aboard Asiana Airlines Flight 214 from Seoul now accounted for, air crash investigators are beginning the painstaking search for clues as to why the incident, which killed at least two people, happened. While the sequence of events that led to accident remains unclear, witnesses described hearing a ""boom"" as the Boeing 777 appeared to come in short, touching down heavily on the runway close to the water's edge at San Francisco International Airport before it disappeared in a cloud of smoke. Parts of the aircraft, including its tail section and engines, snapped off as it spun off the tarmac on its belly. Passenger: 'I just crash landed at SFO. I'm ok. Surreal' ""For whatever reason, the pilot did not have enough power available to correct the rate of descent that brought him into contact with the ground before he wanted to be there,"" Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and former airline pilot, told CNN. ""There are a number of other considerations that may or may not have been made clear: One of them has to do with the fact that at least on one other occasion -- with a [Boeing] 777 in London -- they were on approach to land and they also ended up landing short. It's my understanding that it was all because of a fuel situation. For one reason or another, the throttles were moving but the engines were not increasing their thrust. Therefore they landed short of the runway and short of the power they needed to continue with a safe landing."" British Airways Flight 38 from Beijing landed short of the runway at London's Heathrow airport in January 2008 after losing critical power as it prepared to touch down. Fortunately, the pilot was able to partially control the impact, allowing everyone on board to escape serious injury. Investigators believe the incident was caused by ice in the fuel system of the Boeing 777. Their report suggested the aircraft passed through unusually cold air over Siberia as it traveled from the Chinese capital. ""Mechanical things can be present in these airplanes that will make it impossible for the crew to do the things that they know how to do,"" Tilmon added. Todd Curtis, a former Boeing aviation safety engineer, agreed Flight 214's touch down point was far shorter than intended. ""It should never even have been close to hitting the seawall at the edge of the runway like that,"" he said. Curtis said the pilot rather than the computer would have been in control at this point. ""Typically the pilot would be hand-flying the plane right at the final approach. This was a relatively good-weather day. They didn't have to have a full auto-land system in place -- even when you have a lot of automated systems right before touch down, you're going to have the pilots under positive control of the aircraft,"" he said. ""As for why it hit the runway the way it did, or how fast it was, it depends in the weight of the aircraft and other factors. But this is something that has to be discovered through the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder. ""How fast this aircraft was going, both horizontally along the ground and its vertical speed, that may be the critical factor that made it land so short. ""The initial impact was strong enough to cause both horizontal stabilizers and the vertical fin to come off the aircraft. This was major, major structural damage, which made it very difficult to control the aircraft."" Flight data recorders recovered from crash . Curtis said investigators would be keen to speak to the crew as soon as possible. ""Of course we have all sorts of information from the 'black boxes' but the state of mind of the pilots -- why they made the decisions they did prior to landing -- is something that would be very important to know. ""Also, from outward appearances, until the very end of the flight it looks as though things on the flight were normal. One question I would like to ask those pilots is: 'was there anything going on in the minutes or hours leading up to the landing where you were taken off your usual schedule, where you doing things not on the checklist, where you are not following procedures? Was there anything out of place or out of the ordinary?'"" Why crash was survivable .","Witnesses describe hearing a ""boom"" as the flight from Seoul landed short .

"(CNN) -- For more than a month, Garrett Hand and Jamie Neal went off the grid. But new photos of the couple -- who family members had reported missing in Peru -- surfaced online Thursday, posted by officials to prove that the pair were safe and sound, enjoying their South American vacation. A Facebook page for Peru's tourism ministry published several photographs showing the couple smiling and posing with authorities. The U.S. Embassy in Lima also confirmed that Hand and Neal were ""safe and sound."" And Hand's mother released a statement saying she'd spoken with her son. In Facebook posts Wednesday, Hand and Neal assured friends they were alive and well, and wrote they had been out of contact for more than a month because they had been traveling in Amazon villages without electricity, Internet or phone service. Missing since January, U.S. couple found in Peru . The couple, who hail from the San Francisco area, left in November and began a series of social media posts chronicling the trip of their dreams -- a four-month bike adventure through South America. Their online posts stopped in late January, prompting concern from family members. Saying calls to their cell phones had gone unanswered and bank transactions had stopped, relatives told reporters they feared the worst and asked for authorities to help find the couple. On Wednesday, relieved family members told reporters that the travelers were safe and sound. They thanked the Peruvian government, the U.S. Embassy and others for their help. ""I am so happy today that my son is well,"" Francine Fitzgerald, Hand's mother, said in a statement. ""Now our family will have to process all of this, and I think this will take some time. I can't wait to see Garrett and Jamie walking off the plane and into my arms."" Peru is known for the Incan ruins of Machu Picchu, located in the Cusco region, which attract hundreds of thousands of international travelers each year. Some remote areas of the country are out of cell phone and Internet reach. When the couple was spotted traveling in a small boat on a remote jungle river, Peruvian officials said they were clearly enjoying their trip and weren't aware that their families were looking for them. ""These two young people have fallen in love with Peru,"" Jose Luis Silva, Peru's tourism minister, told CNN on Tuesday. ""They have visited off-the-beaten-path places, and it seems like they're having a blast -- so much so that they have forgotten to communicate with their families."" On Wednesday, a post on Neal's Facebook page said that authorities had taken the couple to a military base, where they were fielding questions and being photographed. ""The Peruvian military gave us our own house to stay in,"" she wrote, ""and food and a bunch of booze to drink."" All the attention was ""insane,"" Neal said. ""I may delete my Facebook when I get home.""","NEW: Mother: ""I am so happy today that my son is well""

"(CNN) -- Even after she was cleared of murder, even after returning home to a scenic haven in Seattle, Amanda Knox is crippled with fear. The case that kept her behind bars for four years and hurled her into global notoriety isn't over. At any point, the United States could extradite her back to Italy to face a retrial since her acquittal was overturned in March. During one of her very first interviews as a free woman, Knox tells CNN's Chris Cuomo that her attempt at resuming a normal life has been punctuated by debilitating panic attacks. Knox: 'I'm afraid to go back' to Italy . Admittedly nervous during the interview, she describes one such episode from the past weekend: ""I sit in my hotel room and cry so loud until the security calls the room, because the person next door has heard me crying,"" Knox says, her voice cracking. As she tries to articulate her next thought, Knox suppresses more tears. ""It's really hard for me to talk to people about it. It's like as soon as I allow myself to cry, I can't stop."" The sweeping interview reveals fascinating new details of a story that has been widely reported -- but not in her words. She slams accusations from authorities that she's an apathetic sexual deviant whose behavior led to her roommate's gruesome death. Was she convicted on a story based partly on a gender stereotype? Or is that just an excuse? The subtleties in her interview may uncover some answers. Read an excerpt from Knox's book . Going back to Italy . Knox says she's afraid to return to Italy to face a new trial almost six years after her roommate's death. But she's considering it. ""I don't know yet. It's a really complicated question,"" she tells Cuomo. I mean, I'm afraid to go back there. I don't want to go back into prison."" ""I've been told that in Italy, people think it's arrogant of me to sit here in the United States and have a book come out and defend myself,"" says Knox, who reportedly was paid a $3.8 million advance for her memoir, ""Waiting to be Heard."" ""First of all, I find that incredibly unfair, because I have the right to defend myself. And no one can ask me to just shut up because it's convenient. But at the same time, I want to prove to them that I care about what's going on."" Knox has been criticized for what some perceived as apathy over the death of her study-abroad roommate, Meredith Kercher, in 2007. Kercher, a 21-year-old British exchange student, was found dead, seminaked with her throat slashed, in the Perugia villa she rented with Knox. But Knox says she's been unfairly characterized as cold and aloof after Kercher's death. ""I find it incredible that despite an absolute lack of evidence that connects me to this murder, I am still being judged based upon unrealistic and unreasonable expectations about how a young woman would react to a horrible situation. No one knows how they would react to a horrible situation until it happens to them,"" she says. ""I definitely reacted to what happened to her. And I react to this day. I'm emotional to this day about what happened. But I'm also the type of person who, when there is pressure on me and expectation on me to react, to feel in front of people, I freeze. I would much rather suppress my emotion than have it be determined as insincere and affected."" Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of killing Kercher. Both were acquitted in 2011, but their acquittals were overturned in March. ""As I was going through all of this, when I cried, it was bad. When I didn't cry, it was bad. When I smiled, it was bad. When I didn't smile, it was bad,"" Knox says. "" ... I have been paralyzed by this kind of scrutiny. And I feel like it's unfair."" Will Knox be extradited to Italy? Experts disagree on likelihood . Claims of sexual deviancy . At times, the depictions of Knox in court were as scandalous as plot lines in a made-for-TV movie. ""They were calling me things like violent and whore and deviant. And it's all untrue,"" Knox tells Cuomo. Prosecutors theorized she was involved in some sort of erotic game gone horribly wrong that resulted in the death of her roommate. Knox says such claims were ""a bombardment of falsehood and fantasy."" ""No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, none of the people who knew me there. This is simply coming out of the prosecution,"" she says. ""I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip. I have never done that. I have never taken part in an orgy. Ever."" She says there has been recent discussion ""about how our society latches onto the idea of a violent, sexual woman, how sexuality becomes deviancy, becomes violent"" and how ""the connection between those things is so easily made in comparison to men."" ""I was completely recharacterized as a human being based upon the fact that I was sexually active. And that turned into sexual deviancy. And it was unfair,"" Knox says. ""And I was having to go into the courtroom when the jury and judge were already convinced of a certain idea of what kind of person I was. And there was nothing I could do to respond to it."" Opinion: What Knox can and can't tell us . Implicating an innocent man . Even though she was acquitted of the murder charge, Knox doesn't have a spotless record. After she and Sollecito were detained for questioning in the killing, she allegedly confessed to being at her home when Kercher was killed and implicated Patrick Lumumba, the owner of a bar where she worked. Lumumba was detained but was released after two weeks when his alibi was corroborated: He had spent the night of the murder talking to a customer in his pub in Perugia, police said. Lumumba later sued Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. Knox says her book gives readers insight into what she was thinking in the days and months after Kercher's death. ""I'm aware of the fact that people don't seem to get where I'm coming from when I named Patrick Lumumba, for instance. And I can't excuse it. But I can try to explain it. And that's the only -- the only thing I can do,"" Knox says. Analysis: Knox case is complicated, confusing mess . Her life today . Despite the panic attacks, Knox is trying to get her life back to normal. She's back with a boyfriend whom she knew before she was in Italy. She's going to school and is making up lost time with her family. But she still hasn't reached out to Meredith Kercher's family. Why? ""I know that they think that I'm guilty,"" Knox tells Cuomo. ""... I wish that I had gotten ahold of them much earlier, at the very beginning."" During the interview, Knox's hands appeared to show signs of injuries. She says she was taking self-defense training. ""I've received death threats since I've been home. And I don't ever want to be caught in a situation that Meredith was caught in where someone is able to overpower me because I just don't know what to do,"" Knox says. ""There are not normal people who are fixated on me. And I don't know what they're capable of. I don't."" Her desire, Knox says, is that within five years she will finally feel at ease. ""I hope that I will be definitively found innocent,"" she says. ""I hope that I can reconcile myself with Patrick and Meredith's family."" She worries about a lifetime of answering questions from doubters. ""I really want this to be behind me. I need this. I don't know how long I can hold it together. I don't know how long I can defend myself."" Timeline: Kercher murder case .

"New York (CNN) -- A 10-year-old boy turned the tables and scared off armed intruders who forced their way into his Brooklyn home, according to police. Surveillance video released by police shows someone in the house on Monday afternoon opening the door for a man wearing a FedEx uniform, followed by another man. Police say the two men were armed, and upon making their way into the house, demanded money from the nine people inside. When one of the alleged intruders went upstairs, someone was able to close the door on his arm, making him drop his gun. The boy picked up the gun and fired once, police said. The armed suspect fired back, before both men fled the scene empty-handed. Both bullets missed, and there were no injuries, but the two assailants were still at large Tuesday; the investigation is ongoing. Tuesday, there was a letter on the door of the home asking for reporters to give the residents privacy. ""Many of the victims are minors and are all traumatized on what occurred yesterday. We just want to continue with our daily routines."" CNN's Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","Two armed men try to rob residents in Brooklyn .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A prominent Georgia pastor accused of sexual coercion has canceled plans to attend a pastor installation at a Florida church, a spokeswoman for that church said, ""due to recent developments."" Pastor Eddie Long had planned to travel to Miami for the installation of a new pastor at Sweet Home Missionary Baptist Church this weekend, spokeswoman Beverly Rodrigues said. But four lawsuits filed last week accusing the televangelist of coercing young male church members into having sex with him, changed his plans. ""He was involved in the installation service of our new pastor, Rev. Jeremy Upton,"" Rodrigues said. ""Bishop Long sent us a letter informing us that he would not be attending due to recent developments."" One of Long's accusers said Wednesday said he is praying for the pastor. ""I have no hate for anyone ... I just pray for everyone. Especially the bishop,"" Spencer LeGrande told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB. ""Because he knows the truth."" LeGrande, now 22, of Charlotte, North Carolina, wouldn't discuss details of his lawsuit. The civil action contends Long took LeGrande on trips to Africa and coerced him into a sexual relationship, convincing him it was ""a healthy component of his spiritual life."" LeGrande told WSB he moved back to Charlotte from Atlanta late last year and confided in his family, an ex-girlfriend and a few friends, including a police officer. LeGrande said he decided to come forward with his story after he saw the first two lawsuits filed against Long. ""They said bishop has been accused of something, and my heart dropped,"" LeGrande told the station. ""And that was my time that God told me to release what I had to say."" One of the plaintiffs told Atlanta television station WAGA that he wanted to send a message to Long: ""You are not a man. You are a monster."" ""I cannot get the sound of his voice out of my head, I cannot forget the smell of his cologne and I cannot forget the way that he made me cry many nights when I drove in his cars on the way home,"" Jamal Parris, 23, told a WAGA reporter who traveled to Colorado to interview him. Parris -- a former church employee and personal assistant to Long -- filed one of four lawsuits last week accusing the Baptist televangelist of coercing young male church members into having sex with him. Long's spokesman, Art Franklin, has said that the pastor ""categorically and adamantly denies"" the allegations, adding that they were ""a case of retaliation and a shakedown for money by men with some serious credibility issues."" Long's Attorney Craig Gillen said Wednesday that Long's accusers and their lawyers were unfairly trying the pastor in the media. ""The appropriate place to try lawsuits is in the courtroom,"" Gillen said. ""There are rules on how civil litigation is to take place and how counsel should conduct themselves, we intend to follow those rules."" Speaking from the pulpit of his New Birth Missionary Baptist Church Sunday, Long said he would fight the allegations, but did not address specific accusations. ""I am not the man that has been portrayed on television,"" he told his congregation. Again, on Tuesday night, Long alluded to the lawsuits, telling his congregation that sometimes he has to speak in code and with ""encrypted messages"" that the media would not understand. ""I am not speaking about individuals and all of that,"" he said. ""This is spiritual warfare. And I pray for mercy for all who are involved."" Parris told WAGA that his suffering was real, and he had a message for Long. ""That man cannot look me in the eye and tell me we did not live this pain. While you can sit in front of the church and tell them that you categorically deny it, you can't say that to our face,"" he said. ""And you know this. You are not a man. You are a monster."" Parris' suit accuses Long of manipulating and deceiving him into thinking the sexual acts were a ""healthy component of his spiritual life,"" giving him, money, trips and gifts. It says Parris left the church in late 2009, ""disillusioned, confused and angry about his relationship with Defendant Long."" Parris joined New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in 2001, when he was 14. Long counseled Parris when the latter talked about his strained relationship with his father and got him a job as a summer camp counselor at New Birth, the suit states. ""What you have to understand is this man manipulated us from childhood. This was our father and we loved him,"" Parris told WAGA. The lawsuits accuse Long of using his power and influence within the 25,000-member church to lure young male church members into sexual relationships. The suits allege that the relationships, which began when the men were in their teens, lasted over many months. Long took the young men -- all of them teens at the time -- on trips, including to Kenya, according to the suits. He allegedly enticed the young men with gifts including cars, clothes, jewelry and electronic items. Long engaged in intimate sexual acts with the young men, such as massages, masturbation and oral sex, the lawsuits say. The accusations are particularly controversial because Long, who is married, has preached passionately against homosexuality over the years. ""I've been accused, I'm under attack,"" Long told his suburban Atlanta congregation Sunday. ""I want you to know, as I said earlier, that I am not a perfect man. But this thing, I'm going to fight,"" he said. ""I feel like David against Goliath, but I've got five rocks and I haven't thrown one yet.""","NEW: One young accuser says he is praying for the pastor .

"(CNN) -- Richard Thompson has had three boxed sets devoted to his music. He's been the subject of a tribute album. He's constantly ranked among rock 'n' roll's greatest guitarists and finest songwriters by both the music press and fellow musicians. Richard Thompson says the focus of his career is his live work. Top 40 hits are ""kind of meaningless,"" he said. For all that, the man's highest-charting U.S. album (1996's ""You? Me? Us?"") peaked at No. 97 on Billboard's Top 200 chart, and the number of Top 40 singles he's had stands at exactly zero. What does a legend have to do to get noticed by the mainstream? Thompson, 60, brushes aside such hopes of breakout success. His focus is on live performance, he says in a phone interview. ""I think the focus of what I do is really live work,"" he said. ""And I think if you persist in that, then slowly but surely, through word of mouth, the word gets out. And I continue to grow as a live performer."" Still, for those who want a Thompson primer before seeing him live -- he'll be touring with Loudon Wainwright in the fall -- there's that third boxed set, ""Walking on a Wire: 1968-2009"" (Shout! Factory), which came out recently. The four-disc set compiles some of his best work with his old band Fairport Convention, his ex-wife Linda, and as a solo artist. The amiable Thompson took some time to talk about putting together the new box, remaining outside the fray and what he thinks of ""Rock Band."" The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Were you surprised another boxed set was in the offing? Richard Thompson: This is more of an overview and perhaps a first-time buyers' introduction kind of thing. It's a greatest hits. If there were any hits. (chuckles) CNN: Does that bother you? You've never had, especially in the States, that kind of mainstream, Top 40 success. Thompson: You know, I think that's kind of meaningless. Certainly in the area in which I exist, I don't think you need hits, necessarily -- though having said that, it would have been useful. I think the focus of what I do is really live work. And I think if you persist in that, then slowly but surely, through word of mouth, the word gets out. And I continue to grow as a live performer. More and more people come to shows, which is gratifying. I think the albums serve as a signpost, a reference point, but it's not really the focus. CNN: You've played professionally for more than 40 years. What were your goals when you started with Fairport? Thompson: Probably to survive. ... We turned pro when I was 18. At that age, you don't really think beyond about three months. So we were delighted and thrilled to be kind of earning a living from what we were doing. I think in the back of our minds, we thought, we'll do this for a year or two years, and then it's back to school, back to college and get a real job. And then it lasted for five years, [though] I still thought I'd be going back to school at some point. And then 10 years, 15 -- I'm still looking over my shoulder occasionally in disbelief that I managed to get away with it this long. It actually turned into a career. CNN: There are these themes -- tightropes, carnivals, the ""Wall of Death"" -- that run through your songs. Do you feel like you're on a tightrope? Thompson: I think if you're going to be an artist, you're really supposed to be on the edge of society. Your positions should, by definition, be precarious. It's only when you're out on the rim that you have the best view, that you have the perspective to see what society is. So I suppose I'm kind of referring to that sort of thing. CNN: It's a cliched question, but who or what influenced your music? Thompson: I grew up listening to Scottish music, traditional music, my father's jazz records and my sister's rock 'n' roll records. And in my father's record collection, there were things like French records he brought back from World War II. ... And I listened to other instruments, to do things that people like piano players could do very easily that are quite hard to do on the guitar. So I've always tried to do some of those syncopated things that pianists do on the guitar. Sometimes you need to take things outside of your field, to push the vocabulary of your instrument. ... The more you know about musical history, the richer your possibilities are. And I think the more you look outside your own field of music, the more you're going to discover. CNN: A few years ago, Playboy asked a number of people to put together a list of the ""best songs of the past 1,000 years,"" and you took them seriously, going back to the 11th century. Were you surprised when they rejected the list? Thompson: I think they thought I was taking the piss, as we say in England. That I was irreverent. And perhaps I was. CNN: When anthologies of your work are put together, do you listen and say, ""That's pretty good"" or ""I'd like to do that again""? Thompson: Usually the latter. I don't really like listening to my own recordings that much. One of the reasons is, I perform the songs live, and every night things get slightly differently interpreted. And the version you perform tends to grow away form the recorded version with the passage of time ... in your desire to keep your music fresh. So it's sometimes horrifying [to listen] -- why did I do it so slowly? Or, that's a really lame version. CNN: The game Rock Band is very popular now, with a Beatles edition coming out. Have you tried to play Rock Band? Thompson: (laughs) I haven't tried it, no. I haven't had a chance. I think it might be fun. But I hope some of the people who play these games are actually thinking, ""I've scored so many points in this game, perhaps I should try a real instrument at some point."" So I hope it encourages people to take an interest in music, as opposed to just kind of messing around. ... It's an extraordinary phenomenon. I'd love to have a go. CNN: If you hadn't managed to fool people over the years, what would you have done? Thompson: I really don't know. I think I would have been some kind of dropout. I was such a rebel. ... I'd probably be one of those people who follows festivals around making hand-tooled leather belts or something, living in a caravan. ... Or a landscape gardener or something. I could probably do that.","Richard Thompson hailed by press, musicians as leading guitarist, songwriter .

"(EW.com) -- In a close race that saw each of the top three films swap places between Friday and Sunday, animated smash ""Despicable Me 2"" once again won the weekend at the box office. The $76 million family film from Universal and Illumination Entertainment fell 46 percent from its debut weekend to $44.8 million, pushing its total all the way to $229.2 million after only 12 days. ""Despicable Me 2"" has easily asserted its dominance over Disney's ""Monsters University"" in the last two weekends. Though ""Monsters"" has been in theaters twice as long (it opened June 21), its $237.8 million domestic total is only $8.6 million more than ""Despicable Me 2."" Universal's minion-filled comedy should easily overtake its rival release sometime this week. Worldwide, ""Despicable Me"" is about to surpass ""Monsters University"" as well, as the films have earned $472.4 million and $474.2 million, respectively. In second place, Adam Sandler's first-ever sequel, ""Grown Ups 2,"" opened to a great $42.5 million. The $80 million Sony comedy started off slightly better than its 2010 predecessor, ""Grown Ups,"" which debuted with $40.5 million on the way to a $162 million domestic finish. If estimates hold up, ""Grown Ups 2"" will stand as Sandler's second-best opening ever behind 2005′s ""The Longest Yard,"" which debuted to $47.6 million. Review: ""Grown Ups 2"" Sandler has proven himself to be one of the most consistent box office draws in Hollywood over the last 15 years, during which time he has accrued 12 live-action hits that grossed more than $100 million, as well as the animated winner ""Hotel Transylvania,"" which topped out at $148.3 million. But after back-to-back live-action misfires with 2011′s ""Jack & Jill"" ($74.2 million) and 2012′s ""That's My Boy"" ($36.9 million), many questioned whether Sandler's brand of comedy was still viable at the box office. ""Grown Ups 2's"" impressive debut should mitigate those concerns — and put the comedy on track to become Sandler's 14th $100 million movie. According to Sony, audiences for ""Grown Ups 2"" were 53 percent female (this follows ""White House Down"" and ""World War Z"" — two other films with unexpectedly majority-female audiences), and 54 percent below the age of 25. Crowds surveyed by CinemaScore issued the film a ho-hum ""B"" grade, and critics were largely dismissive. ""Pacific Rim"" opened in third place with $38.3 million, a difficult start for Warner Bros.' $190 million monsters vs. robots adventure, though the best ever debut for director Guillermo del Toro. Headed into the weekend, ""Pacific Rim's"" sales on Fandango were outpacing those of ""World War Z,"" which recently opened with $66.4 million. On Thursday, ""Pacific Rim"" garnered an eye-popping $3.6 million from shows beginning at 7:00 p.m. But the film, like many others that have targeted geeky crowds, proved extremely front-loaded in its box office returns. After a $14.6 million Friday, ""Pacific Rim"" fell 13 percent on Saturday to $12.5 million, and Warner Bros. expects it will fall another 15 percent today to $10.9 million. If the film's domestic total follows the same trajectory as its opening weekend, ""Pacific Rim"" will top out right at $100 million. Review: ""Pacific Rim"" That's why Warner Bros. is depending on strong word of mouth to carry the film financially. ""We've got critics that love it, we've got audiences — male and female — that love it,"" says Dan Fellman, Warner Bros.' president of domestic distribution, who points to ""Pacific Rim's"" encouraging ""A-"" CinemaScore grade from crowds (that were 61 percent male) as a sign that the film may hold up well in weeks to come. ""What we need to do is go aggressively into week two and broaden that audience base. That's our job."" ""Pacific Rim"" fared particularly well in 3-D, which accounted for 50 percent of its opening-weekend gross, the highest ratio all summer (though still a far cry from the 70 percent 3-D shares that were typical in 2009 and 2010). The film also played well in 331 IMAX theaters, where it earned $7.3 million — a full 19 percent of its opening-weekend haul. Internationally, ""Pacific Rim"" scored $53 million from 38 markets this weekend, bringing its global launch to $91.3 million altogether. The film fared best in Korea, where it started with $9.6 million, and Warner Bros. expects it will play well throughout Asia during its run. In fourth place, Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy's buddy cop comedy ""The Heat"" dipped 44 percent to $14 million in its third weekend. The film surpassed the $100 million mark on Friday and has now earned $112.4 million total against a slim $43 million budget. Despite 'The Lone Ranger', Disney will press on with 'branded tentpole strategy' ""The Lone Ranger"" wasn't so lucky. The $225 million Western, which last week stumbled with only $47.9 million in its first five days, plummeted 62 percent in its second weekend to $11.1 million, which gives the film $71.1 million and puts it on pace for a finish below $100 million. Despite ""The Lone Ranger's"" disappointing run, a Disney exec this week said the studio remains committed to a ""branded tentpole strategy."" 1. ""Despicable Me 2"" -- $44.8 million . 2.

Two indie releases also made waves in limited release this weekend. Fox Searchlight's ""The Way Way Back"" expanded into 79 theaters and grossed $1.1 million, giving it a robust $14,051 per theater average — and guaranteeing that more theater owners will want to show the film on their screens soon. ""Fruitvale Station's"" performance was even more impressive. The film, which stars Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old Oakland resident who was detained and shot by a police officer in 2009, earned $377,000 from only seven theaters, yielding a blazing $53,898 average.

"(CNN) -- The death of an 11-year-old boy at a Boone, North Carolina, hotel could have been prevented had police been told that the carbon monoxide that killed him was also to blame for two earlier deaths in the same room, the city's police chief said. Chief Dana Crawford's statement Monday came three days after Watauga County Medical Examiner Brent Hall resigned. It wasn't clear if Hall's resignation on Friday was related to the three deaths in Room 225 of the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza. Daryl Dean Jenkins and his wife, Shirley Mae Jenkins, died on April 16; 11-year-old Jeffrey Williams died on June 8. Hall received an e-mailed copy of the toxicology report on Shirley Mae Jenkins' death from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services on June 1, a spokesman for the state agency said. 5 things to know about carbon monoxide . The report showed an often lethal concentration of carbon monoxide in her blood but did not provide a formal cause of death. The medical examiner did not share the results with police until June 8 -- the same day Williams died, Crawford told CNN in an e-mailed statement. Had police been told of the results sooner, Crawford said, ""I would like to think that we would have contacted our county health department, The Town of Boone Fire Department and the Town of Boone Planning and Inspections Department, at a minimum and tried to find the source of the carbon monoxide entering room 225."" Repeated telephone calls by CNN to Hall on Monday and Tuesday went unanswered. Police had requested the toxicology reports ""weeks before,"" CNN affiliate WSOC-TV reported Friday. According to the Charlotte station, fire investigators traced the carbon monoxide to a pool heater. Ventilation pipes for the pool heater were installed near the heating and air conditioning units for the room where the three people died, Boone police Capt. Andy Le Beau told CNN on Tuesday. Investigators also found holes in the ventilation pipes just below the room, he said. ""The heater itself runs off of natural gas. A byproduct of the pool heater is carbon monoxide. The ventilation system that ventilates the carbon monoxide goes to outside the building, in close proximity to the heating and air conditioning units of 225,"" Le Beau added. ""In addition, there were deficiencies found in the ventilation pipes that were in the ceiling area just below room 225. Carbon monoxide could also get into the room from that method as well."" Search warrant documents show police removed two sections of exhaust pipe for the heater from below the room, WSOC said. CNN's Joe Sutton and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","NEW: Police found holes in ventilation pipes below room where three died, official says .

"(CNN) -- Former tennis star Jennifer Capriati is batting down accusations -- which led a Florida police department to seek an arrest warrant -- that she stalked and punched an ex-boyfriend. An incident occurred on February 14, Valentine's Day, at the Oxygen Health & Wellness gym in North Palm Beach, Florida. A report from that southeastern Florida community's Police Department said the ex-boyfriend claimed Capriati ""started screaming"" at him before punching him ""with a closed fist four times in the chest."" The 28-year-old accuser, Ivan Brannan Jr., said he was eventually able to lock himself in the men's locker room, according to the police report. Four days later, he went to police headquarters and outlined what he said were ""seven other incidents pertaining to Capriati stalking/harassing/following"" him. Brannan said he'd dated the American tennis player from May 2011 to February 2012. North Palm Beach Police subsequently requested an arrest warrant against the 36-year-old Capriati, the department's Aubre Stroud said Saturday. As of that time, no arrest warrant had been issued -- something the state attorney's office would decide. Capriati's camp highlighted this fact, in a statement issued Friday, saying the case ""has not yet been assigned in Palm Beach County and has not been reviewed."" ""The current facts being circulated by Mr. Brannan are an overexaggeration and the police report is one-sided in (his) favor, since they failed to get Ms. Capriati's side of the story,"" said the statement, which was attributed to the ex-tennis player's legal representative. ""We will make sure that Ms. Capriati's side of the story is fully conveyed, and when the truth comes out, she will be vindicated from these charges."" Capriati burst on the tennis scene as a teenager, breaking into the sport's ranking of top 10 players by 14 and advancing to the semifinals of the French Open in 1990. She remained a force on the tour into the early 1990s, highlighted by a gold medal win at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. But Capriati's star status faded the next few years, a time that included widely reported arrests on shoplifting and marijuana possession charges. She remained off the court into the late 1990s. The New York-born tennis player came back strong at the end of the decade, and in 2001 won the Australian Open and the French Open on her way to becoming the world's No. 1 player that year. Another Australian Open title came the following year. The 2004 season was Capriati's last. Eight years later, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.","Police report: Jennifer Capriati had a run-in with an ex-boyfriend at a Florida gym .

"(CNN) -- Actor and director George Clooney testified before Congress on Wednesday about ""a campaign of murder"" under way in Sudan, where villagers run for the hills to hide from bombings on a daily basis. ""What you see is a constant drip of fear,"" Clooney said, a day after returning from a trip in which he and a small team of fellow activists managed to enter one of the most devastated areas, the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan. ""We found children filled with shrapnel, including a 9-year-old boy who had both of his hands blown off,"" Clooney told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Clooney said the attacks are being orchestrated by Sudan's government, led by President Omar al-Bashir, government official Ahmad Harun and Defense Minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein -- the same three men, he said, who previously orchestrated long-documented attacks in Darfur. ""They're all charged with war crimes and are now proving themselves to be the greatest war criminals of this century by far,"" he said. The Sudanese government has denied accusations in the past that it is engaged in such attacks. This month the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Hussein listing 41 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the Darfur region of Sudan. Al-Bashir and Harun are also facing war crimes charges involving Darfur. Clooney is co-founder of the Satellite Sentinel Project, which uses satellite imagery to watch for aerial attacks and troop movements in Sudan and South Sudan, which became a separate country last year. John Prendergast, who created the group with Clooney, is also co-founder of the anti-genocide Enough Project. Both men traveled to South Sudan last week and worked their way across the border and into South Kordofan. Clooney wrote and directed a video about the trip for the Enough Project. It shows people who have had to flee their villages for caves. ""For the first time since the Stone Age, people are living in caves,"" a man identified as a rebel doctor says in the video. ""We left our homes because we were too scared of the attacks by airplanes and rockets,"" says a young woman holding a baby. ""Omar al-Bashir is attacking us."" In the video, Clooney describes the violence as an effort ""to clear people out ethnically because of the color of their skin."" ""It is a campaign of murder and fear and displacement and starvation,"" he told the Senate committee Wednesday. A U.N. report last year said the Sudanese military ""regularly conducted aerial bombardments in the Nuba Mountains, and in several towns and villages populated by the Nuba (people)"" Much of the violence is along ethnic lines and also involves a battle for control of the country's oil supply, which has shut down in the conflict. U.S. officials at the Senate committee hearing Wednesday said there is a looming humanitarian crisis in the region, particularly in troubled areas, including South Kordofan and the Blue Nile region. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, and many have been cut off from food and basic supplies, said Nancy Lindborg of the U.S. development agency USAID, and the Sudanese government has been blocking aid. For those people in areas of South Kordofan controlled by the opposition Sudanese People's Liberation Movement-North -- which has battled the Sudanese army -- the outlook is particularly dire, Lindborg said. ""Current predictions are that up to 250,000 people in those areas now face a serious emergency, which is one step short of famine by the end of April if the violence and the restrictions on humanitarian access continues,"" she said. ""It is imperative to have immediate humanitarian access to all communities affected by conflict in South Kordofan,"" Lindborg said. Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile straddle Sudan and South Sudan's geographical and political lines. The population in these areas has faced ""exclusion, marginalization and discriminatory practices that have resulted in their opposition to the Sudanese government,"" the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said last year. Speaking to CNN in advance of his testimony, Clooney said that in recent weeks, the Satellite Sentinel Project -- which he has previously described as ""anti-genocide paparazzi"" -- managed to capture images of bombs being dropped on civilians, leaving mass graves. Prendergast told CNN that documenting the atrocities under way in Sudan is critical, as is ""building a constituency of people in the United States who care about these issues and will tell President (Barack) Obama and their members of Congress and senators that it matters to them ... that the United States steps up and takes a leading role in helping to resolve these problems."" Clooney said the efforts are getting support from the White House and Congress. ""We're meeting in Congress because the House is trying to pass a bill right now that has a very good chance of passing that has some pretty robust sanctions. We're hoping the Senate will do the same. The truth is, there is a lot of ways to attack this problem. ""One is to do what we did with terrorist groups, which is go after the money, find where the money is. These guys are not buying their weapons with Sudanese pounds. So find their offshore accounts in Malaysia, places like that, and freeze them. ""The other way is to actually work with China, not try to guilt them, but work with them to say, 'Listen, you guys are losing 6% of your oil import right now from the Sudan because they've shut off the oil. Let's work together to find a way to get that oil turned back on by fixing these problems.' "" Speaking to the Senate committee, Clooney pointed out that the Sudan situation is affecting global gas prices. ""What happens in Sudan matters very much to us now economically,"" he said.","NEW: 250,000 could be one step short of famine by the end of April, USAID official says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- John Travolta's lawyer argued a time-stamped photograph and a restaurant receipt show the actor was not in Los Angeles when a massage therapist claims he sexually assaulted him at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ""We found out the dates of the claim, we knew the story was false,"" Travolta lawyer Martin Singer told CNN Wednesday. The federal lawsuit, which includes claims by two men that Travolta groped them while on their massage tables, seeks $2 million in damage for each plaintiff. The lawyer who filed the suit said ""droves"" of potential plaintiffs have been calling him with similar stories, but he must check their evidence before adding them to the case. ""These are people from different resorts from every state from Hawaii, Arizona, Texas, New York where they were there when he was banned or they were assaulted or they claim to be escorts that were hired by Travolta,"" attorney Okorie Okorocha told CNN Wednesday. Okorocha is a young Pasadena lawyer who said much of his practice is focused on going after sexual predators. He said he is not intimidated by the prospect of going against Singer, a veteran lawyer known for aggressive tactics in his representation of ""A-list"" Hollywood clients. ""They ain't got nothing on me,"" said Okorocha. ""I'm the real deal. He stepped into the ring with a gorilla. I am relentless. If you read the reports, if you look at my records, I do not give up on anything."" But Singer came out swinging hard against Okorocha on Wednesday, first questioning the suit's detailed description of the first incident in which Travolta allegedly groped a male massage therapist repeatedly and finally masturbated during the two-hour session in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel on January 16. It claimed Travolta picked up the plaintiff -- identified as John Doe No. 1 -- in a black Lexus SUV and took him to a hotel bungalow where an African-American chef was cooking hamburgers. ""My client doesn't have a black chef, doesn't own an SUV or a Lexus,"" Singer said. ""He drives a sedan."" And he was in New York that day to be fitted for his wardrobe for his film ""Killing Seasons,"" Singer said. He arrived in the city on January 15, a day before the alleged assault in Los Angeles, and remained there at least through the next day, he said. A photograph of Travolta, which Singer said was taken at the New York fitting, bears a digital timestamp of January 16 at 4:30 p.m., although the time zone was not specified. Singer also provided a receipt for a $382 meal at Mr. Chow, a Manhattan restaurant, apparently printed at 11:38 p.m. the same day of the alleged Los Angeles assault. The merchant copy of the receipt does not include a signature. ""My client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m.,"" Okorocha said Wednesday. ""I can get there on horseback to Mr. Chow's in New York in 12 hours. That's not that remarkable."" He noted that Travolta is a licensed pilot with a private jet. Singer's claim that Travolta was on another side of the country and not with John Doe No. 1 will be easy to disprove, Okorocha said. ""In this information age, it's very hard not to leave a digital footprint and travel around and use cell phones and vehicles and computers, rent bungalows at the Beverly Hills Hotel."" The second plaintiff, who claims a similar encounter with Travolta occurred at an Atlanta hotel where he was a staff massage therapist on January 25, was added to the lawsuit Tuesday. Okorocha said the case should be easy to prove because of documentation that was done soon after the incident. ""He tells his boss, the employees all talk about it. There's e-mails going back and forth about the incident."" ""This second 'anonymous' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one,"" Singer said Tuesday. It was ""obvious"" that Okorocha ""checked media reports that my client was in Atlanta working on a movie"" before filing the second claim about an Atlanta incident, he said. ""However, the claim by Doe No. 2 is just as fabricated as the claim by Doe No. 1,"" Singer said. ""Our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims."" Unless Travolta accepts an out-of-court settlement, the actor can expect to testify in public and on camera about the allegations, Okorocha said. ""He's going to have a videotaped deposition with me asking him questions and if he goes to trial he is going be on the witness stand answering my questions,"" Okorocha said. ""That is far more intensive and productive as far as evidence than any police report will ever be."" The plaintiffs are identified in court filings only as John Doe No. 1 from Texas and John Doe No. 2 of Atlanta, a move their lawyer says is allowed by federal law to protect victims. Travolta's lawyers know their names, Okorocha said. Singer said that Okorocha filed his clients anonymously to keep other people from recognizing them and coming forward with evidence against them. Travolta, 58, has been married to actress Kelly Preston for 20 years. The oldest of their three children, Jett, was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas in January 2009. The lawsuit alleges that Travolta called the first plaintiff, who advertises online with ""professionally themed ads,"" to arrange for a massage at $200 an hour. Travolta picked him up at a Beverly Hills address and drove him to the hotel, according to the lawsuit. When they entered the bungalow, Travolta ""shamelessly stripped naked"" in front of a professional chef and the plaintiff, the lawsuit states. ""He wants me to get on the table, can you believe that?"" Travolta told the chef, according to the document. ""For the first hour the massage was without incident, other than he kept purposefully sliding the towel down that covered his buttocks to reveal about half of gluteus area,"" the suit states. The massage therapist repeatedly slid the towel back up 10 times in the first hour, ""reminding Defendant that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage,"" the suit states. When Travolta ""started to rub Plaintiff's leg,"" he ""thought it was accidental,"" it said. Later, however, there was more touching by Travolta ""and this time Plaintiff told Defendant to please not touch him again,"" the complaint said. ""Defendant apologized, but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child,"" it said. The lawsuit then described Travolta allegedly touching and grabbing the massage therapist's penis. ""This was painful and uncomfortable,"" the suit said. Travolta apologized and suggested they ""must have gotten our signals crossed,"" and that he thought that the massage therapist ""wanted the same thing he did,"" it said. ""Defendant then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding."" Travolta then asked him to switch places on the table for a ""reverse massage,"" the lawsuit states. Travolta allegedly offered to perform a sexual act on the therapist. Although the therapist ""felt very afraid for his safety,"" he agreed to stay and continue with the massage after Travolta told him ""OK, I'll behave myself,"" the suit said. Travolta's statement ""gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control,"" the suit said. When he resumed with a deep tissue massage on his shoulders, Travolta told him, ""Say something nice to me,"" it said. Travolta, who allegedly began masturbating, then got up and screamed at the plaintiff ""how selfish he was; that Defendant got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his 'Welcome Back Kotter' days,"" the suit said. Hollywood is controlled by homosexual men ""who expect favors in return for sexual activity,"" the lawsuit document quotes Travolta as saying. ""Defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up,"" it said. The complaint said Travolta told the therapist that ""he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it."" When the therapist refused to take part, Travolta said, ""No problem. I will find new friends,"" the suit said. He then offered to call a ""Hollywood starlet"" who wanted ""three-way sex,"" but ""they needed to have sex together first before calling her, so this way they would be in-sync with each other sexually,"" the suit said. The actor told him he could ""make millions and be famous"" if he lost some weight and adapted to same-sex relations, the suit said. When the therapist threatened to call police if he was not returned to where he was picked up, Travolta drove him back, although calling him ""selfish"" and a ""loser"" on the way, it said. He paid the therapist $800, double the $400 owed for the two hours, the suit said. CNN's Carolyn Sung and Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.","Travolta's lawyer challenges details of the alleged Beverly Hills Hotel incident on January 16 .

"Scottsdale, Arizona (CNN) -- Not too long ago, it seemed this week's meeting of the Republican National Committee in Arizona might be consumed with squabbles about delegate math and anxious hand-wringing over the long and acrimonious presidential primary fight. Instead, it's looking more and more like a Mitt Romney pep rally in the making. With Romney now on a sure path to the nomination thanks to the departure of his top rival, Rick Santorum, GOP leaders from every state will begin gathering Thursday at a posh Scottsdale resort to plot out general election strategy with the former Massachusetts governor as their standard-bearer. Romney will address the meeting of state Republican Party chairmen at a Friday luncheon that is sure to be the event's biggest draw. Later that evening, the presumptive nominee will venture into Phoenix raise money for the joint ""Victory Fund"" he established with the RNC. A minimum donation of $50,000 is being requested. U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona will also speak at the three-day conference, an appearance that one RNC member described as the ""passing of the torch"" from one Republican presidential nominee to the next. CNN Poll: Republicans divided on vice presidential choice . National party officials, stressing their neutrality even though the RNC and Romney campaign aides have already informally started planning their joint efforts for the general election, pointed out that Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul were invited to the summit and will have emissaries here. Both candidates are clinging to their tiny share of delegates and hoping for an upset at the party's convention in August. But most of the Republicans trekking to Arizona for the meeting say that it's time to move on to the next chapter of the campaign. ""It's clear that there is no likely scenario under which Romney will not be the nominee. He has won it,"" said Tennessee National Committeeman John Ryder. ""The committee will be meeting and doing its work, that's the official business,"" Ryder told CNN. ""But I think a major focus of this meeting will be for people to start to come together behind the nominee and get ready for the contest in November."" Saul Anuzis, a national committeeman from Michigan, said the Romney speech on Friday should be a ""rallying point"" for Republicans in Scottsdale. ""This is an opportunity to bring the party together behind Romney and pull everyone toward the general election,"" said Anuzis, who endorsed the former Massachusetts governor early in the primary process. Not every RNC member is ready to fall in line. Some, such as Iowa National Committeeman Steve Scheffler, still harbor suspicions about Romney's conservative convictions and refuse to call him the nominee until he has accumulated the 1,144 delegates needed to secure the nomination. ""If and when he is the nominee, I will support him,"" Scheffler said. ""But he is not the nominee. We are five months away from the convention or roughly that, so I don't think its bad thing for these other candidates to be in the race. Someone needs to hold Romney's feet to the fire on some of these issues."" His reluctance to support Romney was a rarity among the nearly two dozen RNC members and state party chairmen who spoke to CNN about the state of the race. Now that they have their horse in Romney, most said they are excitedly gearing up for the fall election against President Barack Obama. Romney on November showdown: 'It's going to be fun' The RNC, which for decades has been the main vehicle for Republican get-out-the-vote operations in presidential elections, is using the chairmen's meeting to showcase their plans for the race. RNC political aides will brief state party leaders on their national campaign machinery, region by region. New technological initiatives will be unveiled. Committee finance officials will explain how they plan to keep pace with Obama's impressive fundraising muscle and fund the Tampa, Florida, convention. There will be training sessions, speeches from Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a political briefing hosted by GOP pollster Frank Luntz, and plenty of late night margaritas. In the eyes of many RNC members, the Republican primary fight and the heated debates over new delegate rules that allowed the nomination process to drag on for months already seem like distant memories. But they will still meet several times this week to evaluate what worked during the primary battle and what needs to be fixed. ""Having gone through the primary and seen where there were some holes and weaknesses, I think it's mainly the intention of our members to try and strengthen that up so there are fewer questions the next time around,"" said Arizona National Committeeman Bruce Ash, the chairman of the RNC Rules Committee. Members will discuss the possibility of toughening penalties for primary states that violate RNC calendar rules. They will also examine whether to tweak the delegate rules that governed the nomination process and sparked a series of mathematical disputes between Romney, Santorum, Gingrich and Paul. At a meeting of the rules committee scheduled for Thursday, one amendment will be introduced to protect four early voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- from penalties if they decide to move their contest dates without RNC approval. Another proposed amendment would completely scrap the rule that some primary states allocate their delegates proportionally instead of ""winner-take-all,"" a measure that lengthened the 2012 nomination fight by forcing the Republican candidates to hunt for delegates in more states than they did in 2008. Even if the rules committee recommends changes to the 2016 nomination process, those adjustments would not face a formal vote until August, when the full RNC meets ahead of the party's national convention. In the meantime, there is some consensus inside the committee that despite the damage done to Romney's approval ratings among certain key groups such as Hispanics and women, the primary process largely worked as it was supposed to work. ""I think amongst the members, they feel that the proportional rules have been to the benefit of properly vetting the candidates, and they feel that that's a good thing for the process,"" said one influential RNC member who did not want to be named revealing private discussions. Ryder, the committeeman from Tennessee, said the extended primary battle was a boon to Romney. ""It gives his candidacy greater legitimacy than it would have had he been deemed the presumptive nominee after just a few early states in January,"" he said. ""If that had been the result, there would have been a large number of Republican voters who would not have considered him to be a legit nominee. He had to compete. He won some, he lost some. But he won it fair and square.""","Republican National Committee is meeting in Arizona this week .

"Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) -- Choose your adjective: Hardball. Bare-knuckle. Down-and-dirty. South Carolina has a rich and storied history of tough political tactics. There's the stooge third-party candidate allegedly recruited by legendary Republican operative Lee Atwater to deliver anti-Semitic attacks against Democratic congressional candidate Max Heller in 1978 or the shadowy ""push polls"" about black babies that helped undercut Arizona Sen. John McCain's renegade presidential bid here in 2000. It's the fun and easy topic for pundits to chew on when they drop in to the first-in-the-South primary state after frigid tours of duty in Iowa and New Hampshire. But are South Carolina politics as nasty as advertised? Few here question that the state has a permissive political culture that sometimes celebrates mischief and mudslinging. In a Republican-dominated state where primary campaigns tend to be decided more on personality than major differences on issues, ""dirty tricks"" seem to bubble up in South Carolina more frequently than elsewhere. But the reality is that it's been more than a decade since devious tactics like unidentified robocalls or suspicious mailers have derailed a statewide candidacy. ""I think people have become sort of jaundiced about the whole dirty-trick thing,"" said state Sen. Tom Davis. ""They see some of that ambush stuff, and they take it with a giant grain of salt."" The last time an orchestrated sneak attack seriously damaged the fate of a campaign was 2000, when anonymous George W. Bush supporters carried out a sinister assault on McCain's character, questioning his patriotism and the race of his adopted daughter in a wave of anonymous phone calls. But the most recent Republican presidential primary fight in South Carolina told a different story. While there were plenty of shady stunts and headline-grabbers during the 2008 Republican primary -- several of them perpetrated by the Mitt Romney campaign -- none had a major impact. Wesley Donehue, a Romney consultant during the 2008 race in South Carolina, was caught red-handed after creating a Web site called ""Phony Fred"" that impugned then-candidate Fred Thompson's conservative bona fides. The Romney staff in Columbia also had a penchant for dressing up interns in masks and dispatching them to protest at rival events. In one case, when Mike Huckabee was taking fire in late 2007 for his parole record in Arkansas, Romney aides convinced two interns to dress up in prison stripes and protest several Huckabee rallies. The most craven hit actually came against Romney: Just after Christmas 2007, someone sent anonymous postcards to South Carolina mailboxes calling attention to the former Massachusetts governor's Mormon faith. The effort, though, had little impact. Romney was already trending down in the polls when the postcards landed. Ploys like those are a surefire way to generate media attention. But strategists in South Carolina these days wonder if they actually work. In 2010, then-gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley was called a ""raghead"" and subjected to a series of unproven claims that she had committed adultery -- but the attacks backfired and Haley was next to untouchable on her way to the governor's mansion. Though the practice of dirty politics may always have a place in South Carolina -- and might still rear its head in this presidential race -- times have changed since the Atwater era. The harsh attacks that are consuming the primary race as it opens -- Romney is being painted as a corporate raider who fired workers for a better bottom line, and Rick Santorum as a pork-barrel politician extraordinaire -- are neither sneaky nor underhanded. They are straightforward and on the record, delivered straight from the candidate's mouths or in the form of television ads from the campaigns or cash-flush super PACs. Anonymous political attacks, meanwhile, often take the form of YouTube videos or unsourced document dumps to web sites like FITS News, the popular Columbia-based political blog run by Will Folks, the first of two accusers in the Haley affair story. Meanwhile, master practitioners of the so-called ""dark arts"" are no longer the central players in South Carolina's always entertaining political dramas. ""After Lee Atwater died, there was an entire generation of consultants who looked in the mirror every day and said, 'I'm going to be the next Lee Atwater,'"" one South Carolina Republican strategist told CNN. ""And those folks are all moving on and moving out."" One of the Palmetto State's most famous and colorful political tricksters, Rod Shealy, died last year after a long battle with brain cancer. Two renowned political consultants in South Carolina who famously battled on opposite sides of the Bush-McCain trenches in 2000, Warren Tompkins and Richard Quinn, are still kicking. Tompkins works for Romney. Quinn advises former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. Both men still do campaigns and political strategy but now retain side businesses as well, and their rivalry has long since waned. ""We don't have an ax to grind against each other,"" said Tompkins. ""We are too old for that."" There remains a small crop of political operatives who make a living getting inside the heads of rival campaigns. They are largely unknown outside of the political class in Columbia, and they universally refuse to go on the record to discuss their tactics -- for legal reasons, in some cases. And crucially, most of them are sitting on the sidelines in this presidential cycle. ""I am just not being paid to screw with anybody this time,"" one of them told CNN. ""The super PACs are doing that ... It's a shame. I know exactly what I would do to two or three of them."" Political campaigns are now being run by a younger and newer generation of operatives, many of them with no ties to South Carolina other than their candidates. The last three successful gubernatorial races in South Carolina -- Mark Sanford's in 2002 and 2006, and Haley's in 2010 -- were steered by Maryland-based consultant Jon Lerner. And the day-to-day operations of Haley's campaign were managed by Connecticut native Tim Pearson, then a 27-year-old. Pearson, now Haley's chief of staff, argued that storylines about the state's grimy political culture generate media hype but only matter to reporters and the behind-the-times political operatives who talk to them. ""It's a narrative driven by political consultants, for political consultants,"" Pearson told CNN. ""If Nikki's election proved anything, it's that message and a connection with the people matters more than sideshow political nonsense, and that the voters of this state are far smarter than they're given credit for."" Still, McCain's presidential campaign in 2008 demonstrated how easy it is to bait the media into talking about South Carolina's bare-knuckle reputation. In a bid to generate sympathetic coverage about their candidate, McCain aides circulated to reporters a scanned version of an anonymous flier that they claimed to have uncovered in a far corner of the state. The crude-looking flier, which existed only in e-mail form, mocked McCain's prisoner-of-war experience in Vietnam. No one in the media was able to verify that the fliers were distributed to anyone other than journalists. But cable news and the Web were abuzz for several days with stories about how McCain was once again under attack by nefarious forces. It worked: McCain's won the primary and went on to capture the Republican nomination. ""The fact is that the only real dirty trick that happened last time was John McCain claiming there were dirty tricks against John McCain,"" groused one Republican who worked for an opposing campaign at the time.","""Dirty tricks"" seem to bubble up in South Carolina politics more frequently than elsewhere .
But it's been more than a decade since such tactics have derailed a statewide candidacy .

"(CNN) -- Are you tired of Paula Deen? I am. I'm tired of reading about her. I'm tired of talking about her. I'm tired of hearing other people talk about her. I'm tired of people looking for excuses to talk about her. I'm as tired of people who revel in beating her up as I am of people making excuses for her. To be brutally honest, I was tired of her even before she was called out in public for conduct and language detrimental to African-Americans. Yet, like spectators at an over-extended Mixed Martial Arts bout, we seem perversely fixated on Deen's crashing, bruising struggle to stay upright while finding new ways to fall down. Last week, Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Target joined the Food Network and Novo Nordisk (the pharmaceutical company that makes the diabetes medication advertised by the ""Queen of Southern Cuisine"") in cutting their ties with Deen. And, in what some believe to be the most grievous blow of all, Ballantine Books, the Random House subsidiary publishing her latest cookbook, ""Paula Deen's New Testament,"" announced Friday that it was dropping that title from its fall release catalog. The TV and marketing deals were one thing. But the cookbooks? They made up the foundation upon which Deen's empire was built. Judy Smith, the media consultant who inspired the creation of ""Scandal's"" Olivia Pope and has been hired by Deen to orchestrate her recovery, has her work cut out for her -- especially if, as seems likely, we're going to be forced against our collective will to witness what promises to be an excruciating restoration process. Especially if that process is going to be anything resembling that much-hyped ""apology"" on NBC's ""The Today Show"" last week, which culminated with the single most disingenuous use of the verb ""is"" since Bill Clinton's more than a decade ago. Having squirmed my way through that 20-minute segment at least once, I found Deen to be far less contrite than others expected or inferred. Her cast-the-first-stone plea to the audience; her version of the ""black-people-say-that-word-too"" complaint about using the ""N-word,"" her insistence that she wouldn't have fired herself for what she'd said ""a world ago...with a gun to my head."" Watch: The N-word's history: Where did it come from? Some of the comments resonated with regret -- tearful and at times poignant. But it sounded more like regret that she's being put through all this humiliation in the first place. This seemed to be a conversation not with Matt Lauer so much as with the people who were devoted to her in the first place. And indeed, with ongoing litigation by a former employee of Deen's restaurant figuring into the disclosure, no one tuning in that morning should have expected her to admit any wrongdoing on camera. But why didn't he ask Deen about her apparent delight with the notion of preparing a wedding party with a plantation motif complete with an all-black staff of servers? An interviewer might at least have had the right to ask whether she understands that antebellum days mean different things to the collective memory of African-Americans than they do to more sentimental white Southerners. Indeed, asking Deen point-blank, ""Are you a racist?"" was in so many ways the wrong question to ask. (Lauer might have been better off asking a locked basement door to open up.) If she'd been asked, instead, ""What do you think racism is?"" it might have bewildered, even antagonized her more. But it's a question that needed to be posed at some point -- and not just to Paula Deen. For, as is frequently the case when a celebrity is caught making a bigoted or similarly inappropriate remark, the incident gets drummed up as one of those so-called ""teachable moments"" for an America still wrestling with the specter of race, even after it has elected (twice) its first black president. What often happens instead is another dreary star-bashing ritual, an occasion for pillorying public figures caught in an embarrassing act with censure that makes the rest of us feel superior to the offending party. In a media culture ruled by tabloid thinking (if not necessarily by tabloids themselves), it's an exercise in moralizing as opposed to genuine moral examination. Wouldn't it be nice if, for this one time, this kind of story really did cause the rest of us to re-examine and reflect upon our unfinished business regarding race and culture? And to ask ourselves what constitutes racism in our 21st century society? It is true that we no longer have racially separate drinking fountains, rest rooms and train compartments. But it is also true that a disproportionate number of young black people receive far harsher jail sentences (e.g. life with no possibility of parole) than their white counterparts convicted of similar crimes. Is that justice? Or is it a form of racism? Consider ""Central Park Five,"" the recent documentary by Ken and Sarah Burns, about the rush to judgment by police, prosecutors and the New York media against five minority youths convicted of the 1989 rape and assault of a white female jogger. When the verdicts were vacated in 2002 after someone already in prison confessed to the crime, it didn't get nearly the attention as, say, the verbal racial pratfalls of Don Imus, Michael Richards or even Paula Deen. The documentary's theatrical release last fall offered some opportunity for widespread soul searching about racial presumptions. But not much; not, anyway, as much as there should be. It seems, in short, that America is now more inclined to view racism as a lapse in manners instead of a persistent, recurring presence in its soul, one of many unpleasant facts of life that we'd rather not confront directly, unless it allows us to indulge in schadenfreude (defined as pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others-- say, celebrities who misspeak). No matter how the Paula Deen mess shakes itself out, it will likely be just another squalid real-life melodrama that keeps the rest of us from acknowledging one simple truth: Racism won't even begin to erode until people give themselves the time and space to consider who each of is as opposed to what each of us is. Which, granted, is not as catchy as ""I is what I is."" Too bad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: I'm tired of people beating up on Deen and also of those excusing her .
He says we fixate on her disastrous statements, apologies, attempts to right herself .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Chances are, if you're heading to a ball game in South Korea, the screaming fan to your left will be a woman wielding an inflatable tube. More and more female fans are packing the stadiums to cheer on their favorite teams in the Korean Baseball Organization, so much so that next year organizers predict there'll be as many women as men. ""A couple of years ago, men versus women were 60/40. But this year it looks like 55/45. And the number of the female fans is going to be increasing more and more,"" says Nick Choi, a spokesman for the Seoul-based LG Twins. Baseball is the national pastime in South Korea. The league has nine teams that are spread out across the country of roughly 50 million. The atmosphere in the stadiums has been compared to the largest karaoke performance in the world. The bleachers rock as fans chant, sing and hit inflatable tubes together while their teams are up to bat. Seo Yeon-mi, wearing a LG Twins jersey and hat, has been coming to games for 15 years. She and her best friend rarely miss a game. ""I got an annual ticket and I come to almost every home game,"" says Yeon-mi. But when it comes to devoted fans Jay Kim takes the cake. The businesswoman flew home to South Korea during a short holiday break to see her team play. ""I'm a kind of a diehard baseball fan,"" screams Jay Kim, over the din of the stadium. ""I live in Dubai now but I came here for a holiday for two days to watch this baseball game."" Kim Ha-eun is one of the game's newer fans. She decided to go to her first game with her brother and uncle after her father was unable to attend. Ha-eun had watched baseball on the television, but was surprised by what she found. ""I never watched (live) baseball games before and today is the first time watching an actual game and this is just wonderful,"" she says. ""It's really entertaining and watching the cheerleaders dancing is really really cool! I just love it."" It just took one game to hook Ha-eun. She plans on returning to the ballpark soon but this next time with a LG Twins Jersey. So what's behind the increase in female fans? Many people we talked to spoke about the roar and energy of the crowd and the skill of the cheerleaders dancing. Others talked about the play on the field but all agreed on one main reason. ""LG Twins players are very handsome,"" says Choi. ""That is why there are a lot of female fans."" ""All the players are so attractive,"" agrees Kim. The clubs have taken note of the increase in female fans and sell everything from jerseys, hats and headbands to target this growing demographic. They are also trying to keep the energy levels high even when the players aren't on the field. ""We have an organized cheering team,"" says Choi. ""We also provide different activities between each inning like kissing time, beer drinking contests and those kinds of events."" But the teams have also noticed an unexpected twist to this phenomenon. ""If you attract women to the stadium, you attract men as well,"" laughs Choi. ""In Korean culture, whatever a woman wants to do, that is what a man will do.""","Numbers of female fans at South Korean baseball games rising .
Next year, there could be as many women as men in the stands .
Clubs are catering to demand by selling jerseys, hats and headbands .

"(CNN) -- Mo Farah has joined an illustrious list of athletes who have won 5,000 meter and 10,000 meter Olympic gold medals by beating off a late challenge to win the shorter distance race in front of a roaring home crowd. The 29 year-old runner stepped up the pace 600 meters from the end, but then faced an impressive chase down from Ethiopian Dejen Gebremeskel and Kenya's Thomas Longosiwa in the home strait. But he held on to cross the line in 13 minutes 41.66 seconds. ""I'm just amazed - two gold medals, who would have thought that? I got a lot of support from a fantastic crowd and that helped me towards the end"" Farah told BBC TV after the race. His wife is set to give birth to twins anytime soon and he dedicated both victories to them, saying ""they can have one each"". As is typical in his races, the pace set at the start of the race was fairly slow, with U.S. athlete Lopez Lomong leading with a lap time of 1 min 11 seconds. The Ethopian duo of Gebremeskel and Yenew Alamirew then lengthened their strides to pick up the pace, but encouragement came from Farah's American training partner Galen Rupp who helped keep Farah in contention by meeting the Ethiopian's pace. Rupp could not stay with the pack on the final lap and Farah was left to fight his way into the lead and try to hold on, despite tiring heavily in the last couple of meters. The victory comes a week after he took the 10,000m title and the crowd responded to his achievement by chanting his name as he went on a lap of honor which was more pedestrian in pace only because of the number of people that wanted to congratulate him. He is the first British athlete to win both races at the games and only five other men have managed to do the double, Czech Emil Zatopek, Lasse Viren and Hannes Kolehmainen from Finland and Ethiopians Miruts Yifter and Kenenisa Bekele. Farah moved to Great Britain as an eight-year-old from war-torn Somalia where he was born. He lives close to the Olympic Stadium in London, but he moved out to the U.S. last year to enhance his preparations for these games by training with Rupp.","Farah wins the 5000 meters final in a time of 13 minutes 41.66 seconds .

"(CNN) -- The Army sergeant who admitted to gunning down 16 civilians in a 2012 rampage through two villages near his outpost in southern Afghanistan reportedly apologized Thursday, describing the massacre as an ""act of cowardice."" Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty in June to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts. The plea spares the 39-year-old Bales the prospect of a death sentence in the killings. He now faces life in prison, but a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel will decide whether he will have a chance at parole. ""I hid behind a mask of bravado,"" Bales said, according to Drew Mikkelsen of CNN Seattle affiliate KING, who was tweeting from court. Bales reportedly told the jury he took steroids in Afghanistan. He also took pills to help him sleep and drank sporadically, Mikkelsen wrote. When asked who is responsible for what he did, Bales reportedly said: ""I am. I am responsible."" Bales admitted to slipping away from his outpost and going on a house-to-house killing spree in two nearby villages in March 2012, a massacre that further strained ties between American troops and their Afghan allies. His sentencing hearing began this week at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington. Bales testified for about 40 minutes, according to Mikkelsen. Bales reportedly said the killings were an ""act of cowardice"" and apologized to his victims. ""I am sorry ... I murdered their family,"" said Bales, according to Mikkelsen. In addition to the murder counts, Bales pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted murder, seven of assault and the use of illicit steroids and alcohol. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice. Bales is a member of the Army's 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an element of the 2nd Infantry Division. His attorneys have said the service made a mistake in assigning Bales to another combat tour despite evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury suffered during a combat tour in Iraq. CNN's Dana Ford and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales reportedly says he ""hid behind a mask of bravado""

"(CNN) -- Mystery, moonlight and the sounds of bat wings flapping replace electricity and artificial sound during a night ""off the grid"" in nature. Be it a safari through the endangered red wolf's habitat or stargazing from the highest mountain range in the United States, nighttime is the right time for outdoor adventures in national wildlife refuges and national parks. Here are five places hosting nocturnal events from now through mid-December. Howling safari night hikes . It is estimated that there are 110 to 120 red wolves left on Earth, according to the Red Wolf Recovery Program. The best chance to hear them is during Howling Safari night hikes at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in East Lake, North Carolina. When: The hikes are every Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. through the end of August. There are also hikes on October 12, November 16 and December 7. Be sure to check the website as the hike times change after August. Fall hikes offer the same red wolf program as Howling Safari hikes, and cooler temperatures and fall's season increase wolf activity. Where: Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge is on the Outer Banks, about a 20 minute drive from Manteo on Roanoke Island and about a three hour drive from Raleigh. If you go: The hike costs $7 per person and children 11 and younger are free. Hikers should bring a flashlight and bug repellant and gather at the Creef Cut Wildlife Trail. The hikes last about two hours and pets are not allowed. For more information, call 252-216-9464. Scorpion hunts . Nights in the Nevada desert belong to scorpions and coyotes. Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge and Moapa Valley National Wildlife Refuge are hosting night hike scorpion hunts. When: Pahranagat's night hike scorpion hunt is on September 7 at 8 p.m. and Moapa Valley's is on September 14 at 8 p.m. Where: Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge is about an hour and a half north of Las Vegas, and Moapa Valley National Wildlife Refuge is about an hour northeast of Las Vegas. If you go: RSVPs must be made to Timothy_Parker@fws.gov. There is no cost to attend, and all ages are welcome. Staff will provide ultraviolet flashlights to search for scorpions. Rocky Mountain stargazing . With the ongoing discoveries of new stars, planets and constellations, Rocky Mountain National Park's 7,000-feet and higher elevations make it one of the best places in the Western Hemisphere for weekend warrior astronomers to stargaze. When: There are program options for people staying near the east and west side of the park, which are a about two hours apart. ""Astronomy in the Park"" and ""Celestial Wilderness"" are similar events. Park rangers and local astronomers conduct a 30-minute program followed by sky-viewing. ""Astronomy in the Park"" takes place on the east side. It starts at 8 p.m. on August 9 and 30 at the end of Upper Beaver Meadows Road. ""Celestial Wilderness"" takes place on the west side of the park. It starts at 8:45 p.m. on August 3 and 10 at the Harbison Meadow parking area. ""Stories behind the Moon and Stars"" starts at 8 p.m. August 2 and 18 at the Estes Park Memorial Observatory, 1600 Manford Avenue. Guests can learn about the constellations, tour the Milky Way and gaze at the moon against a backdrop of local storytelling. Where: The east entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park is about an hour and 15 minutes west of Fort Collins and two hours northwest of Denver. Estes Park Memorial Observatory is about 15 minutes east of Rocky Mountain National Park. If you go: The programs are free, but park admission is $20 per vehicle. The pass is valid for seven days. Visitors are encouraged to dress in warm clothes, bring a flashlight and binoculars. For more information, call 970-586-1206. Full-moon hiking . Bryce Canyon National Park is home to hoodoos, those oddly shaped rock formations created by millions of years of erosion. The vistas are beautiful during the day, but the park also offers the chance to view them under the expanse of a Western night sky during full-moon hikes. When: Hikes are scheduled each month now through December. Admission to the park is $25 per vehicle and $12 for individuals (bicycles, motorcycles and hikers) and is valid for seven days. Tickets for the hikes are free and distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. In-person sign-up begins at 8 a.m. (the line starts forming at 7 a.m.) at the visitor center on the day of the hike. Attendance is capped at 30 people per hike. Where: Bryce Canyon National Park is in south-central Utah. The closest cities with major airports are Provo, about a three and a half-hour drive, and Las Vegas, Nevada, about four hours. While you're in the area, check out Zion National Park, which is less than two hours southwest; Grand Canyon National Park, which is five hours southwest. And Canyonlands National Park, which is five hours northeast. If you go: The hikes are between one and two miles. Lug traction footwear is required and must be presented when signing up for tickets. Waterproof hiking boots are required during the winter. Also be sure to bring drinking water and a jacket. Flashlights are not allowed. Rangers may allow flash photography with certain restrictions. Children 5 or younger are not permitted. Bat watching . The cave at Carlsbad Caverns National Park is a part-time home to Brazilian free-tailed bats. The bats swirl out of the cave just before dusk to hunt and return gorged with food before dawn. The park hosts nightly bat watches in the Bat Flight Amphitheater. Before the bats fly, park rangers give an interpretative program explaining why bats use the cave as a place to raise pups. When: Programs take place between mid-April and late October, depending on when the bats migrate to and from Mexico. Carlsbad Caverns' bat population varies, but the best times to view them are generally in July and August. Where: Carlsbad Caverns National Park is in the southeast corner of New Mexico, about a two and a half hour drive east of El Paso, Texas, and two hours south of Roswell. The programs are held at the Bat Flight Amphitheater, which is in front of the Carlsbad Cavern opening. Start times vary with changing daylight times in the spring, summer and early fall. Call the Bat Flight information line 575-785-3012 for updates on start times. There is no cost to attend. If you go: There is wheelchair access to the amphitheater. Use of cameras, including video and cell phones, is prohibited as the flashes and sounds can disturb these wild animals. Pets are not allowed.","Night events are scheduled in national parks and wildlife refuges through December .

"(CNN) -- It has been a project of celestial proportions, but it's finally ready. Construction workers have labored nonstop for months. Their mission? To build an altar worthy of a pope and an outdoor venue that can accommodate as many as 700,000 people. The altar where Pope Benedict XVI will celebrate Mass on Sunday is located at Bicentennial Park in Mexico's Guanajuato state, the heartland of Mexican Catholicism. Guanajuato has the highest percentage of Catholics in Mexico at well over 90 percent. Benedict is expected to arrive at 4:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET) Friday at Guanajuato's International Airport. The nation's Catholics have been waiting for a papal visit since Joseph Ratzinger was elevated to the papacy in 2005. President Felipe Calderon invited the pontiff to Mexico when they met in Vatican City in 2007 and then again in May of last year when Juan Diego, a Mexican Indian, was canonized. Juan Diego is said to have witnessed the apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe in 1531 in what is now Mexico City. Jorge Raul Villegas, spokesman at the Leon Archdiocese, which is hosting the papal visit, said church officials are expecting hundreds of thousands of parishioners. ""We have already received people from states throughout Mexico and also from other countries, North and South America. We've had requests from people with an open spirit and anxious to meet Pope Benedict,"" Villegas said. Guanajuato state officials said the government has spent nearly $11 million preparing for the visit. The Mexican Catholic Church hired Jesus Guerrero Santos, a renowned Mexican artist from the state of Jalisco, to design the altar to be used at the Mass. Guerrero Santos has been working for months to create the symbolic artwork to celebrate the occasion. In his workshop he said he's using nickel silver and ceramics as raw materials for the altar. The money also has been used on beautification projects, multiple billboards that herald the special celebration and infrastructure improvements. Mariachi bands have also been hired to serenade the pontiff at his arrival. Rogelio Martinez Caballero, a director at Bicentennial Park, says much planning has gone into preparing for the arrival of the pope. ""We are coordinating at the three levels of governments and security with the presidential guard,"" Martinez said. ""We're also coordinating with the surrounding municipalities to have strategic points under control with the help of civil protection authorities and the Red Cross as well."" Even the drug cartels have promised to cooperate, officials say, hanging banners pledging to ""keep the peace"" for the pontiff's stay. The pope's visit will be a blessing for Mexico in more ways than one. The Mexican National Confederation of Tourism estimates that 540,000 people -- in addition to the locals who will attend the Mass -- will travel to Guanajuato. Visitors will spend roughly $80 million in meals, transportation, shopping and lodging, according to the confederation. Tourism officials hope the papal visit will put Guanajuato state on the map. The capital of the state, also called Guanajuato, has long been admired for its rich history and colonial architecture. The pope will leave Mexico Monday for Cuba, where his three-day trip will include two large public Masses. A spokesman for the White House National Security Council accused Cuban authorities Monday of using ""tactics of intimidation and harassment to stifle peaceful dissent"" as the pope's visit nears, following arrests of dissidents and demonstrators. CNN en espanolÂ¹s Krupskaia Alis in Guanajuato contributed to this report .","NEW: Pope Benedict XVI is due to arrive in Mexico's Guanajuato state Friday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- Nicknamed Gunkanjima, or Battleship Island, because of its shape, Hashima island has an eerie, sinister look, perfect for, say, a villain's lair in an action movie. The inspiration for villain Raoul Silva's deserted hideout in the James Bond movie ""Skyfall,"" the island figures in one of the most dramatic shots of the film. Its industrial ruins loom slowly into view as Bond and yet another ill-fated Bond girl speed toward the island in a luxury boat. In real life, a trip to the island is less dramatic. In 2009, tour operators began offering trips from Nagasaki to Hashima. A standard trip entails a 40-minute boat ride and then an hour on the island, depending on weather conditions -- often the weather is so poor that boats don't even try to land. Those hoping to pick their way through the rubble in Bond's footsteps, or take a photo at building number 65, where Bond babe Severine meets a gruesome end, will be disappointed. The tourist route is a clearly defined path skirting just a quarter of the island. While there's a good view of the ruins, visitors can't get anywhere close. For that they need special permission from the Nagasaki City Council, and a compelling reason for going inside. There's a simple explanation for all the security -- the ruins are extremely dangerous. Read more: Hashima Island's wartime past . Boom and bust history . For almost 100 years, Hashima was a mining facility run by corporate giant Mitsubishi. The mining community was housed in some of Japan's and the world's earliest concrete high-rises. On this tiny 16-acre plot of land, high-rises were the best option for housing. By 1959, the island was one of the most densely populated places on earth, with 5,259 people living on just 18 acres. But by 1974, gas had replaced coal as Japan's major fuel source, Mitsubishi pulled out of the island, workers found jobs elsewhere and Hashima was left to rot. According to the Nagasaki City Council, location scouts from Skyfall's production team spent several days on the island but decided it was too dangerous to film there. Instead, sets duplicating Hashima's eerie wreckage were built in Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom. Security for visitors . Visitors who are given permission must wear hard hats and have an escort from Nagasaki's city council. Additional caution is necessary -- balconies and railings are long gone and a wrong turn up the ""stairway to hell"" to the rooftop can lead the unwary visitor to narrow pathways between buildings with perilous drops on either side. Those who think they remember the way down from a climb to the top of the structure -- a small, wind-blown shrine remains there -- can find themselves in rooms with gaping holes in the floorboards and sheer drops to floors below. Ghost town . Although Hashima was by no means abandoned overnight, it feels as though it might have been. In the school, exercise books and broken abacuses lie in corners where sea winds have blown them. Sheets of X-rays scatter the floor in the hospital, with faded imprints of miners' lungs still visible. Children's shoes dot ruined pathways, as though their owners lost them while running to evacuate. It feels a bit like Pripyat, the town adjoining Chernobyl, where residents really did leave in a hurry after the town's nuclear reactor exploded in 1986. Weird stories . There are plenty of tales of weirdness surrounding everyday life on the island. A guide who works at Gunkanjima Concierge, Tomoji Kobata is one of the three tour operators who lead trips to the island. Although Kobata lived on the island for only a year in 1961, he's full of stories. From the water, he points out spots where lovers would climb onto the island walls to watch the sunset, seeking out the smallest bit of privacy in a place where privacy was a rarity. ""It reminded me of Hong Kong,"" he says. ""Cooking hours were quite noisy. Wives would borrow seasoning and exchange food they couldn't eat. ""No one would lock the door. There was an old woman called 'Watchdog' who checked on everyone who came in and out and would know everyone's business."" Kobata also talks about the darker side of Hashima's past. Before and during World War II, Hashima, like many industrial sites in Japan, was a location for forced labor. Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were kept here, enduring varying degrees of hardship. Conditions in the mines were grueling. Workers were subjected to heat and humidity with very little to eat and beatings if they slacked. According to local records, 123 Koreans and 15 Chinese died on the island between 1925 and 1945. Hashima is one of several industrial sites awaiting inclusion on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. South Korea, however, has formally objected to the island's petition for recognition due to its association with wartime slave laborers. See also: 'Slave trade ghost town': The dark history of Bunce Island . Former Chinese laborers are still trying to gain compensation and an official apology from Mitsubishi for their enslavement at sites across the empire during World War II. To Japan's neighbors, the island, in its ruined eeriness, is a symbol of a war wound that won't heal. To most Japanese, it's a decaying remnant from a forgotten time.","Japan's abandoned Hashima Island was the inspiration for the villain's lair in ""Skyfall""

"(CNN) -- While commentators have been impressed by John Kerry's single-mindedness in bringing Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, most are quite pessimistic about the prospect of reaching an agreement. One strong reason for this pessimism is Benjamin Netanyahu's basic worldview that he has held consistently since the 1980s. Netanyahu believes Israel is at the forefront of the clash of civilizations between the West and Islam, and that the Arab world has not come to terms with Israel's existence. He thinks that the international community's focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is shortsighted and wrongheaded. Netanyahu also believes Israel's retreat to the 1967 borders will not solve the core issue. Israel will continue to be surrounded by a civilization that intends to erase Israel in the long run, his thinking goes, but it will lose strategic depth and be exposed to rocket attacks on its population centers. Israel's prime minister is a man with a dark world view that is guided by fears and suspicion. But not all of his fears can be dismissed as simple paranoia; indeed some are based on historical precedents and have been corroborated to an extent by recent events. While the Western world has understandably focused on the carnage Bashar al-Assad is inflicting on Syria's civil population, it has often disregarded the fact that many of the rebels are fundamentalist jihadists, and that Israel might find itself in a very difficult situation if these groups gain control over the border between Syria and Israel. Similarly radical jihadists have infiltrated the Sinai and attacked Israel during the past year. But Israel's true nightmare is that Jordan, already shaky, may at some point fall. If jihadists strengthen their foothold in the West Bank, it's not inconceivable the territory could fall into the hands of Hamas. Israel could be faced with rockets stationed no more than twenty kilometers from its population centers around Tel Aviv -- rockets that have already been used to attack Israel both from Gaza and Lebanon. If this is Netanyahu's basic worldview, are we to expect nothing but another round of foot-dragging in the hope that the Palestinians will at some point leave the negotiations, presumably because Israel doesn't stop building new settlements? Is this round of talk nothing but make-believe to appease the U.S.? There are reasons to think that Netanyahu has realized that Israel's occupation of the West Bank is untenable for Israel in the long run. The European Union's recent guidelines that forbid any sort of cooperation with Israeli organizations and companies from the West Bank bode darkly and open the possibility for wider sanctions against Israel. The EU funds Israel's research massively, and is Israel's largest trading partner. Before these guidelines were published Netanyahu met with a delegation of leading Israeli businesspeople, some of them close friends of his, who warned him of the dire economic consequences of Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank. Netanyahu is probably coming to the conclusion that Israel's economy cannot continue to flourish while Israel is antagonizing the free world with the occupation. Problems loom large with America, too. Netanyahu's view has always been that he understands the U.S. inside out -- that the liberal elites of the East and West coasts do not represent the real America, and that at heart the U.S. will stand behind Israel not matter what. He also believed that he could manipulate U.S. political opinion and make sure Israel's interests would be safeguarded under all circumstances. But Netanyahu's wisdom has already taken a big hit. His political guru, Arthur Finkelstein, had assured him that Mitt Romney would trounce Barack Obama at the 2012 elections, and that obviously turned out to be wrong. The U.S. security establishment has also made clear a number of times that Israel's occupation of the West Bank is a serious strategic liability for the U.S., because it has become a symbol for the Islamic world's grievances against the West. Ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is therefore a major strategic interest for the U.S. Does this mean then that the coming nine months will lead to a peace agreement with the Palestinians? I want to hope so, because I am convinced that striving for the two-state solution is in Israel's vital political, strategic and moral interest, but I am pessimistic. Netanyahu lacks a political base for a peace agreement. His Likud Party has moved substantially to the right and a majority of its Knesset members oppose a Palestinian state. Furthermore, any viable agreement with the Palestinians would require uprooting between eighty and one hundred thousand settlers from their homes. The settlers have proven for decades how much political clout they have, and many Israelis look up to them as today's true Zionists. Netanyahu is loath to confront them head-on because they are his political allies, and because in his heart he ultimately identifies with their cause. Adding to these challenges is the fact Netanyahu is temperamentally risk-averse -- another factor which substantially lowers the odds that we are on the verge of peace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carlo Strenger.","Many are pessimistic about the outcome of the Mideast peace talks, writes Carlo Strenger .

"LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- Paul Stanley, a singer and guitarist with rock band Kiss, was forced to pull out of a show in California on Friday after his heart started beating at more than twice the normal level, he said on his Web site. Paul Stanley, pictured here  in April, co-founded Kiss with Gene Simmons in New York in 1973. The apparent tachycardia happened while the band was rehearsing for a performance at a casino in San Jacinto, California, about 90 miles (145 km) east of Los Angeles. ""My heart spontaneously jumped to 190 plus beats per minute, where it stayed for over an hour necessitating paramedics to start an IV and give me a shot to momentarily stop my heart and get it into a normal pattern,"" Stanley, 55, wrote on his site www.paulstanley.com. A normal heart rate at rest is about 60 to 80 beats a minute, according to the American Heart Association. Tachycardia, or rapid heart rate, can cause palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting or near fainting, the group said on its Web site www.americanheart.org. Stanley said he was advised performing would be risky, and the show went on without him. Fellow principal Gene Simmons told fans the group would play as a trio, and turned the show into a tribute to his ailing bandmate. A call to Kiss manager Doc McGhee for an update on Stanley's condition was not immediately returned late on Saturday. Stanley, born Stanley Eisen, and Simmons co-founded Kiss in New York City in 1973. Adored by fans, despised by critics, the group made a name for itself performing in white face make-up and ghoulish costumes. Hits during its heyday included such anthems of teen rebellion as ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" and ""Shout It Out Loud."" Stanley released a solo album last year. E-mail to a friend .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- We are seeing the deadliest sectarian violence in Iraq since 2008 and that is causing major setbacks for Baghdad's aspiration to challenge Saudi Arabia as the top oil producer. The latest figures from Iraq's ministry of energy illustrate the direct link between the violence and the country's oil output. In May, monthly production hit nearly 77 million barrels in the two major regions Basra and Kirkuk. That sunk, the ministry said, to fewer than 70 million in June as daily production tumbled to less than three million barrels a day. According to the U.N., the death toll jumped from 595 killed in April to 963 in May -- and more than 1,000 were killed in July. This is a quick turn of fortunes after Iraq surpassed neighboring Iran as the second largest oil producer within OPEC last year, hitting a peak of 3.4 million according to Standard Chartered Bank in its latest report on the country. A couple of years ago, Iraq said it would achieve daily production of 12 million barrels a day by 2020. The ministry lowered those expectations to nine million and strategists say that remains ambitious. One would think that Iraq would do everything to guard its prized facilities. Pipelines have been attacked, some fields missed production targets, and the cost of production has risen. The inability to protect those fields suggests that the general security situation is worse than expected in many corners of the country. But this goes well beyond sectarian violence and the Sunni-Shiite divide that has wracked this country for the past decade. The central government, under Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, opted to take a tough line when putting up giant fields for auction in the last few years. Instead of production sharing agreements (PSAs as they are known) when international oil producers take a percentage of each field, Baghdad went with service contracts -- paying companies only for services such as workers and technical advice. Oil executives suggest that earns them well below $5 a barrel, when North Sea Brent is trading well above $100, and where it has been for a record three years running. With little upside potential in those fields, there is little appetite for risk either on the production side or when it comes to security -- hence the challenges we are seeing as the violence stretches into a fourth month. While this is a tricky country to navigate as the situation grows more uncertain, it is fair to say the oil majors don't want to be shut out of this market longer term. Emerging market oil producers have taken the same view -- both the Chinese and Russian producers have been active on the ground, as well regional players from the Middle East. Majid Jafar, CEO of Sharjah based Crescent Petroleum in the UAE, says the current level of Iraq's proven oil reserves -- 141 billion -- may be too conservative. ""I for one think once they are fully explored they could even be higher than Saudi Arabia, number 1,"" Jafar said when we toured his natural gas facility in the Kurdistan region earlier this year. That is saying a great deal, since OPEC pegged the kingdom's reserves at 265 billion barrels in 2012. ""The issue is how to develop those reserves and that is where the challenge lays. There are infrastructure issues, security issues in other parts of the country but the big challenge is policy,"" said Jafar. A major policy roadblock remains a national oil law which will govern how revenues are carved up throughout the country. Crescent Petroleum took an early risk to go back into Iraq in 2007, but did so in the Kurdish region where the investment laws and production sharing agreements are in place. Iraq is earning over $90 billion a year at current production levels, nearly matching the budget for the central government. The problem, those who follow the country suggest, is not enough is going back into building a first class network for distribution. Read more: Who's behind the bloodshed?

"(CNN) -- New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez had a ""consulting relationship"" with a Florida anti-aging clinic accused of providing banned drugs to baseball players, but there's no evidence he did anything to violate baseball's Joint Drug Agreement, one of his attorneys told CNN Monday. Rodriguez is appealing a 211-game suspension that Major League Baseball levied against him this month, with the league accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs and having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis clinic. Attorney Joe Tacopina said Rodriguez was one of many athletes who consulted for Biogenesis. ""Clearly there was a relationship -- a consulting relationship,"" Tacopina said. ""I mean, Biogenesis, that lab has consulted with many professional athletes. Not every single one of those athletes has been accused of or found guilty of using illegal substances."" Fast Facts: Performance Enhancing Drugs in sports . Tacopina declined to give further details about the relationship, citing confidentiality concerns. But he said, ""They have no scientific evidence to prove that Alex Rodriguez did anything to violate"" baseball's drug agreement. ""It's witness testimony from one witness -- a witness who's not going to be available, in my prediction, to either testify in arbitration or at some federal proceeding,"" he said. Opinion: How A-Rod let us down . When asked why he wouldn't say unequivocally that Rodriguez didn't use performance-enhancing drugs, Tacopina again cited confidentiality considerations. ""If I utter those words, I've just violated the confidentiality clause of the JDA -- that's the bottom line,"" he said. ""... If you're a supporter or a detractor, what happened to him is not fair by anyone's standards. It's clearly a vendetta, it's clearly a witch hunt to get him 211 games -- not justifiable under anyone's scenario that is being objective."" Alex Rodriguez: 'I'm fighting for my life' Apparently in response to comments like these, Rob Manfred, Major League Baseball's executive vice president of economics and league affairs, sent Tacopina a letter on Monday, offering to waive confidentiality provisions. ""While we believe that your public comments are already in breach of the confidentiality provisions of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program (the ""Program""), we will agree to waive those provisions as they apply to both Rodriguez and the Office of Commissioner of Baseball with respect to Rodriguez's entire history under the Program, including, but not limited to, his testing history, test results, violations of the Program, and all information and evidence relating to Rodriguez's treatment by Anthony Bosch, Anthony Galea and Victor Conte,"" he wrote.

"(CNN) -- Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius will be served with an indictment in court next week following the completion of the investigation into the killing of his girlfriend, South African police said. Following his court appearance Monday, the case is likely to be postponed while the prosecution and defense agree on a trial date, police said in a statement. Pistorius has already been charged with premeditated murder over the February shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. August 19 -- when he appears in court -- would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his home. He says he mistook her for a home invader. The police investigation team ""is convinced that the accused has a charge to answer,"" the police statement said.

"(CNN) -- A Scottish and an Irish woman arrested in Peru on suspicion of drug trafficking are expected to appear before a judge Wednesday. Melissa Reid, 19, from Scotland, and Michaella McCollum, 20, from Ireland, were arrested by Peruvian national police at Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima on August 6. They were stopped as they tried to board an Air Europa flight from Lima to Madrid after authorities allegedly found 11.59 kilograms (25.5 pounds) of cocaine in their luggage. Their final destination was Palma de Mallorca. The cocaine was found inside pouches of oatmeal and dehydrated foods. ""I was forced to take these bags in my luggage,"" Reid said in video footage of the police interrogation. McCollum's family issued a statement Tuesday saying that they stand behind their daughter and are making arrangements to go to Peru. ""Michaella's family are obviously shocked and distressed by the recent events but are confident that Michaella will be exonerated,"" family attorney Peter Madden said. According to police, the pair were contacted by a Colombian named ""Enrique"" in Palma de Mallorca through a tourism company that flew them to Lima and then to Machu Picchu. But the tourism was cover for a plan to smuggle the drugs, police said. Archbishop of Lima Sean Walsh, an Irish-American bishop who's been in Peru for seven years, said he met briefly with the young women in the police cell where they are being held. He said the two are in good condition, are eating well, have clean clothing and are receiving good care. Walsh dismissed media reports suggesting they are not being treated well and that one of the women is on a hunger strike. Reid and McCollum are expected to appear before a judge Wednesday, he said. The Ministry of Justice normally has an official translator present, said Walsh, who often visits foreigners held in jail in Lima. While he was visiting the women, a prosecutor entered and told them that they needed to cooperate as fully as possible, Walsh said. He expects to see the pair again Wednesday evening, he added. Walsh is not aware whether they have an attorney. The court system in Peru provides a public defender, but they may try to hire private defense lawyers, he added. Peru is now the world's top cultivator of coca, the plant whose leaves are used to produce cocaine. It overtook Colombia for the dubious honor.","The two women ages 19 and 20 were arrested at an airport in Lima .

"(CNN) -- In the halcyon days of space exploration, when the USSR was sending the very first satellites into orbit, and Neil Armstrong was about to take his first (small) steps on the moon, NASA's finances accounted for a staggering 4.41% of the US federal budget. In the last two years, that figure has dropped below 0.50% for the first time since 1960, and with the long, slow decline in funding has come an equally steady slide in the US government's appetite for space exploration. Two years ago, many commentators were proclaiming the end of the space age. The contention seemed hard to dispute: in 2011, NASA's Space Shuttle program was permanently retired when the Atlantis touched down to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, after completing its final voyage. Around the same time, plans for a U.S.-manned mission to Mars were shelved, and steps were put in place to decommission the International Space Station. But as governmental funds have dried up, amateur space enthusiasts around the world are reviving humanity's interplanetary dreams through crowd-researched and crowd-funded space projects of their own. The idea of crowd funding, where a large number of individuals pledge a small amount of cash towards a big project, may not be new, but it has been given a new lease on life through websites such as Kickstarter, which help people with innovative ideas reach a global audience. To date, Kickstarter has helped fund films, video games, electronics and more. Recently though, Kickstarter, and other sites like it, have begun to be used to fund missions to the final frontier. To date, many of these projects have been relatively modest in scale and ambition, with sorties only as far as Earth's low orbit. But some are attempting to recapture the spirit of President John F. Kennedy's potent 1962 speech: ""We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade."" The most ambitious and headline grabbing of them all is a new crowd-researched venture to send a manned submarine to Jupiter's ice moon, Europa. Yes, you read that right. The fledgling mission hopes to take an amphibious vehicle farther than humanity has ever traveled before, to dive deep into the freezing oceans of Europa. At the moment, the project simply aims to connect people around the world to begin researching the mission -- funding for the operation will come much later. Kristian von Bengtson is the man behind the audacious scheme. von Bengtson has spent the last five years working on crowd-funded rocket projects alongside his business partner Peter Madsen. Their organization, Copenhagen Suborbitals, has grown from a two-man team into a volunteer army of 45 full- and part-time collaborators with an annual crowd-sourced budget of around $400,000. Europa is regarded as a suitable destination for human exploration due to the commonly held theory that beneath its icy surface lie great oceans of water in liquid form. Scientists suggest that Europa is one of the most likely locations in the Solar System to be capable of hosting extra-terrestrial life. Some have postulated that microbial life akin to that found in Earth's deepest oceans may already exist there. So compelling is this possibility that the European Space Agency is planning a mission to send a robot to Europa in 2022. For von Bengston though, sending robots into space holds no interest. ""If you send a piece of equipment to a part of space then you didn't actually go there ... Robots are stupid mindless machines. They are not curious, they don't come up with ideas or solutions."" von Bengtson's project is not without its critics. In an article on the online tech magazine Motherboard, Fran Bagenal, a professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado, says: ""What's the point of sending humans? What can they do that robots cannot do better? And robots do not need to breathe, eat, drink, excrete or come back. And robots have better bodies, eyes, hands, noses, ears -- and brains."" von Bengtson's understands the criticism, but says that working towards a manned mission to Jupiter's moon fulfills another critical purpose: to inspire. He says that inspiring people is essential to kickstarting the kinds of discussions he hopes the operation will produce. ""If we had talked about putting a solar panel into the sky, I guarantee we would not have got a dime in crowd funding. You need to have both the human and the pioneering aspect to attract interest."" Away from Operation Europa, von Bengtson and Madsen have aimed to muster this same enthusiasm to build support for their project to send a manned rocket into space. The Danish designer estimates that with the support he has received online, the project could come to fruition by 2020: ""we are in a completely different age now,"" von Bengtson says. ""You can reach everybody around the world. With the internet you can share your thoughts and ideas immediately and you can send money around the world. Copenhagen Suborbitals wouldn't be possible if you didn't have the internet. Everybody is able to join forces."" Other projects have found similar success online. Aerospace engineer Zac Manchester hit the fundraising target for his project to launch a hundred micro satellites after just two weeks. His experiment aims to test the communication capacities of small spacecraft, as well as determine how long they can stay in orbit and how well their electronics hold up in the harsh environment of space. The Cornell University graduate is looking forward to seeing his project launch in December. One of Manchester's former research associates, Michael Johnson, has a similarly ambitious project called Pocket Spacecraft that allows anyone to buy into a mission to send a thousand tiny spacecraft to the moon. Investors will be able to track their small ship, from its design and construction through to launch and onward to the moon. Johnson says that the project is about ""democratizing interplanetary space exploration."" He hopes that experiments such as this will help build a new enthusiasm around space research. ""We're building new tools,"" Johnson says, ""so that one day every child will be able to send their own spacecraft on a robotic field trip in space."" Talking about his own project to CNN, Manchester said: ""I think that crowd funding is enabling new types of missions to be flown - smaller, cheaper, and riskier missions - that may not have been funded under traditional models. It is not going to replace the multi-billion dollar national space programs. Those programs, in fact, did the basic research that has enabled the current crop of crowd-funded space projects, including my own. The kind of sustained long-term research that governments have traditionally funded is still very much needed and I hope that it continues."" von Bengtson agrees, adding that his own work is only possible because of research that has already been done by governmental space programs: ""we are standing on the shoulders of, well, everyone,"" he says. The work being done by this new breed of innovative crowd-funded and crowd-researched projects allows people around the world to actively get involved in space exploration. von Bengtson and others like him want to inspire not through mounting monolithic projects that are out of reach, but by opening the process up and inviting people to get involved. ""If they want, our donors can come to Denmark and see the test of our rocket engines for free. Many like to do that, but most are just happy to be a part of the project. They find it important, and they find it interesting to follow ... That dialogue is very important."" To get involved in von Bengtson's plan to take a submarine to Jupiter, click here.

"(CNN) -- Spanish police say they've arrested the man behind what's been called the biggest cyberattack in history. The suspect, a 35-year-old Dutch citizen, traveled around Spain in a van he used as a mobile office, Spain's National Police said in a statement Sunday. Police arrested him Thursday north of Barcelona, Spain, on a European arrest warrant at the request of judicial authorities in the Netherlands, the statement said. Authorities have not released his name, and a photo police issued showing his detention blurred his face. The arrest comes a month after Internet users around the globe faced slowed-down service during the prolonged denial-of-service assault on The Spamhaus Project, a European spam-fighting group. Security experts said the attack used more sophisticated techniques than most distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks and targeted the Web's infrastructure, which led to other sites performing slowly. In a DDoS attack, computers flood a website with requests, overwhelming its servers and causing it to crash or become inaccessible for many users. Last month's attack appears to be part of a fierce feud between organizations that monitor spam and try to block it and companies that accuse spam blockers of unjustly blacklisting them. The Spamhaus Project is a nonprofit that patrols the Internet for spammers and publishes a list of Web servers those spammers use. Matthew Prince, CEO of Internet security firm CloudFlare, estimates the group may be responsible for up to 80% of all spam that gets blocked. And last month, the group added a new name to its blacklist, CyberBunker, and said spammers use the company as a host to spray junk mail across the Web. During his arrest, the suspect told authorities he was a diplomat and ""minister of telecommunications and foreign relations of the Republic of CyberBunker,"" police said Sunday. Last month CyberBunker -- a Dutch company housed in a former NATO nuclear bunker -- did not take credit for the attack against Spamhaus but didn't shy away from talking about it. ""This here is the Internet community puking out Spamhaus,"" Sven Olaf Kamphuis of CyberBunker told CNN in March. ""We've had it with the guys. ... What we see right here is the Internet puking out a cancer."" Kamphuis and other critics say that Spamhaus oversteps its bounds and has essentially destroyed innocent websites in its spam-fighting efforts. ""Spamhaus itself is a more urgent danger"" than spam, Kamphuis told CNN. ""Pointing at websites and saying they want it shut down and then they get it shut down without any court order. That is a significantly larger threat to internet and freedom of speech and net neutrality than anything else."" In a statement Friday, Spamhaus thanked Dutch authorities for last week's arrest. ""Spamhaus will resolutely continue its mission to provide reliable protection against cyberthreats such as spam, malware and botnets and work with Internet service providers and organizations worldwide to create a safer Internet,"" the organization said in a statement. CNN's Al Goodman and Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Police say the suspect traveled around Spain in a van he used as a mobile office .

"(CNN) -- As Norway struggles to come to terms with its greatest loss of life in decades, all eyes are on the man charged in the explosion in central Oslo and the deadly shooting rampage at a youth camp. While police have not officially named him, Norwegian television and newspaper reports have identified the suspect as 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik, of Norwegian origin. A picture is emerging, gleaned from official sources and social media, of a right-wing Christian fundamentalist who may have had an issue with Norway's multi-cultural society. Norwegian and international news outlets have run photographs of a blond man with blue-green eyes and chiseled features, dressed in a preppy style. A victim who was shot during the attack at the youth camp on Utoya island told CNN Saturday that he had seen pictures of Breivik taken from what is believed to be his Facebook page and shown on NRK and TV2. The victim said he recognized the man from the news reports as the gunman. Breivik is a member of the Oslo Pistol Club and has three weapons registered in his name, according to leading Norwegian newspaper VG, citing Norway's official weapons register. They are a Glock pistol, a rifle and a shotgun, VG reported. NRK reports that Breivik does not have a military background and was exempt from Norway's mandatory military service. He has not had any special military training, it adds on its website. He was a youth and adult member of the conservative Fremskrittspartiet (FrP) or Progress Party, VG newspaper reports, remaining involved until 2007. The party's most prominent manifesto pledge is to minimize immigration. His membership was confirmed by a senior party member, Jonas Kallmyr, who is quoted by VG as saying that encountering Breivik was ""like meeting Hitler before World War II."" The leader of the Progress Party, Siv Jensen, told Norwegian broadcaster TV2 News she was ""horrified"" to learn that the suspect was a former member of her party. ""But this is first and foremost an attack against the entire nation. It has affected all of us,"" she said, saying that her party members stood in solidarity with the youth movement of the Labour Party. A post in Breivik's name on an online forum, Document.no, from December 2009, talks about non-Muslim teenagers being ""in an especially precarious situation with regards to being harassed by Islamic youth."" ""I know of many hundred occasions where non-Muslims have been robbed, beaten up and harassed by Islamic gangs,"" the post reads. ""I had a best friend between the ages of 12-17 who was a Pakistani, so I was one of the many protected, cool 'potatoes' that had protection. But this also made me see the hypocrisy up close and personal and made me nauseous."" Such anti-Islamic sentiment is nothing new in Norway or other European nations, where there has been resistance against increasing numbers of Muslims and their practices. About 3% of Norway's population in 2010 -- 144,000 people -- were Muslim, but that was expected to more than double to 6.5% over the next 20 years, according to a report released earlier this year by The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. That is one of the largest percentage increases in Muslim populations across all of Europe, thanks in part to fertility rates significantly higher than those of non-Muslims. Another post in Breivik's name in October 2009 advises ""Hans"", described as the founder of Document.no, to ""develop an alternative to the violent extreme Norwegian Marxist organisations Blitz, SOS Rasisme and Rod Ungdom"" -- all left-wing movements in Norway. ""The conservatives dare not openly express their viewpoints in public because they know that the extreme Marxists will trump them. We cannot accept the fact that the Labour Party is subsidising these violent ""Stoltenberg jugend"", who are systematically terrorising the politically conservative,"" the post reads. He is making a reference to the youth movement of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who heads the Labour Party. A Twitter account attributed to Breivik by Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten has only one message, dated July 17. ""One person with a belief is equal to the force of 100,000 who has only interests,"" it says, adapting a quote from 19th-century British philosopher John Stuart Mill. Police have not ruled out the possibility that other people may have helped the suspect. ""The official questioning is starting now,"" Roger Andresen, a police official, told reporters during a news conference Saturday. The suspect was cooperating with police, making it clear he wanted to explain himself, Andresen said. Norway's police website said the suspect is currently charged with breaking paragraph 147a of the penal code -- a terrorism offense, with a maximum sentence of 21 years. The statement said he was charged in both the Utoya attack and the bombing of government buildings in Oslo, and that the charges might change. ""The suspect has never been arrested by the police before,"" it said. Two addresses connected to the suspect are being searched, police said. One of them is believed to be an apartment in Oslo and the other a farm in Hedmark. NRK reports that Breivik is registered as having run a company that produced ""vegetables, melons, roots and tubers"" -- an industry which allows access to large amounts of fertilizer, the broadcaster notes, which can be used for explosives. An employee at a Norwegian agricultural cooperative told CNN that the man identified in media reports as the suspect in Friday's attacks bought six tons of fertilizer from her company in May. Oddmy Estenstad, of Felleskjopet Agr, said she did not think the order was strange at the time because the suspect has a farm, but after the Oslo attack she called police because she knew the material can be used to make bombs. ""We are very shocked that this man was connected to our company,"" said Estenstad. ""We are very sad about what happened."" More details on the man are sure to emerge in the coming hours and days. But what many Norwegians find hard to comprehend is that the chief suspect in the massacre appears to be one of their own. Stoltenberg stressed that whoever was behind the attacks must be dealt with properly. ""It is very important that those who are responsible -- one or several persons -- are sentenced according to Norwegian law, in the Norwegian system of justice,"" he said. ""Norway is a small country but it is a proud country. We are all very close, especially in times like this.""

"(CNN) -- An inch of rain doesn't sound like a lot. But in parts of the flooded Midwest, it's enough to make a bad situation worse. In Illinois on Tuesday, residents braced for the extra inch, which will delay any reduction in floodwaters that have ravaged dozens of counties, forcing thousands of residents from their homes. As rivers across the heartland swelled during the past two weeks, rising water was blamed for four deaths. Flooding threatens rivers in Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, North Dakota, Mississippi and Michigan, according to the National Weather Service. Along the mighty Mississippi, flood watches stretch as far south as Louisiana. Although flooding is expected all along the river, experts don't expect the catastrophic levels of two years ago, when levees were breached. The flooding was so grave in 2011 that authorities purposely flooded thousands of square miles of Louisiana to spare city centers. Residents in North Dakota are bracing for flooding, too, as the overflowing Red River flows toward Fargo. The city has begun a three-day push to truck sandbags into low-lying areas. Police cars are escorting the semi-trailer trucks as they head to the locations, CNN affiliate KVLY reported. Conditions could get worse: Additional rain could speed up the melting of snow, making the river rise even faster. Starlynn Winchell stared Tuesday as the Illinois River rushed up against her home in Spring Bay, Illinois. ""The more I see the water come up, the more I'll cry,"" she said. At least six rivers in northern Illinois have surged to record levels in recent days after the area was deluged with 5 inches of rain. Flooding in Illinois alone has displaced thousands and prompted Gov. Pat Quinn to declare 44 counties as disaster areas. In Peoria, residents may have narrowly missed a crisis. The Illinois River is forecast to crest Tuesday afternoon at 29.4 feet, a record height. At 30 feet, the water would have topped a levee at a sewage treatment plant -- sending raw sewage spilling into the river. The good news is the flooding won't be as bad because of last year's drought. ""Experts told us the drought might have helped us a little bit,"" said Patti Thompson, a spokeswoman with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. ""We did have so much more capacity for the water to be absorbed into the ground."" Thompson said the state was in variety of stages of dealing with the high water. Some counties were seeing water starting to recede and could start cleanup, while others were working feverishly to strengthen protection measures. Those areas expect to see rising river levels for the next several days, she said. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency there after many areas of the state were stricken by flash flooding. ""The sustained periods of heavy rainfall (have) swollen creeks and streams and is pushing the Mississippi River over flood levels, endangering river communities,"" Nixon said. Winchell, the Spring Bay resident, said her northern Illinois town of fewer than 500 has been devastated. The deluge in her trailer community began Sunday, she said, when floodwaters submerged her home and about 40 others. By Monday, dark, murky water had risen to some homes' doorsteps. Flooding has cut Winchell off from access to her home. ""Yesterday, I cried all day,"" she said. Brad Lohman, who owns a bar in the town, was also hit hard. ""It's kind of emotional to see this situation, and it's a bad deal,"" he said, looking at the waters that rose close to window level. Lohman worked at the bar when he was a teenager and eventually bought it. But this flood may be the end. He doubts he can reopen. ""I think it's going be a total loss,"" he said, ""I really do."" The rain and flooding caused three deaths last week and a fourth Sunday, local authorities and news media reported. In DuPage County, Illinois, a body was found floating in Salt Creek last week, the local sheriff's office said. Authorities were working to identify it. A woman in De Soto, Missouri, drowned last week after her vehicle washed off a road, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. Two fatalities were reported in Arcadia, Indiana. On Thursday, a 64-year-old man died after attempting to cross high water in his car. The water swept him off a roadway and dragged him downstream, Hamilton County Sheriff's Office said. CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.","NEW: Illinois official says flooding could have been worse if not for drought .

"(CNN) -- It's a fishing trip that could have had a very different ending. Efstathios ""Steve"" Moumouris' wife had fitting words shortly after the Florida man was rescued from the Gulf of Mexico, where he had bobbed for nearly 24 hours. ""There are no words to describe it,"" Anastasia Moumouris told CNN Tampa affiliate WTSP. ""I said if anybody could make it would be him."" The dehydrated Moumouris, 51, was spotted by good Samaritans who were out fishing for scallops off of Crystal River in Citrus County. He was about seven miles southwest of Crystal River. ""We got him on board and he was fairly coherent,"" said Todd Hoy. The man had texted his wife Wednesday afternoon to tell her he was heading in, according to WTSP. He was not heard from again and she contacted authorities. Moumouris' 16-food boat earlier Thursday was found unattended nine miles from the Fort Island boat ramp. The Citrus County Sheriff's Office said a storm tossed Moumouris from his vessel. He was not wearing a life jacket when found. The fisherman was expected to be released from a local hospital.","Efstathios Moumouris went missing during a fishing trip .

"(CNN) -- The sentencing phase begins Monday for Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales who has admitted to gunning down 16 civilians in a 2012 rampage through two villages near his outpost in southern Afghanistan. Bales pleaded guilty in June to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts, in a hearing before a military judge. The guilty plea spares the 39-year-old Bales the prospect of a death sentence in the killings. He now faces life in prison, but a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel will decide whether he will have a chance at parole. Bales admitted to slipping away from his outpost in southern Afghanistan and going on a house-to-house killing spree in two nearby villages in March 2012, a massacre that further strained ties between American troops and their Afghan allies. But he has not offered an explanation for his actions. In addition to the murder counts, Bales pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted murder, seven of assault and the use of illicit steroids and alcohol, but pleaded not guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice. Bales is a member of the Army's 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an element of the 2nd Infantry Division. His attorneys have said the service made a mistake in assigning Bales to another combat tour despite evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury suffered during a combat tour in Iraq.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge dropped a hit-and-run charge against Chris Brown after the singer reached a ""civil compromise"" with his accuser Thursday. It was not immediately clear if the dismissal would stop the revocation of Brown's probation he has faced since the traffic charges were filed last month. ""It's unfortunate that Chris had to go through this in the first place,"" Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos told CNN after a hearing Thursday. ""Sometimes I get the impression that he's prosecuted for who he is as opposed to what he's done, and that's unfortunate."" Brown, 24, has been in legal hot water since February 2009 when he was charged with domestic violence after beating his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. In addition to the probation revocation triggered by the traffic incident this summer, the Los Angeles County district attorney has accused Brown of violating probation by fraudulently reporting that he had completed the community labor ordered as part of his sentence for beating Rihanna. Brown is set to be in court Friday for the judge to set a date for a probation revocation trial, which could send him to jail. Geragos said the driver who accused Brown after a traffic accident in May did not get any money in her settlement with his client. ""She did not want to pursue this,"" he said. ""She did not understand that this could even be a criminal matter and said she didn't want to pursue criminal charges."" The city attorney who was prosecuting the case objected to the compromise because of Brown's felony probation status and his allegedly aggressive behavior in the incident. Olga Gure told investigators that after Brown's Range Rover rear-ended her Mercedes on a Los Angeles street, he ""went ballistic"" and screamed at her. Gure said Brown shouted at her: ""You are a b---h!"" The report added more from Gure, who quoted Brown as saying, ""Who do you think you are, b---h? Do you think if you driving Mercedes so got money, b---h? Do you think I am just a black n----r? I got more money than you, beech!"" The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene because he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said. When Brown tried to grab the camera, Tran screamed, ""Don't touch her, don't touch her,"" Gure said. ""I was so shocked that I was speechless,"" she said, according to the report. ""Just a moment ago he was a nice guy. After screaming some insulting nonsense for a while longer, he slammed a door and drove away, fast and noisy."" Brown was ordered to return to court on Friday for a hearing to set a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand. If it does, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin could order Brown to jail to serve part of the original five-year jail sentence imposed for the attack on Rihanna. Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards in February 2009. He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the assault conviction. The judge allowed him to serve the sentence in Richmond, Virginia, under the direct supervision of the police chief. In a court filing in February, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the community labor. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,"" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. Rhianna shows support in court for Chris Brown . Geragos, Brown's attorney, said the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court. ""And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent,"" Geragos said. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has ""tortured"" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said. The prosecutor is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer.

"(CNN) -- Eight women and four men convened regularly over 13 months. They heard from dozens of witnesses, considered 30,000 pieces of evidence. All of it was with one question in mind: Who was responsible for 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey's death? On October 13, 1999 -- nearly three years after the diminutive Colorado pageant queen's body was found in her home -- the 12 grand jurors went back to their own homes, sworn to silence and with nothing apparently to show for their effort. ""We do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges,"" then-Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter said. The presumption was that the grand jury hadn't voted to indict anyone. That included failing to take action against JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, whom Boulder police had said were under ""an umbrella of suspicion"" in the girl's death. Yet the Boulder Daily Camera, the daily newspaper in that Colorado city, now says there was more to the story. Citing several unidentified jurors as well as an assistant district attorney in Hunter's office, the paper reports that the grand jury did, in fact, vote to indict the Ramsey parents on charges of child abuse resulting in death. Hunter, the man who presented the case to them, didn't sign the indictment, however, the Daily Camera reports. It's a decision that Bill Wise, a former prosecutor who wasn't directly involved in the grand jury proceedings, confirmed to the paper and said makes sense. ""The state of the evidence in that case was simply inadequate to file a charge, in my opinion, and that obviously was Hunter's opinion, too,"" Wise said. ""Whether it's against one or two people, you just didn't have the evidence."" Those now in the Boulder County District Attorney's Office aren't commenting on the report, spokeswoman Catherine Olguin said Monday. But Lin Wood, the Atlanta lawyer for John Ramsey, said, ""I have known for years that Boulder prosecutors did not file charges against John and Patsy Ramsey because the evidence to prosecute them did not exist."" He said Monday that any reported ""confusion of the grand jury over child abuse"" could have been addressed had the Ramsey parents testified, as they repeatedly offered to do. Wood also pointed to the 2008 findings from then-District Attorney Mary Lacy that DNA tests ruled out any Ramsey family member's involvement in the girl's death. ""The DNA tests performed after the time of the Boulder grand jury not only prove the Ramsey family to be innocent and the grand jury wrong, they also make former District Attorney Alex Hunter a hero who wisely avoided a gross miscarriage of justice,"" Wood told CNN. Mom: 'There's a killer on the loose' It was December 26, 1996 -- a day after JonBenet got a bicycle as a Christmas gift -- when Patsy Ramsey said she discovered a three-page ransom note in her Boulder home. Police came and, later that day, found JonBenet's beaten and strangled body in the family's basement. Days after burying the girl in suburban Atlanta, where they had previously lived, the Ramseys appeared on CNN. ""There's a killer on the loose,"" Patsy Ramsey said January 1, 1997, in an interview that brought an intense national spotlight on the case. ""I don't know who it is. I don't know if it's a she or a he, but if I were a resident of Boulder, I would tell my friends to keep your babies close to you. There's someone out there."" The parents insisted an intruder committed the crime, but no one was caught and no description was given. In time, the focus turned on the parents: Could they have done it? Investigators didn't find footprints in the snow outside the home, there was no sign of forced entry. A paintbrush from her mother's hobby kit was used to tighten the rope that choked JonBenet. And the alleged ransom note was written from paper inside the house and referenced little-known details about the family's past and its finances. Despite the suspicions, the Ramseys were never named as suspects. But they were a focus of the grand jury, which first convened in September 1998. On Monday, CNN talked with one juror and another's spouse, both of whom indicated that -- at the behest of the district attorney's office -- they would not discuss the case. Messages left by CNN with several other jurors were not immediately answered. But according to Wise and several jurors who talked with the Daily Camera, the decision was eventually made to indict John and Patsy Ramsey. This was even though the jurors weren't sure who, exactly, had killed young JonBenet. ""We didn't know who did what,"" a juror told the newspaper, according to a story on its website. ""But we felt the adults in the house may have done something that they certainly could have prevented (JonBenet's death) or they could have helped her. And they didn't."" 16 years later, still no arrests or charges . According to Wise, who worked as a prosecutor for 28 years before retiring, there was disagreement among the eight or so involved in the prosecution about what to do after the grand jury voted to indict. He told the Daily Camera that he thinks his former boss did the right thing not pressing forward with the case, arguing that the evidence didn't show whether Patsy or John Ramsey may have been more directly responsible. ""If I were on a jury, I would not convict either of them,"" said Wise. As is, while there have been many twists and turns since the grand jury was discharged in 1999, there's been no closure. The Ramseys were busy in March 2000, releasing their book ""The Death of Innocence,"" filing multimillion-dollar lawsuits against media organizations who they say libeled their son (who was 9 at the time of JonBenet's death) and settling a lawsuit with a tabloid newspaper. That May, the Ramseys returned to CNN to face off with Steve Thomas, a former Boulder police detective who'd released a book of his own. Thomas claimed the girl died after ""an explosive encounter"" over a bed-wetting incident, something the Ramseys fiercely denied. The district attorney's office, then led by Lacy, took over the case from Boulder police in 2002. Four years later, there was an apparent breakthrough with the arrest of 41-year-old teacher John Mark Karr in Bangkok, Thailand. This came after he freely -- and repeatedly -- said he was with JonBenet the night she died, although he insisted her death was an accident and that he ""loved"" her. But soon after his arrest and return to Colorado, prosecutors announced DNA evidence proved Karr had nothing to do with JonBenet's death. That same year, 2006, Patsy Ramsey died at the age of 49 following a fight with ovarian cancer. Then came Lacy's 2008 letter to John Ramsey, exonerating him and the rest of his family after tests of DNA evidence found in the girl's underwear and beneath her fingernails . ""To the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry,"" Lacy wrote. Since then, authorities have said they'd continued to try to find answers. But despite their work, the case remains as cold as it was on that late December day, some 16 years ago.","A Colorado paper reports a grand jury voted to indict JonBenet Ramsey's parents .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has told CNN Sport that there is no chance of the top European clubs forming a breakaway league to rival the Champions League. The possibility of a breakaway league has been mooted for several years and earlier this week Barcelona president Sandro Rossell suggested that Champions League matches should be played at the weekend, with the top European leagues all being reduced to 16 teams to accommodate the fixtures. However, speaking exclusively to CNN Sport's Don Riddell, Scudamore rejected any such notions and insisted that the Champions League will remain a midweek competition. ""A breakaway league is just not going to happen,"" said Scudamore. ""What has been said has been said but I'm not going to go along with the sentiment. ""In reality we have a Champions League, it's a fantastic competition. Obviously there are some things the clubs would like to alter and ultimately discussions will take place and UEFA will do something to make sure things stay intact."" Scudamore added: ""But when it comes to ultimate football sanctions you just can't break away. The only reason the Premier League was formed was because it had the permission of our Football Association. ""They are the ultimate arbiters of football in this country and for anyone else to go and play unsanctioned competitions is unthinkable. UEFA would have to agree with what happened, so the idea that anybody in football can just break away and do what they want is just impossible."" And speaking specifically about Rossell's comments, Scudamore continued: ""What he said was from a Barcelona-centric view. ""Our clubs will not be playing European football on a weekend. European football is a midweek competition, and domestic football is a weekend competition."" With six of the current top eight Premier League clubs now under foreign ownership, there has been talk the league might go the same way as American sport, with a franchise system and no promotion and relegation. However, Scudamore was quick to dispel any fears of this, saying: ""It doesn't matter to us whether the owners are foreign or English, what matters to us is how they run their clubs. ""This idea that everyone who is a non-English owner is sat somewhere in a members club with these eight or nine other foreign owners, somehow with a common view, is nonsensical."" He added: ""The one thing I can't see changing is promotion and relegation. That's the lifeblood of the whole league. ""Last season Wolverhampton Wanderers were bottom but they still ended up defeating Manchester United -- and there is no other league in the world when the bottom teams can be competitive with the top. It's because they have to fight to avoid relegation.""","CNN Sport speaks exclusively to English Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore .

"(CNN) -- Mexico has landed some hard punches against the drug cartels that have stirred violence in parts of the country -- at least on paper. In 2011, against just the notorious Zetas cartel, Mexico ended the reign of 16 leaders who ran cartel operations at the state or national level. Thugs with nicknames like ""El Piolin,"" ""El Lucky"" and ""El Amarillo."" But the violence attributed to the Zetas has not decreased even after these busts, and critics wonder if names are meaningless if they are so quickly replaced. And a majority of Mexico's most-wanted drug traffickers, 22 out of 37, have been put out of commission, but to what benefit? At what cost? ""Mexico has paid an enormous price: almost 50,000 dead, almost $50 billion in additional security costs, ever more numerous human rights violations, (and) a great discrediting of the country to the world,"" wrote Jorge Castaneda, a former Mexican foreign minister and critic of the current strategy, in the Spanish newspaper El Pais. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and his backers in the U.S. government, meanwhile, insist that the militarized offensive is paying dividends and that a turning point is close at hand. Taking stock of the successes and failures of Mexico's drug war means examining a strategy that experts are divided over. It is a strategy that is not static, and there is evidence that the Mexican government is -- if not gaining ground -- at least reshaping the battlefield. The strategy . The entry of Mexican troops into the drug cartel fight began before Calderon became president. His predecessor, Vicente Fox, launched Operation Safe Mexico in 2005, which sent soldiers and federal police to eight cities in Mexico. According to Mexican scholar Jorge Chabat, Fox was reluctant to take this step, and tried to limit its scope. (Today, Fox is a critic of the war and advocates the decriminalization of drugs.) When Calderon took office the following year after a victory by the smallest of margins, he embraced the military approach. Just 11 days after being sworn in, he sent troops to his home state of Michoacan, and in the following months to a number of other states. As many as 45,000 troops have been deployed throughout the country. Five years later in January 2012, in a New Year's message to the Mexican people, Calderon admitted that insecurity remains one of the biggest worries for citizens. ""That's why my government has worked with great firmness on this task, and we have done it with a comprehensive vision,"" he said. ""We are combating from the roots a problem that grew during many, many years. We have acted with a firm decision to put a stop to those who hurt Mexicans, honest and hardworking, like I know you and your family are."" The years of military involvement has not stopped the number of violent deaths from growing. The government has released only a partial death toll for 2011, which is expected to set a new record. The good news, the government said, is that the rate at which the killings were growing has slowed down considerably. Militarization is the centerpiece, but not the only component of the strategy. Calderon has committed resources to cleaning up corruption among all levels of police forces, and wants to strengthen the institutions that apply the law, such as the attorney general's office. The United States has aided through the $1.4 billion Merida Initiative, which gave the Mexicans Black Hawk Helicopters, but also training for police, prosecutors and defenders. Measuring success . In the early stages of the offensive, Mexico's Secretary of Defense, Guillermo Galvan, expressed the goal of the campaign as this: ""To provide the level of security that can make viable citizen's life."" If it is true that this level of security exists in most of Mexico, it is also true that most of Mexico has not suffered the drug violence up close. As the government points out, the violence is limited to certain regions, like the border states of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, or in Sinaloa, the cradle of a cartel of the same name. Do Mexicans enjoy a ""viable"" life there? Drug cartels have branched out into kidnapping, extortion, human smuggling and suppression of the media. And residents in those hotspots where the cartels operate continue to live under these conditions. Galvan himself, in a speech this month, admitted that the security of Mexico ""finds itself seriously threatened."" In some areas, security forces find themselves overrun by the traffickers, he said. ""In some regions of the country, organized crime has overtaken state institutions, and once empowered, diversified their ominous activities to deprive society of its rights, generating a climate of unprecedented violence,"" he said. In those same areas, though, slowdowns in violence are evidence that sending in the military does have an impact, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""I think the government overstates its case often, but there is progress,"" he said. Indeed, some of the major cartels, such as the Beltran-Leyva Organization and the Tijuana cartel, are shadows of their former selves. Calderon's offensive has succeeded in disrupting the command and control of the major cartels, he said. The cartels are less cohesive than they once were, and the violence, while still present, is more decentralized, he said. The threat from the cartels is gradually shifting from a national security threat to a public security issue, he said. Toward victory? Mexico has made such strides that it's not impossible to imagine that ""they actually might get every major trafficker at some point,"" Selee said. ""The glass is half full."" Rod Benson, intelligence director for the Drug Enforcement Administration, agreed. ""First and foremost, they have achieved unprecedented successes in apprehending those higher-level leaders and associates in all of the cartels operating in Mexico,"" he said. ""I believe that it's heading in a direction where you will start to see violence drifting down."" Mexico is still building up capacities such as police and investigator competence, but the fruits of their efforts are evident, he said. ""I believe their ability to target, to arrest, to develop intelligence have improved,"" he said. In the past, distrust has been an obstacle to U.S.- Mexico cooperation, but Benson said, robust intelligence sharing has resulted in many of the high-level captures. ""It is moving in the right direction, and I believe it will bear dividends in the future,"" he said. The office of Calderon declined numerous requests by CNN to elaborate on their strategy or view of success. Such upbeat assessments have not won over many Mexicans, however. In November, a group of activists filed a 700-page complaint with the International Criminal Court against the Mexican government, alleging more than 470 cases of human rights violations against women and children. That same month, Human Rights Watch released a report that found a growing number of human rights violation allegations that were not adequately investigated. The Mexican strategy has ""exacerbated a climate of violence, lawlessness, and fear in many parts of the country,"" the report found. Poet Javier Sicilia, who has become a leading activist against the military campaign, garnered enough clout that Calderon sat down to meet with his group. Sicilia's movement calls for ending the military approach altogether, and to focus on the social impacts of the fight. Obstacles remain . ""It is naive to think you can win a drug war. The best you can do is manage it,"" said George Grayson, professor of government at the College of William & Mary and expert of drug cartels. The current military strategy is not working, because the most important sectors of Mexican society have not gotten behind it, he said. The powerful elite in the country -- whether politically, economically or intellectually -- have not felt firsthand the effects of the violence and have not had the ""epiphany"" that it is a problem that must be confronted, Grayson said. With the second- and mid-tier arrests, it is too easy for the cartels to replace those figures. That's where Mexico sees groups like the Zetas replenish themselves even after a year of tough losses in several plazas, or territories. ""Their plaza chiefs are like utility infielders -- you can put them in any place and at any time,"" Grayson said. Real change -- real success -- will be achieved only when the top kingpins are taken down, and that will take pressure from all of the country's elite on the government to act, he said. ""Those with power have not committed themselves to fighting this war,"" Grayson said. Whatever side of the debate Mexicans fall on, is it possible that a military approach was inevitable? Chabat, the Mexican expert, wrote about the options that Calderon had available to him when he came to office amid rising cartel violence. Tolerance was an option, but the cartels were becoming so powerful that it would have put democracy at risk, he argued. There exists the option of legalizing drugs, an idea with growing appeal to many. This is possible in theory, Chabat writes, but politically impossible in the short term. A third option is to strengthen institutions. This is actually part of the current strategy, but it is a time-consuming process. The final option left was a frontal military assault, with knowledge that it would bring violence as a cost, Chabat wrote. It is an election year, Calderon's final year at the helm. These options will be before a new president, likely from a different party. He will have to decide: have the costs outweighed the benefits.","Mexico has used its military to help capture cartel leaders .

"(CNN) -- It's not often that someone you know and consider a friend is awarded the Medal of Honor. I first met then-Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha in Colorado in 2010. We had dinner with three of his fellow soldiers -- then-Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan Hill, Sgt. Tom Rasmussen and Sgt. Eric Harder. Over beer and Mexican food, they talked about their time in the Army and their experiences at Combat Outpost Keating in Afghanistan. I was working on a book about the remote outpost in which they'd served; the four troops candidly and generously shared their thoughts with me. Romesha (pronounced ROE-muh-shay) was dark and sardonic. It was clear that he respected basic military values of selflessness, courage and efficiency, and had little tolerance for those who did not. It's not surprising, because he comes from a military family. Both of his brothers joined the military after high school, following in the footsteps of their father, a Vietnam veteran, and their grandfather, who served during World War II. For the Romeshas, military service is a family tradition. At the dinner, Romesha talked about leaving the Army and spending more time with his wife, Tammy, and their three children. Within a year, he did exactly that. They all now live in Minot, North Dakota. Romesha works as a field safety specialist for an oil field construction firm 90 minutes away. Romesha is modest about the actions for which President Barack Obama will award him on February 11 with the nation's highest honor for courage. Maybe you saw his modesty in our interview of him, which aired in an hourlong CNN special on Thursday, February 7, at 10 p.m. ET. Maybe you saw the way he talks about that horrible day -- October 3, 2009 -- when he and about 50 other American soldiers faced overwhelming Taliban forces numbering more than 300. Even more terrifying than their numbers was their positional superiority: a 360 degree assault from the high ground. Combat Outpost Keating had been built at the bottom of three steep mountains, providing the enemy from day one with a tactical advantage. For all the glory bestowed on Romesha, he is still torn apart because of those he couldn't save that night, those whom no one could have saved. The humility in the interview, his disappointment in not having been able to save every troop's life, is haunting. Excerpt: ""The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor"" ""My granddaddy used to teach me, you know, 'When you tell someone you're going to do something, you do it. You know, your actions is what makes you.' And I know I'm hard on myself, but you know it still hurts,"" Romesha told me. Eight U.S. troops were killed at Combat Outpost Keating, and the camp was overrun by the Taliban. But because of the valorous actions of troops like Clint Romesha -- and others, including Hill, Rasmussen, Harder, Sgt. Ty Carter, Lt. Andrew Bundermann and more -- ultimately, the United States was able to push the Taliban back and regain control of the camp. Romesha's leadership was crucial, and his fellow troops say they wonder if they would have survived without his fierce determination. ""There are few people I would follow to hell and back, and Romesha is one of them,"" former Pvt. 1st Class Chris Jones told us. I interviewed more than 225 individuals for my book about the attack, ""The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor,"" which also details the history of the outpost. I met many brave troops along the way. Romesha, without question, stands out. He and I have spent hours talking about the battle (and other matters too, since we became friends), and some of those conversations will be with me always. He's a laconic guy, Romesha, the type you might see in a cowboy movie. Few words, strong deeds. The love and dedication he has for his troops, and the degree to which he's moved when they return those emotions with performance in the line of duty, is almost palpable. ""To watch those guys say we're short numbered but we've got the stones, we're gonna man up. This is what's required of us. We're gonna dig deep and we're gonna man up,"" Romesha says. ""I mean, it's amazing to watch that great sacrifice, losing out on sleep, long, hard days, running up and down the mountains with less guys than the unit before. We took pride in that, that we did more with less and that was our motto for a while."" There are 79 living Medal of Honor recipients, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society; Romesha will be the 80th. I am proud to know him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jake Tapper.","Jake Tapper: It's not often that someone you consider a friend is awarded the Medal of Honor .

"(CNN) -- A Tennessee man was executed Wednesday for the death of a couple in 1985, authorities said. Steve Henley, 55, was executed by lethal injection at 1:33 a.m. ET. Henley was sentenced to death for the slayings of Fred and Edna Stafford. Authorities said Henley shot the couple and later set their farmhouse on fire. An autopsy found that Edna Stafford was still alive when the fire was set, according to authorities. Henley had maintained his innocence, blaming the couple's deaths on co-defendant Terry Flatt. Flatt testified that Henley was drunk, high on drugs and angry over a debt he believed the Staffords owed his grandparents. Flatt served five years in prison before completing his parole last year. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Henley's appeal late Tuesday. Tennessee last performed its execution in September 2007. In February 2007, the state put executions on hold when Gov. Phil Bredesen ordered a review of how Tennessee administered the death penalty. The moratorium was lifted in May 2007 after the state's death-penalty protocols were revised.","Steve Henley dies by lethal injection early Wednesday for 1985 death of couple .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Given the magnitude of Japan's recession, it should perhaps come as little surprise that the fantasy-obsessed animation industry has received a hard dose of reality. Nobuki Mitani is an ""in-between"" animator -- one of the lowest paid positions in animation. Yasuo Yamaguchi, executive director of the Association of Japanese Animators, said the industry has been rocked by the country's deepest recession since World War II. ""The spread of free Internet downloading is having a deadly effect,"" he said. Japanese animation is roughly a $2 billion-a-year industry. Revenues peaked in 2006 but have since fallen off, as lower advertising revenues lead to fewer new programs. Yamaguchi said the animation industry is important to Japan's economy and that the government should be helping it through these tough times with subsidies.  Watch CNN's Morgan Neill report on anime » . Unlike some big screen animated features from the United States that rely almost completely on computer animation, in Japan, almost all features are drawn by hand -- a labor-intensive craft practiced by thousands of young artists each year. For the last six years, Nobuki Mitani, has been working as an ""in-between"" animator -- filling in the cells between ""key"" animations. It is one of the lowest paid positions in the animation hierarchy. Many of these entry-level jobs have been outsourced to the Philippines and South Korea in recent years. Mitani, 27, said the hours are long, and the pay is low -- about $800 a month. ""Every day I work about 10 to 12 hours,"" he said. ""Often, we work on Saturday, and if it's busy, we work Sunday, too."" In Tokyo, the world's most expensive city, that means living in cramped conditions. Mitani lives in a tiny one-room apartment with no air conditioning. In summer, the room is sweltering. ""I try not to drink water,"" he said, ""to control the sweating."" He has a shared sink at the end of the hall where he can wash his hands and face, but to bathe he has to go to a public bath. At the Tokyo Animation Institute, the classrooms are filled with students honing the craft, faces close to their sheets of paper, the only sound a hum from the electric pencil sharpener. The school's director, Yosuke Shimizu, said he knows many of his graduates will quit their first jobs after just months. ""Within half a year, some will take freelance jobs, some will take a key drawing job, and some will become sketch directors. Those who are good enough never complain about how hard the job is,"" he said. At Toei Animation Studios, conditions are better for the animators than in smaller studios. Toei has produced countless successes over the years, including the ""Dragonball"" series and the ongoing favorite ""One Piece."" But even here animation is an intense, demanding job. Naotoshi Shida has been working at Toei for 25 years. He said it takes much more than just a love of drawing to succeed. ""If someone is thinking of doing this just because they love drawing, that's called a hobby. They'd better think of doing something else.""","Association of Japanese Animators says industry rocked by recession .

"(CNN) -- The hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon -- and out again -- was symbolic for Melissa Schaaf. It was a sign of how far she had come, a sign that the middle-aged mom of two was active, adventurous and alive. She had lost 80 pounds over the last year and a half through regular exercise and a healthy diet. She was in the best shape of her life, and the trip to Arizona's natural wonder was a chance to celebrate. It was a grueling hike, about 15 miles down and up the steep trail with hundreds of switchbacks. But on that day in summer 2011, Schaaf had no idea her biggest battle was yet to come. A healthy habit . Four years ago, the 5-foot-4 Schaaf weighed close to 250 pounds. ""When I turned 40, I looked down at the scale and thought, 'Oh my, I must really do something about this,' "" the Herndon, Virginia, woman says. Family wins $10,000 after losing 255 pounds . A friend convinced her to join a local Sport & Health Club, and the pair started attending group fitness classes. Schaaf liked spinning, which allowed her to burn calories without pounding her joints with the extra weight she was carrying. Step aerobics was another story -- ""I'm jigging when everyone was jogging"" -- but being able to laugh at her lack of coordination kept Schaaf coming back. After a while going to the gym became just another habit, like brushing her teeth. ""I used to be very emotionally vested in hating the gym,"" she says. ""You're not emotional about brushing your teeth. It's something I do because I want to have teeth when I'm old. I want to be able to move when I'm old."" The first 50 pounds seemed to fall off Schaaf. After eight months, she joined Weight Watchers to overhaul her diet. In the past she had tried everything from hypnosis to prepackaged meals to restriction diets to lose weight. But eating better wasn't such a big deal after conquering the gym. ""I'm the kind of person where I can change one habit ... at a time,"" she says. ""I found that trying to master everything at once was just too much."" Foods that will power up your spring diet . Schaaf hit the gym five to six days a week and traded cookies for apples and bananas on her kitchen counter. Within a year she had lost another 30 pounds. The aches and pains that had come with her extra weight and advancing age stopped. She felt confident and more at ease. She looked forward to living a longer, happier life. Maintaining normalcy . In December 2011, Schaaf had an elective hysterectomy. During surgery, her doctor uncovered a tumor in her uterine muscle and removed it for testing. The tumor was leiomyosarcoma, a rare cancer that's often only discovered in the terminal stage. Schaaf's cancer was stage I. She started the first of four rounds of chemotherapy in February 2012. Through it all, she continued to hit the gym and make healthy food choices. At the gym, her goal was simply to keep moving. And if ice cream was all her stomach could handle, she chose frozen yogurt. ""So much of what's happening to you is out of your control,"" she says. ""I wanted to control what I could."" Overall health during cancer therapy is critical, says Schaaf's oncologist, Dr. Amy Irwin. ""We encourage (patients) to eat healthful meals, exercise and continue in activities they enjoy."" Let's talk about sex ... and cancer . Exercise helped Schaaf sleep better at night and work through some of the drugs' side effects, such as constipation and nausea. She went to the gym the morning of her chemo treatments to relieve stress. ""It helped me mentally -- kept me strong, kept me balanced."" Patients should stay involved in life, Irwin says, to avoid obsessing about their cancer diagnosis. ""Given the supportive medicines we have, most patients are able to maintain normalcy."" Schaaf's weight loss may have done more than prepare her mentally for the challenge ahead. Obesity has been linked to cancer incidence rates. And research has shown that cancer patients who are overweight have a higher risk of mortality than patients with a normal body mass index, Irwin says. Twice in a lifetime . Schaaf is now in remission and has kept the weight off for more than three years. She still has about 10 pounds to lose to reach her goal weight, but she's says she's not in any hurry. ""It think it's all about being patient and ... making the best choices every day,"" she says. ""Do I make great choices every day? No. But you've got to be forgiving with yourself and wake up the next morning and say, 'Today, I'm going to do better.' "" Her healthy lifestyle has increased her energy and opened her eyes to new opportunities. She plans to run a half marathon at the end of April with a bunch of her girlfriends from the gym, and hopes eventually to tackle the Grand Canyon again. ""Hopefully it's not once in a lifetime,"" she says of her first symbolic hike. ""There (are) no limitations anymore."" Have you lost weight?

"Berlin (CNN) -- An armed man is holding several people hostage in the German city of Ingolstadt, police said Monday. The hostage taker did not make any immediate demands from the city's Old Town Hall, police spokesman Guenther Beck said. As police dealt with the hostage situation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel canceled an election speech that she had planned to give in the city Monday afternoon. She'd been scheduled to appear with the prime minister of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer. Beck said that as far as he knew, the hostage situation had nothing to do with Merkel's planned visit.","The hostage taker hasn't made demands from Ingolstadt's Old Town Hall, police say .

"(CNN) -- This week on the ""Big Three"" prodcast we talked with our special guest, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, about the momentous upcoming week for the Supreme Court. With 11 decisions left and just one week in the month of June to complete their rulings, the Supreme Court has held the most anticipated cases until the bitter end. Among these are rulings on gay rights, same sex marriage, the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action. This is the moment where the Supreme Court weighs in on the Culture Wars. Intense debate and some inevitable outrage seem sure to follow. Toobin, author of ""The Nine and the Oath"" as well as a writer for The New Yorker, points out that Chief Justice John Roberts seems focused on building a more colorblind society as a core part of his court legacy. That means decisions regarding affirmative action and the special status of southern states in the Voting Rights Act could move in directions that would upset liberals and African-Americans in particular. But Toobin cautions against buying into knee-jerk characterizations and politicizations of complex decisions. In particular, he points out that the Voting Rights Act will not be repealed or fundamentally gutted if conservative justices carry the day in the case brought by Shelby County, Alabama, arguing essentially that the requirements relevant to the 1960s desegregation no long apply. On the court's return to the question of affirmative action, one Roberts quote from 2007 looms large over the decision: ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" Perhaps the preeminent civil rights fight of our time is the gay rights movement, and two cases on this front promise to capture the most attention. The first is regarding the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in the 1990s. The second concerns the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8, which banned same sex marriages at the ballot box. Many close court observers believe that DOMA will be repealed while Prop 8 might be punted on standing. This means that Dean's hope for a broad Loving v. Virginia type decision -- which outlawed state laws banning interracial marriage in the late 1960s -- might be thwarted for the time being. Margaret has been actively following this court case from its inception in California, where legendary conservative jurist Ted OIson banded with legendary liberal lawyer David Boies to argue that marriage is a basic civil right for all Americans. This kind of bipartisan partnership based on deep principles rather than politics is a model for how to end the Culture Wars, whatever the results of this specific Supreme Court decision. Whatever your personal politics, listen to Toobin jam with us on the ""Big Three"" as a curtain-raiser for the pivotal week ahead. These cases will affect all Americans, and by listening to this podcast you'll get up to speed, ready to debate the issues and analyze the landmark decisions delivered by the highest court in the land. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","Jeffrey Toobin joins ""Big Three"" to discuss the week ahead for the Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- On paper Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray might be the favorites to reach the U.S. Open final since they were the last men standing in three of the four previous majors. But neither will enter the season's final grand slam in good form after they exited in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters on Friday. World No. 1 Djokovic was the first to go, falling to big-serving John Isner 7-6 3-6 7-5 and Murray was soon joining him in the locker room. The world No. 2 was ousted by Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-4. Djokovic hasn't won a title since April and lost in heartbreaking fashion to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal last week. Murray, meanwhile, might still be coming to terms with his epic victory at Wimbledon that ended Britain's 77-year men's singles drought, although Berdych improved to 6-4 against the Scot. ""It's disappointing that I played this way,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""For me it's very disappointing. ''I just played a very bad match overall. Terrible match. From beginning to end, except the start of the second set, I was just a different player totally.'' Djokovic opened the door for Isner in the tiebreak when he double faulted at 3-3. He saved four break points to start the second and looked to be in control but buckled as he served to stay in the match at 5-6 in the third. He'll have to wait to complete his Masters collection. It was the 22nd-ranked Isner's second win over Djokovic, both on home soil. ""I really feel like the crowd in both matches really, really helped me out,"" Isner told the ATP's website. ""It was just so much fun to play out there."" Murray, the defending U.S. Open champion, lost to the unpredictable Ernests Gulbis in the third round in Montreal. He didn't break Berdych, missing a break point in the first set and three in the second. Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open winner, advanced to the semifinals with a three-set win over resurgent Russian Dmitry Tursunov. Nadal, riding a 12-match winning streak on hard courts, will face Roger Federer in Friday's marquee encounter. In the women's draw, top-seed Serena Williams eased past Romania's Simona Halep 6-0 6-4 and former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic progressed by defeating Roberta Vinci by the same score.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will enter this year's U.S. Open without a title since April .

"Editor's note: Dina Habib Powell, global head of corporate engagement at Goldman Sachs, served as U.S. assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs from 2005 to 2007. Dina Habib Powell says there are encouraging signs the world is ready to invest in empowering women. NEW YORK (CNN) -- As we mark International Women's Month in March, it is encouraging to see that the movement to recognize the vital role that women play in families, nations and economies has been building for more than a decade and that developments in the past few years have shown that real progress has begun to take hold. On the heels of International Women's Day, President Obama said Monday, ""we will not sow the seeds for a brighter future or reap the benefits of the change we need without the full and active participation of women around the world."" He also recently announced the creation of a new position, ambassador-at-large for global women's Issues, at the State Department. To fill this critical role, the president nominated Melanne Verveer, a widely respected women's advocate and former top aide to then first lady Hillary Clinton. Verveer was a founder of Vital Voices Global Partnership, an organization committed to empowering women and recently co-chaired by Secretary Clinton and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. There has also been very recent progress on Capitol Hill. Last month, the U.S. Senate created a Foreign Relations subcommittee that will focus on the global status of women, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. The efforts have been a bipartisan priority for our leaders. In 2008, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice successfully led the effort in the U.N. Security Council to officially recognize rape as a weapon of war. And in 2001, Laura Bush used the first presidential radio address ever given by a first lady to focus international attention on the plight of women in Afghanistan and used her influence to protect and empower women around the world. Critical strides are also being made globally. In Rwanda, a country devastated by genocide, women have become a key part of the nation's rebirth. Under the leadership of President Paul Kagame, more than half of the parliament is made up of women. In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf made history when she became the first female president on the African continent. In the Middle East, Kuwait has emerged as a leader in women's suffrage and political participation. And in the United Arab Emirates, women such as Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi, minister of foreign trade, have been trailblazers for progress throughout the region. This social change is being promoted at the United Nations, where Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently noted that the protection, education and empowerment of women and girls are among the most important ingredients to achieving all other Millennium Development Goals. Such consensus should not be surprising as study after study has found that investing in the education of women improves lives. Every extra year of girls' education can reduce infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent. In Africa, children of mothers who receive five years of primary education are 40 percent more likely to live beyond age 5. And multicountry data show educated mothers are about 50 percent more likely to immunize their children than uneducated mothers are. But one of the most important developments of recent years has been the increasing amount of research that shows investments in women can offer not only social benefits, but also real economic growth. A growing body of evidence highlights the economic advantage of educating and empowering women. The private sector has seized on this data. There is now broad consensus that investing in women is not only just good social policy, it is ""smart economics,"" as Bob Zoellick, president of the World Bank, says. Toward that end, the World Bank has convened a Private Sector Leaders Forum with companies committed to these issues, such as Standard Chartered, Cisco, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Carlson and Nike. My own firm, Goldman Sachs, published two critical pieces of research, ""Womenomics"" and ""Women Hold Up Half the Sky,"" which found that investments in women -- through increased education and labor force participation -- can lead to real economic growth in developed and developing countries. Specifically, this research found that a 1 percentage point increase in female education raises the average level of gross domestic product by .37 and raises annual GDP growth rates by .2 on average. Such findings led to the development of 10,000 Women, an initiative that is working with a global network of leading academic and nonprofit partners to provide women at home and abroad with quality management and entrepreneurial education. This education is helping to create a greater number of female-owned small and medium enterprises, and a new generation of leaders poised to have exponential impact. One recent graduate of the program, Tuokpe Esisi, a fashion designer from Nigeria, has already increased her revenues, and immediately invested a portion of her profits to provide tutors for the illiterate male tailors she employs. This not only positions her enterprise for greater growth, but is also a perfect demonstration of the multiplier effect of investing in women. Organizations such as Women for Women International, Camfed and the International Center for Research on Women have long touted this multiplier effect and are supported by private-public partnerships dedicated to the promotion of women leaders. For example, the State Department, with the help of Vital Voices, instituted a mentoring program for the past four years with Fortune's Most Powerful Women. The program pairs leading U.S. executives -- such as Ann Moore (Time Inc), Pat Woertz (ADM), Helene Gayle (Care) and Anne Mulcahy (Xerox) -- with rising female entrepreneurs in developing countries. At the dawn of the 20th century, Egyptian poet Hafez Ibrahim said: ""When you educate a woman, you create a nation."" Nearly a century later, the cause of women's empowerment has never been more important. As New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof recently put it, gender inequality is ""the dominant moral challenge we face in the 21st century."" This challenge also presents an opportunity we cannot afford to squander. We should seize this moment and this momentum. There is tremendous work to be done, but history has shown us that women will not let us down. They will take up the challenge and build up their families, their villages and ultimately all our nations. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Dina Habib Powell.","Dina Powell: As we mark Women's Month, there are encouraging signs .

"(CNN) -- Actress, writer and director Nia Vardalos talks to CNN's Jack Gray about infertility, her new book and reprising the blockbuster role that made her famous. CNN: OK, full disclosure, we're friends. I've been to your house for Thanksgiving. Your book is called ""Instant Mom,"" so I'm assuming it's about how you'd like to adopt me. On the off chance it's not, please tell me what it's about and why you decided to write it. Vardalos: True, we are one slumber party away from being BFFs. And it's all thanks to the virtual wine bar where nice people now connect: Twitter. OK, back to me. I wanted to write about the tenaciously stubborn quest for happiness I believe lies within all of us. Plus I'm trying to blow the lid off the silent failure women feel about infertility. For years, I was ashamed, then via foster care found my daughter ... when she was almost 3 years old. I didn't adopt a baby. Hence the title. CNN: People feel like they know you by way of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" -- because that was a personal film in many ways -- but this book is actually much more personal, much more emotional. Was it tough to write? Because you're actually a very private person. Vardalos: I am nauseous from the acid reflux I'm having because I am going public in this book. Sure, I enjoy making fun of my family for fun and profit, but to reveal vulnerable truths like this is completely unlike me. However, I have a nagging feeling that the success of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" happened because I'm supposed to be using my big mouth to talk about adoption. CNN: You're primarily identified with comedies. Was it difficult to write about the incident when you were the victim of a crime? Vardalos: Terrifying. When I finished that chapter, I debated keeping it in because, well, now people will know. And although I describe it in what was, for me, excruciating detail, I eventually found the humor in the experience when I was writing about it because of the human idiocy I encountered after the incident. Anyway, it may be a mistake, but I kept it in. Then I told my mom. Nia Vardalos stays 'in the moment' CNN: What have you learned from your own mom? And, for that matter, what have you learned from Lainie Kazan, who played your mother in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""? Vardalos: My mom taught me to always conduct yourself as if a video camera is on you at all times. Lainie Kazan taught me to never sleep with my co-stars. CNN: Let's talk about the title, ""Instant Mom."" Be honest, did your publisher want to call it ""My Big Fat Greek fill-in-the-blank-with-something-about-parenting""? Vardalos: Here's a humblebrag: There were about 10 offers for this autobiography, and several wanted to call it ""My Big Fat Greek Baby."" Which is why I went with HarperCollins. CNN: What's that ""instant"" transformation like? One minute it's game night with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, and the next minute you have a daughter in preschool, right? Vardalos: Yep, one evening I'm waving on a red carpet whilst sucking in my gut, and the next day I was waving goodbye to my daughter as she walked into preschool, whilst sucking back my snot-bawling and wiping her spilled apple juice out of my Prada purse. CNN: Adoption advocacy, particularly adoption for children in foster care, is something you've been vocal about since long before you wrote this book. Do you feel like you're making progress? Vardalos: No. That's why I wrote this book. I wanted to write about these kids and the compassionate work these social workers and adoption attorneys do to place them in permanent homes. I call them super-pretty angels. Even the men. There is a how-to-adopt appendix, fully vetted by a social worker. This is the book I wished was out there when I was searching for credible information on how to adopt. CNN: But it's not just a book about adoption. It's actually not even a mom book. I think it's for everyone. Vardalos: Oh, you're good. Keep that in. CNN: Rachel Dratch, who, like you, is very funny and very smart, said your book made her laugh and cry, which is kind of the highest of compliments, rights? Vardalos: It is. I wrote this book in the same way I wrote ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"": I simply sat alone and poured my guts out into a computer keyboard, not caring how it would be received, not letting my mind wander into worrying what people would think of me. I didn't show it to anyone until it was printed, so it would be too late to make changes. I wanted to write unfettered by critique and concern on how it would be received or what it would do to my image. It's the most honest I've ever been, and yes, I'm petrified. But I write in the prologue that if something scares me, I tend to lean into it. I'm not brave. I'm more of a fearless idiot. CNN: Your husband, Ian Gomez (who stars in TBS's ""Cougar Town""), cooks a nice chicken dinner; you cook really good lasagna. Whose food does your daughter prefer? Vardalos: Her grandmother's. CNN: How did parenthood change your Hollywood life? Less clubbing, I assume. Vardalos: No, you've been over for dinner. You see we still snort poppers after dessert.

"(CNN) -- Join me in a thought experiment. Take two individuals, A and B. A is a naturally gifted professional immersed in a hyper-competitive field where performance is publicly scrutinized and frequently re-evaluated. Continuous pressure makes A seek any advantage to excel. He takes medications to gain a physical advantage over competitors while risking chronic health problems. B is a talented and motivated employee who has made innumerable sacrifices to get ahead at work. She is stressed by the knowledge that her productivity is always being analyzed and feels pressured to use any possible advantage to be the best. She takes a medication that makes her mentally sharper but could endanger her health. A is maligned baseball star Alex Rodriguez. B is your co-worker with the newly acquired job title who seems to work 90 hours per week, escaping fatigue by inexplicable means. Opinion: How A-Rod let us down . Is there really a significant difference between A and B, other than how much A has been publicly criticized? Not really. Their actions stem from the same premise: In competitive professional environments, winners do whatever is necessary to triumph. Your new VP may lack A-Rod's bulk and salary, but they share a common style. Rodriguez was recently suspended for 211 games for an alleged connection to a Florida clinic that has been accused of supplying professional athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. Even casual fans realize this action is the equivalent of a guilty verdict for doping. Your enthusiastically efficient, work-obsessed colleague with the new job title and beautifully renovated office down the hall shares a similar philosophy as athletes accused of doping: Take advantage of any available mechanism to succeed. Consequently, Person B pursues the controversial advantage conferred by ""neuroenhancement"" medications. In theory, these act as steroids for the mind. They include mixed amphetamine salts and other medications approved to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Whether or not the medications objectively enhance cognitive performance is still under investigation. There are theorized risks of increased rates of hypertension, heart failure and psychosis with their use, but there is no definitive evidence that the use of neuroenhancement medications imposes these risks. Nonetheless, some researchers are documenting that U.S. college students and professionals are increasingly using neuroenhancement medications for ""nonprescription use,"" which may include the use of the medication in healthy adults seeking a cognitive advantage. As contentious as the research on neuroenhancement may be, there is even less controlled research looking at the objective results and adverse effects of performance-enhancing drugs in athletics. Regardless of the outcomes that these medications achieve, the motivations of their consumers are the same. Whether doping for physical or cognitive enhancement, both parties are using medications with indeterminate efficacy and risk to obtain an advantage. The only difference is the level of regulation and scrutiny of the abusers and who is more likely to be punished for the abuse. Fear of public shaming and prosecution should not drive decision-making when it comes to the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. A-Rod has a large number of critics; at least one of them must have tried neuroenhancement to dominate in the office. This person may label A-Rod as a ""doper"" and question the validity of his achievements without acknowledging that his or her motivations may stem from similar desires. Fans who are critical of athletes need to apply the same standards to themselves and to the people in their lives. A pharmacologically derived professional advantage in the office should not be seen as more appropriate than a similar advantage gained in a stadium. A-Rod could potentially sit for hundreds of games as a consequence of the accusations against him. Maybe your new VP should forfeit that fancy new office for 211 days to maintain a moral norm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bryan Moore.","Bryan Moore: People who take neuroenhancement drugs to be sharper similar to A-Rod case .

"Hefei, China (CNN) -- Gu Kailai, the wife of a recently deposed top official in the Chinese Communist Party, raised no objections to the prosecution's charges in court Thursday that she and a family aide poisoned a British businessman last year, a court official said. The closely watched trial, which took place Thursday under tight security in the eastern city of Hefei, adjourned in the afternoon without the announcement of a verdict, said Tang Yigan, deputy head of the Hefei Intermediate People's Court. The hearing phase of the trial is over, and the verdict will be delivered at a later date after deliberations, Tang said, without giving a specific date. Read more: Why the Gu trial is important . The trial is the latest phase in the fall from grace of the prominent family of Bo Xilai, Gu's husband, who until earlier this year had appeared destined to join the elite committee of leaders at the top of China's ruling party. Gu and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, are accused of poisoning Neil Heywood, a 41-year-old British businessman, who was found dead in November in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, the city where Bo was the Communist Party chief. Chinese authorities have said that Gu and her son had ""conflicts"" with Heywood ""over economic interests"" and that she was motivated to kill the Briton because of fears for her son's safety. Prosecutors said in court Thursday that Gu and Zhang had invited Heywood to Chongqing from Beijing, according to Tang. The three of them drank alcohol and tea at Heywood's hotel, as a result of which the Briton got drunk and began vomiting, the prosecutors alleged. When he needed water, Gu gave Zhang some prepared poison that he put in Heywood's mouth, killing him that night, according to the prosecutors. Gu and Zhang didn't object to the account outlined by the prosecution, Tang said Thursday. Gu's lawyer made an argument for leniency based on diminished responsibility, he said. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . The saga involving Bo and Gu has become the most sensational Chinese political scandal in recent memory, creating an extraordinary set of challenges for the central government as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year. In an indication of its sensitivity, the trial is taking place in Hefei, in Anhui province, more than 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) east of Chongqing, where support for Bo and his family remains strong. In a related case, Chinese state media reported Thursday that four top Chongqing policemen will be tried for trying to cover up Heywood's murder to help Gu. The four -- Guo Weiguo , Li Yang , Wang Pengfei and Wang Zhi -- were charged July 30 and will face trial in Hefei on Friday, Xinhua and CCTV reported. They have been charged with ""acting with partiality and defeating the ends of justice,"" the outlets reported. Despite the location of Gu's trial Thursday, a heavy police presence and pouring rain from a nearby tropical storm, supporters of Bo appeared outside the courthouse in Hefei. Read more: Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal . Plainclothes officials tried to stop the supporters from talking to members of the news media, dragging away at least two of them and putting them into the back of a van. CNN and other members of the international news media were unable to enter the court to observe the trial, but two consular officers from the British Embassy in Beijing were allowed to sit in the court. ""This is definitely more than a criminal trial,"" said Wenran Jiang, a professor of political science at the University of Alberta. He added that the process is being closely watched for signs of what might happen to Bo, who is being investigated for ""serious discipline violations"" after being removed from his Chongqing and party posts. Gu's family had wanted to hire two prominent Beijing lawyers to represent her, but Chinese authorities have chosen two local attorneys to form her defense team, a family friend told CNN on Wednesday. The family planned to send one of the attorneys -- along with another well-known Beijing attorney -- into the courtroom as observers, with the approval of the court, said the friend, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the case. The cards appear to be stacked against Gu and Zhang, who are at the mercy of a Chinese court system that has been criticized by human rights advocates as being little more than a tool of the country's politically controlled state security apparatus. China's Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal . The conviction rate for first- and second-instance criminal trials in China stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report said, citing the Chinese Supreme People's Court. In other words, out of more than 1 million criminal defendants tried in 2010, a total of 999 were acquitted. ""In many politically sensitive trials,"" the U.S. report added, ""courts handed down guilty verdicts with no deliberation immediately following proceedings."" Gu and Zhang are unlikely to escape such summary justice. Read more: Bo and Gu on trial, in different ways . ""In this trial, frankly speaking, nobody believes that it's a totally independent judiciary and it will be judged just on the merits of the case,"" Jiang said. ""It has been managed by the most senior level of leadership at every step."" The defendants haven't seen their relatives since they were arrested in early April, a friend of Gu's family said last week. Bo has not been seen in public since he was stripped of his titles. When the murder charges were announced last month, Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported that ""the facts of the two defendants' crime are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable and substantial."" If convicted, the two could face the death penalty. International media reports have speculated about the nature of Heywood's work in China and his ties to the Bo family. He had lived in China for more than a decade and was married to a Chinese woman. Among the companies he advised was a consulting firm founded by former officers of the British spy agency MI6. The couple's son, Bo Guagua, who Xinhua reported was involved in the ""conflicts"" with Heywood, said in an e-mail Tuesday that he had submitted a witness statement to the defense team for his mother. ""I have faith that facts will speak for themselves,"" wrote Bo, 24, who graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in May. He previously attended Oxford, graduating in 2010. His illustrious education is an indication of the influence and ambitions of his family, which is now engulfed by scandal. As the son of Bo Yibo, one the ""eight immortals"" of the revolution that created modern China, Bo Xilai was considered a strong contender for promotion into the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo, whose nine members decide how to run China. Bo and Gu on trial, in different ways . He stood out as one of China's most dynamic and controversial politicians, notably for his populist policies in Chongqing that promoted Chinese Communist culture and aimed to crack down on organized crime. Gu is also descended from a revolutionary hero: Maj. Gen. Gu Jingsheng, a prominent military figure. Fluent in English, she is a lawyer who took a leading role in a legal battle in the United States involving several Chinese firms. She eventually won the lawsuit for the Chinese companies and later wrote a book about it. As well as being involved in her most notable professional triumph, the United States has also played a role in her undoing. The case she is now facing may never have come to light had it not been for an extraordinary series of actions by Wang Lijun, Bo's longtime lieutenant. Officials had quickly blamed Heywood's death on excessive alcohol consumption, and his body was cremated without an autopsy. But on February 6, Wang, the former police chief who had run the anti-crime push in Chongqing that helped to build Bo's reputation, sought refuge at the U.S. Consulate in nearby Chengdu. He wanted political asylum and apparently feared for his life. Media reports and online posts have claimed that he had clashed with Bo after suggesting that Heywood had been poisoned amid a business dispute with Gu. He gave information about Heywood's death to U.S. officials before he left the consulate and was taken into custody by Chinese security forces. The British government was made aware of Wang's comments and made a formal request to Chinese authorities to investigate the case on February 15. A month later, Xinhua announced that Bo had been removed as party secretary of Chongqing. And less than a month after that, Gu and Zhang were arrested. The case has forced the Communist leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high-ranking member in an unusually public way, according to Douglas Paal, a top China analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""The disruption of his departure from office and his wife's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people,"" Paal said. That united front has been key to ruling China for 2,000 years, he said. The current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989, when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

"London (CNN) -- UK authorities faced growing questions Saturday after passengers arriving at London's Heathrow Airport faced long lines at passport control. Waits of up to three hours were reported on Thursday night for non-European Union arrivals. More delays at immigration control were seen Friday night, according to UK media reports. The British Airports Authority (BAA), which runs Heathrow, said recent delays had been unacceptable but that it had no control over passport control. ""Immigration is a matter for the Home Office. Immigration waiting times during peak periods at Heathrow recently have been unacceptable and we have called on the Home Office to address the problem as a matter of urgency,"" a spokeswoman said. ""There isn't a trade-off between strong border security and a good passenger experience -- the Home Office should be delivering both."" There were queues of around an hour on Saturday morning, a BAA spokeswoman said, but lines appeared to be moving faster midday Saturday. The head of the UK Border Force, Brian Moore, defended its performance. ""We will not compromise border security but we always aim to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to meet demand,"" he said in a statement. ""The vast majority of passengers pass through immigration control quickly. Queues are caused by a number of factors, including incorrect flight manifests or early or late planes which result in bunching. ""The important factor is to have staff that are flexibly deployed in the right numbers at the right times and this is what we always try to do."" Moore said the agency was working with BAA to monitor flight arrivals and passenger movements for the rest of the weekend. The delays have caused heightened concern because London is preparing to receive large numbers of additional visitors in July and August when it hosts the Olympic Games. Leo Lourdes, from London, told CNN he fears this is a recurring problem at Heathrow after experiencing long delays on two journeys through Terminal 5 this month. Returning from a business trip to Germany Friday evening, he was greeted by ""massive, massive queues that stretched all along the corridors"" and scenes of confusion as bewildered passengers were herded into line. Three hours later, he finally made it to the front of the queue, where he saw only a few desks manned, he said. Many people around him seemed to be angry or disappointed by their welcome to the United Kingdom, especially with so many signs on display heralding the London 2012 Olympic Games, he said. On April 10 he was met by a similar scene when he returned from a holiday in Costa Rica, Lourdes said. ""It was ridiculous, so slow,"" he said. ""I know these days they have to be very stringent on security but there also seems to be a slight lack of customer responsiveness."" Passenger Chris Windebank also experienced long delays Thursday when he arrived back at Heathrow's Terminal 5 from a business trip to Berlin. He told CNN was yelled at by Heathrow security staff to ""get to the end the queue"" and when he questioned what was going on was told ""we don't know."" When he made it to the passport control for the EU, he found many of the desks unmanned, he said. There was ""no explanation, no apology. I felt I was treated like commodity, not a valued customer of the airport."" His experience at Heathrow compared very badly to the efficiency he saw at Berlin, Windebank said, and ""will kill business for Britain unless it is fixed."" Alastair Campbell, the former Downing Street communications chief under Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, tweeted Thursday: ""If this is what Heathrow T5 border queue is like on an average Thursday Olympic athletes should think about coming soon."" He said European Union passport holders were waiting just under an hour to get through immigration control, while non-EU passport holders were queuing for as long as three hours. Only three or four staff were on duty to process EU arrivals and three for non-EU arrivals, he said. Politician Keith Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, told the BBC that Immigration Minister Damian Green had been summoned before the committee to explain what was happening. Moore said the agency would be ready for the extra demand expected during the Olympic Games. ""We are fully prepared to manage busy periods during the Olympics and will be implementing our well rehearsed plans."" Heathrow, one of Europe's busiest airports, is building a special terminal to be used by departing athletes and officials for the three days after the Olympic Games ends. An extra 40,000 passengers are expected on August 13, the day after the Games finishes, compared with a normal day, BAA said in a statement. CNN's Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","NEW: Arriving passenger was greeted by ""massive, massive queues,"" much confusion .

"(CNN) -- Riddle: What is less popular than herpes, self-inflicted stupidity at its worst, and a gift to the GOP's tax reform agenda? Answer: The IRS' $4.1 million 2010 Anaheim Conference, where an on-stage artist was paid $17,000 to demonstrate ""painting as a learning tool."" Note to the IRS: Dean Obeidallah will paint your next conference for $400, plus room and board, if John Avlon fails to convince President Obama to shut you down. (We have heightened confidence, in light of NSA's cell phone record-collecting, that the White House is indeed listening to The Big Three podcast). Rarely do we kick off a Big Three podcast with unanimous outrage. The IRS, our least beloved federal agency, has managed to unite us. In my view, while waste, fraud and abuse is rampant in the federal government, this episode will prove especially helpful to the House Republicans' agenda to pass radical tax simplification measures before the 2014 Congressional elections. Next in the discussion: Is heckling an effective political tactic? Increasingly, some LGBT activists believe heckling is responsible for advancing their political agenda and LZ Granderson (@locs_and_laughs) chimes in on its value. In his CNN Opinion article in response to Mrs. Obama's incident at a D.C. fundraiser this week, LZ makes the case that heckling heightens attention to LGBT issues, suggesting that every major progressive step for the LGBT community during President Obama's administration has occurred in response to a public heckling incident. For Dean, heckling is personal, and he offers constructive advice to the heckled. First, never give up control of the spotlight to a disruptive audience member. Second, have a prepared zinger to quip back, like, ""I don't heckle you at work, I just come to McDonald's and order a big mac and fries."" Or, in the case of the first lady, Dean suggests she respond: ""Do you really want to heckle a person with access to drones?"" He offers other knee slappers, too. Finally, ""humble brag"" alert on Michael Douglas. The actor stoops to new lows while discussing his cancer and industrious sex life, but still manages to elevate the important health issue -- widespread HPV (human papilloma virus). While the details of his own cancer and comments appear confusing at best, it turns out Texas Gov. Rick Perry was right and Michele Bachmann was wrong. The HPV virus is linked to cervical cancer and some types of head and neck cancer, which the HPV vaccine can eliminate if administered to children and young adults. Perry as a GOP presidential candidate argued in favor of the availability and administration of this vaccine, while Bachmann, in our view, ridiculously suggested it would lead to increased sexual activity for children (which studies have disproved). Not quite the Angelina Jolie class act that brought the breast cancer gene into the public consciousness by sharing her choice to undergo a proactive double mastectomy, but Michael Douglas' disgusting bravado has still managed to contribute to public understanding of HPV ... ahh celebrity.

"(CNN) -- A teenage boy with a failing heart had been denied a chance at a heart transplant. But that decision was reversed this week, turning his family's frustration to joy. Anthony Stokes has been at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston since July 14, according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV. The hospital told his family the 15-year-old was ineligible for a spot on the heart transplant waiting list because of ""noncompliance,"" family friend Mark Bell told CNN. An August 7 letter from the hospital, which Bell provided to CNN, said that ""Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance, which is one of our center's contraindications to listing for heart transplant."" Noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow-up appointments. In a statement Tuesday, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta said, ""While there has been misinformation circulating, Children's cannot discuss the specifics of this case or any other case due to privacy rules."" The hospital earlier had said it was working ""closely with the family"" to find solutions. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston is in good standing, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the United States. Assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient doesn't strictly take all required medicines as directed, he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital, said Dr. Ryan Davies, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware, who is not involved with this case. But Bell said a doctor told the family that Anthony's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment. ""The doctor made the decision that he wasn't a good candidate because of that,"" Bell said. ""I guess he didn't think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen."" Anthony's mother, Melencia Hamilton, told CNN affiliate WGCL-TV that doctors said Anthony would live only three to six months if he didn't get the heart transplant. In the meantime, the story became public in local media. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Georgia chapter got involved because Anthony's family called, and the organization has ""a longtime relationship with the child,"" said the Rev. Samuel Mosteller, the chapter's president, . Mosteller said Anthony was judged based on ""tattoos and an ankle bracelet"" from a ""juvenile agency."" Bell said the detention was because Anthony got into ""an altercation to protect his younger brother."" On Tuesday, Bell said, a doctor delivered the groundbreaking news to the family: ""He said that Anthony has been approved to receive a heart. He put him on the transplant list."" Bell said doctors told Anthony he'll likely receive a new heart in about three to four months, but that this timetable could change. Anthony had no health problems before this summer, Bell said; the heart problem is not congenital. But he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting. His mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains. Bell said Anthony is excited and his mother overjoyed after the hospital's reversal. The teen is now considered top priority for a heart transplant; he just has to wait for one to become available. The complexity of transplants . Federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012, but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed. While waiting for a heart transplant, 331 people died. Dr. David Weill, medical director of Stanford University's Lung and Heart-Lung Transplant Program, said it's not unusual for patients to be rejected from organ transplant lists because of noncompliance -- in other words, if they are seen as people who won't follow instructions about taking medications and seeing doctors. At Stanford, Weill's group evaluates about 300 patients per year for lung transplants and turns down about 1% to 2% because of noncompliance. It's about the same for heart transplants as well, he said. As part of the evaluation process, organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen, Weill said. ""A few times a year, we run into people who can't,"" he said. A patient would not be turned down solely for having served prison time or having bad grades, Weill said, but ""we would want to look at the entire picture."" Some patients have been denied because they don't have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments. After a heart transplant, patients are too sick to do these things alone, Weill said. ""When we fear that someone's not going to do well, it's because the patient couldn't comply with the regimen or they don't have any support in their life,"" he said. Psychosocial factors don't change a person's priority on the waiting list, but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list, he said. The trouble with teens . Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, noted that patients have to adhere to a lifelong regimen after receiving an organ transplant -- showing up at medical appointments, taking medications, monitoring changes in health -- and teenagers in general don't have a good track record of following orders. Teenagers aren't automatically ruled out for heart transplants, but ""the consequence that 'you are going to die if you don't take these medicines' is far from the mind of a 17-year-old,"" said Davies, the cardiothoracic surgeon. Instead of denying Anthony a spot on the transplant list, Caplan suggested that the boy should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what's expected post-transplant -- that is, if the teenager can get a heart. Bell said the family didn't press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list. Personally, Bell attributes it to ""the handiwork of God and the media pressure."" In a video released by a family friend to CNN affiliate WSB before the reversal, Anthony plays chess and looks longingly outside his hospital window. The hospital did not comment on what led to doctors' change of heart. Read more: Girl who underwent lung transplants takes steps toward recovery .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- If he decides to run for president, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will need to push back against the inevitable pressure that he will encounter to move to the right. Christie has emerged as one of the most exciting potential candidates for the GOP, a Republican who has been popular in a blue state and who has demonstrated the kind of straight talk with the media that voters find appealing. In New Jersey, a recent poll shows 30% of the Democratic vote supporting Christie. His willingness to take on the barons of his own party, without capitulating to his Democratic opponents, has bolstered the impression that he would try to break the gridlock that has bogged down Washington, much as Barack Obama did as a presidential candidate in 2008. His emphasis on budgetary conservatism rather than social and cultural conservatism also has the potential to win over moderate voters. The conventional wisdom will quickly push him to placate the right, even before he officially starts running, just in terms of what he does in a second term as governor of New Jersey. For decades, pundits and experts have constantly warned that the nature of the presidential primary system means that a candidate has to move far to the right within the GOP if he or she is going to win over voters who tend come out for these contests, voters who veer toward the extremes of the political spectrum. Yet the conventional wisdom tends to overstate the political benefits that Republican presidential candidates derive from shifting to the right and downplays the damage that is caused by such moves. At the most basic level, moderate Republicans, often governors, who try to dramatically transform their images for primary voters are usually not very effective. Conservatives don't walk away feeling as if they are true bedfellows, and the rest of the voters are left to wonder how hard the candidate will really fight for a new agenda that crosses the partisan divide. Democrats are also given a treasure chest of controversial statements to paint their opponent as an extremist. In 2012, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney tried to convince the right that he was a true conservative with hardline statements on health care and taxes that clearly contradicted his own political record in the Bay State. Rather than running on his record, Romney started to run away from it and tried to pretend he was a very different kind of candidate, a politician who was ""severely conservative,"" as he later said. In the end, however, Republican primary voters did not pick Romney because he was a far-right conservative but because he appeared to be the most viable candidate for the general election. But by the time of the Republican convention, Romney's flip-flopping made it hard to sell himself to voters as something different, and Obama pounded away on the conservative statements that came out of the primaries as evidence that Romney really was a right-wing conservative, more out of the tradition of Barry Goldwater than the tradition of Nelson Rockefeller. The story of a Republican governor in a blue state who had been able to work with Democrats to solve big problems like health care was impossible to tell. Christie should realize that he will never be a Sen. Ted Cruz, even to right-wing voters. What he will be able to sell to them in the primaries is the claim that his straight-talking, pragmatic approach to Republican politics will do better in the general election against a formidable candidate like Hillary Clinton and would probably do more to actually advance the party as well as legislation that matters to those who support the GOP. This is his best argument for the primaries and for the general election. The Republicans who have done best in presidential elections have steered clear of the right and offered themes that united their coalition and even attracted some Democrats. In 1968 and 1972, Richard Nixon focused on the ""Silent Majority"" of Americans who were unhappy with the anti-war protests taking place in the colleges and the urban riots. His main message, one that had broad appeal, was that the war in Vietnam was a disaster and that he would do better. Ronald Reagan, though closely aligned with the conservative movement, built his campaign in 1980 around the themes of anti-communism and anti-taxation -- as well as attacks on Jimmy Carter. In 1988, George H.W. Bush did the same. His son George W. Bush promised voters an agenda of ""compassionate conservatism"" in 2000 and national security in 2004. Even the Republicans who gained the nomination and went on to lose in the general election tended to be the moderates in the primaries, not the candidates of the hard right. In 1976, President Gerald Ford fended off a strong challenge from Reagan, who at that point made little effort to hide his right-wing allegiance. In 1992, President Bush stifled a challenge from former Nixon speechwriter Patrick Buchanan, who made a hard pitch to social and cultural conservatives, while in 1996, Republicans picked Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole over right-wing candidates like Buchanan. In 2008, it was maverick and bipartisan bridge builder Sen. John McCain who won the nomination, a candidacy hurt only when he made his appeals to the right and undercut his greatest virtues as a politician, and in 2012, it was Romney rather than the huge cast of conservatives who filled the airwaves. In all of these cases, it is true that the candidates appealed to the right during key primaries like South Carolina, but it remains far from clear that their victories rested on these kinds of obvious moments of political posturing as much as the overall viability of their candidacy for November. The costs outweighed the benefits. The point is that in presidential campaigns, moderation can be a powerful tool for Republican candidates. Christie has made a lot of progress over the past year in positioning himself as a potential candidate. He should look at the historical record before taking the bait to shift right. If Christie makes too many statements that undermine his image, he might very well hand the next Democratic candidate a victory before the campaigns even get under way.

"Sheremetyevo Airport, Moscow (CNN) -- Fugitive Edward Snowden remains in the transit lounge of Russia's Sheremetyevo International Airport as he attempts to negotiate his way to asylum -- one month after arriving from Hong Kong. The former NSA contractor, who leaked details about a U.S. surveillance program, is requesting Russia take him in while he awaits safe passage to Latin America. While devoid of fresh air, Snowden's temporary home does have an extensive selection of cafes, shopping outlets, business lounges and smoking rooms within its 400,000-square-meter expanse of brightly lit space. For a small pack of international journalists who have been relentlessly following the Snowden saga, including me for a short time, the airport has been home (of a sort) for the past few weeks. READ MORE: The many mysteries of Snowden's transit zone . For those who may be passing through -- to find Snowden or for even less thrilling reasons -- here are five ways to kill time in Sheremetyevo, based on one reporter's excruciating 24 hours in the lounge. TGI Friday's . The ubiquitous all-American joint occupies prime real estate in Sheremetyevo airport: an outlet right near the gates used for flights to Cuba, where journalists initially suspected Snowden might make his sprint for freedom. The walls are adorned with Americana and a sprinkling of Brit culture; Farrah Fawcett and the Beatles share corner space while a small but authoritative statue of astronaut Neil Armstrong oversees the party. Bon Jovi and Nirvana rock the house while travelers bound for Prague, Seoul, St. Petersburg and other sunnier places trundle past. READ MORE: Snowden's future uncertain after retracted tweet . While on Snowden stakeout, I enjoyed fluffy American pancakes -- best 195 rubles you'll ever spend for nap food. They were small and only gently warm, but, with a dose of mango jam, perfectly sweet. Ideal with a strict black coffee. Back at TGI Friday's for lunch (not much else to do), I selected the ""Perfect Ten"" smoothie, a refreshing mix of orange juice, pineapple, honey, nuts and peaches with cream and sorbet. I'd have been happy to score one for Snowden if he'd only have showed himself. Shopping for Matryoshka dolls, vodka, crystals . For those who have everything -- come to Sheremetyevo for the one thing you don't. Browsing the long corridors between terminals E, D and F reveals a Swarovski crystal shop that sells a four-inch-high Hello Kitty doll, complete with pink bow and hearts. The crystal-encrusted kitty is a snip at €500 euros (duty free treasures can be bought in both euros and Russian rubles). READ MORE: Why we're all stuck in a digital transit zone . Or there's always a crystal clutch bag for a slightly more palatable €430. If you get sick of waiting for the next cherished Snowden appearance, there's an ""igniting liquid"" (according to the label) barrel of vodka for €65 to keep you entertained. No explanation is offered for why this booze is more flammable than any other in Russia. Maybe it has something to do with your breath after loitering for a day in an airport. You might invest in another very Russian delight: Matryoshka dolls. EXPLORE: Snowden's asylum options . Row upon row are laid out in the glass cabinets of the more traditional shops. Their pretty colors, gold scarves and luxurious lashes glow under bright lights, making them almost irresistible for the bored shopper. Capsule snoozing . The Capsule Hotel is a sparse and efficient place to put one's head for a few hours. The outlet where I bedded down for some non-Snowden shuteye, near Terminal E, offers 46 rooms of utilitarian convenience in duck shades of blue and green. I checked into the only type of room left; one without windows. The sound of vacuum cleaners reverberated through the walls. The shower sprayed water all over the floor when I turned it on. GALLERY: Long history of spilling secrets . For a passenger looking for simplicity at a transient time, however, the Capsule Hotel does what it's supposed to do. Small white hand and body towels, snuggled on top of each pillow, completes the operation's simple competence. But I didn't want to sleep long -- there might have been action on the Snowden story. Space-age lounging . My airline loyalty program entitled me to three hours in the appropriately named orange-on-orange-on-silver Galaktika lounge, next to Terminal E. The lounge's sparse selection of inhabitants included a small dog which, as I invaded its personal space, erupted in high-pitched barks and attempted to bite my ankles. At this point I was sleep deprived, and it was a terrifying moment. The buffet offered little to ease my frazzled vegetarian nerves. READ MORE: Obama on collecting intelligence . There was a spread of pastry-heavy pies on offer in cabbage, meat, spinach, cheese, cottage cheese, mushroom, cherry and apple. All looked remarkably similar. I partook, instead, in the marzipan squares out of the fridge. They were slightly sloppier than expected and very sweet. I didn't go back for seconds. I tried my luck in the Classic Lounge, which looked rather more luxurious, but was turned away. It was empty, but I didn't have the right kind of ticket. At least they let me take a picture, which you can see above. Snowden stakeout . Being on the Snowden airport trail can be a frustrating experience. Every man with three moles scattered up the left side of his face could be him; but such men are rare. I returned to London without having spotted him. EXPLORE: Notable leakers and whistleblowers . Snowden did emerge on July 13, the first time he'd been seen publicly since leaving Hong Kong on June 23. He met with human rights activists and told them he was requesting temporary asylum from Russia. A flurry of media activity met that appearance, but the steady troop of journalists through Sheremetyevo has since slowed. Finding journalists skulking around the airport is now almost as tricky as finding Snowden himself. Snowden will apparently be exiting the airport within days -- but in this global game of diplomatic cat and mouse, nothing can be assumed. At least Snowden's got the airport's top attractions to keep him entertained.","A month after arriving, Edward Snowden remains in Russia's Sheremetyevo airport .

"(CNN) -- Cloud cover and higher humidity slowed the growth of a wildfire burning in central Idaho this weekend, but officials warned they're not out of the woods yet. The Beaver Creek Fire has burned some 100,916 acres, up from nearly 93,000 on Saturday and 64,000 acres on Friday. It is 9% contained. ""It's pretty tough all the way around,"" said Stephen Dane, a fire spokesman. ""But we have some veteran firefighters who know what they are doing and they are fighting their hearts out. They are doing an amazing job, working night and day. They are not giving this fire any slack."" Approximately 1,200 firefighters are working the blaze, with the help of helicopters, bulldozers and conventional engines, Dane said. The fire, located northwest of Hailey and some six miles south of Ketchum, has forced nearby residents to flee. Mandatory evacuation orders had grown from 1,600 homes to more than 2,200 homes by late Saturday afternoon. ""I remember how fast those flames can move. I just got out of there,"" David Seidler, a Ketchum resident, told CNN affiliate KTVB. ""This is real serious, I was prepared to leave anyway. And it was only as I was going out, I saw the police there. They said, 'It's mandatory.' I said, 'It's mandatory for me right now anyway.'"" According to Dane, the fire has scorched eight structures so far, including a commercial building. No one has been injured. He said that he'd heard that Sun Valley -- home to a well-known ski resort -- was using snow blowers and sprinklers to shoot water on the mountainside. ""There's still a bit of distance before the fire would get to Bald Mountain, the ski resort area, but they are protecting the area just in case,"" he said. The Beaver Creek Fire was ignited by lightning on August 7. It's not the only fire burning in the state. At least nine large fires have scorched 407,883 acres across Idaho, which is experiencing the most wildland fire activity of any state, according to the Boise-based National Interagency Fire Center. ""As some of the other large fires in Idaho such as the Elk Fire have ramped down, we have been able to transfer a lot of resources from there to the Beaver Creek Fire,"" said Jennifer Mislivy, a fire spokeswoman. ""Also, if conditions do not get worse, we will be able to lift some mandatory evacuations about 9 tomorrow morning, possibly allowing residents of about 200 homes to return,"" she said. CNN's Paul Vercammen and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Beaver Creek Fire has scorched more than 100,000 acres .

"(CNN) -- President Obama commended the progress of African-Americans in a speech on the 100th anniversary of the NAACP, but said there was still much work to be done. President Obama addresses the NAACP in New York Thursday night on the group's 100th anniversary. Speaking at the organization's annual convention in New York, the city where the organization was founded, Obama evoked symbols of the civil rights movement to describe the NAACP's influence on race relations in the United States. ""What we celebrate tonight is not simply the journey the NAACP has traveled, but the journey that we, as Americans, have traveled over the past 100 years,"" Obama told a star-studded crowd that included music producer Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and poet Maya Angelou, to name a few. But Obama said ""the pain of discrimination is still felt in America"" among African-Americans, Latinos and Muslim-Americans. ""Even as we inherit extraordinary progress that cannot be denied; even as we marvel at the courage and determination of so many plain folks -- we know that too many barriers still remain,"" he said. Watch Obama's speech to the NAACP . ""What is required to overcome today's barriers is the same as was needed then. The same commitment. The same sense of urgency. The same sense of sacrifice. The same willingness to do our part for ourselves and one another that has always defined America at its best."" The ""steepest"" barriers are not prejudice and discrimination, he said, but the ""structural inequalities that our nation's legacy of discrimination has left behind."" Obama highlighted some of his administration's policies as examples of how the government is attempting to break down the barriers of inequity. ""These are barriers we are beginning to tear down by rewarding work with an expanded tax credit; making housing more affordable; and giving ex-offenders a second chance. These are barriers that we are targeting through our White House Office on Urban Affairs, and through Promise Neighborhoods that build on Geoffrey Canada's success with the Harlem Children's Zone,"" he said. ""When it comes to higher education, we are making college and advanced training more affordable, and strengthening community colleges that are a gateway to so many with an initiative that will prepare students not only to earn a degree but find a job when they graduate; an initiative that will help us meet the goal I have set of leading the world in college degrees by 2020,"" he said. Obama said the economy has made progress difficult, but assured the audience that his administration was working to ""lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity"" for future generations. ""One pillar of this new foundation is health insurance reform that cuts costs, makes quality health coverage affordable for all, and closes health care disparities in the process. Another pillar is energy reform that makes clean energy profitable, freeing America from the grip of foreign oil, putting people to work upgrading low-income homes, and creating jobs that cannot be outsourced,"" he said. The president also talked about the need ""to recapture the same sense of responsibility in Washington and in our own lives"" that propelled the civil rights movement. ""In particular, when it comes to education, we need better standards in our schools, excellent teachers in our classrooms, and parents doing their part to ensure that all our children can succeed, no matter what their race, faith or station in life,"" a senior administration official said. He urged families to help children with their homework, to put away the Xbox and encourage them to be more than ""ballers and rappers"" ""We have to say to our children, yes, if you're African-American, the odds of growing up amid crime and gangs are higher. Yes, if you live in a poor neighborhood, you will face challenges that someone in a wealthy suburb does not. But that's not a reason to get bad grades, that's not a reason to cut class, that's not a reason to give up on your education and drop out of school,"" he said, eliciting applause from the audience. ""No one has written your destiny for you. Your destiny is in your hands -- and don't you forget that,"" he said. The excitement over Obama was in stark contrast to the reception of former President Bush, who had a strained relationship with the NAACP and declined the group's invitations for five years. Bush spoke before the NAACP in 2000, during his first run for the presidency, but he did not make another appearance until 2006. But now, even though there's a new president and a new dynamic, there are still some questions as to whether the NAACP and Obama share the same approach. ""I think his big challenge now is going to be in talking to them about issues that have concerned him in the past, like problems with teen pregnancy and black-on-black crime, that the NAACP hasn't been that eager to deal with,"" said Clarence Page, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune editorial board. Earlier this week, Michael Steele, the first African-American chair of the Republican National Committee, addressed the NAACP and urged its members to take another look at the Republican Party. Steele on Thursday reiterated that message, telling CNN, ""There's a historic and inextricable link between the GOP and African-Americans. In fact, Republicans helped found the NAACP back in 1909."" The Republican Party, however, has not received more than 11 percent of the African-American vote since 1996. Obama received 95 percent of the black vote in the 2008 election. According to a national poll conducted in May, African-Americans really like Obama, but more and more feel that race relations have not gotten better since he took office. In December, 51 percent of African-Americans said Obama's election marks the start of a new era of better race relations, according to a CNN/Essence Magazine/Opinion Research Corp. poll. In May, that number dropped to 44 percent. The historic election of the first African-American president in the United States highlights the NAACP's role in fighting for equality and opportunity. NAACP President Ben Jealous said that while Obama's presidency is a big milestone, it's just the next step on a long road. ""This is a big step that we've taken, having a black family in the White House, ending that 233-year-old color barrier, but there's a lot more work that needs to be done,"" he said. CNN's Kristi Keck, Suzanne Malveaux and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Energy reform, access to education will pave way to prosperity, Obama says .

"(The Frisky) -- Breaking the hearts of ""Transformers""-loving men everywhere, Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green tied the knot at the Four Seasons in Hawaii last weekend. During their first engagement, Green had said, ""Originally we were talking elopement and now we might have a few people there."" I understand that celebrities want to keep everything under wraps so they don't have to deal with paparazzi helicopters drowning out their vows, but come on -- give us a little something. The Frisky: 10 stars who (maybe) have secret babies . Alanis Morissette got secretly married to rapper Souleye in May in an intimate ceremony at their shared home. And it was another two weeks before anyone heard about it! Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady got married in a tiny ceremony in Santa Monica. Apparently, Gisele and her three dogs were all wearing Dolce & Gabbana and the ceremony was so secretive that the guests didn't know it was a wedding -- many of them thought it was a christening! I wonder if Tom's ex, Bridget Moynahan, was under that impression when she arrived with Brady's son, John Edward Thomas Moynahan? The Frisky: Angelina Jolie says ""yes"" daughter Shiloh wants to be a boy . Jason Lee keeps breaking my heart -- first with the Scientology, and then with marriage! In July 2008, the actor married Ceren Alkac in a secret wedding, which was followed a month later by their less-secret baby daughter. It was kind of cute when Mandy Moore and Ryan Adams got married in Savannah, Georgia. The couple broke up briefly after Adams said he couldn't deal with the cameras, but I guess they compromised by dropping off the radar. Moore said of her hubby, ""He's a good egg. I'm in awe of him: his brain, his passion. He's truly one of a kind. The Frisky: Stars who ended their relationships to chase fame .

He was at the festival promoting ""Winnie,"" the biopic of Nelson Mandela's wife, in which he stars opposite Jennifer Hudson. In 2008, Jessica Alba and Cash Warren managed to have a hush-hush marriage in the Beverly Hills courthouse. There were no guests at the wedding aside from the courthouse staff that filed their marriage license paperwork. In fact, Alba's brother didn't find out until Us Weekly called him for comment.

"(CNN) -- North Carolina's Senate passed a restrictive abortion bill Thursday, and it now heads to Gov. Pat McCrory, who is expected to sign it. The bill was passed by North Carolina's House of Representatives this month. The bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed. The bill would also allow North Carolina's health department to make temporary new rules for the state's 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit. It prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, from paying for abortions -- though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman's life. ""The recent House version allows the medical professionals at the Department of Health and Human Services to write the rules which will ensure women's safety. I want to thank those who worked on an improved bill which will better protect women while not further limiting access,"" McCrory said after the House bill passed. Planned Parenthood called on the governor to veto the legislation. The group said more than 35,000 people signed a petition urging him to do just that. ""Make no mistake: These dangerous and deeply unpopular restrictions would endanger women's health and safety. Governor McCrory should keep the promise he made to North Carolina women during his campaign and veto the bill sent to him today by the legislature,"" Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. ""This bill would take women back 40 years, and we won't go back,"" she said. CNN's Joe Sutton and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Gov. Pat McCrory is expected to sign the legislation .

"(CNN) -- Among the familiar faces in Woody Allen's new film ""Blue Jasmine"" is one less familiar these days, someone who hasn't been seen on the big screen in 12 years: Andrew Dice Clay. In the role of Sally Hawkins' blue collar ex-husband, the crass comedian's appearance might be a surprise to some, especially with his character's vanity-free gray hair. ""You know what? I'm not 20 years old anymore!"" Clay said with a laugh. ""I do color my hair, and they did enhance the gray, but I was like, 'Oh, man!' "" Allen rediscovered Clay along with the rest of America when the Diceman played a version of himself as a comic looking for a comeback in a five-episode arc on ""Entourage."" Coincidentally, it triggered his own comeback, which Clay prefers to call ""a resurgence."" ""It's an unbelievable thing to me,"" he said. ""I've always had belief in myself, belief that I could come back, and I've always sort of marched to the beat of my own drum, but to get this movie and to work with all these people -- Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Sally Hawkins -- some of the greats, I'm nothing but humbled by this experience."" These days, Clay knows from humble. Three years ago, ""during the recession,"" he was down on his luck and in need of cash, so he headed to Las Vegas to try to his luck at blackjack. ""It was a tough time,"" he said. ""Desperate times call for desperate measures."" During his gambling spree, Clay earned a little over a million dollars, but it was easy come, easy go. ""After I took care of some bills and bought some cars, I lost most of it,"" he said. ""I call it the summer of 'The Hangover,' because it was just a party."" By the end of that summer, Clay was broke again. (It's a scenario that proved helpful for his ""Blue Jasmine"" character, Augie, who won $200,000 in a lottery, only to lose it all in an ill-advised investment.) Strangely enough, ""that whole thing led to 'Entourage,' "" Clay said. While lamenting his lack of funds with his son at a local Starbucks, the comedian ran into an old friend, who connected him with a mutual friend the very next day: ""Entourage"" creator Doug Ellin. And with the extended arc Ellin gave him, Clay was once again in demand. ""I was like, 'You know what? I'll just rebuild my standup career,' "" Clay said. A Showtime comedy special followed, along with a residency at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas. ""And through all this, I get the call that Woody Allen wants to meet with me,"" he said. ""I thought my manager was messing with me!"" Clay met with Allen on Park Avenue -- a location seen and cited in ""Blue Jasmine"" as the most desirable of New York addresses, one that means wealth, class and elegance to the titular and very status-conscious character Jasmine (played by Blanchett). ""We spoke about comedy, where we both started out, where we both grew up"" in Brooklyn, Clay said of his meeting with the director. ""And I couldn't believe it. He's one of the people in Hollywood I have a lot of respect for, because he's done movies that have made me laugh, 'Broadway Danny Rose' being one of my favorites."" Allen explained that he wanted the comedian/actor to do something meaty for him. Up until now, Clay had a spotty film career, the highlights being a cameo as Jon Cryer's friendly bouncer in 1986's ""Pretty in Pink,"" a part as Lea Thompson's macho suitor in the 1988 raunchy comedy ""Casual Sex?"" and a starring role in 1990's ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane."" Usually, his character was an extension of his on-stage persona, the Diceman (called the Vin Man in ""Casual Sex?""). ""I refer to that persona as a brick wall,"" Clay said. ""Nothing bothers Dice. Nothing. If Dice breaks up with a girl at 8 p.m., another one will be coming over at 8:10."" That persona was popular in films for a bit: ""Casual Sex?"" reshot the ending to give him a happy ending with Thompson's character, Clay said, ""because audiences wanted more of the Vin Man."" But ""Ford Fairlane"" was a critical and commercial bomb, and Clay's movie career never quite recovered. Allen didn't care. After watching him on ""Entourage,"" he thought Clay would be perfect for the role of Augie (for which he originally considered Louis C.K., until he decided he was ""too nice"" and gave him a different role). At the beginning of ""Blue Jasmine,"" we're told that Augie and Ginger (Hawkins' character) are divorced and that he used to hit her. But even in flashbacks of their marriage, he's not violent. ""Woody told me, 'Well, you know, he gets drunk; maybe he smacks his wife around a little,' "" Clay said. ""And then I read the lines, and the lines didn't really match up to that. He seemed like a regular guy who want to take care of his family, who wants the best for his family, and the guy is just crushed."" Clay wonders whether Allen told him that his character was a brute to get his mind ""in a certain place"" and if that was part of the director's method. ""Whatever it was, it did the trick,"" he said. With that direction, he was able to find hidden depths to Augie and do something he felt he'd ""never approached before on film,"" which was play ""a real human being, a full person,"" essentially, to act. ""It was kind of thrilling,"" the comic said. To help his character's antagonism toward his sister-in-law, Jasmine, she of the ill advice that caused him to lose his money and his marriage, Clay drew upon his relationships with his former Beverly Hills neighbors. ""Oh, they hated me in Beverly Hills,"" he chuckled. ""Once you have a certain reputation, you have problems, and the Brooklyn in me would come out."" If he could do it again, Clay said, he'd work with Allen ""any day."" ""All he needs to do is call and say, 'I need you on Broadway and 42nd Street tomorrow,' and I'm there,"" Clay said. ""That's how great I think he is."" In the meantime, Clay hopes to recruit some actors himself. He's looking for someone to play him in the film adaptation of his upcoming memoir, ""The Filthy Truth."" Clay said James Franco met with him to discuss the part. ""It was funny to watch, actually,"" Clay said. ""By the time he left the room, he was doing an impersonation, not of my stage persona but of the way I am as myself, when I'm not on stage."" Whoever takes the part, Clay is bracing himself for the surreality of seeing himself on screen in a whole new way. ""It's weird enough to see myself on screen playing a part!"" he said with a laugh. ""That's going to be strange.""","Andrew Dice Clay is making a resurgence .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Did a Georgia mother conspire with her boss to have her husband murdered? That's the case against Andrea Sneiderman, who is likely to go in front of a jury in August. Sneiderman is charged in the slaying of her husband, Rusty Sneiderman, who was shot and killed execution-style in front of their son's day care center in suburban Atlanta in 2010. Sneiderman's boss, Hemy Neuman, was found guilty of the crime, but mentally ill in 2012. Neuman said an angel sent him on a mission to kill Rusty Sneiderman. But during the course of the trial, both Neuman's defense lawyers and the prosecution agreed on one thing: Andrea Sneiderman had a hand in the murder, too. She now faces 16 counts, including felony murder, in connection with the shooting. She has entered a plea of not guilty, with her lawyers issuing a statement saying she ""categorically"" denies each and ""every one of the charges"" filed against her. But if the allegations are true, what could have possibly driven Sneiderman to have any part in her husband's murder -- or to carry on an affair with Neuman, as has been alleged? Court testimony in Neuman's trial and family interviews in the media portray Rusty Sneiderman as a man who served on the boards of nonprofits and always wanted to help others. He even tried to help advance Andrea Sneiderman's career. But testimony from forensic psychiatrist Dr. Tracey Marks, a witness for the defense, shed a different light on their relationship, some of the nature of which was gleaned from e-mails. ""The e-mails between Hemy and Andrea were also discussing how there was tension in Andrea's home between her and her husband,"" Marks testified. ""She was dissatisfied to say the least with his involvement with taking care of the children or even offering her support to be able to help with the children while she worked."" Was that -- or anything else -- enough to lead Sneiderman into the arms of Neuman, as prosecutors claim? Dr. Tiffanie Davis Henry is a sex therapist who has practiced for 13 years, and though she has not treated either party in this case, she says there are common characteristics many people share: ""In general, people cheat because they are looking to fulfill something that is missing in their primary relationship. That could range from feelings of excitement, lust, a more robust sexual experience or simply a need to feel cared about or loved."" For her part, Sneiderman has denied the prosecutor's claims that she ever cheated on her husband. But testimony during Neuman's trial called the nature of their relationship into question, outlining how the pair's relationship evolved over the course of six months. Witnesses said Sneiderman and Neuman traveled the country together and exchanged hundreds of e-mails. Marks testified that if anyone knew Neuman was delusional, it would be Sneiderman. ""We don't know if she was able to predict what Mr. Neuman ultimately did, but we can say that if she had handled things differently in her relationship with him (and with her husband, for that matter), Rusty may indeed be alive today,"" Henry told HLN in an interview. According to court testimony, the pair went on several work-related trips together, and it was on a trip to Norfolk, Virginia -- their second -- that Neuman began to feel a special connection with Sneiderman, sharing with her the hard times he had growing up at a boarding school. But it wasn't until the third trip to Minden, Nevada, in mid-July that he first revealed his fondness for her, Sneiderman testified. She also told the court that following wine and dinner, he read her a love poem, insinuating that she was beautiful. According to testimony from Marks, Neuman says he gave Sneiderman a foot massage, but she made it clear she would not leave her husband. She did tell him she fantasized about him, according to Marks. ""Although both admitted that she repeatedly told him she had no intention of leaving her husband, her actions provided encouragement to his inappropriate advances,"" Henry told HLN. The court heard testimony that their next trip took them to Colorado, where Neuman tried to get the hotel staff to buy chocolates and flowers to leave in her room, but he settled on a note instead. According to the front desk manager at a Hampton Inn, Sneiderman requested a room change. When she checked in on July 18 she had a room with two queen beds, but on the 21st she requested a room with one bed for two guests, the manager testified. On August 26, 2010, the pair traveled to Greenville, South Carolina, where the two got adjoining rooms and drank wine and watched a movie together while on the same bed in their pajamas, according to courtroom testimony. The next day, Sneiderman told Neuman she felt terrible and that she would have to ""repent"" for the rest of her life. ""When the immediate gratification of the affair wears off, many are left with the aftermath, the devastation that their affair has caused, and they can find it quite difficult to live with,"" Henry told HLN. ""This inability to cope can lead to anything from denial, depression, anxiety, lashing out at others and even lashing out at oneself, which could unfortunately include self-harming behaviors."" A few days later, on August 29, Neuman asked Sneiderman in an e-mail to marry him. The pair traveled to Scotland and Greenville, South Carolina, a second time before Rusty Sneiderman's murder, according to court testimony. It was during their second trip to South Carolina, a local bartender testified, that he saw them dancing and kissing. A therapist testified that Neuman said the pair were in fact physically intimate and that the next day, Sneiderman again told Neuman she would not leave her husband and expressed regret. But in testimony, Sneiderman denied kissing or being in any way physically intimate with Neuman. ""This type of back and forth can be very confusing, especially when directed towards someone who has romantic feelings for you,"" Henry said."" When in love, we want so desperately for things to work out, for love to prevail over all. I don't know that we have evidence of a conversation between Neuman and Sneiderman where they plotted and planned for Hemy to take Rusty's life. What I think is clear is that Sneiderman led Neuman, consciously or unconsciously, to believe that there was potential for a relationship in the future."" According to testimony and e-mails revealed in court, while Neuman shared his feelings for Sneiderman, she shared hundreds of photos of her children with him, but Rusty Sneiderman is not in any of the photos. ""Whether Sneiderman knew of his delusion or not, I find it highly inappropriate for a mother to send this many pictures of her underage children to her boss,"" Henry said. ""I can't think of any scenario where that would be appropriate, especially without my husband's knowledge."" So what does all this behavior add up to? ""The fact that she never went to HR"" -- the company's Human Resources Department -- ""that she never told her husband about Hemy's advances, the fact that she engaged her husband in a relationship with Mr. Neuman, all speak to a destructive pattern of seeking the attention, affection and insatiable needs of someone other than her husband."" Will this and other testimony lead jurors to convict Sneiderman in her husband's murder? Jury selection begins July 29, and HLN will take viewers inside the courtroom then.","Andrea Sneiderman is set to go on trial soon in her husband's shooting death .

"LONDON, England -- Friedel and Robert Borisewitz have led extraordinary lives. Jewish citizens born in Antwerp, Belgium, they survived the Holocaust by fleeing to Brazil with fake documents. Long lives: Friedel, 92, and Robert Borisewitz, 97 still lead an active life. Friedel later survived severe tuberculosis, and while both have experienced personal tragedy during their long lives, they have refused to be crushed by it. What is most remarkable is that at the age of 92 and 97 respectively, Friedel and Robert are as dynamic and full of life as people 30 years their junior. Friedel especially is, according to her friends, a ""miracle"" of nature. When she reveals her age -- which she almost never does -- people are often shocked. In her day Friedel was a striking beauty, and that glamour and grace is still evident today. See more photos of the couple » . Since the age of 13 Friedel says she has exercised every day. She plays golf regularly and often spends weekends in the picturesque seaside town of Knokke, off the coast of Belgium. She swims regularly in waters that many of her compatriots find too cold to enter. Her interest in healthy living started early in life. ""Until the age of 13, I was a little ball, slightly round, and my piano teacher told me I should exercise. ""Since then, I have always been very active"" said Friedel, who never misses her daily a.m. work-out television show. Except for one lapse, Friedel has always maintained healthy eating habits. ""When we arrived in Brazil we ate too much as there had been very little food during the escape. Jewish food is also not particularly healthy. ""That slightly destroyed my stomach and I have since cooked very healthily -- many fruits and vegetables and very little fat."" Nevertheless, when it comes to food, Friedel says her husband, who she married in 1941 in Brazil, is not as disciplined. ""He has always been constantly hungry; he loves eating and drinking a lot,"" Friedel told CNN. But with Friedel in charge of the cooking, Robert has had little choice but to eat healthy ingredients. In the last year, Robert's concentration and memory have deteriorated, but Friedel says she notices a difference when Robert has been active. ""I can see his mind works better when he has been outside the four walls of our apartment and going for walks, even if he now walks very slowly."" Today, Friedel is more determined than ever to continue her healthy lifestyle. ""You will never hear me say I've had enough, even if I do feel tired at times,"" she told CNN. ""My father thought it was a sin to give up. Now I would like to live for as long as is possible."" Friedel admits she sometimes thinks about death: ""I just wonder how it will happen. It's like being pregnant with your first child -- you wonder how it's going to happen. ""The difference is that when you are pregnant for the first time, people give you advice and tell you how it's going to be."" But Friedel, who speaks six languages fluently, doesn't dwell on the subject. She prefers to concentrate on the present. ""When I was ill with tuberculosis at the age of 38 and in hospital for almost a year, my doctor told me it was a good lesson in wisdom to have experienced illness. It means I will always yearn to make up for lost time.""","Both in their 90s the Borisewitz are still living a healthy, active life .

"(CNN) -- It's a snapshot meant to shock: a bloodied woman hunched over with this caption underneath, ""My mother knew I'd never hurt her, then she got in the way."" Graphic ads about the dangers of meth addiction are trying to tackle what's a top drug problem in small towns. The Meth Project has made a name for itself with graphic, disturbing print and broadcast ads meant to wake up kids to the dangers of methamphetamine addiction. Another ad shows a filthy urinal with the caption, ""No one thinks they'll lose their virginity here. Meth will change that."" The nonprofit organization said it's baring the ugly truth about what the Drug Enforcement Administration calls the most dangerous drug problem of small-town America. Now the Meth Project is targeting a new audience: the growing population of Spanish-speaking teens in the Western United States. It's releasing television commercials in Spanish in Arizona and radio ads throughout the West featuring young Latino addicts sharing real-life meth nightmares. Nothing is lost in translation. In Idaho, one of the Spanish radio voices belongs to recovering addict Aucensio Flores. In his ad, Flores said he first tried meth at 15 and headed on a downward spiral, adding: ""I think it affected my brain. I have bad thoughts and I only want to do bad things, such as hurt people. I think I am going crazy."" Flores said meth deadened his conscience, emboldened him and kept him up all night with an edgy high. Meth made it easier, he said, to become sucked into a world of crime and gangs. Flores remembers beating up and robbing people just walking down the street and taking part in drive-by shootings, including one in which ""I shot 17 shots into the house and then I walked around the block and back into the car and just left."" Meth made him feel ""big and bad,"" said Flores, who never imagined being locked up. He's serving time at the Nampa Juvenile Correction Center in Idaho for grand theft, possession of a weapon by a minor, and drug possession. Flores' drug rehabilitation counselor, Colleen Foster, said that up to 40 percent of juveniles in the Nampa facility have a history of meth addiction. She said meth takes over their lives. ""It starts to destroy their value system. It eats away at every aspect of their life: family, responsibility to community, responsibility to education, responsibility to themselves even,"" Foster said. ""It just eats away at all that until they have no value system left, that the only thing they're doing is seeking for that high."" Foster supports the Meth Project's Spanish ad campaign because, she said, denial of the problem extends to teenagers and parents in all populations -- including Latinos. She said she thinks outreach needs to be better tailored for the growing Latino community in Idaho. Foster also counsels Yair Perez, a recovering meth addict who served time for robbery and was released recently from the juvenile detention center. ""When I was coming down from meth, I would feel bad. You know, I threw up and I couldn't eat. Even if I was hungry, I couldn't eat,"" Perez said. ""You know, I would just stay in my room and not talk to anyone, because they would make me mad when they talked to me."" While on meth, Perez said, he also developed frightening ulcerlike sores on his body and suffered from an erratic heartbeat. Still, he said, his cravings for the drug persist and he knows staying clean won't be easy. He's gotten a job at a fast-food restaurant, is reconnecting with his family and has recorded a Spanish radio ad for the Meth Project. Perez said he hopes to reach young Latinos who aren't getting the message about meth in English. ""They might understand a little bit of it or half of it,"" he said.  ""But if they hear it ... in their own language ... the way they were born and they were raised, you know, speaking Spanish, then maybe they will pay a little more attention to it and maybe think about it, instead of doing it."" Idaho Meth Project volunteer Miguel Mouw agrees, saying that ""in the Hispanic community, there's just a lack of education, a lack of treatment and resources, there's a lack of support, because there are some communication gaps."" Mouw, also a recovering meth addict, speaks in classrooms throughout Idaho and at community events. He said he thinks the graphic nature of the ads is needed to drive home the dangers of meth. ""I've seen people lose everything, you know, from their toes to the top of the head, either through death or maybe it's the sores or the scabs [affecting] the teeth or the eyes,"" he said. ""The list is endless. It really is."" Drug officials say meth -- also known as chalk, crank, crystal, glass, ice or speed -- has been a major threat in rural America because it is cheap and easy to make. Traffickers mix drugs bought over the counter with common ingredients, according to the DEA. Twelve- to 14-year-olds who live in small towns are more than twice as likely to use meth than those who live in larger cities, the agency said. The Meth Project began in 2005 in what was then the heartland of meth: Montana. Government leaders there credit the effort with large declines in meth use, including a 45 percent drop in teen use since its ads first appeared. The ad campaign has since spread to a half-dozen other states, including Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois and Wyoming. Program organizers said they research and tailor their campaigns for each new state. But not everyone is convinced of the program's effectiveness. David Erceg-Hurn, a researcher and critic of the Meth Project, said: ""There is the potential for boomerang effects with these ads. Some teenagers react negatively to graphic advertising. These people don't like 'being told how to behave' by the ads and may rebel against them."" The Meth Project is funded through private donations and receives millions of dollars in federal and state grants. Erceg-Hurn said he thinks those dollars could be put to better use. As for the Spanish ad campaign, he said: ""I prefer the radio ads to the print and television ads. They're not so over the top. I like that the radio ads feature real former users rather than actors. This makes them seem more realistic. A problem is still that they don't provide any information about how to quit or avoid using meth. Teenagers need practical skills and information."" The Spanish ad campaign in Idaho is too new for analysis of widespread impact. Organizers said they hope for more reactions such as that of high school student Cindy Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who moved to Idaho from Guatemala, said she and her parents have been listening to the radio ads together. ""My parents, we didn't see a lot of drugs during my time in Guatemala. So we didn't know what the drugs are and what they do,"" she said. ""So what my parents would do, like when they would listen to the radio, they were like, 'Oh, you should listen to this, because this is what I want you to learn.' "" Rodriguez said she was prepared when peers offered her meth. ""They were like, 'Oh, you should do this, so that way you could be a little bit cooler or you're with us. You need to do this.' I'm like, no ... you know, cause I'd heard about it.""","Meth Project has disturbing ads to wake up kids to the dangers of meth .

"(CNN) -- Sporting a growing ""baby bump,"" Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, named a cruise ship on England's south coast Thursday, in what is expected to be her last solo public engagement before her child is due next month. Wearing a stylish black and white animal print coat, she cut a cord to send the traditional bottle of champagne smashing against the hull of the Royal Princess. The ceremony in the city of Southampton also included a blessing by the Bishop of Winchester, the Right Rev. Tim Dakin, a performance by British pop singer Natasha Bedingfield and music from military bands. Catherine was then to be given a brief tour of the cruise liner, as its ""godmother."" Gallery: The Duchess of Cambridge's best looks . The ship, owned by Princess Cruises and with room for 3,600 passengers, will embark on its maiden voyage Sunday. The Royal Princess will then sail Mediterranean cruises through the summer and Eastern Caribbean cruises in the fall. According to Princess Cruises, the huge ship houses the largest pastry store to be found at sea. There was a gala dinner Wednesday night for guests at the naming ceremony, who included representatives of the charities for which Catherine serves as patron. The Royal Princess was built for Princess Cruises, a part of Carnival Corp., at the Fincantieri shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy. Alan Buckelew, the line's president and CEO, paid tribute to its British heritage in a speech ahead of the champagne smash, with a reference to its origins in the former London-registered Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co., better known as P&O. Prince William's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, was ""godmother"" to the original Royal Princess liner, which launched from Southampton in 1984. She and Catherine pronounced the same words as they played their role in the official naming ceremony, saying: ""I name this ship Royal Princess. May God bless her and all who sail in her."" Watch: 'Kate and Diana. a royal comparison . Other ""godmothers"" for the cruise line's ships include the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and actresses Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn. Heir to the throne . It's not known if Catherine and Prince William are expecting a boy or a girl, but a change in royal succession laws means that their first child will be the heir to the British throne regardless of gender. The couple married in London's Westminster Abbey in April 2011. William is second in line to the throne after his father, Prince Charles. Queen Elizabeth II, William's grandmother, last week celebrated 60 years since her coronation. On Monday, she paid a birthday visit to her husband, Prince Philip, in the hospital where he's convalescing after undergoing abdominal surgery last Friday. The Duke of Edinburgh, age 92, could stay in the hospital for another week, according to a palace statement.

"(CNN) -- When others dismissed Detroit as a falling knife unworthy of investment, David Egner saw something else. Egner imagined Detroit regenerating from within, with damaged civic tissue repairing itself to foster new life and commerce. As president of a foundation named for a patriarch who emigrated to Michigan 130 years ago and immediately launched a business, he was in a position to test his idea. The secret, Egner figured, is harnessing the collective power of what he calls ""anchor institutions"": in this case, Wayne State University, Henry Ford Health System and Detroit Medical Center. Through what emerged as the Midtown Project, Egner's Hudson-Webber Foundation, alongside other funders, is finding ways to hitch the fortunes of these institutions to the fortunes of the surrounding neighborhoods. Hudson-Webber's research partner, Omar Blaik from U3 Ventures, compiled the data that confirmed the hunch: The anchor institutions carry breathtaking heft. At a moment when the City of Detroit has been declared insolvent and foundations are looking for innovation, the approach carries two critical lessons for community development. First, investors must build from assets, not deficits. Many foundations like to use quality-of-life indicators to guide their philanthropy. I have been involved in a number of these efforts over the years, and too often, foundations find it irresistible to direct their charitable giving to whatever problem tops the charts. It feels like the right approach; if dropout rates emerge as the worst problem in a neighborhood, why not tackle it? Problem is, whether the needle moves on this indicator or not, the approach is unlikely to contribute to broader neighborhood transformation. Hudson-Webber's method reveals the potential of another kind of analysis, one that is based on the untapped power of existing assets. It turns out Wayne State, Henry Ford and Detroit Medical employ about 30,000 people, hire 3,300 associates every year, enroll 32,000 students, control about half of Midtown's real estate and -- perhaps most important -- spend about $1.7 billion every year on goods and services. Blaik found that about 4.5% of the $1.7 million in spending on goods and services was going to Detroit vendors; the rest is what Blaik calls leakage. If Detroit businesses could step up to provide quality goods and services at the right price -- this is a business play, not charity -- then even small upward ticks would represent enormous amounts of investment and, in turn, jobs. Midtown Detroit Inc. organized vendor fairs to introduce local businesses to the big institutions and made sure local businesses got to see all the requests for proposals coming from the anchors. As a result, a local bakery, a local print shop and a local construction firm were among the firms winning $20 million in business from the anchor institutions. The contracts created jobs for area residents and enabled the small businesses to ratchet up their capacity. The successes point to the second critical lesson for foundations: Instead of limiting themselves to traditional charitable gifts -- building a playground, offering scholarships to deserving high school students -- the approach strengthens the connections between neighborhood residents and the marketplace. By aligning work force training with the needs of the anchors, the Midtown Project has placed 50 local residents in entry-level jobs. Once up to full speed, Susan Mosey of Midtown Detroit believes, the arrangement can place 200 residents a year into jobs. Midtown Detroit Inc. is also rebuilding a strong neighborhood residential core. Incentives to lure renters and buyers have drawn more than 1,000 residents to the neighborhood. While the experiments are ongoing, the results are promising. Post-Great Recession, cities had to find new approaches to revive neighborhoods. It's not enough to build low-cost housing, says Bruce Katz, founder of the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, and there is no massive investment coming from the federal government. ""The cavalry is not coming,"" said Katz, who describes local innovations from across the country in a new book, ""The Metropolitan Revolution: How Cities and Metros Are Fixing Our Broken Politics and Fragile Economy."" Cities cannot wait for old programs to return, Katz says. They are not coming back. Instead, cities should build from whatever assets they have at hand and make a new kind of business case for investment, from within and without. U3 Ventures' Blaik believes that focusing on anchor institutions forces a discipline that prevents wishful thinking. Foundations, with their government and private-sector partners, can base expectations on the realities of supply and demand for hiring, business activity and residential growth. In the end, anchor institutions may present the best hope for neighborhood transformation simply because of their scale. When it comes to sources of employment, investment and connectivity, the scale and power of the Midtown Detroit anchors dwarfs anything a foundation could sustain. Even better: Instead of assuming residents need a handout, the approach gives residents an opening to participate in capitalism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Bare.","John Bare says nonprofits in Detroit saw an opportunity to spark the economy .
He says that by bringing together key stakeholders, jobs were created, projects launched .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday promised a safer U.S. food supply when it implements two new rules regulating food imported to the United States. The first rule would put the burden on U.S. food importers to ensure their foreign suppliers are meeting U.S. food safety standards. The second would establish provisions for certifying third-party auditors in these countries. ""Many of the most vulnerable commodities are coming from countries with less-mature systems in terms of regulatory oversight and farming practices,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said. ""This is an opportunity to help build regulatory capacity and improve safety standards."" The FDA will open the proposed regulations to public comment for a period of 120 days. It expects implementation of these changes to take two to three years. With 15% of the U.S. food supply coming from overseas, including 20% of fresh vegetables and 50% of fresh fruit, Hamburg said these regulations are long overdue. The most recent case of contaminated food involved pomegranate seeds from Turkey; as of Wednesday, 153 people have been sickened by Hepatitis A after eating the seeds. ""Food-borne illnesses continue to take a great toll on American consumers, killing almost 3,000 people each year,"" Hamburg said. ""The health of our families is too important not to take the steps we're announcing today."" The current food safety system in the United States relies on FDA inspectors at ports of entry around the country physically inspecting food and detaining items that may pose a hazard to the American public. But inspectors can only physically examine 2% of the nation's incoming food supply, according to the agency, leaving the other 98% unchecked. The best way to fill that gap, the government agency says, is to require importers to oversee their suppliers, and in turn, for FDA to oversee those importers. ""These regulations represent a shift toward prevention and for industry being responsible for documenting what they have done to prevent problems from occurring,"" said Michael Taylor, the FDA deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. The rules also propose a preferred vendor program of sorts, giving foreign food companies incentives to comply with U.S. safety standards. ""There will be opportunities to see their products move more swiftly (through the import process) if they have a record of compliance,"" Hamburg said. ""This will increase incentives for companies to fully comply."" Food safety watchdog groups applauded the FDA's movement on the issue. ""Once finalized, the rules would ensure that foreign foods are held to the same high safety standards as American products,"" the Pew Research Group wrote in a statement. ""By holding overseas producers to U.S. food safety standards, the new rules would establish a level playing field that would also benefit U.S. businesses, farmers and food processors."" The Center for Science in the Public Interest also said, ""Today's long-delayed announcement that the FDA is moving forward on regulations to increase the safety of imported foods is good news and, if finalized, will lead to safer foods. Supplier verification means that companies should know who they are buying from -- not just their name and address but their food safety practices."" The proposed rules come in response to the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in January 2011. The act represented the first major changes in food safety policy in the United States in more 70 years.","FDA proposes two new safety rules in response to the Food Safety Modernization Act .

"(CNN) -- Texas prosecutors said in court Friday they'll seek the death penalty against Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace accused of killing two prosecutors who served in the same county he did. But what they'll do with the other person charged in the slayings --Williams' wife -- remains up in the air. Kaufman County, Texas, Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse was slain in January on his way to work at a courthouse. Two months later, District Attorney Michael McLelland and his wife, Cynthia McLelland, were fatally shot at their home near Forney. A county grand jury tied all three killings together in April, when they indicted Eric Williams and his wife, Kim, for capital murder. One big question, though, still loomed: Would prosecutors try to get a death sentence for either or both Williamses, should they be convicted of murder? That was partially answered Friday, in a brief hearing at the same Kaufman County courthouse where Eric Williams had been justice of the peace. Special prosecutor Toby Shook told CNN that he and his fellow prosecutor, Bill Wirskye, announced in court that they will go for a death sentence against Eric Williams. But they did not indicate Friday whether or not they'll do the same with Kim Williams. ""We haven't made our final decision,"" Shook said, adding that there's no deadline to make such a call. This scenario, as inconclusive as it might be, jives with what Kim Williams' lawyer told CNN on Thursday. Paul Johnson said then that he expected prosecutors to seek death for Eric Williams, but ""was not so sure"" about what they would do regarding his client. County Sheriff David Byrnes has previously said the three killings stemmed from Eric Williams' ""past legal problems with the criminal justice system of this county,"" including a 2012 conviction on burglary and theft charges that led to his removal from office. His wife, Kim, has confessed to her involvement in the killings and implicated her husband as the trigger man, according to court papers. In Hasse's death, Kim Williams was the getaway driver; in the McLellands' killings, she was a passenger, Byrnes has said. In both cases, Eric Williams fired the fatal shots, according to the sheriff. Both Williamses were arrested in April. Eric is also charged with making a terroristic threat, having been accused of using his home computer to threaten police investigating the McLellands' killings, according to a sheriff's affidavit. He is being held on $23 million bond, according to Kaufman County jail records. His wife -- who is seeking a divorce, her lawyer told CNN on Thursday -- is being held on $10 million bond. Shook -- who, with Wirskye, was sworn in as a special prosecutor in the murder case two days after the McLellands' deaths -- said that the decision to seek the death penalty against one or both of the accused would not significantly impact their approach. ""We just look forward to preparing the case and trying it in front of the jury,"" the special prosecutor said.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of demonstrators marched through cities across Europe on Saturday, calling for an immediate end to Israel's attacks on Gaza. A protester swings a club at a police horse Saturday night near London's Israeli Embassy. Up to 20,000 people were gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, England, at the peak of protests there, London Metropolitan Police said. A police officer was knocked unconscious Saturday night as the protests turned unruly, the police said. The London crowd dismantled barriers placed in front of the embassy and began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of the metal barriers, police said. Three people were arrested. Organizers including the Stop the War Coalition and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign expected more than 100,000 people to join the London march to protest Israel's ongoing attacks on Gaza. Celebrities including musician Annie Lennox and Bianca Jagger, musician Mick Jagger's ex-wife, spoke at a rally before the procession, which went from Hyde Park to the Israeli Embassy in Kensington, West London.  Watch demonstrators throw bottles, metal at police » . Lauren Booth, the sister-in-law of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, also spoke at the rally, The Times newspaper reported. During her speech, Booth criticized Blair over his attempts to bring about a resolution to the conflict. ""Tony Blair's only comment regarding the cease-fire has been to say that it can only take place after the tunnels in Gaza are destroyed,"" The Times quoted her as saying. ""What he is suggesting means that after the massacre, people will have no access to food, kerosene and medicines that came through those tunnels. That is not a cease-fire; that is a slow agonizing death,"" she said, according to The Times. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone issued a statement backing the demonstration. ""Every day, we see appalling pictures of children slaughtered by Israeli bombs, missiles and other sophisticated weapons,"" he said. ""Yet with more than 700 dead and thousands more seriously wounded, the international community is allowing Israel to continue its completely disproportionate onslaught accompanied by an Orwellian litany of lies."" Meanwhile, the British Press Association reported that similar demonstrations took place in other British cities, including Newcastle and Edinburgh. Thousands took part in a rally through the center of Edinburgh calling for an end to the military campaign. About 300 shoes and red paint were thrown toward the U.S. consulate in the Scottish capital, the PA said. Thousands demonstrated in other European cities, according to local media reports, including Innsbruck, Austria; Paris, France; Milan, Italy; Berlin, Germany; and Oslo, Norway. iReport: Protests in Paris . In Washington, pro-Palestinian activists rallied outside the temporary residence of President-elect Barack Obama on Saturday and called on the incoming leader to stop the violence in Gaza. About 3,000 people carrying signs and chanting ""Free Palestine"" flooded Lafayette Park between the White House and the Hay-Adams Hotel, where the president-elect is living with his family. Carrying a flag and wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh head scarf, Abdel-Kader Elkabil exhorted the president-elect to take action. ""Please, Mr. Obama, do something. We love you. We voted for you,"" he said. ""I'm expecting you to do something. ... You're the only one who can do something."" Asma Mobin-Uddin drove to Washington with a group of 500 activists from Ohio. She said she voted for Obama because she believed he could ""make a difference."" ""President Obama, look in the eyes of your kids and look in the eyes of the kids in that region,"" she said at the rally. ""Please, stop the violence, stop the hate, stop the occupation."" Israelis say their Gaza military operation, which started December 27, is targeting rocket-launching sites, Hamas infrastructure and the movement's leaders in an effort to stop militants from sending rockets into southern Israel. Palestinian medical sources said that more than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the attacks, including 235 children, and about 3,300 people have been wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died since the operation began. CNN's Rachel Streitfeld and Mona Larijani contributed to this report.","Three arrested after London protest becomes unruly; officer knocked out .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A leader of Turkey's ruling party held out the possibility of a vote on what to do with the Istanbul park where planned razing triggered two weeks of anti-government protests but said demonstrators must leave the park. ""The Turkish government will not accept Gezi Park protests to be continued forever,"" Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, said after meetings with a delegation of ""popular artists"" involved with the demonstrations. His comments were carried by the semi-official Anadolou News Agency. Celik said the government could hold a referendum on the redevelopment of the park, the last green space in central Istanbul -- but he urged the demonstrators to ""walk out."" At least one protester immediately rejected the idea of a vote. ""We do not think that a referendum is the right way to go because we think that this park should remain as a park because it's our right, and rights should not be asked in a referendum,"" said Imre Azem. The meetings took place a day after riot police used massive amounts of tear gas, water cannons and stun guns to break up protests in Istanbul's Taksim Square. Police also shot tear gas canisters into nearby Gezi Park, violating a promise not to do so. Leaders of the protests skipped Wednesday's talks. One of them, Eyup Muhcu, said those attending the meeting are friendly with Erdogan's government. Meanwhile, thousands of lawyers marched out of their offices in several cities to rally against the arrests of attorneys in the protests. With no sign of negotiations on the horizon, Turkey, a NATO ally with a democratically elected government, could see fighting grip more of the country. And harsh actions against protesters could strain Erdogan's strategic friendships with much of the West -- relationships that are particularly critical in light of the civil war ravaging Turkey's neighbor, Syria. ""The real challenge for the government of Turkey, as now the international focus is on this crisis: How do they get the people behind me to agree to go home?"" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported Wednesday from outside Gezi Park, seat of the demonstrations. ""That requires compromise, conciliation."" On Wednesday morning, Paton Walsh saw someone being taken out of the park on a stretcher. But things were calm in the area, with morning rain having washed away some of the debris from events the night before. Traffic in the major square was nearly back to normal. While police were in position, they looked relaxed, CNN's Arwa Damon reported. Police worked to dismantle barricades that demonstrators in the square have used as they've battled police in recent days. In Ankara, street skirmishes broke out between protesters and police, who fired tear gas. Reporters released . The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported Wednesday that two of its reporters detained by police were released. Sasa Petricic and Derek Stoffel were held all day after being picked up earlier on Wednesday, CBC said. Earlier, the network said it had been in contact with them, and they said they were ""OK."" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird has expressed concern to Turkey's ambassador, the CBC reported. Turks living in Macedonia, Kosovo, Bulgaria and Albania who support Erdogan plan rallies of their own Friday, Anadolu reported. Opinion: Past and future collide in Turkey clashes . But the anti-Erdogan protests show no sign of abating. What began in late May as a demonstration focused on the environment -- opposition to a plan to build a mall in Gezi Park -- has evolved into a crusade against Erdogan that's spread around the country. Attorneys in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities gathered in front of government buildings for rallies, CNN Turk reported. Some called on Istanbul's chief prosecutor to resign. Government officials, however, insisted that while peaceful protests are allowed, those who use violence were being detained. ""If these people have objections to the government's project for Gezi Park and Taksim Square, they are welcome and we can listen to their ideas. Such issues can be settled through dialogue and within the framework of the law, not resorting to violence,"" President Abdullah Gul told reporters. Erdogan's government has no problem with ecologists who started protests to save Gezi Park from bulldozers but takes action against Marxist extremists, who have lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, said Ibrahim Kalin, the prime minister's chief adviser, referring to the latter as ""troublemakers."" ""Anywhere in the world, they will not be considered peaceful protesters,"" Kalin told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. He said some were associated with a group that carried out an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Ankara in February. The police reaction has been no different from that of security forces' methods against similar groups at Occupy Wall Street protests in the United States, he insisted. ""The police obviously have the mandate to establish public order,"" Kalin said, just like they do in Spain, Sweden and Britain. Letters from Turkey, with pride . International criticism . Experts and human rights groups say Erdogan's government lags when it comes to human rights and freedom of expression by opponents. ""Prosecutors and courts continued to use terrorism laws to prosecute and prolong incarceration of thousands of Kurdish political activists, human rights defenders, students, journalists and trade unionists,"" Human Rights Watch wrote in a 2013 report on Turkey. Turkish journalists are afraid to write anything critical of the government, and media companies are slapped with huge tax fines for covering uncomfortable topics. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkish authorities have targeted journalists with detention for covering the protests. Erdogan's dilemma is in how he handles those who did not elect him, said CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""He has come to believe that he speaks for all of Turkey."" Why Taksim Square matters to Turks . Those who are against him are handled in ""too authoritarian"" a manner, Zakaria said Tuesday on Piers Morgan Live. The prime minister has said he will not back down. ""They say the prime minister is harsh,"" Erdogan said Tuesday, referring to his detractors. ""I'm sorry,"" he told a gathering of his own party. ""The prime minister is not going to change."" Erdogan is tightening his grip on power, adding authority to the office of the presidency, which he hopes to hold in coming years. Former U.S. intelligence chief John Negroponte said he believes the protests could have something to do with Erdogan's ambitions. There may be ""forces joining in here, whose aim it is to prevent him from achieving his ambition of becoming the next president of the country,"" he told Morgan.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's interim military government Tuesday added two more key figures to its list of Muslim Brotherhood leaders under arrest: Mohamed Badie, the group's spiritual leader, and Safwat Hegazy, a preacher and hardline supporter of the movement. They were among about 100 members of the Muslim Brotherhood taken into custody Tuesday. The brotherhood -- locked in a deadly battle with the military for control of Egypt -- slammed the interim government's ongoing ""bloody military coup."" In a statement, the group's Freedom and Justice Party described the charges against Badie as ""trumped up"" and ""political."" ""It is well-known that all the charges brought against the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliated political party, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) as well as the leaders of the Anti-Coup, Pro-Democracy National Alliance are implausible fabricated charges with no legally acceptable evidence. ""What they are facing are nothing but political trumped up charges thinly painted with criminal colors,"" Ali Kamal, a lawyer for the Muslim Brotherhood, said in the statement. Badie was taken in a dawn raid at a residential apartment in Cairo's Nasr City neighborhood, the Ministry of Interior said. Arresting Badie ""is not the end of the group, which will remain in the hearts of millions of Egyptians,"" said Ahmed Arif, spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood. Badie will be detained for 15 days for investigation on accusations of inciting violence and killing protesters, the Ministry of Interior said. The detention could be extended, as has been done with ousted President Mohamed Morsy. Mahmoud Ezzat, Badie's deputy, was named supreme guide on a temporary basis. Later, Hegazy was arrested in Nasr City as well, according to state-run broadcaster Al-Masriya. Opinion: Can anyone save Egypt from the brink? The military has been arresting numerous key figures in the Muslim Brotherhood, including Mohamed Mahdi Akef, the former supreme guide; his deputy, Khairat al-Shater; Saad al-Katatni, chairman of the Freedom and Justice Party; his deputy, Rashad al-Bayoumi; and Sheikh Hazem Salah Abo Ismael. Armed fighters holed up in school facility, military says . Badie was with Syed Abdul Rahim Abdel Naby, a teacher from the Islamic Dawa school in Beni Suef, when he was arrested at dawn, the Ministry of Interior said in its statement. Defterios: Egypt's cycle of violence threatens to destroy its economy . Security forces then searched the school and arrested 38 members of the Muslim Brotherhood ""who were hiding"" in the facility and had numerous weapons, including a rifle, pistols, and Molotov cocktails, the statement said. Some of the equipment belonged to the administration of the civil protection unit in Beni Suef, which had been stormed, robbed and set on fire, the statement said. Both sides in the conflict have insisted they reject violence, but fighting has raged. The Muslim Brotherhood changed its profile image on Facebook on Tuesday to an image of Badie, with a quote saying, ""Our peaceful movement is mightier than their tanks."" Nationwide arrests . Security forces also arrested 56 administrative leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood in various provinces, the Ministry of Interior said. The arrests came a day after 25 soldiers were killed in a Sinai ambush and onetime ruler Hosni Mubarak won acquittal on a corruption charge. The soldiers were killed when suspected militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades struck two buses carrying security forces Monday in the city of Rafah, on the border between Egypt and Gaza, Nile TV reported. Interim President Adly Mansour declared three days of national mourning following the attack, Nile TV said. The Sinai Peninsula is a lawless area that was the site of frequent attacks even before Egypt's latest round of turmoil. In May, for example, seven Egyptian solders were kidnapped and held for six days there, a spokesman for Egypt's armed forces said. But the attack adds to the persistent tension across the country since the military ousted the democratically elected Morsy in a coup. Over the past week, about 900 people -- security personnel as well as citizens -- have been killed. Deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo on Wednesday and violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations Friday.

"(CNN) -- After my short journey home from the hospital with our newborn seven years ago, I hit my first breaking point. Breastfeeding was not going well and so we hired a ""lactation expert"" to come to my rescue. I viewed my initial inability to breastfeed as nothing short of failure as a mom! For the record, I am a huge proponent of breastfeeding and know there are lots of great and supportive lactation experts and consultants -- but sadly, mine was not one of them. When the lactation guru had me sit in my dining room chair naked from the waist up, and forcefully moved my breast around like a piece of meat to find the exact position for the ""latch,"" I knew this was not the way breastfeeding was supposed to go. I shrieked something to that effect and politely asked her to leave. Oh Kate, I hope that doesn't happen to you, but if it does, know you are not alone. As you bring home your bundle of joy, who also happens to be third in line to the throne, and prepare for your first days as a mom in front of a worldwide audience, we offer you this: real advice from moms on 10 things that could make you slightly crazy during these first magical -- and exhausting -- days. Read on and remember, we've all been there and lived to tell about it! 1. Get used to smelling like... baby spit-up . ""Gone are the days of fine perfume, at least until you know whether the baby is sensitive to it,"" said mom of two and Washington blogger Stephanie Dulli, who also warns Kate about the burning sensation she will feel when she hears a baby cry on television. ""That's your milk. Breasts don't care if it's your baby or not,"" she joked. ""Hear baby? Fill up!"" 2. You still look pregnant . If you think right after you give birth, your body will return to normal, you will learn how wrong you are! Kim Como, a Long Island, New York, mom of two and co-host of the blog 2 Moms on a Train, remembers feeling ""so thankful"" to have her favorite maternity jeans and oversized sweater at the hospital and equally thankful it was just her husband taking a few pictures of their new addition. ""At least I could control it a bit,"" she remembered. ""Honey, take pictures waist up!"" 3. Beware of the sleep deprivation . Amanda Rodriguez, a mom of three from Frederick, Maryland, and host of the blog Dude Mom, said the biggest thing for Kate to worry about is sleep. ""Seriously, lack of it will turn you into a zombie faster than you can say royal baby,"" she joked. ""Find a way to sneak it in. Tell Prince William to take the baby on the other side of the palace ... if you have to but make it happen."" 4. Check for what under fingernails? Your baby's poop, said Lisa Nee, a mom of three boys from Madison, Connecticut. ""I remember going to the grocery store and realizing I had poop under my nails left from a messy midnight changing cycle."" Kate, don't freak! Keep reading! 5. Realize breastfeeding takes time and patience . Cybele Weisser, a Manhattan mom of two, said what made her insane during her first days as a mom was discovering how much time it took to breastfeed and how hard it was. ""On day three, I believe I actually said the words, 'I'd rather be in labor again,'"" she told me. Amanda Rodriguez encourages Kate to ""do it alone"" if she plans to nurse. ""Away from the husband and the cameras and the mother-in-law, as lovely as she seems. It's the one time I got to be silent and bond with baby without someone standing there waiting for a turn to hold him,"" she said. 6. Don't think you're horrible if you can't breastfeed . ""Not everyone makes a ton of milk and if you don't, don't feel bad about it and get depressed and think you're a horrible mom,"" said a mother of two who preferred to stay anonymous, remembering how she endured a ""never-ending"" cycle of breastfeeding, pumping and giving her boys bottles since she couldn't produce enough milk. ""If someone had told me that different moms make different amounts of milk, I think I would've fared better after the first baby."" 7. Beware of the unsolicited advice . We all get it -- from our parents, our in-laws, even well-meaning strangers. The challenge, Kate, will be to smile and keep doing it your way. Shandley McMurray, a Canadian writer and mom of two now living in London, said, ""One woman told me to put a hat on my 2-year-old 'before she froze to death.' It was 59 degrees out. Another warned me that my daughter would poke her eye out if I let her use a fork to eat her hot dog,"" she remembered. ""It's a miracle my children are still alive."" 8. Be prepared for the ridiculous nicknames . No matter what you and William decide to call your son, Kate, your family and friends will have their own ideas about exactly what he should be called. Beth Engelman, a single mom in Chicago and co-founder of Mommy On a Shoestring, said when her 7-year-old son, Jackson Robert, was born, family members started to call him a host of names. ""Jacko, Jack-Ro, J Bob and AJ, which is short for Action Jackson, and yes, that ridiculous nickname was created by the baby's dad!,"" she said, offering this advice to Kate. ""Just smile and repeat the baby's real name. You might have to do it 100 times but eventually they'll get the hint."" 9. Get William to do his share . A prince and heir to the throne changing diapers? Why not, says mom of three Samantha Ettus, founder of Working Moms Lifestyle, who believes sharing parenting duties is the best way to ensure an equal partnership in the raising of a child. She offers this advice to Kate: ""In the first week, make an excuse for (William) to be alone with the baby. Find a reason to have to run out and leave him alone with the baby so he has to,"" Ettus said. ""And I always like to say, 'Catch him doing things right' so try not to micromanage him. So long as he's keeping the baby safe, he's doing a great job. Use tons of positive reinforcement."" 10. The world will feel like a different place now . Becoming a mom, said Sarah Walton, a New Jersey mom of two and founder of Better Way Moms, changed her more than she could ever have imagined. ""I can no longer watch any kind of violence. I can't ride roller coasters. ... My disdain for bullies shocks me and the desire to have my child be kind can make my eyes well up with tears,"" she said. ""You will now see the world through the eyes of a mother, and no one can prepare you for that."" Finally, Kate, when it's 4 o'clock in the morning, and you can barely keep your eyes open, and you feel close to tears for no reason at all, and you are wondering if you are truly made out to be the mother you hoped you could be, remember this -- relax. ""It's going to get easier,"" said mom of two Maryellen Mooney of Long Island, New York. ""Although you feel like you can't catch your breath now, someday, your baby will be putting her own clothes on or fixing himself a snack, and you'll say, 'Where did the time go?'"" That's exactly how I feel about that newborn whom I finally figured out how to breastfeed. Seven years later, she's heading into the second grade, her sister into the first grade, and my story about the lactation expert with the poor bedside manner makes me laugh instead of cry.

"(CNN) -- The melting glacial ice in places like the Alps, Greenland and the Himalayas is a dramatic visual document of how our planet's climate is changing. For U.S.-based environmental photographer James Balog, it is a vision he has spent more than six years trying to record and preserve. After an assignment for National Geographic in Iceland in 2005, he was shocked by the changes taking place and wanted to find a way to capture what was going on, in the Arctic and glaciers elsewhere around the world. The result has been a new documentary film, ""Chasing Ice,"" based on 36 time-lapse cameras looking at 16 different glaciers in locations in Alaska, Bolivia, Canada, France, Greenland, Iceland, Nepal, the Rocky Mountains and Switzerland. Each camera has been taking a photograph every half-an-hour during daylight, producing almost one million pictures in total. Balog says putting the documentary together has changed his initial skepticism about climate change. ""What we've seen has been a complete shock. I never really expected to see this magnitude of change. Every time we open the backs of these cameras it's like 'wow, is that what's just happened.'"" At one point in the film, Balog is shown looking at the memory card he has just removed from a camera and saying: ""This is a memory of a landscape. A landscape that is now gone and will never be seen again in the history of civilization."" Watch: CNN special 'Secrets in the Ice' Of all the places he has filmed, it is the Arctic that has attracted most attention in recent years. In September this year, the ice cap fell to its lowest extent on record. It grows each winter but is retreating further and further every summer, according to data collected by the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. The summer ice extent has declined by 13% each decade since the ice was first monitored in 1979. Climate scientists have previously predicted the Arctic could lose almost all of its ice cover in the summer months by 2100. However, the recent accelerated ice losses have led some to believe that date could come much sooner. While accepting that glacial ice melting has happened many times before in human history, Balog says what he is documenting now can no longer be considered a natural process. ""What we're seeing is a much more accelerated rate of change, especially in the past 40 years or so and that has clearly been traced by scientists to the impact of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions into the atmosphere."" ""In the past 100 years, the atmosphere has accumulated 40% more carbon dioxide in it than had been seen in the peak over the past one million years. ""So, in the past one million years the peak of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere has been 280-290 parts per million (ppm). We're now at 395 ppm and adding more every year. It's gone beyond natural and is affecting the entire world,"" he says. Balog, who lives in the Rocky Mountains near Boulder, Colorado, believes the economic and technological solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change already exist. ""What we need is a greater political and public understanding of the immediacy and reality of these changes. I believe that this film can help shift public perceptions by telling people a story that is real and happening now,"" he says.","New documentary captures glacial ice retreating at sixteen different locations around the world .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A sealed envelope awaits in Rissi Palmer's Bible. Country singer Rissi Palmer performs for students in an after-school program at Atlanta's Parkside Elementary. It's her Grammy acceptance speech, the one she wrote as a 12-year-old. She vowed not to open it until she could read it from the stage accepting her award. Sixteen years later, the time may be nearer when Palmer can open the envelope. The road has been a long one, starting with her standing on a milk crate as a child so she could sing solos in the church choir. But these days, she is an up-and-comer in country music -- and a rare African-American performer in the genre. Palmer acknowledged this week to students in Atlanta that some people had told her she couldn't sing country because she was African-American. But she said, ""When you tell me I can't do something, it just makes me want to do it more."" Palmer told CNN that no one in the music industry had discouraged her based on race but that people who loved her were concerned country stardom might be a tough goal. She said she doesn't believe her story is different from any other musician's: ""The music industry is just hard."" Palmer told students at Parkside Elementary School that she grew up listening to all kinds of music, including country. ""My mother was a big country music fan,"" she recalled. The family also listened to R&B and classic soul, such as Sam Cooke, she said. ""I loved the way the country artists wrote songs,"" Palmer told about 50 students, most of them minorities, in an after-school program at Parkside. She liked the way that country songs told stories: ""I always liked telling stories."" ""Country Girl,"" the first single off Palmer's self-titled 2007 debut album, made her the first African-American female in 20 years to hit Billboard's country chart, according to Country Music Television. Country music is home to a smattering of well-known African-American artists. Charley Pride is by far the most visible, but other artists have dabbled in country as well -- the Supremes, for instance, and Ray Charles. More recently, Darius Rucker, longtime lead singer for Hootie and the Blowfish, hit the top of the country charts as well. African-Americans always have been in the country music industry, said John Rumble, senior historian for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. However, it's rare for an artist -- of any race -- to reach the level of stardom attained by Pride, who had 67 records on the country chart between 1966 and 1990, more than 20 of them in the Top 10. ""Some people at the time, and since, called him the Jackie Robinson of country music, but nobody who followed him has yet reached that level,"" Rumble said. ""... He's almost an impossible standard to match."" However, given Rucker's recent success, he is showing ""superstar potential"" in the country industry, Rumble added. Palmer lost her mother at an early age but has said her parent's love for country music stayed with her. Still, she said she doubted she could break into the genre. ""When you're a child, you react to something that's familiar and looks like you,"" she told CMT in 2007. ""And there was nobody [in country music] who looked like me. Just being a kid, you don't see black country singers. So you don't think that's a possibility for you. You see black pop singers. You see black R&B singers. You see black rockers. So you say, 'If I'm black and I want to sing, then I probably have to sing R&B.' "" Rumble echoed Palmer's comments about the music industry being tough on new artists. More than ever, ""it takes a lot of money to put an artist out there on promotional tours,"" creating videos and the like, he said. Rumble said many African-American artists probably gravitate to other genres. And, for artists of any race, ""once you're in the door ... it's still a matter of catching on."" ""There are a certain number of people who are just not used to seeing a black person on CMT or GAC [Great American Country],"" he said. ""It just doesn't compute, for whatever reason."" Palmer's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, when she was 13, according to her Web site. She took part in talent pageants there and joined an entertainment troupe. ""That is where a lot of my country influences started to come out,"" she said in the online biography.

However, she cautioned them that being a singer is not always fun, even though she loves it. ""The best advice I can give you is that this is a job that I do,"" she said. ""... You have to take it very seriously."" She fielded questions with a sense of humor, telling them some of her favorite songs (one is Bonnie Raitt's ""Nick of Time"") and her favorite instrument -- a guitar (""Have you ever tried to push a piano around with you?"" she asked). She told the children that once they start dating, they will find plenty of material -- good and bad -- to write songs about.

For her part, Palmer has said she hopes that one day, the discussion centers on her music rather than her ethnicity. ""I'm looking forward to the day when the only thing that's being discussed is the album -- the actual music -- as opposed to my race,"" she told CMT. ""I understand it is something rare, and it is something different, and it is something that's not happening every day. I get that.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- As a symbol of national pride and success, South Korea and Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung, carries more weight on his shoulders than the need to perform. South Korea's Park Ji-Sung celebrates after at the 2006 World Cup  against France. Park, once rejected from his country's own K-League, is now considered the ambassador of Korean football. A responsibility he seems to able carry. ""I want to push my way through Manchester United's star players and put my name on the list of the best 11 team. Park Ji-Sung talks to CNN . ""I want to show the world how good Korean players are by playing well in the top flight,"" Park wrote in his book ""Neverending Challenge"" before he joined United. Park's autobiography, which illustrates his life as a football player since he started out at the age of ten, became a bestseller after being published in 2006. It is no surprise. Park is a celebrity in South Korea and is swamped with fans wherever he goes. His hometown, Suwon, near to Seoul, built a park and named a road after Park to commemorate him becoming the first Premier League-r in South Korean history. Park may even become the first Asian to win a Championship League medal after this season. Nicknamed ""Three-lung Park"" for his seemingly overflowing energy supply, the South Korean papers plaster their front pages with Park if he scores and give out the smallest details of how many minutes he ran in each match. But Park's football career had not really drawn much attention until the recent years. He was mostly unknown to the public until he scored the winning goal to defeat Portugal in the 2002 World Cup in which South Korea reached the semifinals for the first time ever. ""People like him because there's a touching story behind him,"" football commentator Park Moon Sung at SBS, one of Korea's major broadcasters, said. ""They can see how this player, who never really got much attention, is maturing over the years."" The South Korea player, after receiving no calls from the K-League, started his professional career in Japan with Kyoto Purple in 2000. It was only after the 2002 World Cup that he joined PSV Eindhoven and proceeded to join Manchester United in 2005. Park has so far managed to keep his private life out of spotlight, most likely due to his quiet personality, a quality that is also reflected in his performances. ""He's someone who pumps energy into the entire team. He's not like a magician who can save the team from its worst moments with dazzling skills,"" the SBS commentator said. ""It's more like he plays for the others and brings the team together which is something very much needed in a team like Manchester United with all its stars."" Park's joining of Manchester United has enriched the football culture in Korea. Many who started watching European games because of Park have now become avid fans. ""I would like Park Ji-Sung to become a symbol of challenge for all Koreans,"" 30-year-old Kim Young Woo, who is a great fan of Park, said. Kim said he admires Park for never giving up and admits to watching at least 70 percent of all Manchester United games even if it means staying up until three in the morning on weekdays. ""I think young people will look at him and tell themselves that they want to take on challenges, too,"" Kim said. Something Park wants to see as well. The midfielder signed on a deal to build a Park Ji-Sung football center in his hometown fully equipped with training areas and football fields. He believes there should be a better future for Korean football.","Park scored the winning goal against Portugal in the 2002 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- The air in and around New Orleans is electrified with anticipation -- and anxiety. Louisiana National Guard members arrive at the New Orleans convention center during preparations for Gustav. Nervous is how Merrick Matherne says he is feeling. Nervous and stressed at the prospect of having to survive and rebuild in the wake of another hurricane. As Friday's third anniversary of Katrina's landfall passed, the Crescent City found itself potentially in the cross hairs of another destructive storm, Hurricane Gustav. Residents are suspended in a wait-and-see mode, with an evacuation order for New Orleans likely to come sometime after Saturday, according to Mayor Ray Nagin. Matherne and his family live in a low-lying area in the town of Metairie, near Lake Ponchartrain, just outside New Orleans. After Katrina and a drawn-out evacuation, Merrick and his wife spent nine taxing months living in various places, sometimes apart. Then, they went through the challenge of dealing with insurance companies and contractors over the phone, waiting for the various bureaucracies involved to do their part. Now they face the prospect that it might happen all over again. And they are not alone. ""The city is in a little bit of a panic,"" says Dr. Tim Pearman, Ph.D., a clinical associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Tulane University School of Medicine. ""Kind of wherever you go, every TV is turned to the news. The news is now reporting nothing else other than the hurricane, and it's days away. People are really heightened in terms of their emotions right now."" Many New Orleans residents already live on the edge emotionally. Among Katrina survivors, New Orleans has a post-traumatic stress disorder rate of more than 25 percent, and a mood and anxiety disorders rate of roughly 35 percent, according to a study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry in January. The big question is, can the city deal with any mental health fallout should Gustav get within striking distance? ""Thinking about the storm is anxiety-provoking for people. It brings them back to a lot of those feelings they had and memories from Katrina,"" says Dr. Anthony Speier, the deputy assistant secretary for the office of mental health at the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. ""People have memories that are triggered by preparing for this storm."" ""Why did we return? Why did we rebuild? Why is this happening again to us? All of those thoughts are going through people's minds,"" says Dr. Lisa Mills, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences Center at New Orleans. ""People are certainly anxious and doubting themselves."" But there is a small silver lining to all the attention Gustav is generating. Pearman, who also serves as the director of the Tulane Cancer Center Comprehensive Clinic, says that although the anxiety brought on by Gustav is ""definitely a bad thing,"" it is spurring better preparedness. ""In terms of the prep, it's great, because I really think it's going to be a different ball game than it was three years ago."" There is no doubt that the city is better prepared overall than it was for Katrina. But in mental health services, many holes still exist. After the storm, the city lost -- and hasn't completely replaced -- many of its hospital beds devoted to mental health, and also many of its psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, leaving it ill-equipped to handle its chronic caseload, let alone any spike in mental health care needs brought on by potential stressful events like Gustav. ""Throughout the country, mental health is in crisis, and in areas that are impoverished and recently devastated like New Orleans, they are certainly struggling,"" says Mills, who is also an ER physician at the Louisiana State University emergency department at the University Hospital in New Orleans. Mills says the city's mental health system that can't provide care for its chronic level of illness, let alone for any surge in demand. Pearman agrees that the city has not recovered. ""Mental-health wise, absolutely not. The number of providers is still far below what's needed,"" he says. Still, New Orleans is not a complete wasteland in terms of mental health services. Louisiana Spirit is the state-run counseling program funded by FEMA. ""We've been on the ground since Katrina and have been providing mental health and emotional recovery services,"" says Speier, who directs Louisiana Spirit. He says the agency has about 215 counselors who service the parishes in and around New Orleans. ""We have provided individual counseling visits to over a quarter-million people and we've generated probably 2.5 million to 3 million contacts -- many people we see more than once. The primary part of their work [is] meeting with survivors, going to their neighborhoods, homes, community centers, and educating people about emergency preparedness, about coping with the recovery process, about getting their homes and lives back together."" As for Matherne, he says he and his wife are dealing with the specter of Gustav with humor, mostly for the sake of his eldest daughter, now 9, who is anxious about losing her friends and her toys all over again. ""We're just trying to be as funny as possible and keep it in as light a mood as possible while we're biting our nails. We're worrying amongst ourselves and eating junk food as relief."" He jokes that they haven't hit the bourbon yet, but they are defrosting the freezer, where a gallon of daiquiris await.

"(CNN)  -- As he surveys the nation's landfills, chemical plants, waste facilities, and smelters, Robert Bullard sees an insidious form of institutional racism. Robert Bullard is the director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University. ""When you look at the neighborhoods that are where you have a lot of different waste facilities... the people who live closest are oftentimes the most vulnerable people who have the fewest resources to escape neighborhoods because of residential segregation, housing discrimination, and limited incomes,"" said Bullard, a professor at Georgia's Clark Atlanta University and the director of that university's Environmental Justice Resource Center. ""Just because you're poor, just because you live physically on the wrong 'side of the track' doesn't mean that you should be dumped on."" Those people are predominantly minorities, Bullard said. In fact, more than half of the 9 million people living within two miles of the nation's hazardous waste facilities are minorities, according to ""Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty, 1987-2007: Grassroots Struggles to Dismantle Environmental Racism,"" a recent report that Bullard co-wrote. Widely acknowledged as a pioneer in environmental justice, Bullard has worked in the field since 1978. He is the author of several books on the topic, including ""Confronting Environmental Racism,"" ""Dumping on Dixie"" and ""Unequal Protection."" In his nearly two decades of work in the field, Bullard said little has changed. ""I've visited dozens of communities and done these toxic tours,"" Bullard said. ""What's so disheartening is that it looks so familiar. I could have been in Louisiana, Richmond, California...I could have been in Chester, Pennsylvania. ""And I think this phenomenon of concentrating polluting industries in communities [of] working class...low incomes, communities of color, this phenomenon has to be dealt with."" Living near these facilities puts people at higher risk for health problems, Bullard said. ""We're seeing elevated asthma rates, we're seeing higher than average cancer rates, we're seeing lots of diabetes and kidney failure,"" he said. In a response to the ""Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty, 1987-2007: Grassroots Struggles to Dismantle Environmental Racism"" report, the Environmental Protection Agency said ""The EPA is committed to delivering a healthy environment for all Americans and is making significant strides in addressing environmental justice concerns. Since 1993, EPA has awarded more than $30 million in grants to over 1,100 community-based organizations focused on addressing local environmental and public health issues."" The agency also said that it is developing an Environmental Justice Smart Enforcement Assessment Tool, which will look at environmental, health, socioeconomic and compliance factors to ensure that the EPA's enforcement activities will focus on communities that need it most. ""EPA expects to begin using this tool later this year,"" the agency said. E-mail to a friend .","Robert Bullard is a professor at Georgia's Clark Atlanta University .

"(CNN) -- As part of Boeing's ongoing efforts to resolve Dreamliner problems, the passenger jet maker has put out a request that airlines inspect an emergency beacon used to find aircraft in the event of a crash. The request is based on a recommendation by the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) following a fire aboard an Ethiopian Airlines 787 Dreamliner parked at London's Heathrow Airport on July 12. The fire caused extensive damage to the rear of the aircraft. No one was hurt but the incident shut runways for about an hour before operations resumed, the airport said. Randy Tinseth, vice president marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement that in addition to the 787, the company has also asked operators of 717, Next-Generation 737, 747-400, 767 and 777 airplanes to inspect aircraft. ""We're taking this action following the UK AAIB Special Bulletin, which recommended that airplane models with fixed Honeywell ELTs be inspected,"" he said. ""The purpose of these inspections is to gather data to support potential rule-making by regulators."" The AAIB said the emergency locator transmitter (ELT) -- which uses its own battery to send details of a plane's location in the event of a crash -- is now the focus of its investigation. ""Detailed examination of the ELT has shown some indications of disruption to the battery cells,"" said the AAIB bulletin. ""It is not clear however, whether the combustion in the area of the ELT was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short."" 'Airworthiness Directive' expected . Distancing Boeing from the malfunction, Tinseth said ""it's important to note that Honeywell ELTs have been deployed on approximately 20 aircraft models -- including Boeing, Airbus and numerous business aviation aircraft."" Honeywell, the maker of the emergency beacon, said it had no knowledge of any problem with its emergency transmitter, certified by the Federal Aviation Authority since 2005. Last week, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instructed airlines operating the 787 to remove or inspect the Honeywell ELTs. ""The FAA is preparing to issue an Airworthiness Directive in the coming days that would make these inspections mandatory,"" said the FAA statement, released July 20. ""Federal Aviation Regulations do not require large commercial aircraft in scheduled service to be equipped with these devices."" The investigations come little more than two months since the Dreamliners were allowed back in the air following a retrofit to fix an issue with its lithium-ion batteries. Customer demand for the super-efficient airliner has remained solid despite the grounding earlier this year. Boeing has delivered 68 of the planes to 13 airlines and has 862 unfilled orders. It says it plans to increase production to 10 per month by the end of the year, double the rate earlier this year. Meanwhile, Boeing is facing a possible US$2.75 million civil penalty for allegedly using certain parts in 777 construction that did not meet standards and repeatedly missing deadlines to address related quality control issues. The FAA proposed the fine, saying Boeing's commercial aircraft division took more than two years to fully address problems after learning about quality control gaps involving fasteners in 777 construction. CNN's Michael Martinez, Thom Patterson, Mike M. Ahlers and Mark Thompson contributed to this report.","Boeing asks airlines to inspect planes equipped with Honeywell emergency locators .

"Washington (CNN) -- No veteran should be forgotten, President Barack Obama said Saturday while commemorating the end 60 years ago of the Korean conflict, sometimes described as the ""forgotten war."" He laid a wreath at the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the National Mall and spoke to veterans and family members with ties to both U.S. and Korean troops, an audience estimated by event organizers to number 5,000. Active hostilities on the Korean conflict halted six decades ago with the signing of an armistice agreement, leaving the war between the North and South in suspension, and the peninsula divided by a demilitarized zone where tensions remain tense to this day. More than 36,000 U.S. troops died and 103,000 were wounded in the three-year conflict. Fast facts: Korean War . The military says just over 7,900 U.S. troops remain missing, and Obama expressed a commitment to ""give these families a full accounting of their loved ones."" For example, the family of Sgt. 1st Class William Robinson, who went missing at 26 in 1950, will bury his remains in Pennsylvania this week, he said. He noted that returning veterans were not welcomed by parades or protests and said these veterans, as do all, ""deserved better."" Pondering Pyongyang: Beijing's problem child . ""Here in America, no war should ever be forgotten, and no veteran should ever be overlooked,"" Obama said, pronouncing the war a definitive win. ""Korea was a victory,"" he said, because South Koreans live ""in stark contrast to the repression and poverty of the North."" North Korea, meanwhile, observed what they called ""Victory Day"" on Saturday in the capital city Pyongyang with a lengthy military parade that was reviewed by leader Kim Jong Un and the Chinese vice president, Li Yuanchao.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan kept their Serie A title hopes alive as striker Giampaolo Pazzini scored twice on his debut to help them recover from a two-goal deficit to beat Palermo 3-2 at the San Siro. The Italian champions signed Pazzini on a four-and-a-half year contract from Sampdoria for $16m earlier in the week -- and he repaid that faith straight away with a match-winning second-half performance to delight the home crowd. But two minutes later it was Palermo who went in front as Mattia Cassani skipped around Davide Santon and crossed for Miccoli to tap home from close range. The Sicilian visitors started brightly and took a fifth minute lead when Fabrizio Miccoli  tapped home Mattia Cassani's cross. And Palermo doubled their lead nine minutes from half time when Antonio Nocerino turned defender Maicon before beating goalkeeper Julio Cesar at his near post. The match could have been all over before the break when Javier Pastore struck the post with a fierce drive. Inter coach Leonardo introduced Pazzini as a second half substitute and he made an instant impression, holding off his marker to convert a chipped pass from fellow-debutant Houssine Kharja in the 57th minute. Palermo then wasted a glorious opportunity to double their lead again, but Pastore's penalty kick, given after Thiago Motta had fouled Pajtim Kasami, was turned onto the post by Cesar. The home side made Palermo pay for that missed opportunity, levelling in the 73rd minute when Pazzini headed home Maicon's free-kick at the near post. And the turnaround was complete just three minutes later when Samuel Eto'o scored from the penalty spot after Ezequiel Munoz had fouled Pazzini. ""I never imagined having a day like this, it really was a dream to play with so many great players,"" Pazzini told Italian TV station SkySport. The result means Inter remain in the title race, although they trail leaders and city rivals Milan by nine points, they do have a vital game in hand. Milan won 2-0 at Catania on Saturday evening thanks to goals from Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. However, they had to do it the hard way after having Dutch midfielder Mark Van Bommel sent off on his debut following two bookable offences. Milan are four points clear of second-placed Napoli, who crushed Sampdoria 4-0 on Sunday aided by a hat-trick from Uruguayan Edinson Cavani -- the division's top scorer with 19 goals. Lazio lie third, a further three points adrift, after their 2-0 defeat of  Fiorentina on Saturday, courtesy of two Libor Kozak goals, while Inter and Roma share fourth position. Meanwhile, in Sunday's late match, the pressure has increased on Juventus coach Luigi Del Neri after his side slumped to a 2-1 home defeat against Udinese -- their fourth loss in seven games in 2011. Goals from South Americans Christian Zapata and Alexis Sanchez sealed the three points for the visitors, who are now up to sixth in the table with Juve one point behind them in seventh position. There were two matches played in Germany's Bundesliga on Sunday and both ended up in 1-0 wins for the visiting sides. Freiburg secured victory at struggling Stuttgart thanks to Johannes Flum's first-half goal, while Igor de Camargo's late strike was enough to give bottom side Moenchengladbach a narrow win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Moenchengladbach and Stuttgart are now level on 16 pouints at the foot of the table, while Freiburg moved up to sixth place following their success.","Giampaolo Pazzini scores twice for Inter Milan on his debut for the club .

"(EW.com) -- This weekend was always going to belong to The Wolverine. As the only film opening in wide release, James Mangold's dark take on the clawed mutant opened strong and walked away with about $21 million on Friday, which includes the $4 million it made in theaters that began showing the movie at 10 p.m. on Thursday night. Also, 3,063 out of its 3,924 locations are showing the X-Men pic in 3-D. The $120 million Hugh Jackman-starrer should easily make at least $60 million by the end of the weekend, slightly lower than some estimates — including ours — which placed it in the $70 million range. The opening is not quite as strong as 2009′s X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which had a $34.4 million Friday, and did not benefit from 3-D surcharges. Out of all the X-Men films, The Wolverine is tracking on the low end of the franchise, sitting between 2000′s X-Men which opened at $20.8 million on a Friday in mid-July, and X-Men: First Class which had a $21.4 million Friday. In second place, James Wan's possession horror movie The Conjuring experienced a normal 56.6% drop off and made $7.4 million on Friday in 3,022 locations. The modest $20 million flick has made $69.1 million domestically, and this is only its second weekend in theaters. EW: Can 'The Wolverine' save the summer box office? Universal's Despicable Me 2 took third place on Friday with $4.8 million. In its four weeks in theaters, the $76 million sequel has made an estimated $295.2 million domestically. By comparison, Monsters University has been in theaters for six weeks and has made about $253.4 million to date domestically. Turbo continues to stay in the top five despite a rocky start. It also blew past last week's dismal R.I.P.D. which dropped about 63% to ninth place in its second week. The Ryan Reynolds-voiced animated comedy brought in about $4.0 million on Friday for Fox. The $135 million family movie has made $46.5 million so far. Coming in fifth place was Adam Sandler's Grown Ups 2, with $3.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $93.8 million in its third weekend in theaters. The '90s-set R-rated teen sex comedy The To-Do List opened in 591 theaters this weekend with a $590K Friday, and Blue Jasmine, Woody Allen's latest, made $175,991 on Friday in six theaters in New York and Los Angeles. With such a strong cast and even more positive reviews, Blue Jasmine should enjoy a healthy run as awards season movies start taking over the theaters. Sundance hits Fruitvale Station and The Way, Way Back also went into wide release this weekend, but only Fruitvale Station made the top 10 on Friday with $1.4 million.

"(CNN) -- Rosalia Mera, Spain's richest woman and co-founder of the international clothing giant Zara, has died at the age of 69. Spanish media reported that Mera suffered a stroke while on vacation on the Mediterranean island of Menorca. She was transferred on Thursday from the hospital in Menorca to the private San Rafael Hospital in La Coruna, where she died at 8.30pm local time, according to newspaper reports. Zara's parent company, Inditex, said: ""The group wishes to send its sincere condolences to [Mera's] loved ones and friends at this extremely difficult time, after the loss of a person who contributed so much to the origins and development of the company."" Rosalia Mera Goyenechea was born on January 28, 1944, in La Coruna in Spain's Galicia region. The self-made billionaire began her career as a seamstress at age 11, when she dropped out of school to work as a tailor in a clothing shop. Mera married Amancio Ortega in 1966 and nine years later they opened the first Zara store in La Coruna. Zara expanded worldwide and over the years, Mera helped build the company into one of the world's biggest retailers. She and Ortego went on to found Inditex, which also owns the Massimo Dutti and Bershka brands. Mera and Ortega separated in 1986. They have two children, Sandra and Marcos. In 1986, Mera co-founded Paideia Galiza Foundation, based in her hometown, La Coruna. The organization helps people with physical and mental disabilities -- like her son Marcos, who was born with a mental disability -- to find jobs and it also provides training and education workshops. The foundation was not immediately available for comment. According to Forbes, Mera's net worth was $6.1 billion as of March 2013. Ortega, 77, remains Inditex's majority shareholder.

In fact, Van's ideas have helped lead to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs across the industrial Midwest and throughout the nation's decaying urban and rural areas. Van Jones also may be the most misunderstood man in America. He resigned from the White House last year after some sought to discredit him for missteps, such as political statements made years ago. However, we can never afford to forget that a defining trait of our country is our collective capacity to practice forgiveness and celebrate redemption. This is a nation built on second chances. In America, we ultimately judge people on what they are doing today for tomorrow, not for what they did yesterday. When former Alabama Gov. George Wallace embraced integration, we forgave him for having championed segregation. When West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd embraced civil rights legislation, we forgave him for having defended racist organizations. The real Van Jones story is about how a young leader became the father of the green jobs movement. In response to a longstanding jobs crisis in Oakland, California, he helped initiate the Oakland Green Jobs Corps, one of the nation's first job training programs targeting low-income people for work in the solar and green industries. This program has become a renowned model for numerous initiatives that are now up and running across America. Today, Van's vision for seizing the opportunity created by the global shift to solar power and other forms of renewable energy is becoming a reality. Policies he has promoted are bringing change to downsized economies across America. In Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, workers have gotten new jobs from a county wind turbine plant and from other wind energy projects generated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The jobs are union jobs with health benefits and living wages. At a time of record unemployment, when 2.7 million Americans are getting ready to lose unemployment benefits, green jobs can provide a way up for some families in dire need of good options. Long before joining the administration, Van was America's champion for green jobs. He helped found three national organizations, including ""Green for All"" in 2007, that are pushing for green energy jobs for Americans who urgently need work. Far from the divisive caricature painted by some cable news outlets, Van has been one of America's most effective and inspiring bridge-builders. He has successfully brought together labor leaders, business executives, civil rights champions, students and environmentalists to find creative solutions to the ecological and economic crises. His efforts earned him designation as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in 2004. His ideas served as the foundation for the 2007 Green Jobs Act, signed by President George W. Bush, which paved the way for $500 million in retraining funds provided under the Recovery Act during the Obama administration. Walk through the streets of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, or Akron, Ohio, once the steel and the rubber capitals of the world respectively, and you see the dire need for redeeming the American heartland. The lack of industry has devastated towns and cities and thrown families into catastrophe. Through Green for All, and others organizations, Van Jones continues to work for an American economy that can thrive again -- a nation whose prosperity reaches beyond Wall Street to Main Street and back streets. A country where jobs in installation, manufacturing and construction flourish again -- to upgrade our homes to conserve energy, create solar panels, build electric cars, and manufacture wind turbines and smart batteries. Furthermore, Van is working to make sure that our country does not lose out to India, China or Germany in the green industrial race. His vision gives us a fighting chance to reclaim something we lost years ago, back when steel was king. In those days, blue-collar workers could support their families with their wages, and our nation was not the world's leading debtor. Van's vision, in short, is a vision for America restored to its place as the definitive world economic leader. It is for reasons like these that Time magazine named Van one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2009 and that I am proud to give him the NAACP President's Award at our 41st Image Awards this Friday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Todd Jealous.","Benjamin Todd Jealous says Van Jones, Obama's former green jobs ""czar,"" is visionary .

"(CNN) -- If anyone wants to transform the old, lifeless, ""white-guys-in suits"" caricature of the Republican Party, look no further: Your dream candidate has arrived. Gabriel Gomez is an antidote to the stuffy Republican establishment that only says ""No"" and scares next-generation voters away. Sledding uphill in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts, the young and energetic Gomez is running to fill Secretary of State John Kerry's vacated Senate seat, calling himself ""a new kind of Republican."" Surprisingly, in this bluest of states, he has drawn within single digits of his Democratic challenger. Even stranger, perhaps, is that GOP money and support has not matched the flood of Democratic money that is pouring in on behalf of his opponent. Gomez has made it a close race with only a modicum of GOP help. His opponent, the plodding Ed Markey, is tailor-made for an upset. A lifelong career politician, Markey is the poster boy for everything that's wrong with Washington. The Boston Globe reports, ""The only jobs he would ever hold outside of politics were summer gigs as 'Eddie the Ice Cream Man' selling Fudgsicles and Beatle Bars out of an ice cream truck and a stint as a substitute teacher."" Markey has spent 37 undistinguished years in Congress, unencumbered by accomplishment, warming the same seat since ""Saturday Night Fever"" was a hit, John Travolta was thin and disco lived. During his tenure, Disco Ed has danced with the Washington establishment: He bounced 92 checks in the House banking scandal, took a million dollars in campaign contributions from special interests he regulates and voted himself regular pay raises while raising voters' taxes. When asked whether he could recall opposing a tax increase favored by his party's leadership, Markey told reporters he'd have to get back to them. If Markey has made Washington work, it has only been for himself. Begala: Why Gabriel Gomez is just more of the same old, same old . A weak candidate, Markey is being well advised that he should debate only when necessary and, preferably, after the election. In their most recent head-to-head, when Gomez challenged that Markey didn't understand the math of job creation, Markey responded, ""It's really not math. It's just arithmetic,"" drawing laughs on Twitter and despair from his elementary school instructors. Foghorn Leghorn could have been describing Markey when he said, ""That boy is as sharp as a bowling ball."" Word inside the community of Washington political consultants is that Democrats are growing increasingly anxious, ""seeing ghosts of Scott Brown"" and not liking their survey data. In his fundraising appeals, Markey himself is citing a Republican poll that calls the race a ""dead heat."" The PollTracker Average shows Markey with only a 6-point advantage. And a Suffolk University poll that had Markey leading by 17 points last month shrank that lead to just 7 points last week. At this point in the special election in 2010, Scott Brown was behind 9 points yet came from behind to take the race. Markey has hit the panic button. On the House floor a few days ago, a Republican congressman overheard a desperate Markey running up to a group of House Democrats, saying he needs a lot more money to win, that he feels it is too close and could lose -- and he's worried about a repeat of the 2010 election. Though President Obama remains popular in Massachusetts, anti-Washington emotion is cresting because of the IRS, Benghazi, news media snooping and NSA scandals, piled on top of America's stagnant economy and Washington's unstoppable indebtedness. There is a sense in Massachusetts, as everywhere, that ""Washington is out of control, like 2010,"" one of Gomez's consultants told me, ""and we need to send an outsider to watch the insiders."" Markey, who spends most of the year at his home in the D.C. metro area, is on the wrong end of that anti-Washington sentiment. Changing Washington is Gomez's campaign. A businessman who worked in private equity, as he explains, ""building the retirement savings of firefighters, public school teachers and policemen,"" Gomez graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis with merit. He then gained an invitation to flight school and earned the wings of Navy pilot, flying early-warning E2-C Hawkeyes and C2-A Greyhounds off aircraft carriers. That wasn't enough for Gabriel Gomez. He asked to transfer to the Navy SEALs. Though he knew that 80% never complete the grueling training and was warned he would lose his Navy pilot status if he didn't make the cut, Gomez started again from scratch, committing himself to the elite Special Operations force. He succeeded with distinction, becoming a SEAL platoon commander. There was still room for accomplishment on Gomez's rÃ©sumÃ©: After his service, he attended Harvard and earned an MBA. A son of Colombian immigrants, Gomez speaks fluent Spanish, as he proved in this week's debate, responding to one question entirely in the language of his parents' birthplace. A GOP that is struggling to reach out to a growing Hispanic audience couldn't ask for a better candidate. GOP Chairman Reince Priebus proved again why he is exactly the right man to be leading his party at this moment of transformation: The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to their credit, put on their big-boy pants and bet early and heavy on Gomez. Still, though Gomez is finally getting some help from GOP supporters, the most familiar independent pro-GOP groups have been sitting unexpectedly on the sidelines. As of June 12, the Markey campaign and outside pro-Markey groups were outspending the pro-Gomez forces on TV the final two weeks, $5.1 million to $1.8 million. The old GOP establishment is playing it safe. Steven Law, who runs Karl Rove's Crossroads super-PAC, has even told heavy-hitting GOP contributors to stand down because Gomez is ""too far behind to win."" The GOP needs Rove and Crossroads. In fact, the Republican Party is dependent on Rove: No one else on can raise the hundreds of millions he can to offset what pro-Democratic groups pour in against Republicans like Gomez. It would be foolish for any Republican to wish Crossroads anything but success. It's understandable that Rove and Law now want to be cautious and appear as responsible stewards, after blowing $300 million of their contributors' money in 2012 with nearly nothing to show for it, but they are paying a terrible price. No doubt the odds augur against any Republican in Massachusetts, as they did against Brown, but Gomez is a dream GOP candidate, running against one of the densest career politicians in D.C., in an anti-Washington environment -- and he's within single digits. It's time for the GOP to stop paying lip service to Hispanic outreach. This is the moment for Republicans to grow a pair. If not, we may not only blow our chance for a next-generation Republican to pick up a Senate seat but also the party's chance to turn things around and build momentum for the 2014 elections. Candidates like Gomez are the future. A GOP that wants a future should bet every chip on him. Gomez has adopted the SEAL ethic of ""team first"" as his own. It would serve all Republicans well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Castellanos.","Alex Castellanos: Gabriel Gomez is a dream candidate for the Republican Party .

"(CNN) -- I suppose Republicans are to be congratulated for nominating a Latino Navy SEAL as their Senate candidate in Massachusetts. I recall when GOP lowlifes mocked and lied about the war heroism of John Kerry, and just last year Mitt Romney was saying the DREAM Act was a ""handout"" and Latinos voted for President Obama because they wanted ""gifts."" But if you're looking for a ""new kind of Republican,"" Gabriel Gomez is not your candidate. He has called himself that. But in a recent debate, he admitted he would vote for Supreme Court nominees who would repeal Roe v. Wade. Nothing new there. He opposes the assault weapon ban, which even George W. Bush supported. So to the extent that's new, it's moving in the wrong direction in the eyes of most Bay State voters. He opposes Obamacare, even though it's working in Massachusetts already, and it was so dear to the heart of Massachusetts' legendary Ted Kennedy. Same old stuff. He has said he is open to repealing the home mortgage deduction for middle-class Americans but helped himself to a $281,500 income tax deduction in 2005 for not making changes to the facade of his pricey house. Republicans hammering the middle class but helping the rich -- that's not exactly new either. Oh, wait. Here's something new. As a private equity financier, Gomez -- in the words of the Boston Globe -- served as a director of several companies ""while they took on significant debt and cut jobs or moved overseas."" A Massachusetts Republican who got rich while laying folks off and shipping jobs overseas? Where have I heard that before? Alex Castellanos: Gomez a dream candidate for GOP . Gomez is not a new kind of Republican. And that is why he is going to lose. In the Senate, Democrat Ed Markey will fight alongside Massachusetts' rising star, Elizabeth Warren; Gomez would cancel her vote. Markey will support President Obama; Gomez will oppose him. Markey will stand for progressive change: an increase in the minimum wage, universal prekindergarten, tax fairness, rebuilding our roads and bridges and more. Gomez will empower obstructionist Republicans like GOP leader Mitch McConnell and the tea party extremists. That is why Markey will win and Gomez will lose: because it's not enough to just say you're new. Heck, I could say I'm George Clooney, but it won't change the fact that I'm a middle-aged balding dude. Gomez's military record is impressive, and his immigrant story is all-American. But his politics are just more of the same old Republican line.","GOP Gabriel Gomez is running against Democrat Ed Markey for Massachusetts Senate seat .

"(CNN) -- The last few years have seen the beginnings of an energy revolution in the U.S. The coming of shale gas and now shale oil has transformed not just its energy outlook, but also the climate change debate. The game has changed: Energy independence, the goal first set by Nixon in the early 1970s, looks like being achievable, at least for the North American continent. The game that has changed has profound implications for energy and climate policy. To date it has been based upon two assumptions: The first is that fossil fuel prices would go ever upward as oil (and gas) production peaked and then declined. That, in turn, meant that energy policy should actively try to increase the security of the supply by increasing domestic energy production. The second was that climate change is best addressed by a top down international climate change agreement, and that within that framework, the U.S. should accept a cap on the amount of carbon it would release into the atmosphere. The two assumptions fitted together. Ever rising oil and gas prices would make current renewable energy technologies, like wind and bio-fuels economic; and energy security would be enhanced through switching away from imported oil and gas. Taken together, putting a cap on carbon emissions would accelerate this transition, and the U.S. would want to do this for fear that others who pushed ahead with current renewables -- like the Europeans -- would gain a competitive advantage as oil and gas prices rose. The cap would, on this view, give Europe a head start with renewables, and as these become economic against the higher oil and gas prices, fossil fuel dependent countries like the U.S. would lose out. Almost everything that could be wrong with this approach has turned out to be so. The U.S. now has cheap natural and shale gas and it has rapidly rising oil production. Gas prices have more than halved in the last five years, and oil production is up over a quarter over the same period. Its carbon emissions have fallen to their lowest level for two decades in the first three months of 2012, partly because it has been able to switch from coal to gas, especially in electricity generation. Without much by way of either an energy or a climate policy, it has both improved its security and reduced its emissions. So great are the potential oil and gas reserves that already North America is producing most of its energy needs. Canada is having to look to export from its west coast rather than sell its oil and gas to the U.S. Indeed so great is the energy abundance that a process of repatriating energy intensive industries is now getting underway. The energy cost advantage of the U.S. looks likely to outweigh the labor cost advantage of China. The U.S. has adopted only a few really significant policies affecting climate. One, the pursuit of ethanol as a fuel is proving very expensive -- and tragic for world food markets. Another, the fuel efficiency standard for autos, is perhaps the sole example of effective policy on climate. The new energy abundance is not however entirely good news: Contrary to what many environmentalists have claimed, there are enough fossil fuels to fry the planet several times over. The obvious implication is that going green is not going to happen automatically through higher prices. On the contrary, low carbon technologies are going to be expensive and therefore out of the market for a long time to come. In the U.S., nuclear is the biggest casualty, but other renewables face the same challenge. Nor are the major world economies going to accept top down Kyoto style carbon caps any time soon. Faced with a serious world economic crisis, and with the U.S. now in pole position on the energy competitiveness front, the willingness of both China and Europe to go further and faster on carbon caps has got even weaker. At the Durban climate conference last year all that could be agreed was that nations would try to agree by 2015 what they might do after 2020. In Doha this year, nobody has had any serious expectation of much progress. By 2020, on current growth rates, the Chinese and Indian economies will be twice their current sizes, with lots more coal burned, and global carbon emissions will be beyond the critical threshold of 400 parts per million and on their way towards 500 ppm, thereby resulting in the 2 degrees-plus temperature rises the scientific consensus predicts. Faced with this new game, what should the U.S. -- and indeed the rest of the world -- do about energy and climate change? Two obvious recommendations are: Accept that Kyoto is not going anywhere and build on the new gas abundance to get out of coal. Broadly that is where the U.S. is heading. The next steps are harder: A carbon price is a necessary condition for facing up to the pollution our consumption is causing. If we don't want to pay the price of our pollution, then we don't want to tackle climate change. So far, the sad reality is that we are not prepared to act. That is why nothing much has been achieved on the carbon front since 1990. Why then might the U.S. consider putting a price on its carbon emissions, through taxing pollution? One powerful reason has nothing to do with climate change: It needs the money. Taxing carbon might be politically painful, but not as painful as taxing income. So for the wrong reason there are some grounds for optimism. What would be even better is if some of the money were spent on new technologies. Current renewables can't bridge the carbon gap. Low-density intermittent energy just doesn't generate enough electricity to carry though decarbonisation. But future renewables just might, and here is not only the best hope on the climate front, but also precisely where the U.S. stars. Its deep technological base and its entrepreneurial culture provide one of the best places to drive through the necessary advances. For the rest of the world, the lessons are much the same. Everyone needs to switch out of coal, and gas provides a now much more abundant alternative whilst we develop new technologies. Sadly Europe is engaged in a dash from nuclear and gas towards coal. It needs to waste less money on current expensive renewables -- especially the really expensive options like offshore wind -- and get serious about future renewables. Next generation solar technology is an obvious candidate. And everyone needs to put a carbon price in place. The climate change problem can be cracked, but not through current policies. And in the meantime the world needs to get used to the idea that the U.S. no longer needs the Middle East to keep its cars and industries moving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dieter Helm.","Dieter Helm: America's new abundance of energy is a game changer for the climate .
He says North America could achieve energy independence and is moving away from coal .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Their faces and darker skins make them look different. They are routinely called ""slave"" by the majority, whatever their profession. But Iraq's black population hopes that Barack Obama's rise to the White House will mark a turning point for minorities not just in the United States, but also in their country. Jalal Thiyab Thijeel quotes Barack Obama, saying it is time for ""change."" Jalal Thiyab Thijeel, general secretary of the ""Movement of Free Iraqis,"" followed every detail of Obama's election campaign. ""Inspiring,"" he calls it. Inspiring politically, and personally. Like Obama, Thijeel has family roots in Africa. ""We told our people, Inshalla, God willing, Obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world,"" he recalls. ""We're going to make him a model to follow. Even our old women were praying for him to win."" When news broke that Obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of November 5 in Basra -- but Thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party. It was a moment, he tells me as we talk on a street in Baghdad, that he'll never forget. ""Now we, the dark-skinned people, feel even closer to the American people because Obama is one of us."" Thijeel's organization estimates there are approximately 2 million black Iraqis. The country's total population is more than 28 million, most of them ethnic Arabs. It's impossible to verify Thijeel's estimate, since the government does not keep statistics on race, but there is no denying there are many black Iraqis in the southern city of Basra. Their history goes back 1,000 years to the time when Africans were brought as slaves to the south of Iraq to drain marshes and build Basra. Many Iraqis still call blacks ""abed,"" an Arabic word that means ""slave."" Thijeel grimaces when he pronounces it. It's demeaning, he says, and he wants the government to forbid its use. Many white Iraqis claim the word isn't meant to offend, but Thijeel says they have no idea how hurtful it is. ""I never want my son to go through this,"" he says.  Watch what Obama means to some Iraqis » . He also wants his son -- and his daughters -- to have access to good jobs, something that is not the case now, he says. In Basra, many black Iraqis have menial jobs. Although no one can point to any official discrimination, there are no black members of the Iraqi parliament. The Movement of Free Iraqis was founded two years ago and on January 31 it will run the first slate of black candidates in Iraq's modern history. Thijeel hands me the party's documents that spell out its demands. Foremost is that the government recognize blacks as an official minority in Iraq. This is key, because power in Iraq is apportioned along ethnic, religious and even tribal lines. The party also wants an apology for slavery, although it is not asking for financial reparations. The movement also wants laws to combat racial discrimination. The party has found some nonblack political allies. Awad Al-Abdan of the National Dialogue Front says, ""There's been social oppression for a long time. We have a tribal-based society and, according to traditions and customs, the black man is considered to have lower status."" Some white Iraqis say that founding a political party on racial lines is divisive, especially when Iraqis of different communities need to pull together. But Thijeel, quoting Barack Obama, says it's time for change. Although he's speaking in Arabic, he uses the English word ""change."" ""There's a change in international politics,"" he tells me. ""Obama won, and not that long ago, in his country, black people were marginalized, so this event has shattered all barriers.""","Iraqis of African descent are marginalized by society, called ""slave""
Obama's victory makes black Iraqis feel closer to U.S., one says .

"(CNN) -- I have interviewed Dominique Strauss-Kahn many times over the years, usually after an international summit or IMF meeting. The agenda at those interviews was the normal stuff of such events; debt, deficits and dismal economic performance. The prospect of sitting down with the former IMF chief and asking about personal matters relating to his New York arrest seemed unseemly, and even more odd when it was to be juxtaposed with a discussion on the current economic situation. I worried Strauss-Kahn would be too timid in giving strong views on the eurozone crisis, its leaders and the problems facing the global economy. After all, why should a man now regarded as an outcast of scandal be willing to offend people anymore, especially as he was looking to rehabilitate his image? READ MORE: Two years later, DSK still smarting over 'perp walk' But Strauss-Kahn is a man of frank views and, even with the best will in the world, he can't help but want to express his opinions. He was part of the troika which negotiated the original Greek bailout in 2010. He says the European Union's repeated attempts to buy time has been a ""catastrophe,"" leading to the Cyprus bailout. That, he added, was ""another disaster."" On the eurozone, he is not afraid to describe the ""crises in leadership"" facing the union, where he says there are ""lions led by sheep."" I don't think he had any particular leader in mind, rather a collective process in Europe built in a way that ""no hard decision can be made."" During the interview, I realize I am speaking with a man who is free of responsibility and not really worried about treading on toes. He knows his place in history will be forever defined by seven minutes in a hotel room in New York and his sexual liaison with a maid there. Charges of rape and sexual misconduct were dismissed after the prosecution admitted the victim involved had a history of lying and was not credible. WATCH: Strauss-Kahn: Europe's banks are 'sick' Asking Strauss-Kahn about this is embarrassing; our interviews until now have always been about economics and financial markets, not arrests and libertine soirees. I try to lighten the moment suggesting there's no easy way to ask these questions. He recognizes my predicament and quips back: ""There's no easy way to answer them."" He is ready for what is coming his way. His anger at being paraded in handcuffs before the world's press is still palpable. ""A most terrible thing....the perp walk takes place at the moment where you are supposed to be innocent,"" he told me. He maintains the events in Suite 2806 are ""private."" The problem is it's not only the New York incident. Since then, a series of incidents have been revealed involving sexual behavior which suggests gross errors of judgment, not expected of people in high office. ""I agree, I agree,"" he tells me. He calls it a ""mistake"" to ""believe you could have a public life.....and that you can have a private life."" Opinion: DSK is back - anyone feel sorry for him? He added: ""I have a problem with understanding what is expected from politicians of highest levels."" For someone who has been in the public eye for several decades, this may seem a remarkable statement. But perhaps not for someone who has been in the cloistered environment of French politics, where private and public are clearly defined and mistresses and ""libertine soirees"" are ignored. Listening to Strauss-Kahn talking about the economic dangers ahead is perhaps the most interesting of our time together. After all, he is considered one of the greatest practical economic politicians of our time, bringing together theory and practice. He has a prescient warning about the forthcoming U.S.-EU trade talks. The U.S. wants to ""dominate the world"" by setting the standards for trade with agreements both across the Pacific and Atlantic, he says. ""The Europeans should not be that naive."" I am not confident Europe will avoid this fate. Pulling together the strands of our talk, Strauss-Kahn has already said that the EU cannot make a decent collective decision. He doesn't take it this far, but I suspect he believes those sheep leading the union will lead to a trade slaughter. Our agreed time of half an hour has passed far too quickly. I am left with the impression of a man who has discovered who his friends are and is now finding out what he wants to do next. He says politics does not feature in that future. He is quite clear that he will not run for the French presidency. When asked, he says: ""No, no."" It could not be clearer. Strauss-Kahn is charming, witty, candid and perhaps cunning. He carries himself with the air of a man unafraid of his life's next twist. He knows some people will shun him and he says he respects their view. But he also believes there are those who will seek his help and advice. And for them he is ready to serve, politics be damned.","CNN's Richard Quest has interviewed Dominique Strauss-Kahn many times, but this time the agenda was different .

"(CNN) -- ""Look around. We are living in a heavy metal world."" -- Faisal, lead vocals, Acrassicauda . Four young men start a band in a basement. Their music is loud, their t-shirts lurid, their language littered with expletives. Big noise? Big deal. But Firas, Tony, Marwan and Faisal aren't your average young metalheads. They claim to be Iraq's only heavy metal band, and the documentary film ""Heavy Metal in Baghdad,"" which premiered at this year's Berlin Film Festival, gives a harrowing glimpse of their everyday life in a city torn apart by war. Directed by Eddy Moretti and Suroosh Alvi, with Spike Jonze sporting an executive producer credit, this feature follows the four young musicians' desperate struggle to make the music they love, from the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003 to the present day. The directors track down Acrassicauda (the band is named after a particularly venomous black desert scorpion) on the streets of Baghdad. We follow them to their bombed-out basement rehearsal space (obliterated by a Scud missile) and watch their fans embrace them at a rare gig at the Al Fanar Hotel.  Watch clips from one of the band's gigs in a Baghdad hotel » . But as co-director Alvi explained to CNN, what started as a short rockumentary evolved into a full-length feature that highlights the plight of so many civilians trying to live a normal life in Iraq's capital. ""We went over to find the band,"" he said. ""They were speaking for so many faceless Iraqis who were affected by the war, displaced from their homes by the war."" And that's where ""Heavy Metal in Baghdad"" gets its power. As the band struggles to overcome roadblocks, curfews and power cuts just to get to rehearsal, this portrayal of four regular guys surrounded by violence and chaos is a striking picture of a city's populace caught, quite literally, in the crossfire. ""Nobody could live under the same circumstances that an Iraqi could live in,"" says bassist Firas. ""You have to deal with death and fear every day,"" adds singer Faisal. That fear is reflected in their music. There's little room for allegory in their songs, ""Massacre,"" ""Between the Ashes"" and ""Orphan Child"": These titles reflect the band's everyday existence. In Baghdad, as fundamentalism begins to flourish post-Saddam, Acrassicauda and their fans are viewed with suspicion for both their music and their appearance. Three years into the documentary, a clerical council issues a bundle of edicts that ban, amongst other vices, long hair on men, ""improper Western clothes"" and ""music-filled parties and all kinds of singing."" Even Acrassicauda's local guitar emporium has closed, the owners cowed by fundamentalists into shutting up shop. That makes it tough if you want to play American-style heavy metal, condemned by some of their compatriots as satanic. In a country where the number one rule of survival is to keep your head down, bass player Firas says, ""just wearing a United States band t-shirt can get you killed,"" while paying homage to Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde's flowing locks is out of the question. ""Where is the freedom if I can't wear what I want, say what I want?"" he argues.  Watch clips from the documentary and hear the band speak about Iraq » . But the band persists, sweating through 21-hour-long rehearsal sessions and continuing to sport t-shirts emblazoned with their idols: Metallica, Slayer, Slipknot. In such a constrained situation, it's no surprise that the band feels frustrated. ""You just feel like you're caged, like there's chains all around you,"" says drummer Marwan. For Acrassicauda, playing at one of their infrequent live performances is an all-too-rare opportunity to find some release. ""For two hours, we want to free ourselves from those chains, get that rage out,"" he continues. And the film's surreal scenes of Iraqi metallers writhing in a makeshift mosh pit against the shabby genteel backdrop of a hotel function room -- in the middle of the afternoon -- underline the pathos of the reality in which the band exists.  Watch clips from one of the band's gigs in a Baghdad hotel » . Surrounded by an ever-increasing band of bodyguards, and strapped into flak jackets, Moretti and Alvi's approach often feels reckless, and sometimes a little gung-ho: they're journalists hooked on the trail of a hot story. That contrasts with the nervy, cautious approach of their subjects, as Acrassicauda snatch careful moments to share their lives with the directors. Director Suroosh Alvi told CNN, ""The story ... is playing out in real time. It's happening every day for these guys."" Firas, Tony, Marwan and Faisal, who have all lost friends or family members, know too well that Baghdad is no playground. The crux of the film sees Acrassicauda's members faced with a hard choice: stay in Baghdad and risk getting sucked into the conflict, or flee, abandoning their homes and families, for a slim chance at survival in neighboring Syria. But Syria is no easy lifeline: They'll face a perilous 16-hour bus ride, run the gauntlet of barricades, checkpoints, kidnappers and exploitative fixers, and risk their life savings. As they wrestle with their decision, the band members' ways of coping with their plight come to the fore. Marwan greets the situation with aggression -- ""if I don't play drums, I'd kill someone"" -- and a growing anger at those who have allowed the situation in Baghdad to arise; Firas conceals his feelings behind bravado and laughter; while singer Faisal becomes increasingly withdrawn and introspective. The band has now fled to Turkey, their passage funded by well-wishers from the worldwide heavy metal community. Their mission -- to make the music they love -- continues. It's a constant struggle to survive, but one that Acrassicauda aren't prepared to abandon -- yet. As Firas says, they won a major battle just by proving that they could make their kind of music in a war zone. ""Nobody was expecting that in Iraq, heavy metal could exist,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- A University of Pittsburgh research professor accused of killing his wife with a lethal dose of cyanide pleaded not guilty Tuesday, according to Mike Manko, spokesman for the Allegheny County District Attorney's office. Robert Ferrante was extradited from West Virginia to Allegheny County Jail in Pennsylvania on Tuesday morning, where he later appeared via video conference at his arraignment, according to the Allegheny County district attorney's office. The arraignment lasted only five minutes. Ferrante pleaded not guilty in the death of his wife, Autumn Klein, 41, former head of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, according to the district attorney's office. Several preliminary hearing dates have been set for early next month regarding the custody of Ferrante and Klein's 6-year-old daughter, Cianna, who is in the care of her maternal grandparents, the district attorney's office said. Hearings have also been set regarding Ferrante's assets. Before his arrest on July 25, Ferrante was a researcher and professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. Part of his job included managing a laboratory where he conducted clinical trials using various drugs and chemicals, according to a criminal complaint. Several text messages sent between the couple before Klein's death in April suggest that Ferrante urged Klein to try using creatine to get help her get pregnant, according to the complaint. CNN Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen reports that some people use creatine to build up muscle and may have some medicinal value, but that there is no connection between increased fertility and creatine use. A source close to the case told CNN: ""One of the theories the prosecution will work off of is that the cyanide was mixed with the creatine that Ferrante was urging his wife to take."" One day before Klein fell ill, Ferrante had used his University of Pittsburgh credit card to place an overnight order for more than a half a pound of cyanide. At the time the order was placed, there were no active projects at Ferrante's lab that involved the use of cyanide, according to the complaint. Cyanide is a naturally occurring toxic substance that can be found in seeds of various plants. It is widely distributed throughout research laboratories as a chemical used in scientific experiments. Cyanide interferes with the ability of the body to use oxygen to produce energy, which can lead to rapid death. ""Cyanide in low doses will make you dizzy, you'll start breathing rapidly, but if you get it in big doses, it can actually make you stop breathing and that's what kills you,"" Cohen said. On April 17, Allegheny County 911 dispatch received a call from Ferrante requesting medical assistance for his wife, who he said was possibly having a stroke, the complaint read. He described her condition as ""conscious and breathing, but not alert."" When paramedics arrived, they found Klein on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine. Klein died on April 20. In a statement made to detectives shortly after being informed of Klein's death because of cyanide poisoning, Ferrante said, ""Why would she do that to herself? Who would do this to her?"" according to the complaint. A neighbor of the couple told CNN on Tuesday that nothing seemed amiss to her. ""I've never seen anything to suggest they were anything but a happy couple with a beautiful little girl,"" Blithe Runsdorf said. She said the family had just gotten back from a trip to Puerto Rico and that they had never seemed happier. Runsdorf added that after his wife's death, Ferrante ""acted like a guy who had everything pulled out from under him."" Ferrante's defense attorney, William Difenderfer, told CNN Tuesday that his client is ""devastated not only for losing his wife but being accused of it."" After a nationwide manhunt, Ferrante was arrested on July 25 in West Virginia. He has also been placed on immediate and indefinite leave, according to University of Pittsburgh spokesman John Andrew Fedele. Ferrante will appear in Allegheny County Court on September 23 for a preliminary hearing regarding the criminal homicide case. Another neighbor to the couple said the community is concerned about the welfare of the couple's daughter, whom he described as ""essentially an orphan now."" The neighbor said it was ""no secret"" in the neighborhood that Klein wanted to have another baby. However, Klein told the neighbor's wife that Ferrante did not want another child, said the neighbor, who asked not to be identified. He called the whole situation ""a tremendous shock"" and added that this was not the kind of case where someone could say, ""Oh, there was a lot of fighting."" He said he was aware of none of that. He described the couple as ""dedicated and hard-working"" and their daughter as ""bubbly."" ""They were hustling and trying to manage a family and the demands of the American Dream,"" the neighbor said. Allison Malloy, Poppy Harlow, Sho Wills, Erinn Cawthon and Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley contributed to this report.","NEW: The wife wanted another baby, a neighbor says .

"(CNN) -- This weekend at the box office, a superhero comedy, a Steve Jobs biopic, and a Harrison Ford thriller all got served by a butler. ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" to be exact. The Weinstein Company's awards-bait drama, which stars Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, topped the chart with an excellent $25 million from 2,933 theaters in its first frame. Audiences issued the well-reviewed picture an enthusiastic ""A"" CinemaScore grade, which sets it up for a lucrative box office run as summer draws to a close. ""The Butler"" opened in the same range as ""The Help,"" which found $26 million in its first weekend in August 2011. Like that film, ""The Butler"" tells a racially charged story that is playing particularly well with older women. According to Weinstein, crowds were 60 percent female and 76 percent above the age of 35. Winfrey's presence no doubt helped lure in many of those ticket-buyers, as did ""The Butler""'s ""inspired by a true story"" cachet. Time will tell whether the film can match ""The Help""'s $169.7 million total, but given ""The Butler""'s low $30 million cost, it doesn't need to hold particularly well to become a major success. Of course, with its positive reception and its reputation as the first Oscar contender of 2013, ""The Butler"" should have no trouble performing at least as well as 42, which ran away with $95 million after a $27.5 million opening earlier this year. Weinstein may have a true cash cow on its hands. ""We're the Millers"" maintained its spot in second place. The pot-smuggling comedy, which stars Jason Sudiekis and Jennifer Aniston, fell only 33 percent in its second weekend to $17.8 million and has now lit up $69.5 million worth of tickets against a trim $37 million budget. ""Millers"" is now a lock to surpass $100 million at the domestic box office, which would make it Sudeikis' second film to reach the milestone (alongside his previous Aniston team-up, ""Horrible Bosses""), and Aniston's sixth. 12 comic stripper scenes . Last weekend's champ, ""Elysium,"" took a major hit in its sophomore frame. The $115 million sci-fi film dropped 54 percent — the largest fall in the top 10 — to $13.6 million, which gives the tepidly received spectacle a $55.9 million total. Currently, ""Elysium"" seems headed for an $85 million to $90 million finish — well below director Neill Blomkamp's $115.6 million finish for ""District 9."" Down in fourth place, Universal's ""Kick-Ass 2"" stumbled in its opening weekend with a meager $13.5 million. That's a big step below the original ""Kick-Ass,"" which debuted to $19.8 million en route to $48.1 million total in 2010. While that was hardly an eye-popping total, Universal pushed ahead with a sequel based on ""Kick-Ass""' popularity in geek circles and its strong home video sales. Unfortunately, few people were very interested in the sequel (including star Jim Carrey, who would not do any publicity for the R-rated film after deciding he would not promote violence). ""Kick-Ass 2,"" which fortunately cost only $28 million, extends the streak of under-performing sequels that has plagued Hollywood over the past month. ""Red 2,"" ""The Smurfs 2,"" ""The Wolverine,"" and ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" have all failed to match their predecessors' grosses. Audiences were 63 percent male and 58 percent below the age of 25, and they awarded the film a ""B+"" CinemaScore. Were these sequels necessary? ""Planes"" descended 41 percent in its second weekend to $13.1 million, which brings the $50 million animation's total to $45.1 million. Obviously, that's not a ""Monsters University"" or ""Despicable Me 2""-sized number, but given ""Planes""' relatively low cost (and gigantic merchandise appeal), it's flying high enough to keep Disney happy. 1. Lee Daniels' The Butler -- $25 million . 2. We're the Millers -- $17.8 million . 3. Elysium -- $13.6 million . 4. Kick-Ass 2 -- $13.5 million . 5. Planes -- $13.1 million . Two newcomers finished outside the Top 5. ""Jobs,"" Open Road Films' Steve Jobs biopic starring Ashton Kutcher, didn't sync with moviegoers and floundered with $6.7 million. Fortunately, the picture cost only $12 million to produce — or about the amount that Apple has earned since you started reading this sentence. Meanwhile, ""Paranoia,"" a $40 million thriller starring Liam Hemsworth and Harrison Ford, fared even worse. The Relativity-acquired film grossed a truly terrible $3.5 million from 2,459 theaters, yielding a $1,423 theater average. The misfires were issued ""B--"" and ""C+"" CinemaScore grades, respectively. In limited release, ""Blue Jasmine"" continued to impress. The Woody Allen-directed film starring Cate Blanchett increased its theater count from 119 to 229 locations but maintained a robust $10,303 average, which gave it $2.4 million for the weekend. After four weeks, ""Blue Jasmine"" has earned a remarkable $9.5 million. Next weekend, ""The Mortal Instruments,"" ""You're Next"" and ""The World's End"" all hit theaters.

"(CNN) -- The Stamford Bridge faithful gave their returning hero a rapturous reception before Jose Mourinho's Chelsea team made sure the ""Special One"" would be celebrating Sunday as they beat Hull 2-0 in their English Premier League opener. Mourinho, returning for a second spell in charge at Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, said after the win that it was proof he had made the right decision. ""It was fantastic, something you don't forget. I know they (the fans) love me and that's the reason I'm back and could say 'yes' to Mr Abramovich,"" he told Sky Sports. The Portuguese saw his team dominate from the start with first half goals from Oscar and veteran midfielder Frank Lampard sealing the three points. Lampard could afford to see his sixth minute penalty saved by Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who made amends for his clumsy foul on Fernando Torres. Brazil's Oscar was played in by man of the match Kevin De Bruyne before beating McGregor for the 13th minute opener. More might have followed in a fluent display by the Blues, but Lampard stepped up to double the advantage with a perfectly struck free kick. Promoted Hull improved after the break to prevent a rout, introducing a number of their close season acquisitions, including record signing Tom Huddlestone from Tottenham Hotspur. Mourinho, back after managing Inter Milan and Real Madrid, acknowledged his team had been unable to match their first half heroics although under no serious pressure. ""It was a brilliant first half, high intensity, great quality, great football. ""But it was no surprise that in the second half the intensity went down because our pre season was not easy, with a number of players involved in midweek internationals,"" he added. Earlier, Huddlestone's old club made sure Crystal Palace's return to the EPL would also end in defeat. Tottenham secured a 1-0 away win at Selhurst Park thanks to a second half penalty by their record signing Spain international Roberto Soldado. They also fielded other new signings Paulinho and Nacer Chadli in midfield, but Real Madrid transfer target Gareth Bale was not included, still nursing a foot injury.

"(CNN) -- New season, new manager same free scoring Barcelona who routed Levante 7-0 in their La Liga season opener Sunday. Gerardo Martino's first competitive game could hardly have gone better, a record 6-0 ahead at the break in the Nou Camp, with Pedro adding his second before the final whistle. New signing Neymar also made his Spanish league debut as a second half substitute, having been left on the bench by Martino after his midweek international exertions. ""We need to continue like this, we know we have just started and the season is very long. If we keep going like this then we can achieve great things,"" goal scoring hero Pedro told Barcelona TV. Argentine Martino, replacing the cancer-stricken Tito Vilanova at Barca, will certainly be hoping for repeat performances in their domestic title defense. Talisman Lionel Messi ran the show in the first half, scoring twice and setting up a number of other goal scoring opportunities. Alexis Sanchez opened their account after fine work from Manchester United target Cesc Fabregas before Messi grabbed his first of the new season. Analysis: Martino who? Is El Tata the man for Barca? Messi then set up the third for Dani Alves before his through ball allowed Pedro to open his account. His second of the night came from the penalty spot and the first half scoring spree was completed by midfielder Xavi after excellent work from Fabregas. Brazil international star Neymar came off the bench just after the hour mark to test his legs for his new club and came close to marking his debut with a goal before being booked late on. ""We put a lot of emphasis on pressing and we managed to sustain it for the majority of the match,"" said a delighted Martino. Barcelona's arch rivals Real Madrid also began their campaign under new boss Carlo Ancelotti with a win, but were made to fight hard by Real Betis in the Bernabeu. Jorge Molina put the visitors ahead with a well taken opener, but Karim Benzema canceled it out in the 26th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo hit the crossbar with a shot in the second half and wasted some good scoring opportunities before new signing Isco headed in an 86th minute winner from Marcelo's cross. In the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund went top on goal difference with a 2-1 win over Eintracht Braunschweig. Midfielders Marco Reus and Jonas Hofmann made the breakthrough with 75th and 85th minute goals, the second from the penalty spot. The visitors grabbed one back when a corner deflected in off Borussia's star striker Robert Lewandowski. Dortmund head five teams, including champions Bayern Munich, who have won both their opening two games in Germany.

"(CNN) -- In his first in-depth TV interview since his dramatic escape from house arrest, Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng told CNN about his departure from China and his continuing concern for family and friends he left behind. He also spoke about tasting freedom recently. ""I haven't been able to feel (nature) for a long time,"" said Chen, who is blind. ""I had some time to soak in the sun and feel the breeze. I just felt I hadn't been able to do that in so long. I have missed out for too long. "" Chen's brother fled village to seek legal advice, lawyer says . Asked about speaking out against China, he said, ""It was natural for me, it was very natural for me. I feel it's in people's nature to want to stop evil and embrace the good."" His experience being under house arrest in China, he said, brought much suffering. ""I want to correct one thing here,"" Chen said. In the future, he continued, ""let's not use the word 'house arrest,' but instead let's use the term 'illegal detention.' It's hard for me to describe what it was like during that time. But let's just say that my suffering was beyond imagination."" He made his comments Thursday morning in an exclusive with CNN's Anderson Cooper. Chen's arrival in the United States on Saturday brought an end to a diplomatic firestorm between Beijing and Washington that erupted after he escaped from house arrest in the Shandong province. Chen, 40, and his wife and children are in the United States for Chen to study at New York University under a fellowship. Chen told CNN that he and his wife were beaten periodically in China. ""Yes, it was beyond everybody's imagination,"" Chen said. ""But I don't want to talk about it right now."" Five days after arriving in the United States, Chen said he was still gathering his thoughts about his escape. ""After evading danger and the obstacles, I was able to get out of Dongshigu village (his home town) and then I called my good friend Guo Yushan in Beijing. ""He quickly led a team to find me and drove me to Beijing. I was able to talk extensively with him during the journey and found out what had been going on in the outside world. So Mr. Guo played a very important role in this process,"" Chen said. Though staying in a safe place in Beijing, he began to worry about his safety, he said. He was also getting treatment for a foot injury, he said. He came up with a safer place to stay, he said. He noted how acquaintances in China helped him. ""There's one thing I want to mention that may be a surprise to many people,"" Chen said. ""When a group of people come together and accomplish something, they often fight for credit. In my case, all those people who went to Shandong to pick me up, when the news broke, they were fighting for risk instead of credit. They were all trying to claim responsibility to make others safer."" Chen, who's blind, fears the Chinese government may retaliate against acquaintances who helped him, he said. ""Of course, I'm very worried. We can see their retribution against my family since my escape has continued and been intensified,"" Chen said. Shortly after Chen escaped from his village, his nephew, Chen Kegui, was arrested and accused of murder. Chen Kegui's father, who's Chen Guangcheng's brother, has fled his village in eastern China to Beijing to seek legal advice, his lawyer said Thursday. ""When dozens of men break into someone's house with weapons in the middle of the night, taking away your parent with a hood over his head and detain him without any legal basis and then go back to assault my nephew, he only reacted when he could no longer bear the beatings, and his actions would be self defense according to any Chinese law,"" Chen told CNN. ""They injured his head, and made him bleed for three hours, and his clothes were shattered and the sticks they used to beat him were bent, and if actions under such circumstances (were) not called self-defense, would there be any meaning left in having the term self-defense in Chinese law?"" Chen added. Chen asserted that the Chinese government seeks to convict his nephew under an unfair legal process. ""What they're doing now is not very different than what they did to me in 2006,"" Chen said. ""They told my nephew no lawyers are willing to defend you. Then they tell lawyers outside (that) Chen Kegui has already hired lawyers. I experienced the same thing in 2006. Back then I told them clearly I have my own lawyers. I don't need you to appoint lawyers for me. But they forced ... a government-appointed lawyer onto me despite my protest."" In 2006, Chen was sentenced by a local Chinese court to four years and three months in prison on charges of damaging property and ""organizing a mob to disturb traffic"" in a protest, charges that his supporters called preposterous. Chen rose to fame in the late 1990s because of his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices, such as alleged forced abortions, by China's family planning officials. Read about a report finding brutal methods by city enforcers . After he was released from prison in September 2010, he had been confined to his home along with his wife, mother and daughter. Regarding his 2006 trial, Chen told CNN: ""That whole process was just a farce of them investigating, prosecuting, trying and convicting all by themselves."" To ensure his nephew receives a fair trial, his case should be assigned to a court outside of Shandong, Chen said. ""Chen Kegui's case should be moved elsewhere, so he can have a fair trial and have his innocence and freedom back,"" Chen said. ""China's own criminal procedure law means Shengdong authorities cannot be involved in Chen Kegui's case."" The case ""is going to be a benchmark in testing China's rule of law. It's going to be a litmus test,"" Chen continued, ""because in his case, what happened was not difficult to verify. The facts are clear. The key is whether or not they want to act based on facts and accordance with law."" On Saturday, the activist indicated through a translator that the U.S. government granted him partial citizenship rights. He asked people to work with him to ""promote justice and fairness in China."" And Chen said he was looking forward to recuperating in ""body and spirit.""

"(CNN) -- Six months on from the strike-related violence that left 44 people dead at the Marikana mine in South Africa, unrest and uncertainty still plague the country's mining sector. At least nine mine employees were hurt Monday when security guards shot rubber bullets to break up a confrontation between rival union groups at Anglo American Platinum's Siphumelele mine, in northwest South Africa, Anglo American said in a statement. It's the latest in a number of incidents at South African mines that have disrupted the industry. A string of wildcat labor actions, coupled with rising power costs and depressed commodity prices on the international market, have put pressure on many mining companies operating in South Africa, the continent's largest economy. ""Mining companies have really struggled to get back onto production levels prior to the strikes,"" says Abrie Olivier, mining leader for southern Africa at Deloitte. He adds that the ""heightened tensions"" witnessed last year have also raised questions about the role of unions within the mining sector. Last year's tensions have been widely blamed on competition for members between rival trade unions -- the more established National Union of Mineworkers and the fast-expanding Association of Mineworkers and Construction, which is seen as the more militant of the two. Olivier adds: ""Six months down the line, there's quite a big process in terms of redefining the landscape of the unions -- who's in control and who's not, who's got the voice of the workers and who doesn't, how do mining companies engage with labor through union."" Last August, violent clashes at a platinum mine owned by Lonmin, in Marikana, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg, sparked national outrage after 34 people died when police opened fire on striking workers. Ten others died in the earlier days of the protests, including two police officers. After the carnage, wildcat strikes marred by violence became the order of the day in South Africa's mining sector. Fatal clashes between rival unions, as well as underground sit-ins, brought several operations to a halt and cost the country big money in lost production. In December, Harmony Gold cited security concerns for its decision to suspend operations in its Kusasalethu mine, about 100 kilometers west of Johannesburg. The company, which is one of South Africa's top gold producers, has only now reached an agreement with unions and expects the mine to return to full production toward the end of June. Last month, discontent among workers rose again after Anglo American Platinum, the world's top platinum producer, announced plans to mothball two mines, sell an unprofitable one and put 14,000 jobs at risk, although those plans are currently on hold. The potential job losses could spell trouble for the ruling African National Congress party that's already struggling to deal with the country's 25% unemployment. Unfulfilled promises of a better life post-apartheid have already led to an increase in urban unrest in recent times. Analysts say that mining is the backbone of South African economy. According to the country's Chamber of Mines, the sector employed about 513,000 people in 2011. Over the past 10 years, the industry has contributed just over $213 billion (1.9 trillion rand) to both the country's GDP and export earnings, in real money terms. After more than a century of mining gold, platinum had become South Africa's new cash cow. But the sector is struggling with an oversupply in the international market and soaring production costs. At the same time, pending increases in electricity costs and the potential of further labor unrest over the coming months, when wage contracts will be up for renegotiation, as well as uncertainty over mining legislation, have all helped exacerbate an already challenging situation. This has prompted some investors to look for opportunities in other countries. ""It will vary according to the mineral group and project life cycle but we are likely to see investors looking elsewhere in the region ... particularly if the South African government doesn't come out quite strongly and say what its plans for the sector are going forward,"" says Simiso Velempini, South Africa analyst for global business risk consultancy Control Risks. ""We are seeing some investors looking to Zimbabwe, Namibia and increasingly Mozambique, which has vast untapped natural resources,"" she adds. Police fire tear gas as striking miners protest . In December, the government, which is currently amending its Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, moved to ease investors' concerns by ruling out nationalization as a policy option. Instead, it opted for ""strategic"" state involvement in key sectors of the industry and hinted at new taxes as it declared that the ""state must capture an equitable share of mineral resource rents through the tax system and deploy them in the interests of long-term economic growth, development and transformation."" But, Velempini says, lack of clarity about the level of state intervention in the industry is keeping investors wary. ""That is going to be something that investors want to hear more about and want to be reassured about in 2013,"" she says. ""Which state-owned enterprises will potentially increase their involvement in the mining sector but also how the government plans to increase the local South African participation in the sector, through what means and ways."" But despite the sector's recent woes, most analysts agree that mining holds the key to a prosperous South Africa. ""It's an industry that's going through a lot of change and it's going through a lot of pain, for the better,"" says Olivier. ""If there's one industry that is very resilient it is the mining industry and South Africa will get through it and I think it will be for the better in the long run."" Velempini agrees. ""The mining sector in 2013 is in for quite a tumultuous period but having considered the sector's contribution to the country's GDP, but also its contribution to employment levels, the government will have a strong reason to try and ensure that there is policy clarity and also a measure of stability in the medium term,"" she says.

"Maputo, Mozambique (CNN) -- In their new apartment in Maputo, the vibrant and cosmopolitan capital of Mozambique, Bruno Gabriel and his girlfriend unpack their last suitcases, still trying to settle in their new surroundings. The Portuguese couple relocated to the southeastern African country a few months ago, making a deliberate career move to swap the economic uncertainty of their crisis-hit country for the prospect of a better future abroad. They are part of a growing Portuguese community fleeing the severe eurozone crisis in search for jobs and economic opportunities in their country's former colony. ""In Europe everybody is a little bit afraid with their own future because (of) the crisis, worldwide crisis, in terms of economics,"" says Gabriel, a marketing director who has head-hunted to work in Maputo. ""Once we start to enter the labor business, once we start to work, we understand that to plan the future is a little bit more difficult than what you expected."" Although Mozambique gained its independence from Portugal in 1975, and retains Portuguese as its national language, many in the African country continued until recently to see the former colonial power as a land of opportunity. But now, with Portugal mired in financial woes amid a worsening European debt crisis, that notion is increasingly being reversed. How Mozambique turned from war zone to tourist hotspot . In the Portuguese consulate in Maputo, consul general Graca Pereira says she's seen a rise in experienced, university-educated Portuguese migrating to Mozambique looking for a brighter future. ""In the last two or three years, people began to come increasingly,"" she says. ""Lots of people for small investments, some others working with the companies, some others working contract by other people. So a variety of people."" In addition to the common language, the familiar architecture and the rich culture, the main draw for Portuguese in Mozambique is the country's impressive economic performance in recent years. In 2011, Mozambique's real gross domestic product grew by 7.2%, boosted by the country's first overseas export of coal, as well as strong performances by the transport, communications, construction and financial services sectors, according to the African Economic Outlook. The country's economy is also forecast to grow by 7.5% and 7.9% in 2012 and 2013 respectively -- an alluring incentive for those Portuguese wishing to escape the lack of opportunity back home. Locals in Maputo say the new arrivals from Portugal fly into Mozambique nearly every day. ""None of us is facing financial difficulties or is unemployed,"" says Portuguese entrepreneur Pedro Alvin Castro. ""What we envisage is to find places for the future because in the next five to 10 years Portugal will slow down and stagnate. ""We want to find places like Mozambique where there is the reverse, where we have sustainable growth for the next five to 10 years."" The Africans looking to make it in China . One of many new Portuguese immigrants in Maputo is Vanessa Souza. The 32-year-old left Lisbon in January and now she is working for AVI, a successful South African consumer goods company, helping to promote and sell tea, biscuits and coffee to Mozambique's growing middle class. She says she's now earning more than she did back home, works shorter hours, and can afford a car, cell phone and insurance. ""New life, new country,"" says Souza, explaining that she can now build her future -- something she didn't dare to do in Portugal where many are struggling under the weight of austerity and unemployment is at around 15%. ""We have jobs here and the language is the same,"" adds Souza. ""We have opportunity here."" Yet it's not only the cosmopolitan Maputo that's attracting large numbers of Portuguese. The recent discoveries of vast reserves of coal and gas off Mozambique's northern coast have also sparked a big swell of investment in the country as well as the emergence of second industries in the towns around the mines. According to the consul general, there are many Portuguese who are bypassing Maputo to set up restaurants, join small companies or offer skills in these frontier towns. ""People are moving outside Maputo and are even beginning their businesses outside of Maputo,"" says Pereira. ""So it is very interesting. It could be very useful also."" Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . As for the Mozambicans, locals say there has been little backlash to the return of the Portuguese to the country -- this time, however, under very different circumstances compared to the colonial era. ""Yes, they're coming but I think (it's) really positive,"" says economist Hipolito Hamela. He explains that the new businesses that are being set up create jobs for local Mozambicans, while the influx of foreign skills help the country's development. Also, government quotas on the number of foreigners that a company can hire ensure that local jobs are protected. Yet, notwithstanding the recent improvements, life in Mozambique, which is still one of the poorest countries in the world, is not without challenges. Souza says her biggest concern in Maputo is security while Gabriel notes that he is frustrated with the slow pace of life compared to Europe. ""It's a little bit more difficult to make things happen than it is in Europe,"" he says. ""Mozambique is a challenge every day."" But despite all the difficulties, it is here where Gabriel and many of his compatriots have chosen to develop their careers. And if Portugal's economy remains stuck in turmoil, many others could follow them, lured by Mozambique's growing and untapped opportunity.

"(CNN) -- Trains are as intrinsic to life for India's billion-plus people as cars for Americans. Think, then, what it means that the Railway Ministry has been accused of ignoring ""massacre"" on the tracks. About 15,000 people die each year simply trying to cross India's mammoth network of railway lines, much of it left over from colonial days. That according to a scathing new safety report that blames the government for a lack of safety on a railway system used by 20 million Indians each day. Often, vast slums hug tracks and people live lives synchronized with the rhythms and noises of the trains roaring by. They walk the tracks every day as though it were their backyard. The report by the safety panel, set up in September after a series of rail accidents, said many of the deaths resulted from outdated technology and a lack of infrastructure. ""Reluctance of Indian Railways to own these casualties, which do not fall under the purview of train accidents but are nevertheless accidents on account of trains can by no means be ignored,"" said the report issued recently by the High Level Safety Review Committee. ""No civilized society can accept such massacre on their railway system,"" it said. The panel said 6,000 of the deaths occurred in Mumbai's commuter system alone. ""We feel the grim situation on the Mumbai suburban system has to be tackled on a different war footing,"" it said. People are dying, it said, because of unmanned train crossings and a lack of barricades, fences and pedestrian bridges. Or the platforms are too narrow and stations lack facilities such as elevators for the disabled. Another 1,000 people die because they fall off crammed compartments or in train collisions, the report said. It said accidents of a minor nature and near misses were not included in the data. The report made a host of safety improvements and recommended a budget of about $20 billion over the next five years to implement changes. ""The demands on the system are rapidly growing without commensurate investments for upgradation of technology and modernization consistent with modern times,"" the report said.","15,000 people are killed trying to cross train tracks every year .

"Washington (CNN) -- If you're a Republican woman, the GOP wants you. To run for Congress, that is. The Grand Old Party holds a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. Yet of 234 Republican members, only 19 are women. In an effort to boost that number, the House Republican campaign committee is launching ""Project GROW,"" a program largely led by the party's female members designed to bring more women into the fold. CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash spoke exclusively with three sitting House Republican female members spearheading the effort, and one GOP woman hoping to score a House seat. To a person, they recognize that at the very least, Republicans have an image problem-- especially after studying the results of the 2012 election. According to CNN's 2012 exit polls, 55 percent of women voted for Barack Obama, a stark leap over the 44 percent who voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney. And Democrats made gains in both the Senate and the House. ""We saw that as Republicans, even though we were talking about the issues that affected America, women across this country felt we were not connecting with them,"" Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-North Carolina) said. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Missouri), serving her first congressional term, said she and her colleagues need to talk to women ""in a way that's going to make their life better and easier."" ""You know, I told my colleagues close your eyes, say that you're speaking to that 37-year-old single mother of two who's trying to make it to the 15th and the 30th of the month,"" said Wagner. ""What do we have to offer her? How do we make her life easier, better, more manageable? These are the kind of messaging things we need to do and I think we've got ... real opportunities here, both to motivate women in the electorate, but also to motivate women to run for public office."" Indeed, women make up a mere 8% of the Republican House caucus. House Democratic women comprise a staggering 29%, by comparison. The Republican women agree it boils down to encouraging more GOP women to run. Curiously, ""women who are going to run for office, they almost need to be asked,"" Ellmers said. ""They need to make sure there's a place for them."" Male GOP members, who don't traditionally seem to need such encouragement, are involved in recruiting women as well. In fact, Project GROW also involves educating elected Republican men ""about connecting with women and doing a better job and going out and meeting with women."" Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Indiana) said. ""Women business owners, women volunteer organizations-- just doing a better job connecting with where they are, with things they care about,"" Brooks said. Martha McSally, an Air Force fighter pilot who flew combat patrols over Iraq and Afghanistan, is running in a rematch for Gabby Giffords' old seat in Arizona, which she just barely lost to Democrat Ron Barber last year. She is exactly the kind of political recruit these GOP women say they're looking for. ""The Democrats have been effective in attacking us and branding us in a way that's just not accurate,"" McSally said. ""So in my race ... my opponent, a white man, was trying to lump me in the war on women, she said, pointing to a Democratic attack line during the 2012 election accusing Republicans of waging a ""war against women."" ""And here I am a pioneering military woman, the first to fly in command in combat. I sued Donald Rumsfeld for making our servicewomen wear burkas over in Saudi Arabia. I mean, I am not a part of the 'war on women.' I've been fighting for women my whole life,"" she said. McSally said she doesn't know why women make up only a small percentage of the GOP caucus. ""I can only say that in my experience, running that when I engage with Republican, independent and Democratic women in my community, and you talk about the issues that matter to them,"" she said. ""If we you connect with them, and we're real, and we show our leadership, we show we're solution oriented."" Meanwhile, the top House Democrat recruiter told CNN her party doesn't need a special project to attract women candidates to run with our party."" Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Florida), the chairman of the Democratic National Committee charged with adding more Democratic members, said Republicans have a ""wholly unappealing agenda"" that alienates women and discourages them from affiliating themselves with the GOP. She says Republicans are ""wrong"" on the economic, healthcare, cultural, and education agendas ""that are important to women."" ""I think acronyms are nice, but at the end of the day women voters in this country and potential women candidates are going to continue to choose the Democratic party because we value the input and feedback from women, and we're the party that grows leaders,"" she said. Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, who as head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is working to elect Democrats to the House, told CNN ""The difference between Republicans and Democrats is that they have to work hard to recruit women to run for Congress. All I have to do is answer my phone."" Republicans have their work cut out for them. Project GROW's website says the effort will focus specifically on recruiting, messaging, polling, candidate training, fundraising, a strong digital presence, and other things ""to increase female participation."" At the end of the day, Ellmers believes that, despite appearances, women voters largely lean Republican. ""That's why in Project GROW, we're going to be focusing on listening, and recruiting, and engaging and motivating,"" she said. ""Because we want women across this country to be involved in Republican beliefs. We believe most women are conservative."" Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Republicans launch drive to attract women candidates for Congress .

"(CNN) -- Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly looking to harness Africa's opportunity, lured by an emerging middle class across the continent's growing urban centers. Although the total size of the African market is still small compared to other global regions, analysts say that the continent's big cities hold the key to unlocking the industry's lucrative potential. In such areas, increasing individual wealth, coupled with a stronger health system infrastructure and a rising demand for drugs treating chronic diseases, are driving demand for pharmaceuticals, say analysts. ""Urban centers have the highest concentration of the segments of the population that are more likely to be relatively wealthy, more likely to be educated and also possibly more likely to suffer from the chronic diseases of affluence that are becoming increasingly important in Africa,"" says Sarah Rickwood, director of Thought Leadership at IMS Health. Read this: Off-road bikers race to save lives in rural Africa . According to a recent IMS report, called ""Africa: A ripe opportunity,"" pharmaceutical spending on the continent is expected to reach $30 billion in 2016, up from about $18 billion now. By 2020, the market could represent a $45 billion opportunity for drug makers, spurred in part by robust economic growth and demographic changes. This can only be good news for people like Rudzani Modau, owner of Mangalani Pharmacy in Soweto, just outside Johannesburg in South Africa. ""The pharmaceutical business is growing and it will grow,"" says Modau. ""It's the next big thing in Africa."" Modau says his profits have soared over the last decade. ""We have a lot of potential in Africa,"" he adds. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Africa is home to 11% of the world's population, yet accounts for 24% of the global disease burden. But while infectious illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis still remain a major problem, the continent is also expected to experience a surge in demand for treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCD), such as cardiovascular and respiratory disorders as well as cancer and diabetes, in the coming years. The WHO estimates that by 2020 the biggest increases in NCD deaths will occur in Africa. ""We're seeing a movement of volume towards more products that treat chronic diseases,"" says Rickwood. ""As urban populations are becoming wealthier, they're more likely to have a Western diet, they're living longer and they're going to suffer the kind of chronic diseases that Western individuals suffer."" A 2011 report by the African Development Bank said that Africa's middle class -- defined as people spending between $2 and $20 a day at 2005 prices -- increased to 34% of the continent's population in 2010 -- nearly 313 million people. The continent's urban population is also projected to exceed that of China and India by 2050, according to U.N. figures. Next to major market-leading multinationals such as Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, which traditionally have had a strong presence in the continent, a diverse mix of drug manufacturers have made significant inroads in recent years. Indian and Chinese companies have more than doubled their imports to Africa over the last decade. In addition, some local players in South Africa and northern Africa have also had success, reaping the benefits of an already established market. In 2011, South Africa, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco accounted for more than half of the continent's pharmaceutical sales. It's not surprising, then, that major cities in these countries are expected to be at the forefront of the industry's growth. According to IMS, between 20-30% of Africa's $30 billion opportunity in 2016 will be driven by the top 10 cities in the continent -- all of them in South Africa and northern Africa, with the exception of Lagos in Nigeria. Excluding South Africa and northern Africa, 10 major sub-Saharan Africa cities make up another 12% of the 2016 forecast. ""There is a rapidly growing opportunity across Africa, not just in the markets that are well established,"" says Rickwood. ""Growth is strong and the macroeconomic indicators are that growth will continue to be strong over the next 10 years and probably beyond."" Read this: African CEOs look to bright future . Yet companies keen to tap Africa's pharmaceutical opportunity must overcome several challenges whilst operating in a diverse and heterogeneous market, made up of more than 50 countries, different languages, varied regulations and unequal levels of infrastructure development. Amid such challenges, the industry is also keeping an eye on the substantial threat posed by counterfeit drug makers, who are also trying to benefit from Africa's expanding demand for modern medicines. ""Frankly, the presence of counterfeit keeps me up at night,"" admits Kofi Amegashie, managing executive for the Africa region for Adcock Ingram Healthcare, a South African pharmaceutical company. ""We've had instances of counterfeit in East Africa, so far that's where we found counterfeit. You've got to live with it, in that we can't eradicate it completely, but we've got to stay on top of finding a counterfeit and bringing its presence to the authorities."" Still, despite these challenges, insiders say the industry's future is bright. ""Without a shadow of a doubt,"" says Amegashie. ""I'd say that there is a boom and it's going to get even stronger as the middle class grows. And I think you've got to be on the ground now to be able to win in this segment.""","Africa's urban middle class is attracting pharmaceutical firms .
Analysts say pharmaceutical spending will rise to $30 billion by 2016 .
