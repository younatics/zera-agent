"By . Michael Seamark . and Colin Fernandez . The Goldsmiths finally called a Twitter truce yesterday to their increasingly bitter marital row. After a week spent publicly trading insults on the  social networking site, multi-millionaire Ben Goldsmith and his wife Kate decided their ugly break-up should become private. However, their apparent  truce was immediately put to the test, after it emerged that the Rothschild heiress's alleged lover, US rapper Jay Electronica, posted a photo of her on his Twitter page. High-flyers: Jay Electronica posted a picture on Twitter of Kate Rothschild accompanying him on a helicopter ride to a Jay Z and Kanye West concert last month. Kate and her estranged husband Ben Goldsmith today confirmed they are to divorce . Outburst: Kate Rothschild took to twitter to attack her critics, telling them to 'get on with fixing' their own lives . The picture, captioned . '@KateRoundtable (her Twitter user name) at the Watch The Helicopter . tour', is likely to inflame the bitter break-up. The rapper also recently tweeted: 'The handling of the heart is a very delicate art cause it's paper thiiiiin (sic).' Mrs Goldsmith had been branded . 'appalling' by her  husband over her relationship with Electronica – . prompting a succession of extraordinary tweets from her. She claimed her 'life had been saved' by the rapper, accused her husband of cheating on her and being . 'irrational', and said she was merely responding to the 'vultures' taunting her. Heading for divorce: Ben with Kate, who he has branded 'appalling' over her . relationship with a rapper . Rapper Jay Electronica who is believed to be having an affair with Kate Goldsmith leaving a flat in Cadogan Square, London . Yesterday, however, the  prospect of . an acrimonious 'Twitter divorce' battle between two of the world's most . famous banking dynasties appeared to have led to an agreement. In a joint statement the couple said: 'We are both deeply saddened that our marriage has ended after nine years. 'It is a matter of regret that, at a . time when our emotions and those of our friends have run high, things . have been said in public which should have been kept private. We accept . our share of responsibility.

Hollywood actress Lucy Liu in the band Bullitts . Row: Kate Rothschild had tweeted that hip-hop star Jay Electronica, pictured, had 'saved her life' after her husband branded her 'appalling' for her relationship with the musician . 'There will be no further comment.' News of the split emerged last weekend after police arrested Mr . Goldsmith at the couple's £20million family home in Kensington, West . London on suspicion of actual bodily harm. It reportedly followed a confrontation . between the Eton-educated financier, the youngest son of Sir James . Goldsmith, and his 29-year-old wife over explicit texts and emails . between her and Electronica. Mr Goldsmith, 31, who inherited . £300million, was released without charge after accepting a caution.  He . later announced he was filing for divorce on the grounds of adultery. Kate Rothschild posts Instagram picture of her children on a plane to Twitter, which was then given a 'like' by Jay Electronica (see small pic bottom right) Kate Rothschild posts cryptic tweet about being in a 'talespin' in first message since husband blasted her over relationship with rapper . It provoked an ugly war of  words between the couple which culminated in the tweets by Mrs Goldsmith on Thursday. In 14 messages posted in quick . succession, the music producer – who calls herself Kate Rothschild on . Twitter – wrote: 'Our marriage went bad a few years ago and none of you . have any idea what I went through along with my husband. My husband is a . brilliant and incredible man... but relationships can go wrong. This is . the darkest time of my life.' In response to a Twitter user who . wrote: 'Imagine if you'd been cheated on', she replied: 'I have, several . times.' By yesterday morning all the messages had been deleted. Electronica, 35, refused to comment . last night. But a neighbour said: 'Jay is a perfect Southern gentleman. Kate is absolutely lovely. They are a lovely couple.' Kate Rothschild took to Twitter to defend herself in the latest move in the battle between the estranged spouses . Backing from women: Mr Goldsmith has been deluged with messages of support on Twitter since it was revealed he had split from wife Kate . It is not the first time that a Rothschild heiress has put everything on the line to pursue an edgy musician. The alleged affair between Kate Goldsmith and rapper Jay Electronica echoes that of her great aunt, who left her husband and five children to live with a jazz artist in the 1950s. In both cases, their family and friends were mystified and shocked by their behaviour. Kathleen Annie Pannonica Rothschild, the Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter, who was nicknamed Nica, first became infatuated by pianist Thelonious Monk after being introduced to jazz by her brother, Victor Rothschild – Mrs Goldsmith’s grandfather. She moved to New York and became consumed by the jazz scene, where she was known as ‘The Baroness’. There she helped to support many struggling musicians, arranging for rehearsal space and transporting them to clubs in her Bentley. By 1954 her marriage to a wealthy French diplomat and war hero, Baron Jules de Koenigswarte, was over and she lost custody of her children. She later hit the headlines after Charlie Parker, the jazz saxophonist and composer, died in her hotel suite – a scandal that cast a dark shadow over the rest of her life. However, her relationship with Monk was to endure for three decades until his death in 1982. Monk – who would go on to become a giant of 20th century music – would later move into her New Jersey home,  which served as a sanctuary for ageing jazz musicians.

"By . Martha Kelner for The Mail on Sunday . Follow @@marthakelner . As he dutifully performed Mobots before the race, you would not have guessed Mo Farah was consumed by nerves. Yet he admitted feeling very vulnerable before his hard-fought 10,000m gold last week. Farah’s personal battles over recent months have given that victory extra significance. So to win the 5,000m title today and scoop a second gold would help eliminate the self-doubt he has felt after health scares and relative failure. ‘I’m not invincible,’ said Farah, ‘I’m just a human being and sometimes you doubt yourself when things are not going quite so well. There are times when I’m struggling and going through different emotions. Success: Mo Farah wins the 1000m final at the European Championships in Zurich . Two weeks ago I pulled out the Commonwealth Games and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be all right for the Europeans. You ask yourself questions; “Am I ready?” Physically, you might be ready but mentally you might not be. ‘It would be awesome if I could do the double in Zurich. If I can run a good race and similar to what I’ve run to previous years, then I’d know. I’d say “Yes, you are on the right track.”.’ Four years ago this week in Zurich, Farah became the first Briton to run under 13 minutes for the 5,000m. It confirmed his world-class credentials. He calls it a ‘magical place’ and it would be more special if he can harness the wonder of the venue to get back on track. Only human: Farah said that he is not invincible and sometimes is filled with self doubt . Victory: Farah enjoyed success after having to pull out of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Farah has been reminded of the fragility of his career by his setbacks. He laughs when asked when he will be going back to the marathon. ‘I haven’t thought about the marathon yet!’ Farah regrets turning to training for the London Marathon after winning the distance double at the World Championships in Moscow last year and his competitive debut over 26 miles was a disappointment as he finished in eighth. Farah has also endured some ‘scary’ moments this year. He collapsed after the New York Marathon in March and points to four stitches in his left ear sustained when he collapsed after a training run in Utah. ‘It gives you a different outlook on life,’ said Farah, ‘If it was just myself then you wouldn’t think too much about it, but I’ve got kids, I’ve got family. That’s when you think a lot and say to yourself, “Wow”. It’s scary.’ Farah plans to continue for four or five more years before retiring to spend more time with his family. But his focus is now on the 5,000m final. ‘It would be good to show all my opposition, everyone who knows I’ve been ill, that I’m back,’ he said.

"By . Emily Davies . Presenter Jenni Murray has criticised the sexism she said is still rife in the classical music world . Presenter Jenni Murray has criticised the sexism she said is still rife in the classical music world. The veteran host of Woman’s Hour on Radio 4 pointed to the way female performers are  marketed to the public. ‘The women who seem to be most welcome are the ones who are prepared to go along with the old idea that sex sells,’ she said. Miss Murray, 63, made her comments to Radio Times as she announced she will conduct the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra – despite not being able to read music. She continued: ‘Look at the way the violinist Nicola Benedetti and trumpeter Alison Balsom are marketed. ‘The BBC is not entirely blameless in this  matter.  For the first time this year, the Last Night of the Proms – that wonderful night in the  classical music calendar – will be conducted by a woman, the American genius Marin Alsop. It only took 119 years to get there.’ The broadcaster said the drive for equality of the sexes in classical music has been ‘shockingly’ slower than in other walks of life, leaving women ‘downgraded, excluded and downright insulted’. She cited incidents where female musicians have been undermined by colleagues. These included a woodwind player who was told her clarinet practice must improve her talent in ‘other departments’. One percussion player was told she would be better off as a housewife. Miss Murray highlighted how women who play in orchestras can be discriminated against because of their appearance. In 2000, conductor Leonard Slatkin told The Times he did not want overweight women in his orchestra. The veteran host of Woman's Hour on Radio 4 pointed to the way female performers, including Nicola Benedetti (left) and Alison Balsom (right), are marketed to the public . ‘I tend to favour covered arms, especially among the violinists,’ he said. ‘You don’t want to see too much flapping about.’ Even the language used can be biased against women, added Miss Murray. ‘Maestro suggests a man of extraordinary  talent in complete control of his players. ‘Diva implies a difficult and demanding woman, verging on hysteria,’ she said. The radio star will be given just one . lesson by conductor Jessica Cottis before facing the BBC Philharmonic . Orchestra on June 21. For the first time this year, the Last Night of the Proms will be conducted by a woman, the American Marin Alsop (pictured) Her performance will feature the . Overture to Bizet’s opera Carmen in a live broadcast of a special . edition to mark women in music. She . admitted to having limited experience, saying: ‘I studied music at . school but only as far as the fourth form – many years ago. I was . excellent at appreciation, not so good on the practical side, gave up . piano after four lessons (I hated the teacher) and played triangle in . the school band. ‘I shall . have a few hours’ training. I do know the piece. I shall, I hope, . terrify the players into submission with the power of my baton and by . peering at them over the top of my specs.’ Miss Murray said women who play in orchestras can be discriminated against because of their appearance in a Radio Times interview.

"By . Martha Kelner for The Mail on Sunday . Follow @@marthakelner . Eilidh Child was taught to hurdle by her older sister using a pair of cones and a stick in the driveway of the family home in Perth. It was in the grander surroundings of Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium that the groundwork paid off with a European championship. ‘I owe Iona a lot,’ she said after the 400m hurdles final. Taking a gold medal back to Scotland, to go alongside the silver she won at the Commonwealth Games, is a fine demonstration of gratitude to the elder sister who first coached her over the obstacles as a 10-year-old. Child described her vitory as a ‘complete relief.’ It was the first major championships final where she was expected to win, as the fastest qualifier and by being the best in Europe this year. Celebration: Eilidh Child celebrates winning the Women's 400m hurdles at the European Championships . ‘I was feeling the pressure,’ she said, ‘Anything other than winning it and I’d have been disappointed. I was quite nervous but I managed to calm myself and did what I had to do.’ The 27-year-old started strongly, clearing the second hurdle easily and putting her foot down to move away from the field with four hurdles left. She began to tire coming off the final hurdle but dipped to cross the line in 54.48sec, holding off the fast finishing Ukrainian, Anna Titimets. ‘I just tried to get to that line as quickly as possible,’ said Child, ‘My legs were dying all of a sudden and I was about five metres out and everybody came alongside me. I didn’t really know what had happened when I crossed the line. Obviously the Commonwealths meant a lot because it was at home but to actually have my own title now and be European champion is the best feeling ever.’ Finish: Child crosses the line ahead of the Czech Republic's Denisa Rosolova . Winner: Gold medalist Child said her sister had first taught her to hurdle . Child, who was a part-time PE teacher at Perth Grammar School until 2011, praised her coach, Malcolm Arnold, for helping get her mentally ready after the hype of being the Glasgow 2014 poster girl. Now she hopes to be given a place in today’s 4x400m final after the team of Emily Diamond, Kelly Massey, Victoria Ohuruogu and Margaret Adeoye advanced third quickest. ‘It would be nice to add another gold to the collection,’ said Child. Then she has a couple more Diamond League races before her punishing eight- month season ends in September. Lynsey Sharp ran the fastest 800m of her life but she was outsprinted in the final straight by Maryna Arzmasova. Sharp, 24, led until the final 60m when the Bulgarian, who beat her own personal best by more than a second, charged past. Number one: Child reacts after winning the 400m hurdles in Zurich . Afterwards, she collapsed into the arms of her mother, Carol. ‘I’m gutted,’ she said, before bursting into tears, ‘I just don’t know if I did the right thing.’ Sharp has adopted a new confident, front-running style. She said: ‘I knew I had a fast race in me but that’s the most uncomfortable way to race, running scared the whole way and I knew in that field someone was coming — it was slightly suicidal.’ There was no fairytale double for Jo Pavey, the 40-year-old mother of two who won the 10,000m title this week. She did not have the speed on the final lap, finishing seventh in the 5,000m.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 20:58 GMT, 15 November 2011 . Alive and kicking: President of Malawi Bingu wa Mutharika was said to be furious at reports he had died . When their 78-year-old president  vanished from view, the people of Malawi feared he was gravely ill or even dead. There was talk in the African nation’s capital, Lilongwe, that Binguwa Mutharika had flown to China for lifesaving treatment. The rumours were so damaging that yesterday the president called a telephone press conference to prove he was, in fact, very much alive. He came on the line from Hong Kong and spoke to a group of political reporters, including one from the Nyasa Times. ‘Mutharika, reportedly furious with the death rumours, told the journalist that he was in sound health and that his wife Callista was also well,’ said the newspaper. 'The President laughed off the rumours that he was dead and that he was gravely ill. The president insisted he was simply taking his 30 days of annual leave. His absence has outraged his countrymen who face an economic crisis. Mutharika has also clashed with the UK over the possible loss of aid money. Mutharika was introduced to the assembled journalists by his spokesman Hetherwick Ntaba and the country's vice president Yunus Mussa, who called the leader on his mobile and handed the phone to the media. He said he had decided to take his 30 days of holiday in Hong Kong. The Malawi press had reported that the president was suffering from a mystery ailment and being treated at a top private hospital in Hong Kong. However, his brother Aurther-Peter Mutharika, the country's foreign minister and heir apparent, said he was simply enjoying a shopping trip with his wife. New wife: President Mutharika at his wedding to Callista Chapola-Chimombo in April last year . Landlocked Malawi state has suffered chronic fuel shortages in recent weeks which has seen pump prices soar by more than 30 percent. Experts fear the move could lead to widespread civil unrest amid an increase in general inflation. This year has already been a traumatic one for Mutharika, who has ruled Malawi for seven years. The controversial statesman was condemned by the international community in July when more than a dozen people died after he deployed the army to crush protests against his government. In August he raised eyebrows again by sacking his entire cabinet and assuming every position himself. The statesman has since appointed new people to most of the roles, including several members of his own family. Meanwhile the president's recent actions have led to strained relations with Britain. In April Mutharika was criticised by London after threatening to expel the UK's high commissioner to Malawi when the diplomat expressed concern over his autocratic rule. The tyrant later retracted his decision and allowed the envoy to stay. However he has lashed out against Britain again in recent weeks amid speculation the UK could cut aid to developing nations which fail to protect gay rights. Mutharika has accused prime minister David Cameron of trying to meddle in the affairs of his country, where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by prison.","Binguwa Mutharika, 78, had stopped off in Hong Kong on way back from Commonwealth conference ."
"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is famous for the shortest flight in the world, but Orkney is now really reaching for the skies - it is to have an aviation festival. Running from September 10-14 it will highlight the story of military and civil aviation in the islands. Orkney has been over the years at the centre of numerous aviation developments, through two world wars and the pioneering air service of Captain E.E.. (Ted) Fresson in the 1930s. Up and down: Loganair has been running the 'world's quickest regular flight' since 1967 from Westray to Papa Westray . All aboard: Baggage is loaded onto a Loganair plane for the short journey from Westray to Papa Westray in the Orkney Islands . A new era in island aviation began in 1967 with the start of Loganair's inter-island service and the company's president, Scott Grier, will tell the story, with archive footage, on September 12. And the air link between Westray and Pappa Westray is the world's shortest regular air service. In November the route claimed a new record - with a woman at the controls for the first time. Rebecca Simpson, 35, took over the 1.7-mile journey from Westray to Papa Westray which attracts flight fans from all over the world. The record flight time, from the wheels coming up to touching down again, is 52 seconds, and the plane normally has room for eight or nine passengers. Next month's aviation festival is an initiative of a local group Another Orkney Production, led by photographer and film-maker Moya McDonald. She said that that she wanted to put on record the remarkable range of achievements in aviation that have taken place in Orkney. Don't get too relaxed: The scale of the flight - that could take less than a minute . History: Scottish writer Ann Scott-Moncrieff as she prepares to take her flight as the first Orkney resident to fly the Pentland Firth with pioneering aviator captain Ted Fresson in the cockpit . The festival will also hear about the Fleet Air Arm in Scapa Flow from the daughter of one of the pilots, Sheena Taylor who comes from Stromness. The closing event of the festival will be an Aviation Trail Bus Tour, including the unveiling of an aviation interpretation board at the Standing Stones Hotel in Stenness. The first Orkney resident to fly the Pentland Firth was Agnes Shearer from Kirkwall, then a young reporter at The Orcadian, who later became the well-known Scottish author and contributor to the BBC, Ann Scott-Moncrieff. Her untimely death at the age of only 29 was described at the time as a 'serious loss to the literary and cultural life of Scotland'. Ms McDonald said: 'Orkney is the ideal location for an Aviation Festival. From the flying boats in Scapa Flow on U-boat patrol to today's pioneering Loganair inter-island services, Orkney has a wonderfully rich and varied aviation history.'","The 1.7 mile journey from Westray to Papa Westray on Orkney usually takes less than two minutes by plane .

"By . James Rush for MailOnline . It may not be the most common father-daughter bonding exercise, but for this Texan teenager and her alligator-catching dad, it's all in a day's work. 'Gator' Chris Stephens was called out to the Sienna Plantation neighbourhood, in Missouri City, after a large alligator was spotted in a pond. Mr Stephens, a licensed nuisance hunter, also enlisted the help of his 13-year-old daughter Taylor, however, in his bid to capture the animal for the safety of the residents. Scroll down for video . 'Gator' Chris Stephens (left) and his 13-year-old daughter Taylor (center) captured an alligator, with the help of a policeman (right) in the Sienna Plantation neighbourhood, in Missouri City . Mr Stephens was called out after the large alligator was spotted in a pond, so he took his daughter along to help . After waiting patiently for a number of hours, Mr Stephens managed to catch the animal and bring it ashore, with the help of his daughter, KHOU.com has reported. Taylor not only helped hold on to the rod but also covered the alligator's head after climbing on top of it. When it comes to helping her father out however, Taylor hardly finds it disconcerting. She said: 'I've been doing it since I was four, so it's not scary. It's more of a routine.' After capturing the reptile, Mr Stephens warned residents who had gathered in the area not to feed alligators in case they get too big and start attacking people. He said: 'The next person may have their chihuahua with them, and the gator's not mean, he's just thinking - wow, they brought me a chihuahua today.' After waiting patiently for a number of hours, Mr Stephens and his daughter managed to capture the alligator . Following its capture, the animal was due to be taken to an alligator farm in El Campo. In an unrelated incident earlier this month, teachers preparing for the first day of classes at a Texas school got an early morning surprise in the form of an alligator at the back door. Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office deputies were called out to capture the animal on Wednesday, August 13, at Beck Junior High. An employee alerted authorities that the seven-foot alligator was outside so they could remove it before students returned to campus. After capturing the reptile, Mr Stephens warned residents who had gathered in the area not to feed alligators in case they get too big and start attacking people . Authorities found the reptile across campus near some air conditioning units. 'One of our deputies is kind of a veteran at doing this type of thing,' Bob Haenel of the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office told ABC. 'After several attempts of trying to rope the alligator, he managed to put a towel over the gator’s head to calm him down and then roped him.' The alligator was then taken to a 'more natural habitat' than the school yard.","Chris Stephens and his daughter catch alligators together in Missouri City .

"By . Helen Pow . Alleged victim: San Francisco tech entrepreneur Ben Way, pictured, has revealed his story to make the subject of domestic abuse against men less taboo . A San Francisco tech entrepreneur has opened up about the shocking beatings he allegedly suffered at the hands of his ex-girlfriend in an effort to make the subject of domestic abuse against men less taboo. Ben Way, 33, claims, in an article published online Tuesday, that he was punched in the jaw, bitten, scratched, stabbed in the foot with a stiletto and struck in the genitals during the attacks. Some nights, he told MailOnline, he even 'hid the knives' in the apartment the couple shared for fear his partner would take things further. The British-born dot com millionaire met his younger ex, who MailOnline is not identifying, after he moved to Silicon Valley from the UK three years ago. The couple were inseparable for about a year, and Way says he is still madly in love the woman who allegedly abused him. 'It was a very loving relationship most of the time, and that is what makes it so difficult,' he told MailOnline. But he says things started to fall apart a few months back and after he requested some space his girlfriend clung on even more and then 'snapped.' 'I was in bed, and despite begging you to let me sleep because I had work in the morning you would not stop shouting, moments later you had straddled me, your weight forced against my chest, the next thing I know you deliver three hard blows to my jaw,' he writes in the first person piece posted on tech news website TWnow.com. Way, a serial entrepreneur who started his first business aged 15, made $33 million by 17 and lost it all by 21 only to build his wealth again, intentionally doesn't reveal whether he's a man or a woman until half way down the article, so readers hear him out before offering judgement. 'You would later pretend they were slaps, but the blue bruises on my jaw in the morning told a different story,' Way continues. Couple: The British-born 33-year-old met his younger ex, shown with him above, after moving to the states . He writes that while his ex promised it'd never happen again, 'it did happen again and . again, life was never the same after that for me.' But the repeated abuse came to a head about a week ago, he says. Way had temporarily moved out of their home because he 'just could no longer live in a constantly aggressive environment' but had moved back in as his partner was staying with her mother. However, around 11:30p.m. one night, he says the woman stumbled back to the house allegedly drunk and screamed for him to let her in. 'My heart got the better of me and I opened the door,' Way writes in the piece. 'When you started to get aggressive I told you I wanted to leave.' Texts: Way shows some of the text messages between himself and his girlfriend, reffing to the alleged abuse . But he . says every time he would get to the door, she would scream 'help, help' so as to alert the neighbors, who he believes already thought he was an . abusive boyfriend. When things began turning violent, and it was clear her screaming . would bring the police, Way says he pulled out his iphone and started . video recording, 'so that whatever happened I knew at least somebody . would believe my story.' 'As you repeatedly tried to grab at my phone I recorded you beating, kicking me and ripping at my genitals, by the time I had managed to barricade myself in the bedroom the police finally arrived,' he writes. Beatings: In one exchange, she allegedly told him 'I should of slapped u harder...' 'At this point I could have easily had . you arrested, but given that I loved you so much I hid the bruises and . cuts across my body from the police and told them you were just shouting . at me.' According . to Way, the San Francisco police officers did believe his story, but . only escorted his girlfriend out of the house that night. Way . claims she remained outside the property for eight hours, beating on . the door, throwing rocks at the windows and trying to climb up the fire . escape. He says he eventually had to call one of his girlfriend's friends to come get her so he could leave his own house. Way told MailOnline that writing the article was 'tremendously difficult' but he wanted to go public to help other men trapped in similarly violent relationships who may be worried or embarrassed to speak out. He insists he's not a 'sissy,' he goes to the gym and could have really hurt his partner if he chose to react, like he believes many boyfriends would have done. But he didn't fight back. Serious: Way, pictured, claims he was punched in the jaw, bitten, scratched, stabbed in the foot with a stiletto and struck in the genitals during the alleged attacks . Not a sissy: Way, left, says he's not a sissy and could have really hurt his partner if he chose to react, like he believes many boyfriends would have done . 'She abused the fact I was a man. She knew that if she wanted to she could put me in prison,' he says. Way claims she also used his fear of being a foreigner against him. 'It's scary being an immigrant in the US, I've tried to avoid all issues with the police and she would use that against me constantly. She would say ""if you don't do as you say I'm going to call the police and tell them you beat me or raped me."" 'In the end, it took the police getting involved to realize how bad things had got.' More than 30 men have got in touch with Way since he shared his story, confessing to have experienced relationships where a woman used 'the perception of vulnerability to abuse and bully' them. Way says he's also been overwhelmed with support from friends and family since opening up and hopes that his experience will help society accept that the man is not always the abuser. He adds in the article: 'I'm a strong, successful man, I deal with bullies and super stressful situations everyday, I'm not whining because some girl slapped me or trying to get back at her for doing so. 'I just want society to realize that neither partner should be able to behave like this, somebody who you have let into your heart needs to behave in a responsible way with it regardless of sex.' Way also insists his former partner is not a bad person, signing off his account, 'For my ex girlfriend: I still love you, and I always will, maybe over time you will change enough for us to be back together, but for now please just learn from our experience together.'","Silicon Valley-based entrepreneur Ben Way describes the alleged domestic violence in an article posted on tech news website TWnow.com Tuesday .

Justice Minister Alan Shatter said that, following Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Ireland's anti-semitic Berlin ambassador Charles Bewley ensured 'the doors to this state were kept firmly closed to German Jewish families trying to flee'. The admission came as he apologised for the way brave soldiers who 'deserted' the Irish Army to fight with the Allies during the Second World War were treated. Denied: Jewish families, such as the ones pictured in this 1943 photo being rounded up in the Warsaw Ghetto, were denied entry to Ireland in the 1930s . Slammed: Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter (left) said the administration of Eamon de Valera (right) in the 1930s was 'morally bankrupt' He suggested the 4,983 servicemen, who were barred from jobs and State pensions on their return and condemned to poverty and stigma for the rest of their lives, were now likely to receive an official pardon. And he linked the two issues to the administration of the time, led by Eamon de Valera, which he said had 'utterly lost its moral compass' in moves that still affected perceptions of the Irish now. Mr Shatter, who is Jewish himself and MP for Dublin South, said the current regime was eager to make a complete break from the past. He added: 'We should no longer be in denial that, in the context of the Holocaust, Irish neutrality was a principle of moral bankruptcy.' Blocked: Twitter said the new tool is designed to comply with local laws, such as bans on pro-Nazi content in Germany . He said the 'shameful position' was further compounded by de Valera's visit to the German Ambassador in 1945 to express his condolences on the death of Hitler. He added: 'At a time when neutrality should have ceased to be an issue, the Government of this State utterly lost its moral compass.' A total of 90,000 Jewish refugees from across Europe were welcomed into Britain during the 1930s. Some 40,000 came from Austria and Nazi Germany, with the remainder coming from Italy, Poland, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The flow stopped in 1938, as the threat of war with Germany escalated. The exception was the Kindertransport (pictured above right) - an effort on the eve of conflict to transport Jewish children (their parents were not given visas) from Germany to Britain. Around 10,000 children were saved by the scheme. With the declaration of war, 74,000 German, Austrian and Italian citizens in the UK were interned as enemy aliens. After individual consideration by tribunal, the majority, largely made up of Jewish and other refugees, were released within six months. In a landmark speech before tomorrow's Holocaust Memorial Day, he said he believed the dishonourable discharge the soldiers received was wrong. He said: 'Many who fought in British uniforms during that war returned to Ireland. For too many years, their contribution in preserving European and Irish democracy was ignored. 'Some of those include members of our Defence Forces who left this island during  that time to fight for freedom and who were subsequently dishonourably discharged from the Defence Forces. 'It is untenable that we commemorate those who died whilst continuing to ignore the manner in which our State treated the living, in the period immediately after World War II, who returned to our State having fought for freedom and democracy.' He now awaits advice from Attorney General Máire Whelan about how to proceed. Of those who joined the war effort, there are estimated to be just 100 still alive. Families of the men have welcomed the news of the pardon, after years of campaigning. Paddy Reid, whose father Paddy and uncle Freddie left the Irish Army to fight with the British, said: 'I’m very happy to hear of the pardon. 'But there is also a deep sense of regret that it has taken so long for these men to be recognised for what they did.' Paddy Snr joined the Allied Forces in 1941, when he was 17, and fought against the Japanese in Burma. Flee: Jewish families were trying to escape Nazi Germany, where they faced eventual deportation to death camps such as Auschwitz in Poland . He died in 1988, aged 64.  He joined the . British forces to make money because he wanted to start a family, his . son said. However, he also felt he should stand up against the Nazis . after hearing about the bombing of Guernica in northern Spain. Born in 1882 in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother, Eamon de Valera (right) moved to Limerick, in Ireland, aged two. He was a leader in the 1916 Easter Rising which proclaimed an Irish republic. He was arrested but saved from a death sentence and sent to prison for two years instead because of his American birth. He was a leader of Ireland's struggle for independence from Britain in the Irish War of Independence and of the anti-Treaty forces in the ensuing Irish Civil War (1922–23). In 1926, he founded Fianna Fáil and was head of government from 1932 to 1948, 1951 to 1954 and 1957 to 1959 and President of Ireland from 1959 to 1973. Died in August 1975. When he came back to Dublin, he found himself blacklisted and was prevented from getting work from 1946 until 1961. 'It was very tough trying to support . eight children,' said Paddy Jnr. 'The stigma was very deep and a lot of . people who fought came back to real abuse. 'My father was a brave man and a good soldier. Those men fought for what they believed in – they don’t make them like that any more.' Dr Gerald Morgan, a lecturer in English at Trinity College Dublin and a campaigner for the deserters, said that the Irish Government was 'morally right' to pardon the men. He added: 'This puts into context the sacrifices these individuals made. 'They went off to fight, but paid a huge price.' Retired Major-General David O’Morchoe, who joined the British forces just after the war, also welcomed the decision. 'I think the men who left the Irish Army would have felt a moral obligation to be involved but there were other considerations including financial ones,' he said. 'Many Irish people supported the war effort not in uniform. 'But through working in the war industries in Britain at the time.' The campaign to pardon the soldiers was kick-started a year ago when Robert Widders, a former soldier from Liverpool, published the book Spitting on a Soldier's Grave.","Justice Minister Alan Shatter says 'doors to state were kept firmly closed to Jews fleeing Hitler' while UK took thousands .

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Five Eastern Europeans were in custody in Paris yesterday after a £1million jewellery raid by up to 15 men brandishing sledgehammers and axes. Police believe a Roma gipsy gang was behind the well-organised robbery at a Swiss luxury watchmaker’s store in the French capital. They said staff allowed two well-dressed men to enter the locked Vacheron Constantin store. The men then held open the doors to allow a crowd of hooded accomplices to get in as well. Heist: The Vacheron Constanin store, pictured, was raided by a 15-strong gang of axe-wielding men on Friday . Getaway: In this video still, a group of hooded men can be seen running across the street in central Paris . Raid: The gang had forced their way into the store and stole around 20 watches - worth about £1million . The gang smashed display cabinets at the store near Place Vendome and left with around 20 watches worth up to £1million. Meanwhile, accomplices outside used smoke grenades to create confusion during the raid, which happened around noon on Friday. A 24-year-old Romanian and a Moldovan, aged 17, were arrested shortly afterwards, while three more Eastern Europeans were held on Saturday. Robbery: Policemen cordon off a street near the Place Vendome following the midday raid . Arrest: Police today have said five men - all Eastern European - are in custody following the robbery . France has been hit by a number of . high-profile jewellery robberies this year, and gangs from Eastern Europe are . believed to be behind a majority of them. One, during the Cannes Film . Festival on the Riviera, saw robbers make off with a necklace . laced in diamonds and valued at £1.3 million. In August four men rammed a . 4x4 car into another shop close to Place Vendome. They made off with almost two million pounds worth of luxury watches. A French jeweler shot dead a teenage robber in . Nice, also on the Riviera, last month. Despite huge support for owner Stephan Turk, he faces murder charges for shooting the teen as he made off on a getaway scooter. None was carrying identity papers, but French police are working with police in Romania to try to identify them. Investigating . officer Francis Vincenti said the arrested men had fled the scene on . foot. He said the gang had used force of numbers to terrify staff. The watches have not been recovered.

"By . James Tozer for the Daily Mail . and Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Jonjo Highton, 18, described  as 'a good-looking boy who did not deserve this', is believed to have been set upon by a group of men outside his house . Three men have been charged with murder after a teenager was hacked to death by a  mob outside his home. Jonjo Highton died from neck wounds after he was attacked by a group of knife-wielding men in Preston, Lancashire on Saturday. The 18-year-old was attacked in similar fashion in June last year in a so-called 'punishment slashing' and needed major surgery to be able to walk again. Three suspects, Owen Whitesmith, 19, Arron Graham, 22, and Craig Walton, 26, all from Preston, will appear in court today charged over his killing. Five other men from Preston remain in police custody under arrest for suspicion of murder. Police are still looking to trace a vehicle that may be connected with the incident. Det Supt Eddie Thistlethwaite said: 'We are determined to thoroughly investigate the tragic and callous murder of Jonjo Highton. 'We continue to make good progress with this investigation, however we are still keen to trace people who may have been involved in the incident. 'I would encourage anyone with any information at all about the murder to contact the police before we visit you. 'I am continuing to appeal for information about the current whereabouts of a car which may have been involved in the crime, a blue Vauxhall Vectra, registration KG04 EJU.' Jonjo died after a gang of men turned up at his home in two cars at 11.20pm on Saturday. His death came a year after he was attacked while riding his bike. In that incident, a group of men pulled up in a car and knocked him to the ground, raining down brutal kicks and punches. That attack is thought to have stemmed from him becoming somehow caught up in a feud between rival gangs in Preston. Last November, Shaun Tyrer, then 33, and Dylan Cornwell, 17, both admitted wounding with intent against Jonjo. Tyrer was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years and Cornwell to seven-and-a-half years. A third man was cleared. Scroll down for video . Floral tributes and hand-written notes lie in the street where the 18-year-old was stabbed to death on Saturday . Jonjo, pictured as a child, left, is said to have been set upon by eight men -  friends left notes at the scene of his death yesterday . Jonjo declined to give evidence against his attackers at their trial. Jonjo's devastated family have been too upset to comment on his death but on Facebook Ashley Miller Hardman posted: 'Rest in paradise Jonjo my brother – gone but never forgotten. 'You will be missed by all of us. See you again one day. Love and miss you. Night and God bless.' Parts of Preston have suffered a spate of violent gang attacks in recent years with organised crime groups from nearby Manchester and Liverpool blamed for escalating turf wars over drug-dealing. Only this week, Lancashire Police launched a knife amnesty, revealing that the county had recorded 3,712 offences involving bladed weapons between April 2010 and March this year. Football fan: The teenager was pronounced dead at the scene soon after the attack at 11.20pm on Saturday . Amid fears of further knife attacks, Det Supt Thistlethwaite said: 'I would say to any young person involved in and around gangs who think it's clever that it's not clever. 'It represents a waste of young people's lives.' Drew Gale, a local councillor, said: 'Like any city, Preston has its fair share of gangs, but this terrible incident is particularly shocking as it is such a rare event. 'In the past, it has been mainly seen as a matter of unruly kids, but this appalling crime shows the importance of tackling the problem before it escalates into more violence. 'My heart goes out to the victim's family. This brutal attack has horrified the people of Preston.' A neighbour said: 'It's terrible to think that something like this could happen on your doorstep – I'm scared to go outside now.' Jonjo was set upon in a similar attack last June, when men attacked him with a machete in the street .

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Spargo For Mailonline . Prosecutors said Thursday they will not file charges against a Northern California mother accused of grabbing the throat of a 12-year-old boy she suspected of bullying her daughter. The Sonoma County District Attorney's Office said there were conflicting witness statements, and that prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Delia Garcia-Bratcher attacked the youngster earlier this year at the Olivet Charter Elementary School. No adult saw the confrontation at the time, and Miss Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not checked in with the school office before coming on campus, meaning no school officials were with her to witness what happened. Scroll down for video . Delia Garcia-Bratcher, joined by her fiance Shaka Hay, reacts outside of the Sonoma County Superior Court in Santa Rosa, Calif., after the charges she choked a young boy were dropped . A lawyer for Garcia-Bratcher called her a 'folk hero' and 'mother of the year' for defending her 10-year-old daughter from a boy who allegedly called her a 'dirty Indian' Regardless, Miss Garcia-Bratcher, 30, was arrested on suspicion of child abuse in the aftermath of the May 16 confrontation at the Santa Rosa elementary school. Most of the eyewitnesses interviewed by prosecutors were children, according to Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Bill Brockley. Two of these children claimed to have seen Miss Garcia-Bratcher grab the young boy by the throat, authorities said at the time. However, there was no consensus about whether Miss Garcia-Bratcher did indeed touch the boy. 'Ethically, I can only file charges that I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury,' Mr. Brockley said. 'If I don't have that evidence, then I can't file charges.' Sheriff's officials also said they could not find any evidence linking the boy to the bullying allegations, and that Miss Garcia-Bratcher might have targeted the wrong person. Miss Garcia-Bratcher acknowledged confronting the boy but said she did not touch him. In a seven-page report, an investigator hired by her attorney, Ben Adams, quoted a 10-year-old saying he saw the boy put both hands around his own neck after the encounter with Miss Garcia-Bratcher. Mr. Adams said Thursday his client was glad to have the case behind her. 'They arrested her for no reason and dragged her to court for no reason,' he said. The Olivet Charter Elementary School in Santa Rosa, where Miss Garcia-Bratcher confronted the young boy who was bullying her daughter . The incident occurred after Miss Garcia-Bratcher went to the school to discuss her children's registration. When she ran into her son in the hallway, she asked him to point out the boy who has been calling her 10-year-old daughter a 'dirty Indian.' The boy said Miss Garcia-Bratcher yelled at him and grabbed him by the throat. Administrators called police after they noticed red marks on the boy's neck. Miss Garcia-Bratcher was arrested the next day and released several hours later after posting $30,000 bail. Following the incident, her lawyer called her a hero. ‘She is the mother of the year,’ Mr. Adams declared. ‘She did nothing wrong. Her daughter was being bullied, and she confronted the bully. What is wrong with that?’ The case, at the time, sparked much debate on social media over how best to respond to bullying at schools.","Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, came to Olivet Charter Elementary School in May and confronted a boy she suspected of bullying her daughter .

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Spargo for MailOnline . USC football star Josh Shaw has been suspended from college play indefinitely after admitting to school officials he fabricated a story about spraining both ankles while saving his nephew from drowning. The newly-appointed captain of the Trojans football team said he had seen the seven-year-old struggling in a swimming pool at a family party in Palmdale, California on Saturday night, so he jumped from a second-story balcony to save him from drowning. The claims gained national attention on Monday, but the next day USC Coach Steve Sarkisian announced the school was investigating Shaw’s account after it received phone calls contradicting the story. Scroll down for video . USC football star Josh Shaw has admitted he fabricated a story about spraining both his ankles while jumping off a balcony to save his nephew from drowning . Now, Shaw is acknowledging he fabricated the drowning incident. He will not say how he was injured, but he did issue a brief statement this afternoon, shortly after his suspension was announced, through criminal defense attorney Donald Etra. 'On Saturday, August 23, 2014, I injured myself in a fall. I made up a story about this fall that was untrue. I was wrong to not tell the truth. I apologize to USC for this action on my part,' said the cornerback. 'My USC coaches, the USC Athletic Department, and especially Coach Sarkisian have all been supportive of me during my college career and for that, I am very grateful.' 'We are extremely disappointed in Josh,' Sarkisian said in a statement. 'He let us all down. As I have said, nothing in his background led us to doubt him when he told us of his injuries, nor did anything after our initial vetting of his story.' He later added, 'I believe Josh will learn from this. I hope that he will not be defined by this incident, and that the Trojan Family will accept his apology and support him.' Shaw in action against Notre Dame. He started all 13 games for the USC Trojans last season. The Los Angeles Police Department revealed earlier this evening that Shaw’s name had been included in a report from an incident that occurred  Saturday night, where authorities responded to a woman screaming in a downtown apartment complex. Officers interviewed several people at the building, and a woman told the police that someone had pried open a window, entered the third-floor apartment and fled, but nothing was taken. The woman also acknowledged 'a relationship' with Shaw, according to LAPD Lt. Andy Nieman. Shaw, who is from Palmdale, played at Florida as a freshman before transferring to USC in 2012. He started all 13 games for the Trojans last season. The Trojans, whose preseason rank is No. 15, open their season against Fresno State on Saturday. Sarkisian said the Shaw situation will not be a distraction for the team this weekend.","Josh Shaw claimed he sprained both ankles when he jumped off a balcony to save his nephew from drowning in a pool at a family party .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Russia has responded to a sarcastic tweet by Canadian NATO officials that mocked their excuse that troops had mistakenly wandered into Ukraine with its own map of the area. The Twitter account Russians at NATO posted the map, which shows the Crimea region that was annexed by Russia in March, as part of Russian territory. It comes with an explanation they are helping Canadian colleagues 'catch up with the contemporary geography of Europe'. Scroll down for video . Russia has responded to Canada's mocking tweet by posing their own map of the area, showing the annexed Crimea region as part of Russia territory . Canadian officials at NATO had posted this sarcastic tweet with a map showing that Ukraine was 'NOT RUSSIA' and that Russia was 'RUSSIA' in response to claims that Russian soldiers found themselves in Ukraine by mistake . The social media spat began on Wednesday when the official NATO account of Canada tweeted a colour-coded map, marked in block letters to clearly show that Ukraine was 'NOT RUSSIA' and that Russia was indeed 'RUSSIA'. It was accompanied by the explanation: 'Geography can be tough. Here's a guide for Russian soldiers who keep getting lost and 'accidentally' enter Ukraine.' The tweet went viral, being retweeted more than 31,000 times, including by U.S. U.N. ambassador Samantha Power. But now Russia has struck back by tweeting its own map of the country, showing Crimea, which was annexed from Ukraine in March, as part of its own territory. It was also followed up with the caption: 'Helping our Canadian colleagues to catch up with contemporary geography of #Europe @CanadaNATO' Their tweet, posted yesterday has so far attracted just over 800 retweets. The map also shows shaded areas where Abkhazia and South Ossetia are located, which have declared their independence from Georgia but still contain Russian forces after a conflict in 2008. They also posted: 'BTW why not share Canadian experience of ""asymmetrical federalism"" with #Kiev's authorities @CanadaNATO' Canada's tweet on Wednesday came after 10 Russian soldiers were captured earlier this week in Ukraine, with Moscow insisting they had mistakenly wandered across the border. Prisoners: These pictures show two of the ten Russian paratroopers who claimed they entered Ukraine by accident because the border was poorly marked, a version which is being mocked by Canadian NATO officials . Meanwhile Kiev has accused Russia of sending tanks, artillery and troops into Ukraine. Rick Roth, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said: 'It's important to look at this exchange through the current context. 'The original tweet was in the context of Russian military personnel being found in sovereign Ukrainian territory, claiming they were lost. Nobody believes that.' Mr Baird had called the recent events a 'significant provocation' in advance of next week's NATO summit in Wales, where the alliance's leaders are expected to hold a special meeting with new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. However, Ukraine is not a member of NATO, so the alliance is not automatically obliged to come to its defence. Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko (left) is expected to hold a special meeting with leaders at a NATO summit in Wales next week. However, President Barack Obama (right) has ruled out the possibility of military action by the U.S. President Barack Obama has also ruled out the possibility that the U.S. will take military action over Ukraine and declined to characterise the assault as an invasion. Meanwhile Dutch Brigadier General Nico Tak said there has been a significant escalation in both the level and sophistication of Russia's military interference in Ukraine. 'We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including air defence systems, artillery, tanks, and armored personnel carriers being transferred to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine,' said Mr Tak. NATO estimates that as many as 1,000 Russian troops are fighting inside Ukraine with an additional 20,000 soldiers massing on the border for support or possible reinforcements.","Russia tweets their own map in response to a mocking Canadian post .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Football could become a much more literal term if a group of U.S. soccer moms have their way. A lawsuit filed against Fifa by the group argues the governing body hasn't done enough to protect players from the medical risks of heading the ball. The group behind the lawsuit are parents of young players, who claim their children are at risk of long term injury due to repeated heading of the ball and concussion. The lawsuit wants Fifa to enact new laws which include temporary subs when a player suffers a head injury . The lawsuit argues for changes in the Laws of the Game - the sport's governing rules - that include limiting the number of headers for players under 17 and including temporary substitutions when a player suffers a head injury. Cited in the lawsuit as an example is the injury suffered by German midfielder Christoph Kramer, who continued playing for 14 minutes in the World Cup final after suffering a nasty collision. He later admitted he could not remember the entire first half of the game. The lawsuit accuses Fifa of being 'careless and negligent' in its duty to provide players with proper protection from concussion. It states: 'There is an epidemic of concussion injuries in soccer at all levels around the world, including in the United States, from youth to professionals, from elite players to children playing for the first time, women and men, girls and boys. The lawsuit cites the example of Christoph Kramer in the World Cup final. The Germany midfielder played on for 14 minutes after a collision before he collapsed and was substituted . 'Fifa presides over this epidemic, and is one of its primary causes.' Earlier this month Dr Michael Grey, a motor neuro-science expert at the University of Birmingham, called for children to be completed banned from heading the ball. The expert said the impact of the brain against the skull causes damage and children’s neck muscles are not developed enough to handle the shock of impact. Former Irish international Kevin Kilbane told the Daily Telegraph: 'Football is a contact sport and you are putting your body on the line, so of course there are risks. 'I'm not sure exactly how they would count the number of headers anyway.'","Lawsuit filed against Fifa states it has been negligent in protecting players .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . A mysterious aquatic creature has washed up on the shore at Mudjimba Beach on the Sunshine Coast. The creature was discovered on the sand on Monday morning by Debbie Higgs, a local who walks on the beach every day. The unidentified creature is bright red, has ribbing, no limbs, eyes of mouth and has what looks like frills around it. Scroll down for video . An unidentified red creature has washed up on the shore of Mudjimba Beach on the Sunshine Coast . 'It's definitely not a plant, it feels spongy like a jelly fish,' Ms Higgs told Daily Mail Australia, 'it's cold and rather smelly.' 'I had no idea what it was so I took a picture of it and tweeted it,' she said 'I had so many retweets and responses from people speculating what it was.' After discovering the 'blob' Ms Higgs photographed it and left it on the beach, but after she got so many tweets she went back for it. 'It is about 25 cm long, so about the length of my arm. I had a tea towel in the car so I picked it up and took it home and put it in a bucket of salty water.' The 'blob' appears to have no face or limbs.  Ms Higgs who came across the creature on a walk on the beach says that it feels soft and spongy and smells bad . The slimy red creature has caused speculation on Twitter about what it actually is.  Many have said it appears to be a Spanish Dancer slug . She was determined to find out what it was so she continued posting images of the mysterious sea creature on social media. 'I've never seen anything like it and I'm on that beach every day. People were saying on Twitter that it might be a Spanish Dancer Slug,' Ms Higgs said. Spanish Dancer slugs are most common in the warmer tropical waters of the Indian Ocean. Ms Higgs came across a strange red creature on a beach on  the Sunshine Coast of Australia then tweeted this photo asking people if they knew what it was . Ms Higgs' Twitter feed has been inundated with suggestions about what the bright red creature is. Some have retweeted and tagged experts while others have taken the comedic route of saying it is 'The red Teletubby' or 'whale placenta' and one person even made a cheeky comparison to Prime Minister Abbott in budgie smugglers. Twitter users have a laugh suggesting the creature looks like the red Teletubby or a liver . A spokeswoman for Queensland Museum told Sunshine Coast Daily, it was difficult to tell without examining it closely however they felt it was a sea slug. 'I'm not sure what to do with it now, I took it home in case it was something extremely rare or something. I'll probably hand it over to the aquarium if it is, otherwise I'll just take it back to the beach.' The CSIRO has been contacted and is yet to identify the mysterious creature.","Mysterious 'blob' has washed up on Mudjimba Beach on Sunshine Coast .

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . CLICK HERE to follow Sportsmail's LIVE coverage of the transfer deadline day . Gus Poyet is a relieved man after landing two fellow South Americans having earlier warned that failure to sign his targets would be ‘very dangerous’. The Black Cats completed season-long loan deals for Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates and Inter Milan winger Ricky Alvarez on Monday – but there was also disappointment after missing out on Fabio Borini. Poyet – whose side only escaped relegation last season thanks to four wins from their final five matches – had feared another campaign of struggle at the wrong end of the Premier League. Done deal: Sunderland brought in defender Sebastian Coates on loan from Liverpool . Danger averted: Gus Poyet has admitted the Black Cats could have struggled without new signings . Indeed, he said at the weekend: ‘If we don’t get the players in, we’ve got a problem. It would be dangerous, very dangerous.’ Poyet has been a long-time admirer of Uruguayan compatriot Coates and he made it clear to the club’s hierarchy that he wanted the 23-year-old. The centre-back – who managed only 12 league appearances in three years at Anfield – is expected to form a partnership with skipper John O’Shea. Wing man: The Black Cats also signed Inter Milan forward Ricky Alvarez (L) on deadline day . Alvarez, meanwhile, represents something of a coup for the Wearside club. The 26-year-old was part of Argentina’s World Cup squad and has been capped on seven occasions. He appeared 90 times for Inter following a £10m move from Velez Sarsfield in 2010, and Sportsmail understands a similar fee has been agreed to make his move permanent should he impress for Sunderland this season. But Borini’s rejection is also a source of regret for Poyet. He had waited all summer for an answer from the Liverpool frontman over a return to the club, where he spent last season on loan. The Italian, though, was never keen on re-signing and Sunderland have not added a striker to their ranks as the manager had hoped. Borini remained at Anfield after a move to QPR fell though over wage demands. The one that got away: Sunderland failed in their protracted attempt to bring back Fabio Borini . Two players did leave the club, however, defender Valentin Roberge joining Stade de Reims on loan for the remainder of the season, while Modibo Diakite had his contract terminated by mutual consent.

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . As Australian house prices continue to rise, it's becoming increasingly hard to find an affordable home close to capital cities and business hubs. But Daily Mail Australia has found ten properties around Australia which are under $100,000. And some are only 25 minutes from a capital city. Others feature pools and even water views. The property finds come as a  new report released by RP Data this week has found houses selling for less than $400,000 across the capital cities are falling fast. Less than 28 percent of properties in Australia are listed as selling at $400,000 in capital cities, while over 60 percent of regional properties can still be found at that price. The RP Data report found the combined Australian capital median house price is $550,00, while the media unit price is $475,000. 'A rise in capital city home values of 10.1 per cent over the 12 months to June 2014 indicates the difficulty being experienced by price-sensitive purchasers looking to enter the housing market,' RP Data's Cameron Kusher said. 'This is most felt in Sydney and Melbourne where home values have increased by 15.4 percent and 9.4 per cent respectively over the year to June.' Scroll down for video . This apartment in Hope Island, Queensland overlooks the Gold Coast's Coomera River . This unit on the beach in Pottsville, far-north NSW could be snapped up for $99,500 . The report also revealed that although properties in regional areas are definitely more affordable, job and employment prospects are substantially lower in these regions. But the Daily Mail Australia has put together a list of ten suburbs and towns around the country where you can buy property for less than $100,000 _ without moving more than two hours away from a capital city. This was despite being told repeatedly by estate agents it was impossible to buy for under $100,000. While some of the houses, units or apartments may need a little work, by moving a little further out, the extra hour commute to work might just be worth it for the low price you'll pay for these homes.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Jo-Wilfried Tsonga does not feel Andy Murray is the player he was and claims locker-room rivals are less fearful about facing the Scot. Their fourth-round clash at the US Open tomorrow should provide a real measure of where Murray's form is after an up-and-down first three rounds. The Scot has not faced anyone inside the top 70, yet has already dropped sets to Robin Haase and Andrey Kuznetsov, either side of a good performance against Matthias Bachinger in round two. Beatable: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga fancies his chances when he takes on Andy Murray in the fourth round . Brute force: The Frenchman celebrates beating Pablo Carreno Busta in round three . The good news for Murray is he will surely be back on Arthur Ashe, a court he loves, for the Tsonga match and away from his nemesis, Louis Armstrong Stadium. Should Murray win, it would be his first victory over a top-10 player since lifting the Wimbledon title last year. Tsonga said: ""The locker room is maybe a bit less afraid of Andy because he's losing a few more matches than in the past. But I don't know any player who once on court is going to be super confident against Andy. ""He's different than in the past maybe because I feel he's not serving as strong as he used to, nor maybe hitting as strong as he used to. ""And during matches he's showing more when he seems in pain with his back or hip region, I'm not sure. You can see it on some moves, too."" Murray declared himself in the best shape since before his back surgery almost a year ago when he arrived in New York, and maintained that is the case despite his cramp issues in round one. He is no longer in pain from his back but has struggled to maintain his intensity through matches and has developed a bad habit of allowing leads to slip away. He was pegged back by Kuznetsov after looking in complete control at a set and a break up, and went on to drop the third set, but Murray was happy with the way he handled the lows. Frustrated: It's been far from plain sailing for Murray as he's struggled through to the fourth round . Support: The Scot's loyal fans have stuck by him at Flushing Meadows . Determined: Tsonga has been knocked out in all three previous grand slams in 2014 . Pen to paper: Tsonga signs autographs for excited fans after seeing off Busta . ""Each time I had a slip, I did a decent job of getting myself back into the sets, getting a break straight away,"" Murray said. ""Even when I got broken at the end of the match, I broke the next game. When I was down 4-1 in the third set, I got myself back into the set. ""That's really what you need to do. You need to give yourself opportunities in every set and in matches. Then it will start to become natural again."" Murray was unable to turn things back his way the last time he met Tsonga, in Toronto earlier this month, when from 3-0 up in the deciding set he allowed the match to slip away. It was Murray's first loss to Tsonga in a competitive match since the Australian Open in 2008 and he retains a dominant 9-2 lead in their head to head. ""I played a good match,"" said eighth seed Murray, looking back to the Toronto match. ""I was up a break in the third set and didn't manage to close it out. So obviously if I get myself in that position again, hopefully I'll do a better job of that. But I don't need to change too much. ""It will be a tough match. We've played each other a lot of times. He's obviously playing well right now. He had a great week in Canada. He's played some good tennis so far here. ""I've had a lot of close matches with him but I've won a lot against him, as well. I would say (my game) matches up well."" Tsonga had been having a poor season until Toronto, where he beat Novak Djokovic, Murray, Grigor Dimitrov and Roger Federer back to back to lift the second Masters title of his career and climb back into the top 10. Determined: Murray has only lost twice to Tsonga in 11 ATP tour matches with Tsonga . Girlfriend: Murray's partner Kim Sears has been at the US Open offering the Scot support . The 29-year-old is not reading too much into his win over Murray and admits the best-of-five-set format in slams does not suit him as well as best of three. ""Andy is someone I know very well, against whom I don't have a good record,"" said Tsonga. ""But I'm feeling good. I expect to play a good match. Playing three sets, it's always more physical. I like when it's in three sets. ""(Toronto) is positive because it means that I'm able to play well against him. I hope I will do that again. ""One shouldn't overestimate this win, he still leads our head to head and now he'll be aware of the danger and maybe it plays against me.

"By . Mike Dickson for The Mail on Sunday . It looked like spring had come early for British tennis in mid-February, the spirits buoyed above all by an away Davis Cup victory over the USA which put GB in the World Group quarter final for the first time in 28 years. Andy Murray looking on the mend following back surgery, Heather Watson returning, Dan Evans seemingly poised for the top 100, a new man at the helm of the Lawn Tennis Association – revival was in the air. Yet this US Open has been a reminder that tennis in Wimbledon’s host nation rarely takes two steps forward without taking at least one and a half back. Murray has reached the last 16, but there were no qualifiers, the country’s two female entrants failed to win a set while Laura Robson – unbeknown in February - is likely to miss the rest of the season as she works her way back from wrist surgery. Better times: Andy Murray (left) congratulates James Ward on his Davis Cup victory in San Diego in February . Disappointment: Heather Watson was knocked out in the first round of the US Open at Flushing Meadows . The men’s doubles players, a source of low-key success for the past few years, failed to win a match between them. With poignant timing it emerged that Oliver Golding, junior winner at Flushing Meadows just three years ago, is considering his future in the game. Now there are big changes afoot at the LTA, going well beyond the recently-announced shift of emphasis to the National Tennis Centre at Roehampton, which will become more a junior training base and less of a centre for elite training squads. According to one insider at the governing body, ‘everything is up in the air’, with coaches being warned that they need to have a ‘Plan B’ in case they are released. Some staff are being told to reapply for their jobs while others are being made redundant. Employees in the regions are fearful too, as the axe is set to be wielded on many of the 19 ‘High Performance Centres’ which for so long have failed to live up to their titles. Morale is said to have reached a new low. Uncertain: Oliver Golding, the 2011 US Open junior champion, is considering his future in the sport . Canadian Michael Downey is now, in earnest, starting the changes he promised since taking over from Roger Draper, who grew the organisation to more than 300 employees but with little to show for it in terms of participation or elite performance. Draper got many things wrong, although it has been incorrectly reported that he is to blame for the £40 million blown on building Roehampton, which he had the foresight to oppose. He also spotted the potential in Leon Smith as Davis Cup Captain, but Downey is now trying to reverse many of his more damaging strategies, aided by veteran Australian coaching guru Bob Brett, who has been brought in as Player Development Director. Downey and Brett worked together when the former ran Tennis Canada and are both proper grown-ups at 57 and 61. Although they have affable exteriors they have already shown a ruthlessness that, while inevitably painful for some, is probably necessary to try and turn around a sport that has been underachieving for decades, despite the odd spell of optimism such as last February. Brett, with a huge list of individual coaching credits to his name such as Boris Becker, is a formidable taskmaster and will demand the highest standards. In charge: Canadian Michael Downey took over from Roger Draper as LTA chief executive in January . It will be fascinating to see how he views players like Evans, who has genuine talent but struggles to come to terms with the demands of the modern game. Evans, who will be back down below 250 after losing in qualifying here, has gone in and out of the LTA giant tent over the years and is a reluctant traveller. There has been a desperation to provide assistance to help keep players like him going, because the alternatives are so sparse and, in his case, he has also put in some fine performances for the Davis Cup team. The fact is that come a week on Monday the only British male within a country mile of Murray will be James Ward, who has had a good season to get within sight of the top 100, and more definitive decisions may be taken on whether to maintain support for other players. On a similar theme Brett also has to weigh up the policy on wildcards at British tournaments, which for so many years have been distributed with little coherent strategy. The effect has sometimes been to temporarily inflate home players’ rankings, but some international research suggests they are counterproductive in the long run. Drop: Dan Evans' loss in US Open qualifying means that he will now be ranked below the 250 mark . Arguably more worrying is the lack of obvious male prospects in the GB junior ranks, which is highlighted again in this week’s event for under-18s at the US Open. Talent identification systems are another area rightly under examination. The in-trays of Downey and Brett overflow, with some of their remedies for the long-term malaise expected to be more solidly outlined in the next two months. Another development to look out for is the possible switch to British nationality of Aljaz Bedene, the longtime Hertfordshire-based Slovenian ranked 133. But it is only more success with the home-grown players that can prevent another US Open like this one.","There were no British qualifiers at the US Open this year .

"By . David Clough, Press Association . Alastair Cook numbers Graeme Swann as only a 'so-called friend' after his former team-mate's assertion that England would be better off without his captaincy at the World Cup. Cook's team put in a wretched performance with ball and then bat on the way to a 133-run Royal London Series defeat against India in Cardiff - after which he was at a loss to explain why they were 'not at the races'. There was little to cheer on the field as Suresh Raina hit a brilliant 74-ball hundred in India's 304 for six and then England were bowled out for 161 in pursuit of a revised target of 295. VIDEO Scroll down for Alastair Cook blasts so-called friend Graeme Swann . Jibe: Alastair Cook (above) as labelled Graeme Swann as only a 'so-called friend' Opinion: Swann (right) claimed that England would be better off without his captaincy at the World Cup . But if anything, Cook appeared even less pleased by ex-England off-spinner Swann's remarks from the sidelines in his role as a pundit, that for his own sake and his team's he should give one-day internationals a miss for the remainder of his career. 'I don't think it's that helpful - especially from a so-called friend,' said Cook, who spent much of the summer resisting similar calls to step aside from the Test captaincy - before making many eat their words as England fought back to beat India 3-1. Swann is adamant Cook's ODI strike rate does not set the tone that will make England competitive in next year's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia. Knock: Cook plays a shot during the second One Day International between England and India . VIDEO Alastair Cook targets fight back after Cardiff defeat . 'He's entitled to his opinion,' added Cook. '(But) it's not ideal for me, especially when you get through the summer I've had.' He has not contacted Swann - but has left open the possibility that a call could come in the opposite direction. 'The phone is always open the other way,' said Cook, before repeating he will not be deflected from his intention to lead England down under next winter. I am a little bit (disappointed) - because he is a good friend of mine, and has been a supporter. 'It's not helpful at this time, because I am going to be captain in this World Cup. I've done it for three-and-a-half years. We're going to build up to that, and we've got a good chance.' Cook acknowledges, however, much better will be required if England are to beat the best. Jubilant: India fielders MS Dhoni (right) and Suresh Raina celebrate after dismissing Jos Buttler . 'Obviously, if we play like that we're not going to win many games of cricket. But the talent in the changing room is there. We've got a lot of improvement to do. 'It's frustrating. We weren't quite at the races today, and I don't quite know why.' England began well with the ball, reducing India to 19 for two, and then with the bat as Cook and debutant Alex Hales put on a half-century opening stand. But precious little else went right. 'You could look at some good spots, I suppose,' said Cook. 'I thought Chris Woakes bowled nicely up front, and came back pretty strong when the carnage was happening. Ton: India's Raina celebrates getting 100 runs against England as he inspired his side to victory . 'Obviously, it wasn't a 300 wicket - and it wasn't a 160 wicket. 'But it's one game, isn't it? It's one day of cricket. 'When you don't get it right - like we haven't today - it's not the end of the world at all.' England are 1-0 down, as they were after two Tests, and as then too they still have three to play. Their next opportunity will come at Trent Bridge on Saturday. 'You don't win every game of cricket you play - and you certainly don't win many when you play like that,' added their captain. 'The lads in the changing room will know that. They don't need me to tell them. Jubilation: The India team celebrate after beating England by 133 run on Wednesday . 'So, it's dust ourselves off and try to come back and play better next time.' For Cook's opposite number Mahendra Singh Dhoni, there is a contrasting mission - to try to stay in front this time. Dhoni shared a stand of 144 with Raina, and was one of two batsmen apart from the centurion to pass 50. It was Raina's hundred that changed the game, and Dhoni said: 'It was a fantastic knock. 'It was important he stayed there, because he was one batsman who was set. 'We realised that if we could get a partnership going, if we had wickets in hand, we could make a lot of runs in the last 10-12 overs. 'So his innings was very crucial.'","Alastair Cook labels former team-mate Graeme Swann as a 'so-called friend'

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . The forensic dissecting of England’s World Cup hopes by Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan looked anything but harsh on Wednesday as Alastair Cook’s ‘retro’ side were comprehensively dismantled by the defending champions. India, such a rabble in the last three Tests, came alive once the red ball was swapped for two white ones and provided a lesson to England on how to play modern 50-over cricket in conditions that should have suited the hosts perfectly. It was Swann who said during Monday’s washed-out game at Bristol that England ‘haven’t got a cat in hell’s chance’ of winning their first World Cup next year and, on this evidence, he was being kind to them.

Mistake: England's Alex Hales skies a delivery from India's Ravindra Jadeja before being caught out . VIDEO Alastair Cook targets fight back after Cardiff defeat . But they were comments that angered his close friend and recent captain Cook, who Swann feels should no longer be one-day leader. ‘It wasn’t that helpful, especially from a so-called friend and after the summer I’ve had,’ said Cook after England’s thumping 133-run Duckworth-Lewis defeat at the Swalec Stadium. ‘Yes I am disappointed because he is a good friend of mine and has been a supporter. But it is what it is. I am going to be captain in this World Cup and we have a good chance but if we play like that we’re not going to win many games.’ Everything was in England’s favour when Cook won the toss and Chris Woakes took two wickets in an over to leave India on 19 for two in what was effectively the first one-day international of a four-match Royal London series. Yet, under grey Cardiff skies and with the ball nipping around, the back-up seam bowlers blew their big chance to maintain the pressure on India and silence the old players who believe England are stuck in the one-day dark ages. Knock: Debutant Hales and captain Alastair Cook (right) raised hopes in a solid opening stand of 54 . Slip and slide: Eoin Morgan survives a run out attempt before eventually being caught for 28 . Chris Jordan, in particular, had a nightmare, bowling 12 wides in 10 expensive, wicketless overs and later departing second ball as England capitulated to a miserable 161 in reply to India’s formidable 304 for six. Those Indian riches owed much to a 74-ball century from Suresh Raina, not good enough for Test cricket but a formidable proposition in the shorter game, but also to old-fashioned application that is meant to be England’s preserve. Firstly Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane rebuilt India’s innings as Jordan and Ben Stokes, preferred to Steven Finn and Harry Gurney, bowled woefully and then Raina ran wild in company with his rejuvenated captain MS Dhoni. Dhoni looked uninterested and tired as England ultimately thrashed India in the Test series but here he was bristling and imaginative, a perfect summation of the modern priorities of the most powerful nation in cricket. As, too, was the presence in Wales of a large number of Indian supporters, as many as 40 per cent of the 14,000 crowd, who were conspicuous by their absence during the five Tests, a worry for the health of the ultimate game. England, in contrast, have always paid lip service to limited-overs cricket but have perennially struggled to find a winning formula and look as far away as ever as they embark on their extensive six-month one-day World Cup build-up. Ton: India's Raina celebrates getting 100 runs against England as he inspired his side to victory . Head down: Alex Hales walks off back to the pavillion after being dismissed in Cardiff . One of their enduring problems is a lack of penetration in the middle overs and that was exposed here as Raina and Dhoni added 144 off just 16.5 overs to change the complexion of what looked likely to be a low-scoring game. There was one huge slice of luck for India when Raina should have been given out lbw sweeping James Tredwell on 17 but, after that carnage ensued, with only Woakes and Tredwell able to limit the damage on England. Much of the criticism from Swann and Vaughan centred on a perceived lack of power in the England line-up and certainly there was considerable expectations on the shoulders of Alex Hales on his 50-over debut. Yet Hales acquitted himself well and showed he has a solid technique as well as power in top scoring with 40 but becoming bogged down while everyone around him floundered on a pitch that had been spiced up by showers. Out: India's Virat Kohli (left) congratulates team-mate Ravindra Jadeja after the dismissal of Hales . I'll take that: Hales (left) hits the ball back to India's Mohammed Shami during the second ODI in Cardiff . Cook could at least point to an unlucky dismissal as the ball from Mohammad Shami that trapped him lbw was shown to have pitched fractionally outside leg-stump but there was little to excuse the bulk of his under-performing side. The England captain had added 54 with Hales but after he fell his ship quickly sank, all 10 England wickets falling for 107 in just 28.1 overs. A thrashing by any standards. ‘We weren’t at the races and I don’t know why,’ added Cook. ‘It’s frustrating but it’s one game and we will now dust ourselves off and try to play better next time. We’ve got a lot of improving to do.’ When England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Durham earlier this season they immediately came back with a convincing victory at Old Trafford. Time will tell whether they can do the same against India at Trent Bridge on Saturday.

"By . Pa Reporter . Welsh rugby has finally agreed a peace deal with 10 players receiving dual contracts in a six-year £60million-plus agreement. The new Rugby Services Agreement, which runs through until 2020, ends months of painstaking negotiations between the Welsh Rugby Union and the four regions over the future of the professional game in Wales. Among the key points is the provision of national dual contracts for the first time to try and keep key players in Wales. Contract: Wales captain Sam Warburton has been unable to play for his club after signing a central contract . The 10 dual contracted players will include Wales captain Sam Warburton, who signed a central contract earlier this year but has been unable to play for Cardiff Blues during the pre-season period, and his fellow British and Irish Lions Alun-Wyn Jones, Taulupe Faletau and Gethin Jenkins. Dual contracts are understood to involve a 60-40 WRU-region split. The RSA delivers £8.7m a year to the regions for Welsh qualified players and the WRU has allocated £2m of that to be spent on national dual contracts with an additional £1.3m coming from the regions. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: 'This new agreement creates a new and positive relationship within Welsh rugby and is firmly based on the rugby priorities for Wales. 'The national dual contracts represent a radical step forward in our mutual aim of retaining Welsh talent here in Wales. Deal: It is believed that the dual contracts will involve a 60-40 WRU-region split . 'The new contracts will help us keep more of our best players in Wales and will help stem the flow abroad of the talent we develop here through our academies and regions. 'We now have an agreement which will ensure the pyramid structure which leads from the grassroots right through to the international team is strong and truly fit for purpose.' Chairman of Regional Rugby Wales Nigel Short said: 'Following long and detailed negotiations, RRW is satisfied that the new agreement with the WRU creates a fair, progressive and credible foundation to protect and support the best interests of Welsh Rugby into the future; with the core objective of delivering a sustainable and competitive professional game in Wales. 'With greater clarity and the security of a new agreement, the regions can forward plan with more focus, working hard to ensure their independent businesses remain competitive. Deal: As well as Warburton, Alun-Wyn Jones, Taulupe Faletau and Gethin Jenkins are now on dual contracts . 'Things will not change overnight - but securing our new agreement in partnership is a positive forward step.' Under the new deal players offered national dual contracts will be chosen by Wales coach Warren Gatland and become WRU employees. Wales will also introduce a new senior policy which declares that players based outside the country will not be eligible for selection subject to a number of exceptions made by the national head coach. The new RSA also limits the number of foreign players in regional squads to a maximum of six while each region will be allowed two so-called time serving players who will be available for Welsh selection after three years residency.","Welsh Rugby Union and four regions reach peace deal .

"By . Chris Spargo For Mailonline . At least four American hostages being held in Syria by ISIS were waterboarded during their captivity claims a new report. James Foley, Steven J. Sotloff, and two other captives were subjected to the brutal practice according to people familiar with their treatment. The source added that ISIS militants appear to have modeled the technique on the 'CIA’s use of waterboarding during interrogations following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.' Scroll down for video . James Foley (pictured left) and Steven J. Sotloff (pictured right) were both waterboarded by ISIS during their time in captivity claims a new report . A source says ISIS militants are modeling their use of waterboarding on the technique the CIA used for coercive interrogation following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 . 'They knew exactly how it was done,' said a person with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity. Waterboarding is a form of torture in which an individual is strapped down while water is poured over a cloth covering their face, making the victim feel as if they are drowning. President Obama has condemned the practice, and a 2008 op-ed written by Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island criticized this form of coercive interrogation out of fear that militant groups and dictators might attempt to waterboard American captives. 'Waterboarding dates to the Spanish Inquisition and has been a favorite of dictators through the ages, including Pol Pot and the regime in Burma,' the two wrote while supporting an anti-torture bill. 'Condoning torture opens the door for our enemies to do the same to captured American troops in the future.' Foley, who was abducted on November 22, 2012, was beheaded last week in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. The group is now threatening to execute Sotloff, 31,  as well. His mother, Shirley Sotloff, released a video pleading with her son's captors to let him go on Wednesday. 'I am sending this message to you, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Quraishi al-Hussaini, the caliph of the Islamic State. I am Shirley Sotloff. My son Steven is in your hands,' she says in her message. 'You, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you please to release my child. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.' She then adds at the end of her video, 'Steven has no control over the actions of the U.S. government. He is an innocent journalist.' Last week, Didier Francois, a French journalist who was held captive with Foley for eight months in Syria following his June 2013 kidnapping, said members of ISIS singled Foley out for beatings and mock executions after learning that his brother worked for the US Air Force. In one mock execution, Foley, who Francois calls an 'extraordinary guy,' was crucified against a wall. Francois had never shared any of this information as he was told by his captors before his release in April of this year: 'If you make public the fact they are being held or that you were together, reprisals will follow against [Foley, Sotloff, and the other remaining captives].' Members of ISIS released another video earlier today that they claim is a beheading of another one of their prisoners, an Iraqi Kurdish fighter.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Five people arrested  in the Michael Brown protests are suing Ferguson police for $40million over claims they were assaulted and brutalised with rubber bullets and tear gas. St. Louis County and Ferguson officers have been accused of treating US citizens like 'war combatants', including one woman who was assaulted as she went to buy ice-cream. Thousands of demonstrators have marched in the Missouri city, demanding the arrest of white police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot dead unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Police in Ferguson (not those pictured) are being sued for £40million over claims that they used 'excessive force' and brutality . Police begin arresting dozens of protesters in Ferguson on August 20 after they refused to leave the area . The lawsuit, which includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and assault and battery, focuses on several arrests between August 11 and August 13. Social worker Tracey White was buying an ice cream sundae at McDonald's when officers 'in what appeared to be army uniforms, carrying rifles and wearing helmets' ordered her to leave. She was told to shut up, thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticising officers for the way they were treating her 17-year-old son, according to the lawsuit. 'It was so horrifying, we did nothing wrong,' she said. Dewayne Matthews was walking to his mother's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him, the lawsuit alleges. Michael Brown, 18, (pictured) was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9 . Protests  erupted in Ferguson after Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown (shown here) He fell into a creek or sewer, where officers 'pounced on him, slammed his face into the concrete, and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned'. Damon Coleman and Theophilus Green claim they were peacefully protesting when police in riot gear fired stun grenades in their direction and then 'hurled racial epithets at them, while punching and kicking them the entire time'. Tracey White claims she was mistreated by police when trying to buy an ice-cream and is one of those filing a  $40million lawsuit against Ferguson Police . And Kerry White was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera, 'took out his memory card and threw it to the ground,' the lawsuit says. 'The police were completely out of control,' said attorney Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice. 'In those initial days, it was virtually a police riot.' The population of Ferguson is 67 percent black, but African Americans make up just 5.6 percent of the police force. The August 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked two weeks of demonstrations, some with violent clashes and scores of arrests. In the immediate days after Brown's shooting, local police in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who refused to disperse and, at times, broke into nearby stores. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon eventually placed the State Highway Patrol in charge of securing Ferguson with a more relaxed approach. He later imposed a curfew that was lifted after several nights of clashes between police and protesters, and called in the National Guard, whose members have since departed Ferguson. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, Ferguson officer Justin Cosma, several unnamed officers and the city and county governments are listed as defendants. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A St. Louis County police spokesman declined to comment, referring inquiries to the county counselor's office.

The death of Michael Brown, 18, has focused global attention on the state of race relations in the United States. It has also evoked memories of other racially charged cases, including the fatal shooting of black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012. Audio has been released that allegedly captures the moment Officer Darren Wilson opened fire on unarmed Michael Brown. At least ten shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire.

A St. Louis County police sergeant forced the officer to lower the weapon and escorted him away. It also recently emerged that a  police officer in Ferguson allowed his dog to urinate on a makeshift memorial for Michael Brown just hours after the teen was gunned down, according to a report. According to Mother Jones, police also drove their patrol cars over the flowers and candles Brown's mother had scattered over the place her son's body fell and laid for more than four hours, crushing them.

"By . Chris Foy for the Daily Mail . Follow @@FoyChris . England's front-row resources could be stretched alarmingly during the autumn Tests after it emerged that two injured Lions props are destined to miss the four-match campaign. Leicester’s Dan Cole and Mako Vunipola of Saracens are both in rehabilitation after serious setbacks and neither is expected to return to action until November. On that basis, they will not be in contention to play for the national team against Southern Hemisphere visitors New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia. England head coach Stuart Lancaster is due to name his elite player squad in October. He and his assistants must prepare to be without Cole — the country’s premier tighthead, who has had neck surgery — until the Six Nations. Missing: Dan Cole will play no part in England's schedule this autumn and is expected to return in November . Blow: Mako Vunipola of Saracens (centre) is also out after dislocating his knee in the Heineken Cup final . Headache: It isn't ideal preparation for England coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of the autumn Tests . At the launch of the Aviva Premiership season, the Tigers’ director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘Coley has had the all-clear from the surgeon to ramp up his training and that was a week ago. He should be fit about 12 weeks from that date, so we’re hoping Dan will be playing again in 10 or 11 weeks, but we will see. We will give him as much time as he needs. The disc that has been replaced will be stronger than the one he had in there in the first place. ‘We will listen to the specialists to make sure that when he comes back, he is good to go. It would be nice to have him back within the 12-week timescale but if it’s a month later, two months later or he doesn’t play until April, it is what it is. ‘It’s far more important that he gets his neck absolutely right rather than come back a bit early and have issues with it. Stuart Lancaster is very sensible about it. Coley will be ready to play when the specialist deems he is ready and not before. ‘The disc has been replaced. It is a metal disc — there’s a plate and a ball-and-socket joint inside. He has been letting the bone heal and has done nothing at all for a few months, but now he can start doing some cycling, some running, some light weights and gradually build himself back up.’ Cole, 27, has played 45 times since he made his debut at the 2010 Six Nations Championship, as well as representing the Lions in 2013 as a substitute in all three Tests against Australia. Bath’s David Wilson has stepped into the tighthead role, backed up by Henry Thomas of Sale Sharks. Vunipola had an operation after dislocating his knee during last season’s Heineken Cup Final — an injury which ruled him out of England’s tour of New Zealand. The 23-year-old loosehead is on the mend but Saracens won’t expect him to regain full fitness for some time. The club’s director of rugby, Mark McCall, said: ‘Mako has an injury from the European final. He’ll be out for a while — until November possibly. But he has no chance for the autumn internationals.’ Meanwhile, Saracens also expect to be without England fly-half Owen Farrell for the start of the Premiership season as he continues his comeback from a knee injury which ended his own tour involvement. ‘Owen is coming back,’ added McCall. ‘He may miss the first couple of games of the season but we’ve got Charlie Hodgson there so we have cover.’","Stuart Lancaster will be without big players for the autumn Tests .

Col. James Keefe announced the news at the Massachusetts Air National Guard in Westfield, Massachusetts, home of the 104th Fighter Wing with which the pilot and jet were based. Keefe said his thoughts and prayers are with the family of the pilot, whose identity was not disclosed. Scroll down for video . An experienced pilot on a standard maintenance mission was killed Wednesday after his fighter jet crashed in the mountains of western Virginia. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) This brings to a sad end an exhaustive two-day search involving more than 100 local, state and federal officials as well as volunteers. When asked how investigators knew the pilot had died, Brig. Gen. Robert Brooks, Commander of the Massachusetts Air National Guard said rescuers found evidence at the crash site Thursday that the pilot did not eject. Pressed for specifics, he said, 'We just found evidence that the ejection seat was with the aircraft.' Brooks would not comment on whether the pilot's remains had been found. He added that the investigation into what caused the crash of the single-seat jet is ongoing and would take several weeks. He also said the pilot's family had been informed and his identity would be made public Friday. The jet crashed in the mountains of western Virginia on Wednesday morning, shaking residents but causing no injuries on the ground. The impact left a deep crater and a large debris field in a heavily wooded area adjacent to a mountain in the George Washington National Forest. Authorities said the pilot was headed to New Orleans for radar installation as part of routine maintenance and reported an inflight emergency before losing radio contact. U.S. Air National Guard Col.

The actor insisted he 'should have known better' as he made an appearance to promote Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday. In an interview the chat show host admitted he thought would be cancelled, the English star insisted he had no idea how much ill-feeling his rant, in which he complained about political correctness, would cause. So sorry: Gary Oldman again begged for forgiveness over his now infamous Playboy interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday . Gary, who is in the middle of promoting . his forthcoming summer blockbuster, caused outrage . after claiming Mel Gibson is 'all right,' despite the actor's previous . use of anti-Semitic and racist epithets. He said: 'It was an article I did with Playboy and I said some things that were poorly considered, and once I had seen it in print, I could see it was, um, offensive, insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed. 'And, uh, well, words have meaning, they carry weight, they carry on long after you've said them, and I don't condone or excuse the words I used in any context. I just basically shouldn't have used them in any context. But I did an I have deeply injured and wounded a great many people.' No case for the defence: The English actor made no excuses for his expletive filled interview . Public figure: Gary said he had set a bad example and apologised to the fans he lovingly calls Team Oldman . Saving his bacon? It remains to be seen whether his grovelling will stop Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes from sinking at the box office . Working class Gary, who is the son of a welder, then thanked the chat show star for allowing him on his show to make his apology. He said: 'It gives me the opportunity to say to those people that I am, from my heart, I am profoundly, profoundly sorry and deeply apologetic, especially to the fans because they have been so incredible to me and very loyal.' The actor then said he should have been mindful to be a better role model to the supporters he calls Team Oldman. He said: 'I am a public figure, I should be an example and inspiration and I am an a—hole. 'I am 56. I should know better. So to them I say I extend my apology and my love and best wishes to my fan base.' The Leon star also took a shot at the media for wanting stars to be more than mere performers. Gary said: 'I just think that we're . public figures and sometimes we're looked upon, we're are asked to be, . social or cultural or political commentators, and, I can't speak for . other people, but I'm not, clearly. A musing actor: The Dracula star was thinking before speaking this time as he chatted with Jimmy . Really? The Fifth Element favourite made the confession he is unqualified to be a social commentator . 'I stepped out of my area of expertise and I just landed both feet in a hornets nest. 'It just came over in a certain way and for that I'm deeply sorry. The Londoner, who admitted his overlords are 'furious' at the publicity his comments have attracted, still found time to laugh when Jimmy made 'the most awkward transition possible' by asking about his new film. His guest admitted: 'I only ever wanted to talk about Planet of the Apes, you know, and this thing, this news cycle, this event has I think sadly um, it derailed what my initial purpose was. And after talking about how great the cast and crew are he joked, 'Its a relief, believe me I desperately want to talk about Planet Of The Apes.' Begging for forgiveness: Gary Oldman has issued a grovelling apology over his controversial new Playboy interview . The Harry Potter star had already made a grovelling . apology to the Anti-Defamation League, he issued his fawning apology, in . which he hailed Jews as 'the chosen people.' However the gorup's national national . director Abraham H. Foxman was no impressed, saying “At this point, we . are not satisfied with what we received. His apology is insufficient and . not satisfactory.' He added the group 'just began a conversation with his managing producer,' who had claimed the star's comments had been taken out of context. This was despite Gary sending a statement to the group in which he addressed the 'gentlemen' of the organisation. He wrote: 'I am deeply remorseful that comments I recently made in the Playboy Interview were offensive to many Jewish people. 'Upon reading my comments in print - I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype. 'Anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable, including my own words on the matter.' The Dark Knight Rises favourite went further as he tried to distance himself from his statements in the forthcoming edition of the pornography magazine, insisting he is a huge admirer of the contribution Jewish people have made to showbusiness. He said: 'If, during the interview, I had been asked to elaborate on this point I would have pointed out that I had just finished reading Neal Gabler’s superb book about the Jews and Hollywood, An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews invented Hollywood. 'The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution. 'I hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt, genuine, and that I . have an enormous personal affinity for the Jewish people in general, . and those specifically in my life.' He then finished by begging for forgiveness, going as far as to say he is unworthy of using a Hebrew greeting meaning 'peace be upon you.' The self described libertarian said: ''The Jewish People, persecuted thorough the ages, are the first to hear God’s voice, and surely are the chosen people. Oldman's controversial interview has derailed his tour promoting Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes . 'I would like to sign off with “Shalom Aleichem”—but under the circumstances, perhaps today I lose the right to use that phrase, so I will wish you all peace.' Gary, who is in the middle of promoting his forthcoming Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes film, caused outrage after claiming Mel Gibson is 'all right,' despite the actor's previous use of anti-Semitic and racist epithets. He also claimed the current vogue of political correctness was rife with hypocrisy. The Dracula star insisted: 'Mel Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him - and doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough. 'He’s like an outcast, a leper, you know? ''But some . Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn’t turned and said, “That f***ing . kraut” or “F*** those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and try to . be so politically correct. That's what gets me.' Gibson, . 58, made anti-Jewish slurs when he was arrested for suspected . drink-driving in Malibu in 2006, two years after his film The Passion Of . The Christ was criticised for depicting Jews negatively. 'He's alright': Gary claimed 'everyone' has used racial slurs like Mel Gibson and should forgive him . His words prompted an angry backlash, with antisemitism group the Anti-Defamation League's national director Abraham H. Foxman saying: 'He should know better than to repeat and give credence to tired anti-Semitic tropes. 'Mel Gibson’s ostracization in Hollywood was not a matter of being ""politically incorrect,"" as Mr. Oldman suggests, but of paying the consequences for outing himself as a bigot and a hater. 'It is disturbing that Mr. Oldman appears to have bought into Mr. Gibson’s warped and prejudiced world view.' He also added the assertion Jews control Hollywood is, 'an anti-Semitic stereotype based on the ""Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,"" the 19th Century anti-Semitic forgery that suggested Jews conspire to control major industries such as banking and finance.' The apology is the latest piece of backpeddling from the English star's camp, with his manager Douglas Urbanski earlier saying: 'This notion that he's defending Mel and Alec is preposterous. Gary Oldman would not defend hate speech or any divisive speech. The piece lacked a kind of balance on that regard.'

The 29-year-old Papua New Guinea international was reported by the Australian media to be one of 17 past and present Cronulla players offered a reduced 12-month ban for admitting taking prohibited substances during the 2011 season. Twelve players, including Australia prop Paul Gallen, began their suspensions on Friday after accepting a deal offered by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency but Aiton insists he has not been part of the investigation.

'I haven't been approached by anyone so I know just as much as anyone else, what's in the papers,' said Aiton, speaking on the subject for the first time in the aftermath of Leeds' 23-10 win over Castleford at Wembley. Leeds coach Brian McDermott had maintained that the controversy had not affected his team's preparations and Aiton says he was grateful for the support of his team-mates. 'It's been like that for 18 months,' he said. 'It's not real good on the players - you can just tell how hard they've done it. My heart goes out to them but I haven't been approached.

Aiton, who is in his first season with the Rhinos after initially moving from Cronulla to Super League with Wakefield in 2012, says he has no interest in getting to the bottom of the mystery. 'Not really, I'll just keep playing and show up for next week and just keep going,' said Aiton, who is in the first season of a three-year contract. 'It's up to others what they want to do.

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Stephen Gallacher is the only player who controls his Ryder Cup destiny, but it was Francesco Molinari who did most to boost his chances of making the European team in the Italian Open. On the course where he started playing golf aged eight, Molinari carded a flawless six-under-par 66 at Circolo Golf Torino to share the lead with Austria's Bernd Wiesberger. And that meant Gallacher, who needs to finish in the top two to overtake Graeme McDowell and claim the final automatic qualifying place, found himself six shots off the pace following an erratic opening 72. Italian Open: After impressing at the Italian Open, Francesco Molinari may be selected as a wildcard option . European captain Paul McGinley admitted Molinari is 'very much in my mind' for one of the three wild cards he will announce on Tuesday, with the man himself thinking he needs to win on Sunday to make a third consecutive cup appearance at Gleneagles next month. 'I had a chat with Paul when he got here and I think the good thing is that he knows what I can bring to the team because he has seen me as vice-captain on the last two teams,' said Molinari, whose halved match with Tiger Woods at Medinah in 2012 ensured Europe won outright for the seventh time in the last nine contests. 'But it's up to me to prove that I really want it and am playing well enough. I think anything less than a win would not be enough so I have to aim for that.' Gallacher headed straight to the range after a round featuring four birdies and four bogeys, the 39-year-old Scot squandering a good start after almost holing his approach to his second hole of the day. Leader: Molinari carded a flawless six-under-par 66 at Circolo Golf Torino to share lead with Bernd Wiesberger . 'I'm a bit disappointed because I threw away a couple of shots midway through my round, but it's okay for the first day and I am only one good score away from the top of the leaderboard,' said Gallacher, who lives just 35 miles from Gleneagles. 'I know I have to finish first or second, that's not going to change, so I'm not putting any pressure on myself. Once you get out on the course you just try to birdie every hole. That's the easy part. It's when you finish you think about the Ryder Cup.' McGinley said that even if nothing significant happened this week that he had not settled upon his three wild cards, with five players - thought to be Gallacher, Molinari, Ian Poulter, Luke Donald and Lee Westwood - the favourites. 'Something will happen and there are a lot of permutations,' McGinley added after a bogey on the last gave him an opening 73. 'My selections won't be a surprise, it won't be coming out of left field. I will be going by logic. Francesco has played very well today and is very much in my mind.' Destiny: Sean Gallacher will automatically qualify for the Ryder Cup team if he can finish inside the top six . The lack of a 'left-field' selection would appear to rule out Wiesberger, who finished 15th in the US PGA Championship after playing in the last group in the final round alongside eventual winner Rory McIlroy. Wiesberger was fourth in the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles last year and also lost a five-man play-off in the same event in 2011, but said: 'I think Stephen Gallacher should get a pick for the way he has played this year. 'Paul (McGinley) knows I play well at Gleneagles and I like the course, but I am pretty far down the list (23rd) and even if I win it would be a surprise to get that call on Tuesday,' he said. 'The first three days at Valhalla gave me a lot of confidence knowing I could get into that position and be in the last group in a major. I probably should have tried to make more of a move in the final round but I didn't drive the ball that well that day and couldn't really get it going. Options: Paul McGinley has a number of options available to him for his three wildcard slots . 'It was actually the first time I have had a really good performance in America as well so it was a big, big week for me and a pretty cool experience to be out so late on a Sunday in a major.' Wiesberger and Molinari enjoyed a one-shot lead over American John Hahn, Northern Ireland's Gareth Maybin, Scotland's Richie Ramsay, England's Richard Bland and South African Hennie Otto, with 17-year-old Italian amateur Edoardo Lipparelli among a seven-strong group another shot back. Scotland's Marc Warren, an outside chance for a wild card following his win in Denmark a fortnight ago, carded a three-under-par 69 to finish alongside fellow hopeful Joost Luiten.","Francesco Molinari playing himself into Ryder cup contention at Italian Open .

"By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . The Breeders’ Cup meeting at Santa Anita in November is a possible target for Jamie Osborne’s Toast of New York after the colt put in what his trainer believes was a career-best effort to finish second to Shared Belief in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in California. The three-year-old colt, owned by Michael Buckley, got to within two and three-quarters of a length of the Jerry Hollendorfer-trained winner to justify the decision of connections to return to America. Toast Of New York was the brilliant winner of the UAE Derby in March but had since slightly disappointed at Belmont Park in July. Target: Jamie Osborne’s Toast of New York will look towards the Breeders' Cup in November . Osborne said: ‘I’d say, probably, he's run the race of his life. He stepped up the form from winning the UAE Derby. This is probably his best performance and, sadly for us, he's just bumped into an exceptional three-year-old. ‘He'll improve a bit more. I'm very proud of him - he's run a great race. From now on he's going to have to try something different, but he's proved he's a very good horse.’ Plans remain fluid for Toast Of New York, who was ridden at Del Mar by Victor Espinoza, although the Dubai World Cup in March next year remains a long-term objective. Osborne said: ‘We've all sorts of ideas. The Dubai World Cup is obviously a massive target for next year, but I'll have to talk to Michael. ‘Do we try him on dirt beforehand? Do we bring him to the Breeders' Cup? There's all sort of options, but he's only three with a big future and maybe he can come back here (California). Victory: Shared Belief with jockey Mike Smith wins the TVG Pacific Classic on Sunday . ‘There's no reason to think he won't go on Dirt. If he does, just think of the fun we could have with him.’ Shared Belief was the leading two-year-old in America last season but missed this year's Triple Crown races with a foot injury. He is now set for a possible showdown with Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner California Chrome in the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Jockey Mike Smith said: 'He's a special horse. I heard someone say this might be the coming out of a superstar. I think now this horse deserves that accolade.’","Toast of New York put on a career-best effort, finishing second at the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in California .

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Captain Jose Fonte is confident Ronald Koeman's new-look Southampton could yet eclipse the achievements of last season - with French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin at the heart of the team. Dutchman Koeman guided the Saints to a first Barclays Premier League win when coming from behind to beat West Ham 3-1 at Upton Park, where Schneiderlin scored twice. It has been a testing start to life at St Mary's Stadium for Koeman, who saw the likes of Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers all follow former boss Mauricio Pochettino out of the south-coast club, who finished in eighth place. Up for the challenge: Jose Fonte (left) thinks Southampton can improve on last season's eighth-placed finish . Key man: Morgan Schneiderlin will be an important player for Saints according to Fonte . However, with summer signings Graziano Pelle, the £8million Italian striker who scored his second goal in as many games after the midweek Capital One Cup win at Millwall, Serbian playmaker Dusan Tadic and goalkeeper Fraser Forster all starting to gel, Portuguese defender Fonte believes Southampton can quickly move forwards. ""For sure, we have lost some good players, but this team still has enough quality to have a strong season and with the additions the club were able to bring in, they have shown their potential,"" Fonte said. ""You know that if you come to this club, you have to play and not be afraid to have the ball, to come and get it, to be dynamic.

""The manager came with a few, but important details - how he wants us to play and what he wants us to do. ""We have shown that we can do it, but we need to be consistent."" Fonte added: ""It is hard to say where we can finish, but we have he quality to be very competitive. ""If we keep working hard and playing like this we can give ourselves a good chance to finish if not in the same position then higher."" Schneiderlin has started all three league games so far, with Southampton insisting the midfielder is not for sale, having been strongly linked with a switch to join Pochettino at Tottenham. On Saturday evening, Schneiderlin gave an interview with Southampton's internal media channel insisting he wanted to focus on his game, but stopped short of committing his future to the club. Heads I win: Ryan Bertrand (left) is one of a number of new arrivals for Southampton . Finish: Pelle fires home powerfully past Adrian's despairing dive . Fonte hopes the 24-year-old will still be at Southampton when the transfer window closes at 11pm on Monday. ""We know what a good player Morgan is because we train with him every day,"" he said. ""Sometimes these things can play with your mind, but he has been a very good professional for us, and we are just glad that we still have him.

The mystery of why the Welsh club at the end of the M4 is apparently out of reach for an England manager continues to confuse and irritate Garry Monk. Swansea’s boss admitted last week that he was puzzled by Roy Hodgson’s ongoing absence from the Liberty Stadium, a feeling exacerbated on Saturday when Wayne Routledge’s wonderful goal against West Brom was sandwiched by two well-taken strikes from Nathan Dyer. With Jonjo Shelvey also performing close to his best, and the injured Leon Britton yet to receive a call-up, it is not lost on Monk that the latest snubs come at a time when England are crying out for players comfortable in possession. Overlooked: Nathan Dyer fires his second goal against West Brom - and third of the season - but the winger is yet to be called up to Roy Hodgson's England squad . Technique: Wayne Routledge showed remarkable agility to score against the Baggies . ‘We all talk about how we want England to play nice, expansive football, a passing game with attacking football,’ Monk said. Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 6; Rangel 6, Amat 6, Williams 6, Taylor 5.5; Ki 6.5, Shelvey 7.5 (Carroll 84); Dyer 8, Sigurdsson 6.5, Routledge 7.5 (Montero 66); Bony 5.5 (Gomis 76) Subs not used: Tiendalli, Tremmel, Richards, Fernandez .

West Brom (4-2-3-1): Foster 5.5; Wisdom 5.5, Dawson 6.5, Olsson 5, Davidson 6 (Gamboa 72); Dorrans 5.5 (Sessegnon 46), Gardner 6; Mulumbu 6, Brunt 6 (Morrison 72), Berahino 6; Ideye 5.5 . Subs not used: Baird, Yacob, Myhill, MacAuley . Manager: Alan Irvine 5 . Booked: Dorrans, Gardner . Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) MOM: Nathan Dyer . Att: 20,318 . ‘I do feel when we are at our best there are not many better than us in terms of doing that. So to have those boys within that team who are English and performing well does make it strange. It is out of our hands. The players can only keep doing what they are doing. Hopefully something comes of it.’ For Swansea, such matters are trifling in comparison to their concerns of last season, when they flirted so close to relegation that Michael Laudrup lost his job. Monk has reacted to his elevated status by winning his first three Premier League games of the season, though he continues to talk of the ’40-point mark’. ‘We have had a very good start but that’s all it is,’ Monk said. ‘We are not a Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Everton or whoever. ‘We always want better but we understand what we are, a team that tries to secure Premier League status as soon as possible and after that we reassess.’ West Brom’s concerns are perhaps a little more realistic, having started the season without a win and Alan Irvine’s 11 signings taking time to settle. Irvine will now lose ‘12 or 13’ players to international duty at a time when he is desperate to increase his squad’s cohesion and fitness, and he has put pressure on Scotland and Greece to justify their respective call-ups for James Morrison and Georgios Samaras with playing time. International class: Garry Monk is bemused why the likes of Jonjo Shelvey is not in the international squad . Top form: Dyer skips around West Brom keeper Ben Foster to give Swansea an early lead .

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Abel Hernandez became Hull City’s club-record signing when he joined for £9.5million on deadline day. The Uruguay striker penned a three-year deal at the KC Stadium but his arrival was somewhat overshadowed by the subsequent scramble to sign Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa. So who is Hernandez? And what will he bring to the Tigers? Sportsmail tells you more… . New arrival: Abel Hernandez completed a £9.5m club-record move to Hull City from Palermo on deadline day . First things first, what are the basics? Well, he only turned 24 last month so his best years should still be ahead of him. Born in Pando on the country’s coast, he made his debut at 16 with Central Espanol in the second tier. A transfer to current Uruguayan champions Penarol soon followed and he didn’t hang around there for too long either, moving to Serie A and Palermo when still only 18. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's top 10 most expensive 2014 Premiership transfers . New surroundings: Hernandez arrives at the KC Stadium with a good reputation but has yet to fulfil it fully . So he’s had nearly six years in Italy, was he a success? On the whole, yes, although his stay was bookended by periods of promise with some frustrating times in between. He spent his early months in the youth-team ranks but come the age of 19 he was a regular in the first-team set-up. Indeed, his first full season produced seven league goals from 21 appearances. But his strike-rate dropped and, over the next three seasons, he managed only 10 from 56 outings. He contributed only one goal as Palermo were relegated in 2013. Last season, however, undoubtedly won him his move to the Premier League, 14 league goals meaning he signed off with a one-in-two ratio as the Rosanero returned to Serie A as champions. Promise: Hernandez has been billed as the next big thing for years but he is yet to fully fulfil his potential . But that was Serie B, is that not a concern? Perhaps, but the season in a lower league appears to have given him the platform to rediscover his form and fitness and at least he arrives full of confidence. Decent record: Hernandez netted 14 times for Palermo as they were promoted from Serie B last season . What about at international level? He’s competing with former Palermo team-mate Edinson Cavani and Luis Suarez for a starting berth, and as a result he was restricted to just 39 minutes at the World Cup. But he has 14 caps and seven goals – four of which came in an 8-0 win over Tahiti – and in the absence of Suarez he could be set for a run in the national side. Prolific: Hernandez's record at international level is impressive, having netted seven times in 14 appearances . So what type of player is he? He’s 6ft1ins but Hernandez is more pace than power. If Nikica Jelavic is the targetman at Hull, then the new boy will buzz around him, populating the flanks when given license. Manager Steve Bruce has already labelled him an ‘exciting talent’ who ‘supporters will enjoy watching’. Hernandez is nicknamed ‘The Jewel’, and Bruce will certainly be hoping he’s struck gold. Quick: Hernandez is more about pace than power and can thrive alongside Nikica Jelvaic up front for Hull . Will he be a success with Hull then? You’d argue they have upgraded on Shane Long and saved themselves £2m in the process. He needs to improve his potency in front of goal but his pace will also create chances for others. But, at 24, time is on his side and we think Hull have made a smart investment. Good deal? Hull have sold Shane Long to Southampton, signed Abel Hernandez and saved £2m in the process .","Abel Hernandez became Hull City's club record signing on deadline day .

"By . Hayden Smith, Press Association . A football fan 'bent it like Beckham' when he ran onto the pitch and took a free kick during West Ham United against Tottenham Hotspur earlier this month, according to the judge in the case. Jordan Dunn, 22, from Dover in Kent, became an internet sensation after he kicked the ball towards the goal West Ham were defending at Upton Park against Tottenham last month. His shot was saved by West Ham's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian San Miguel del Castillo while the fan was chased by a steward amid cheers from the crowd on August 16. Charge: Jordan Dunn arrives at court before being charged under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act . On Tuesday . he apologised for a 'moment of madness' as he pleaded guilty to a charge . under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states that it . is an offence to go on to the playing area without lawful authority or . excuse. He was fined a total of £305 but spared a ban from attending future matches. Passing . sentence at Thames Magistrates' Court in East London, District Judge . Gareth Branston said: 'On the afternoon of August 16 about 35,000 . football fans sat down at Upton Park to watch 22 men in shorts and . football boots kick a football around for 90 minutes. 'Those 22 men were paid for that, to entertain. 'Some time into that game a young man ... ran onto the pitch. That was you. You weren't paid to do that.' The . judge said he proceeded to run 'some 70 yards' across the pitch, chased . by stewards - one of whom fell over - before arriving at the spot where . Tottenham were lining up a free kick. The judge said: 'You took it for them. To be frank you were probably a little tired by the time you got to the ball. 'It was a longer run than was strictly necessary. 'You had consumed alcohol and your stride pattern was a bit out of kilter but to borrow a phrase you did bend it like Beckham. 'Regrettably it was about 30mph slower than Beckham.' Shock: Dunn ran onto the Upton Park pitch and took a free-kick during a Premier Leagu match . The . judge said the effort was 'easily' saved by the West Ham goalkeeper but . referred to Christian Eriksen's subsequent effort after play restarted, . saying: 'I understand that the professional footballer who followed you . did not do any better.' Judge Branston said the shot drew 'the cheers of the crowd' before he was tackled 'in the customary manner' by stewards. He also said it was a 'small mercy' that Dunn had 'decided to remain fully clothed'. Dunn, . who smiled as the judge compared his effort to the former England . captain, told police it had been a dream of his to play at the home of . his favourite team West Ham from a young age. The . judge said: 'You told the police and you tell this court that having . achieved your childhood ambition you won't be doing it again. 'Others . need to be deterred from attempting to do what you did otherwise . football matches would become very tedious affairs if everyone was . allowed to run onto the pitch.' The . judge said a greater risk was that 'drunken hooligans' may invade the . pitch and attack players though he said he accepted that Dunn had 'no . violent motivation'. He said he could not condone the offence but must also put it into perspective. The . judge declined to impose a football banning order called for by the . prosecution, saying he was taking into account Dunn's previous good . character, his 'motivations' on the day, the remorse he expressed and . the fact that 'you will not want disappoint your young son' by repeating . the stunt. Controversial: Dunn runs onto the pitch and strikes the dead ball towards goal . Stop: Stewards restrain Dunn during the Barclays Premier League match between West Ham United and Tottenham . Dunn . told police in interview he had been a West Ham fan since he was a . little boy and it had always been one of his dreams to 'run on the pitch . and kick the ball', the court heard. Ben . Edwards, prosecuting, added: 'Now he could say he had done it. He also . said now he had done what he wanted to do he is not going to do it . again.' Earlier . Dunn told the judge he was 'sorry' for committing the offence and . admitted he had drunk around six beers before the match but denied being . a 'hooligan', 'thug' or 'yob'. Asked . what was going through his mind, Dunn said: 'Nothing really - it was . just a moment of madness. It was a spur of the moment thing. I just . went.' The judge said he had seen footage of the incident on YouTube and asked: 'Were you intending to take the free kick?' Dunn . replied: 'No. All I was going to do was run and as I was running I just . saw the ball there so I thought I would just kick it.' Dunn, who works as a receptionist at a hotel, said he has a ten-month old little boy. Referring . to the prospect of a banning order, he said: 'I was a bit concerned . that when my little boy grows up I want to take him to watch the . football.' The judge asked if his mother had 'expressed disapproval'. Dunn, . who represented himself, said: 'At first she was concerned because she . didn't know the consequences but when she saw the YouTube video she saw . the funny side but she has had a go at me, as a mother would.' He declined to comment after the hearing. The . pitch invasion provoked amusement on social media, with one fan saying . the effort was better than Spurs star Eriksen's free kick once play had . resumed. He . wrote on Twitter: 'Fair play to that pitch invader at West Ham v . Spurs.. He got the Free kick on target when Eriksen couldn't.'

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . The message radiating from White Hart Lane is clear: Tottenham Hotspur are a team transformed. As they look to banish last year to a box marked ‘honest mistakes’, Spurs - under the management of Mauricio Pochettino - go into the new Premier League season refreshed, full of new ideas and with a considerable amount of renewed optimism conspicuous by its absence for a club that spent more than £110million on replacing Gareth Bale. The plan had been to reinvest the world-record fee on building a formidable squad, not reliant on one asset. In the end that hastily assembled group appeared lethargic under Andre Villas-Boas and scattered with Tim Sherwood in charge. A sense of direction wasn't all that evident, Tottenham didn’t know who they were any more. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Christian Eriksen score a brilliant free kick during pre-season . All change: Mauricio Pochettino (centre) is transforming Tottenham's fortunes after taking over this summer . Then in stepped Pochettino. From a relative nobody to one of the country’s most revered coaches in under 18 months, the Argentine hasn’t messed about this pre-season. The squad have been made to work harder than ever before with an emphasis on a high octane programme ensuring they can press higher and for longer. Players are comfortable with, even encouraging, the intensity training; while a change in formation and style will be noticeable in the coming weeks - not least at West Ham on Saturday - it is the mood around the camp that has people at Spurs wired. Ledley King is one of those enthusiasts. A club ambassador and Under 18 coach, the former captain told Sportsmail the tangible effects Pochettino - aided by Jesus Perez and Miguel D’Agostino, who were both coaches at Southampton - has had on an ailing group. ‘The manager has come in and is doing something that most of the players have never done before,’ King said. ‘I've been impressed. Speaking to the players it’s obvious pre-season has been tough but enjoyable. Happy days: Pochettino has brought the smiles back to the faces of the Tottenham players . ‘They can see where the manager wants to go with this. It’s not just hard work for the sake of hard work - it has a motive behind it. They can see why they’re going to have to be fit. We need pace and fit players to get around the pitch to play at a high tempo. ‘Last season we were guilty of not playing at the tempo we've been used to. That’ll come back this season.’ And here comes the real crucial item of information: ‘The lads are happy.’ That hasn't always been the case since Harry Redknapp was sacked two years ago, and it’s something that needed to be addressed quickly this summer. Under Villas-Boas there had been more than a whiff of dressing-room dissent. His predecessor decided to play out spats in public. A united front it was not. King can be a tricky individual to read, but his body language when talking about Pochettino is expressive. There is a new philosophy afoot with largely the same squad, a desire to go and emulate Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers. Why not? There is a squad in place, particularly after much-needed additions at the back, that can go and surprise. Role model: Ledley King was appointed as an ambassador for Tottenham after hanging up his boots . The 33-year-old name checks Erik Lamela as someone who has the potential to unlock defences in a new system and an inventor able to ‘flourish’ when given licence. Christian Eriksen is another. But Lamela is the intriguing case. A poster boy for ill-informed decisions in the transfer market, it had looked like his stay in England would be brief. Villas-Boas was too rigid a coach to fully incorporate the Argentine and by the time Sherwood rocked up the dye seemed to have already been cast. Signed for close to £26million last August, Lamela needed time to settle, time to stamp a mark on English football. People within the club truly believe he will thrive under Pochettino. Lamela has now been given that time, something not afforded to managers in north London very often. That’s the main criticism levelled at Daniel Levy, who seems incapable of giving managers the lengthy stint they require. They've gone through eight in 13 years. That impatience, says King, is merely borne out of a desire to get things right. Pochettino has a five-year contract and is seen as a long-term appointment. Although the initial noises were the same with Villas-Boas, it appears the new man will be given a proper go. Redemption: Erik Lamela has yet to live up to his £30million price tag after joining Tottenham last summer . ‘The chairman has done a great job over the years,’ King added. ‘From where we were when I was breaking through to the end of my career has a lot to do with the chairman. He’s driving and trying to make us a top team. ‘We've obviously had a lot of changes but that’s through a chairman who is passionate and wants the team to do well.’ King has a very valid point. The year he made his debut - 1999 - Tottenham finished in the bottom half. Fifteen later that’s unthinkable. ‘Hopefully we’ll go on and win the league in the next few years,’ the club legend said. That’s the power of Pochettino. VIDEO Pochettino happy with players . Ledley King is an ambassador for Barclays.

"By . Chris Foy for The MailOnline . Follow @@FoyChris . Emily Scarratts’s brilliant solo try seven minutes from full time in Paris on Sunday allowed England’s women to sweep away the pain of past near-misses and secure World Cup glory at last. This was redemption for Gary Street’s side. This was the euphoric occasion when they banished the demons of the last three finals, each one of which had ended in agonising defeat. This was the culmination of four years of fervent dedication, as captain Katy Mclean lifted the trophy which had remained stubbornly out of reach for so long. Yet, the dream was only realised after a hefty dose of tension and drama at Stade Jean Bouin, as England were pushed to the limit by a tenacious Canadian side. Going into the final 10 minutes, the underdogs had closed the deficit to five points, gained the upper hand in the set-piece and were swarming forward in search of the decisive score. VIDEO Scroll down for Prince Harry's good luck message for England women's rugby . Jubilation: England celebrate with the World Cup trophy at Stade Jean-Bouin in Paris . Delight: England centre Rachael Burford holds the trophy after winning the IRB Women's Rugby World Cup . Champions: England celebrate after Emily Scarratt's try rounded off the win late on . Under extreme pressure, England were in danger of unravelling. They were making basic errors which they had not done in the semi-final demolition of Ireland and were lacking any real fluency in their attacking game as their opponents competed strongly at the breakdown and in defence. The Red Rose line-up were within touching distance of their destiny but they needed a moment of inspiration to guard against a last-gasp upset. Scarratt delivered it. In the 73rd minute, England were awarded a penalty and kicked to touch on the right. When the ball was won at the lineout, the Lichfield centre’s powerful burst took her through two tackles into the Canadian 22 and she carved a superb diagonal line to go clear and over for the crucial try. After being mobbed by jubilant team-mates, the 24-year-old then knocked over the conversion to add to her earlier three penalties, to complete a 16-point personal haul. Lining up: Final hero Emily Scarratt of England prepares to kick as England overcame Canada . Dejected: The Canadian team stand back as England receive the World Cup . Soon afterwards, despite one last red wave of defiance, the English celebrations began in earnest. Mclean broke away from the pandemonium to acclaim Scarratt, saying: ‘She is phenomenal. She is a world-class player and she showed that today on a world-class stage.’ The skipper added: ‘It is 20 years since England last won the World Cup so it is amazing that we have done it. Canada were fantastic but our group of girls and all the staff deserved this. We have had a rough ride.' This was the last game many of the England players will play for their country and Mclean heralded their contribution, saying: ‘We are going to lose massive figures like Maggie Alphonsi, Joanna McGilchrist and Sophie Hemming. They have done a great job for English rugby and deserved to go out on a high. ‘So many legends who have gone before us haven’t won a World Cup in an England shirt and that was for all of them who were here today and for all of the England rugby family.’ Top performance: Scarratt of England dives to touch down a try late on . Alphonsi emphatically lived up to her nickname of ‘Maggie the Machine’ with a prodigious display of tackling, breakdown work and tireless harrying of the opposition, while Sarah Hunter also stood tall once again in the back row. Further back, Natasha Hunt was a livewire running threat and Scarratt contributed top-class poaching to go with her goalkicking and wonderful late try. In a first half awash with adventurous intent on both sides, England had surged clear with a classy opening try in the 33rd minute. After Scarratt and Kay Wilson combined at pace down the left, a clever show-and-go by second row Tamara Taylor created space for Alphonsi to send full back Danielle Waterman hurtling into the right corner. At 11-0, Street’s team had a strong grip, but Magali Harvey’s three penalties and Canadian ferocity typified by openside Karen Paquin kept the game in the balance until Scarratt’s strike settled it. England had suffered too much in past finals and gone through too much in the last four years to let this one slip.

Chelsea's Josh McEachran agreed a season-long loan with Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem this week and Hodgson is convinced it is in the interests of more young stars to consider a future on the continent. Hodgson told thefa.com: 'We are going to have to accept that some young players - who I think are good enough and can win games for England - will not always be first choice for their teams in England. VIDEO Scroll down for Roy Hodgson takes England U21 training . Playing time: Roy Hodgson advocated young English  players moving abroad if it meant they would play more . 'It wouldn't hurt them at all to go abroad. Most of our players, although they don't all play regularly - play at very good clubs at a very high level.' He added: 'If you are asking me would it be better for some of our players to be playing in good teams abroad rather than warming the bench, then of course as a national team manager I would like to see that.' The then Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster was the only member of England's final 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup to be based outside the Premier League.

But Hodgson is hopeful that the move by England Under-21 midfielder McEachran could be the start of a trend which sees young prospects pick regular first team football abroad over often bit-part roles at home. Hodgson added: 'It is not my job to tell players what to do but I would think that, if the opening was there for players to go abroad, then a lot of them would take it. 'Chelsea have a lot of young players and they send them to Vitesse Arnhem. Manchester City have a lot of farm clubs.' But Hodgson appeared to concede that the introduction of some kind of quota system which restricts the number of foreign players available to each top-flight club is likely to be a non-starter.

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . It is one of the most famous phone calls of the summer, a conversation that lasted less than two minutes but went viral on the internet. Being granted an audience with Barack Obama could lead some to get an inflated sense of their own worth but, as you listen to Tim Howard relay the story of the day he and Clint Dempsey chatted with the President of the United States, one thing is quickly apparent. Everton’s goalkeeper may have found requests for autographs and pictures increasing, while the days when he could slip back to America and relax in relative anonymity may be over, but this episode has not changed him one bit. Top save: Everton and USA goalkeeper Tim Howard was USA's star player during the World Cup in Brazil . Phonecall: US President Barack Obama had a conversation with Howard to congratulate him . Success: US goalkeeper Tim Howard was telephoned by President Barack Obama after the World Cup . ‘I’m fortunate because 99.9 per cent of people don’t get to speak to him,’ says Howard, as he revisits the events that took place after the USA’s interests in the World Cup were ended by Belgium. ‘I’ve met the President once before when we went to the White House, so to speak to him was really cool. ‘He watched it with his family and his daughters. He said he was proud of us and the team effort and it was exciting, thrilling, he was on the edge of his seat. It was cool that he was so excited. ‘I think I played well against a real tough Belgium team but I’m an old dog, I don’t get too excited. In 2010 we lost in the round of 16 and in 2014 we lost in the round of 16. We were poo-pooed then and we’re celebrated now. But we still lost in the round of 16, so it’s all a little bit lost on me. ‘We lost a game of football which we could have won at the end. We missed a golden chance and could have done it but I still don’t get caught up in all the mass hysteria.’ Howard chose to reveal this week that he is taking a break from international football to spend more time at home after 12 years of criss-crossing the Atlantic. If it is good news for his family, it is also good news for Everton. New season: Tim Howard has returned to Everton and is hoping to have a successful campaign on Merseyside . Record: Tim Howard has kept 116 clean sheets since signing for Everton in 2006 from Manchester United . Form: Howard is playing the best football of his career and is hoping to continue that with Everton this season . As he showed during that breathless journey in Brazil, when his saves almost took the USA to the last eight, Howard is operating at his peak, thriving from long hours in the gym and reaping the benefits of the Paleo Diet, which advocates eating lean meat and fish while avoiding dairy and grain foods. He also has clarity. Howard intends to retire when his current contract with Everton expires in four years’ time - the ambition is to finish, if possible, after one last hurrah at the World Cup in Russia - but before then, there are targets to be met. His 116 clean sheets since moving from Manchester United in 2006 are the fourth best figures in club history - another five will move him beyond the fabled Ted Sagar, who played for Everton before and after the Second World War - while his durability and consistency will almost certainly take him into the top 10 most appearances before his time is done. Above all, though, there are ambitions for the team as a whole. Everton came within a whisker of qualifying for the Champions League last season and the club has spent big this summer, smashing their transfer record for Romelu Lukaku. Howard knew that would happen soon after Lukaku had ended his interest in the World Cup. Joy: Kevin Mirallas (right) celebrates after scoring during Everton's 3-0 win over Arsenal last season . Devastation: Arsenal players look to the sky after Everton score their third goal at Goodison Park last season . ‘We both got pulled for doping after the game in Salvador,’ Howard reveals. ‘I was in doping control and I was happy for him as a person because I regard the guys at Everton like my family. I love those guys. It was heartbreaking to lose but I was oddly happy for him. ‘I believe in him and love him as a person. He is not arrogant, he is a good person. We talked about our family, we didn’t talk about the game, we were just standing there trying to drink water, your mind is racing, he is looking forward and I am looking back. ‘We spoke a little about what was next, he said he had had some good conversations with Roberto (Martinez) so I was encouraged by that. I wanted to go cry in the locker room and he wanted to celebrate. ‘As much as I felt his joy, he felt my pain. We both peed and we left. I don’t think he needed me to tell him (how much we wanted him to sign), he had spoken to the manager — we made our case last year. I didn’t have to beat him over the head.’ Lukaku was instrumental in April’s 3-0 demolition of Arsenal and he will have a major role to play on Saturday evening when Arsene Wenger brings his side back to Merseyside. That performance set the barometer for what Everton can do under manager Martinez and Howard wants more of the same. ‘We switched things up last season and really hurt them, says Howard. ‘Will they come to defend against that or will they be trying to play straight up? I don’t know. Our job is to make being at Goodison an uncomfortable afternoon.’ Glum: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger looks on during his side's 3-0 loss at Goodison Park last season .

Roberto Martinez is predicting this will be the tightest season in Barclays Premier League’s history - and believes the next two games will show what hand Everton can take in the major issues. Having opened the campaign with a 2-2 draw at Leicester, Everton now have back-to-back home games against Arsenal and Chelsea and Martinez is adamant that both clashes will show the progress his side have made since finishing fifth last year. Everton produced one of their finest performances of the modern era when they dismantled Arsenal 3-0 at Goodison Park in April and Martinez also recorded his first win in charge when Steven Naismith’s header saw off Chelsea last September.

Martinez is confident Everton can improve on how they performed in his debut season, in which they finished fifth with 72 points, but he is reluctant to say how far they can go this time, as he believes this will be the most competitive battle there has ever been between the country’s leading sides. ‘I’m delighted we are facing Arsenal and Chelsea before the end of the transfer window,’ said Martinez. ‘I am pleased with the squad and the focus. That is what you need in football – to face this opposition. ‘I thought we were really fluent last week, we just didn’t get the second goal that would have given us that cushion. Until you play against sides like Arsenal and Chelsea, you don’t have the answers on the pitch. Pre-season has been a real success but we won’t know where we are until after these games. ‘I have heard people saying it is between Manchester City and Chelsea but the League is going to be closer than people think. This season will be very small margins proving crucial from week to week. Challenge: Everton host Arsenal at Goodison Park on Saturday in a mouthwatering early-season tie .

VIDEO We should've won - Martinez . ‘I see five teams with equal chances of winning the title. I think it is going to be small margins, the tightest that we have ever seen. It is a 10 month competition. I wouldn’t go in to discussing where we can be at the end of the season.’ Martinez, meanwhile, is confident key midfielder Ross Barkley will be back before October after ruling out the prospect of him spending five months on the sidelines with medial ligament damage. ‘He is as you would expect,’ said Martinez. ‘Ross is such a strong boy he has recovered quicker than you would expect but there is still some swelling around the knee and we are taking our time. ‘I don’t know where five months came from. He has a partial tear of his medal ligament. It can take time and I’m sure Ross will be quicker than normal in his recovery but it could be seven, eight or nine weeks. You just don’t know with that type of injury.’ Martinez, meanwhile, believes Aidan McGeady – who scored Everton’s first goal of the season with a thumping effort at the Kingpower Stadium – could be ready to step into Barkley’s shoes. The Republic of Ireland midfielder made a slow start after his move from Spartak Moscow in January but is fitter now. ‘I have seen Aidan coming back in a really good shape,’ said Martinez. ‘We are really excited to see what Aidan can do this year. He scored his first goal for the club and I think the fans are in for a treat as Aidan’s qualities are quite unique.

"By . Pa Reporter . Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has already conceded that his side may have fallen too far behind Barcelona and Real Madrid to retain their Primera Division title. Despite emerging from the shadows of Spain's big two to claim their first title for 18 years last season, Simeone believes that a summer of aggressive spending by those sides will make it extremely tough to defend their crown. 'I don't like lying to people, and one thing is clear: we cannot compete with Real and Barcelona. Our rivals are Sevilla, Valencia, Athletic Bilbao, and the target is third place. This is a new team,' he told Gazzetta dello Sport. Different class: Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone says they cannot win retain their league title this season .

Top talent: Real have strengthened this summer with the £63million acquisition of James Rodriguez . World Cup winner Toni Kroos and Colombia star James Rodriguez supplement an outrageously talented forward line including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Angel di Maria and Karim Benzema. Barcelona responded to a disappointing season, which culminated in Atletico Madrid beating them to top spot at the Nou Camp courtesy of a 1-1 draw, by bringing in former player Luis Enrique to take over from Gerardo Martino as manager. The Catalan side have been busy strengthening their squad in anticipation of a 14-month transfer ban starting in January, with Luis Suarez becoming their new record signing and the third most expensive footballer in history after clinching a £75m switch from Liverpool.

In a statement released Thursday via his Facebook page and US Soccer, Howard said he was keen to spend more time with his family but does not want to retire yet - something United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann is willing to accept. Break time: Howard said on Facebook that he needed to make a commitment to his family . 'Having played overseas for the last 12 years and missing out on spending time with my family, making this commitment to my family is very important at this time,' said Howard. 'I am grateful for the willingness of both Jurgen Klinsmann and Everton manager Roberto Martinez to afford me the opportunity to spend time with my kids. It's the right decision at the right time. 'Jurgen has always been up front with all the players in saying you have to earn your place, which is something I agree with, so I look forward to coming back next fall and competing for a spot.' Klinsmann said: 'We had a very good and productive conversation. I totally understand Tim's situation. He was very straightforward and honest in his approach, and I admire him for that. Admiration: Klinsmann said he admired Howard's honesty and that the keeper will be welcomed back . Working hard: The break from international football will allow Howard to focus on his family and Everton . 'He has a wish to take a step back to take care of his family, and we came to the conclusion that it's absolutely fine that he takes time off from international soccer until after next summer's Gold Cup, and then we reevaluate. 'I told him as long as he is the same Tim Howard we always see performing well, he will be welcome back with open arms and right back competing for a spot. 'He knows he has to prove that he deserves to be back.' Howard's appearances in Brazil this summer took him to 104 caps, the most all-time by an American goalkeeper. Old favourite: Howard has been a key member of the USMNT for a dozen years, winning over 100 caps . Number one: Howard played 37 times in the league for The Toffees last season and was a key performer . Taking a year out will cost him the chance to feature in eight friendlies as well as the CONCACAF Gold Cup, and once he returns he will likely face a fight to regain a spot which Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan will be the favourite to inherit. Real Salt Lake's 35-year-old goalkeeper Nick Rimando was the third goalkeeper taken to Brazil. 'This gives us a huge opportunity to see Brad Guzan and Nick Rimando going forward and fighting for the No. 1 spot,' Klinsmann added. 'We have young talented goalkeepers with Sean Johnson and Bill Hamid, who have been brought along the last couple years, so this may give them a chance here and there to get some game time. 'Always when somebody steps aside for a moment, it gives an opportunity for the next ones in line.'","USMNT goalkeeper will take a break until after next summer's Gold Cup .

"By . Adam Shergold . As the new Bundesliga season begins, German football has probably never been in such rude health. When Bayern Munich start the defence of their title against Wolfsburg on Friday night, 40 days will have elapsed since Philipp Lahm lifted the World Cup trophy in the Maracana and their time in the international wilderness is most certainly over. Blessed with a 'golden generation' of wonderfully-gifted players all blossoming at the same time, Germany swept all beside them to win the tournament for a fourth time and few would argue they were undeserved winners. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bayern can cope with injuries - Breitner . All-time high: German football has never been stronger following the national team's World Cup triumph . The ones to beat: Bayern Munich will once again be the strong favourites for the Bundesliga title, lifted here by their captain Philipp Lahm at the end of last season. They also won the DFB-Pokal to complete the double . Even stronger: Bayern have boosted their firepower further by signing Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski . VIDEO Bayern can cope with injuries - Breitner . Their triumph could also signal the start of a period of dominance similar to that of Spain over the last few years, with young talents coming through all the time and coach Joachim Low adept at helping them along. Domestically, the Germans also seem to have got everything spot on as well. The Bundesliga continues to draw the biggest average attendances and has by popular consensus the best experience for the fans with cheap tickets and safe standing. It can also claim to be the most entertaining - with an average of 3.16 goals per game over the last 12 years, compared to 2.77 in the Premier League - and the best run, making a profit year-on-year and successfully restricting ruinous debt and short-term profit hunting with the '50+1' rule. These figures will only continue to improve as the fans flock to see Germany's World Cup stars who, on the whole, will be playing in the league next season. It's all very positive but one question remains - who can stop Bayern Munich? Unique experience: German grounds, such as Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, are noted for their atmosphere . Unstoppable: Thomas Muller scored 26 goals last season and five more for Germany at the World Cup . Happy man: Pep Guardiola guided Bayern to the domestic double in his first season at the Allianz Arena . FRIDAY . Bayern Munich vs Wolfsburg (19.30) Live on BT Sport 1 . SATURDAY (14.30 unless stated) Cologne vs Hamburg . Eintracht Frankfurt vs Freiburg . Hannover 96 vs Schalke 04 . Hertha Berlin vs Werder Bremen . Hoffenheim vs Augsburg . Borussia Dortmund vs Bayer Leverkusen (17.30) Live on BT Sport 1 . SUNDAY . Paderborn vs Mainz (14.30) Borussia Monchengladbach vs Stuttgart (16.30) Both live on BT Sport 1 . The Bavarians sent records tumbling as they retained their title last season, wrapping things up with seven matches remaining on March 25 and going on to finish 19 points clear of distant challengers Borussia Dortmund. They set league records for the most wins in a row (19), the best goal difference away from home (+38) and the longest undefeated streak (53 games going back into the season before). And after all that, they then acquired Robert Lewandowski, the league's top goalscorer and arguably the best player of their closest challengers. Toni Kroos may have been sold to Real Madrid, but Bayern still boast World Cup heroes Manuel Neuer, Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller, Mario Gotze and Jerome Boateng. With the likes of Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and Javi Martinez also in there, all the signs point to another Bayern procession. It's an issue I raised with the league's chief executive Christian Seifert prior to the Super Cup final in Dortmund last week. He said Bayern's dominance would only concern him if it lasted for five years or more, admitting that a situation akin to Celtic in the Scottish Premiership would 'not be so good for us.' But he believed the situation will change given time and the right system is in place to ensure other teams can challenge for the Bundesliga title. Dortmund are best equipped and they struck an early blow when they beat a misfiring Bayern side 2-0 in the Super Cup curtain-raiser. First strike: Borussia Dortmund lifted the German Super Cup last week, beating Bayern Munich . Playing catch up: Can Dortmund's popular manager Jurgen Klopp lead a sustained challenge for the title? But then again, Jurgen Klopp's side won the same fixture 12 months ago and went on to trail by some distance, so take it with a pinch of salt. Starting with Saturday's match with Bayer Leverkusen, they must hit the ground running. Any slip will prove costly but Bayern will be without some of their World Cup stars for the first few weeks, perhaps allowing the opportunity to build a handy little lead. 'At the moment I have only eight or nine players who are fully fit,' said Pep Guardiola last week, with Martinez and Schweinsteiger among the long-term absentees. Franck Ribery and Thiago Alcantara will also miss the start. Lewandowski's departure hardly came as a surprise and Dortmund hope new buys Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos will be sufficient to make up the 28 goals scored by the Pole last season. Missing the start: Bastian Schweinsteiger will be out for a while yet with a knee injury . New signing: Dortmund have brought in Ciro Immobile from Torino to fill the gap left by Lewandowski . Positive start: Adrian Ramos (right) celebrates scoring with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the 4-1 DFB-Pokal win over Stuttgart Kickers at the weekend . Immobile was certainly impressive last season as his 22 goals in Serie A helped Torino into the Europa League, while Colombian Ramos scored 16 in 34 games for Hertha Berlin. Klopp will also be encouraged that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan are already hitting form, having both scored in the Super Cup and the DFB-Pokal victory at Stuttgart Kickers last weekend. He also has Marco Reus, who missed the World Cup with an ankle injury, Neven Subotic, who missed the bulk of last season with ligament damage, and Ilkay Gundogan, who has missed a whole year with a back injury, to return. But even when back to full strength, Dortmund will have to be outstanding to keep up with their title rivals. In form: Armenian striker Henrikh Mkhitaryan has scored in the Super Cup and the opening DFB-Pokal tie . Look who's back: Marco Reus has returned from the ankle injury that kept him out of the World Cup . It's hard to see beyond those two for the title, leaving the likes of Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen, Wolfsburg and Borussia Monchengladbach to challenge for the Champions League places. Young manager Jens Keller is starting to make his mark at Schalke and the acquisition of Germany international Sidney Sam from Leverkusen, sealed back in January, represents a coup. Cameroon winger Eric Choupo-Moting, who scored 10 goals last season, has joined from Mainz on a free transfer and, with the likes of Julian Draxler, Kevin Prince Boateng and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in the team, they should be able to mount a challenge, especially if they avoid a slow start like last year. New boy: Schalke have signed Germany international Sidney Sam from Bayer Leverkusen . Main man: Schalke will depend heavily on the goals of Dutchman Klass-Jan Huntelaar . Leverkusen, who are desperate to end a 21-year trophy drought and finally shake off the 'Neverkusen' tag, have again raided Hamburg for their summer shopping. A year after South Korean star Son Heung-Min made the switch, Bayer have signed talented Turk Hakan Calhanoglu for £12m. He's the guy who scored that outrageous 50-yard free-kick against Dortmund last season, one of 11 he got last season. Another new recruit is £6m Swiss striker Josip Drmic from relegated Nuremberg and new coach Roger Schmidt will hope he can combine well with Stefan Kiessling. The job represents a step-up for Schmidt, who led Red Bull Salzburg to the Austrian league and cup double last season. Exciting: Bayer Leverkusen splashed out £12m to sign Hamburg's Hakan Calhanoglu this summer . Wolfsburg missed out on Champions League qualification by a single point last season and moved to sign Werder Bremen's playmaker Aaron Hunt as well as Arsenal's much-maligned striker Nicklas Bendtner. The Volkswagen-owned club also have former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne and Brazilian Luiz Gustavo in their ranks, plus they've borrowed highly-regarded Frenchman Joshua Guilavogui from Atletico Madrid. Fresh start: Nicklas Bendtner has joined Champions League challengers Wolfsburg from Arsenal . There is every chance they will push for the Champions League places, as will Monchengladbach, for whom striker Max Kruse will be key. They lost Marc-Andre ter Stegen to Barcelona but spent £7m on Basle's Yann Sommer to fill the gloves. Chelsea youngster Thorgan Hazard, younger brother of Eden, will spent the season on loan at Borussia-Park. Things surely have to go better for Hamburg, who survived a relegation play-off to preserve their Bundesliga ever-present status back in May. Striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga, the man who scored the vital goal against Greuther Furth that kept them up, has been signed on a permanent basis from Hertha and will hopefully offer the goals to propel them a little further up the table. Coming into the top flight are 'yo-yo club' Cologne and Paderborn, who are at this level for the first time.

"By . Chris Cutmore for MailOnline . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Marcos Rojo is ready to make an impact following his £16million move to Manchester United... on Premier League forwards' shins that is. The Argentina defender sealed his switch from Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday and will add much-needed steel to United's brittle defence, which was breached twice on the opening day of the season in a miserable defeat against Swansea. A quick glance at Rojo's disciplinary statistics from his time in Portugal reveal a player not afraid to get stuck in to the opposition - whether within the rules of the game or outside of them. VIDEO Scroll down for Rojo likes to have a hit from range as this compilation shows . Red Devil: Marcos Rojo has signed for Manchester United for £16m from Sporting Lisbon . Putting his foot in: Rojo (left) upends a squealing Thomas Muller during the World Cup final . Seeing red: Cards are a familiar sight for Rojo . Rojo collected a staggering 15 yellow cards and four red cards during his previous two league seasons with Sporting - more than anyone else in the Portuguese Primeira Liga - marking him out as a man not to be trifled with. Not only that, Rojo also saw red in the Portuguese cup against Benfica making it five reds in two seasons at Sporting. The 24-year-old from La Plata also gave a hint of what was to come for Premier League referees when he collected his second yellow card of the World Cup  in the last-16 win over Switzerland. Rojo took down Ricardo Rodriguez to earn himself a booking which would rule him out of the quarter-final against Belgium. The left back's absence from that match does not seem to have concerned Louis van Gaal, who was able to scout Rojo first-hand as Holland manger in the semi-final. But if Rojo is suspended for, say, United's visit to Anfield on March 21 then the Dutchman might think differently. United were forced to field 20-year-old Tyler Blackett at centre half and Ashley Young at left back during the defeat by Swansea, such is the paucity of top-class options available to Van Gaal. Supporters will hope that Rojo's signing will ensure their new boss does not need to expose such a makeshift defence again. Over the top: Estoril forward Bruno Lopes gets a clattering from Rojo at the Alvalade Stadium last season . Rojo could be the latest in a long line of Argentine hard men to have left their own stud marks on the game. In recent years Gabriel Heinze was a fans' favourite at Old Trafford, while Javier Mascherano became a fearsome figure in Liverpool's midfield. No England fan will forget Diego Simeone's role in Argentina's midfield at the World Cup in 1998, and the nation's reputation for dirty play was cemented during the vicious World Cup quarter-final defeat by the Three Lions at Wembley in 1966. Further evidence of Rojo's hot-headedness came when he refused to train at Sporting in a bid to force through his move to United. The message was loud and clear: don't mess with me. Premier League strikers take note: this one could be a real Red Devil. *Rojo was also shown one red card in a Portuguese cup match .","Marcos Rojo has signed for Manchester United for £16m .

"By . Chris Waugh . Our first Fantasy Football £1,000 weekly winner is revealed (he's an Exeter fan who got lucky with two Hull defenders)... and here's his team. It is the craze that seems to have taken over the world - and sports stars in particular seem to have embraced the Ice Bucket Challenge. Names including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and David Beckham have been doused with freezing water in order to raise money for charity. The Ice Bucket Challenge craze originated in the United States with the intention of raising money for the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Association. ALS, also known as Motor Neurone Disease, attacks the spinal cord and can lead to speech difficulties, muscle spasms and paralysis. It affects around 30,000 people in the US and 5,000 in the UK. Here, we show you the best sporting Ice Bucket Challenges... CRISTIANO RONALDO . Ronaldo stripped down to his boxers to accept former Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher's Ice Bucket Challenge nomination - and then called on musicians Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and Lil Wayne to join in. The Real Madrid forward was soaked by his compatriot Fabio Coentrao while sat on a chair wearing just a pair of purple boxer shorts at the club's training ground at Valdebebas. What a friend: Real Madrid team-mate Fabio Coentrao soaks Cristiano Ronaldo for Ice Bucket Challenge . NEYMAR . Barcelona forward Neymar was dared to undertake the freezing challenge by Real Madrid defender Marcelo.

Chilly: Neymar takes on the Ice Bucket Challenge after being nominated by Brazil team-mate Marcelo . LIONEL MESSI . The Barcelona forward was nominated for it by his team-mate Dani Alves, and he then went on to put forward his international colleagues Sergio Aguero and Ezequiel Lavezzi to step forward next. Ice Bucket Challenge: Lionel Messi has also felt the cool chill of freezing water being thrown over his back . DAVID BECKHAM . Beckham, was nominated by US presenter Ryan Seacrest. And he went on to name former NBA stars Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and actor Leonardo DiCaprio to have a go. JOHN TERRY . The Blues captain managed to thank Ashley Cole and Stiliyan 'Stan' Petrov for nominating him before tipping a bucket of freezing water over his head and letting out a scream that would scare a banshee. And then the veteran defender nominated Frank Lampard, John Obi Mikel... and Rafa Benitez. Wet wet wet: John Terry takes the Ice Bucket Challenge after Chelsea's 3-1 win over Burnley at Turf Moor . TIGER WOODS AND RORY MCILROY DOUBLE TEAM . The two biggest names in golf dumped ice over one another on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Ian Poulter nominated Woods, who coaxed McIlroy into joining him. Four-time Major winner McIlroy nominated former US President George W Bush, Wayne Rooney and model Meghan Markle, whereas Woods challenged Phil Knight and Rafa Nadal. Revenge: Tiger Woods strikes back, dumping water on Rory McIlroy's head after the Irishman had doused him . COLEEN ROONEY (THROWN OVER BY WAYNE ROONEY) Wayne Rooney got into the spirit of the 'ice bucket challenge' craze - by soaking wife Coleen. The Manchester United striker's wife was nominated by Rooney's former England team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips for the challenge, and after being drenched called upon Piers Morgan and Sheree Murphy - Harry Kewell's wife - to step up next. Harsh: Wayne Rooney douses his wife Coleen Rooney with water during the Ice Bucket Challenge . ROBIN VAN PERSIE . Van Persie was soaked by his kids as he sat next to a pool. The Manchester United forward nominated Patrick Kluivert and Patrick Vieira to take up the challenge next. GEORGE W BUSH . George W. Bush accepted his daughter's ice bucket challenge Wednesday, but in a hilarious twist his wife Laura surprised him with the face full of frigid water after the former president offered just to write a check. He then went on to nominate another former US President in Bill Clinton. Chilly challenge: Before the former president could get away with simply buying out of the chilly challenge, his wife Laura sneaked up and douse him in the required fashion . ANA IVANOVIC . Tennis star Ivanovic took the challenge as she stood in a pink sports crop top. She went on to nominate Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Dunked: Ana Ivanovic has ice poured over her by two guys after taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge . NOVAK DJOKOVIC . Wimbledon champ Djokovic accepted his challenge from One Direction singer Niall Horan. The Serb then nominated Michael Jordan... and Mr Bean. Really? CESC FABREGAS . Among those who nominated Fabregas were former Barca team-mate Gerard Pique and current Blues star Andre Schurrle. The Spaniard upped the stakes with his nominations, however, with Fabregas electing Thierry Henry and David Villa. One sided: Cesc Fabregas remained seated during the challenge as water was chucked at him from the side . DIDIER DROGBA .

Clubs chasing: Manchester United, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain . United know they could do a deal but have not made a move.

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Jack Wilshere maintains Arsenal must not take it for granted they will sweep aside the challenge of Besiktas at the Emirates Stadium next week to secure their place in the Champions League group stages. The Gunners battled to a goalless draw in the play-off first-leg at the cauldron of the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, where midfielder Aaron Ramsey was sent off late on for a second yellow card and so will miss the return match back in England next week. Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic insists his well-organised side - who hit the bar right from kick-off through former Chelsea striker Demba Ba - are very much still in contention, although it remains to be seen if the former West Ham and Everton defender will be allowed in the dugout having been ordered to the stands late on by Serbian referee Milorad Mazic. Defiant: Jack Wilshere maintains that Arsenal will next take Besiktas for granted in the second leg . Tussle: The Gunners played out a gritty goalless draw in the Turkish captail on Tuesday night . Wilshere knows Arsenal will have to be on their guard to qualify through to the group stages for what would be a 17th consecutive European campaign. 'It was a hostile atmosphere, but I think we battled well and showed a different side to our game, especially at the end when we went down to 10 men, it was tough, so we did well,' Wilshere said. 'They worked just as hard as we did last year to get themselves into this position, so they are not going to just turn up (at the Emirates Stadium) and throw all of that hard work away . 'It is not going to be an easy game and we can't take it for granted. 'They are going to come full of confidence from their performance in the first game and we are going to have to start how they did and take the game to them.' Wilshere added: 'We always want to be in the Champions League and to attract players who can be in the Champions League. 'We know how big a game it is, and we will treat it as a cup final.' Threat: Demba Ba proved a threat up front for Besiktas all night at the Ataturk Stadium . Embrace: The former Chelsea forward had been linked with a move to Arsenal last season . Arsenal hit the woodwork themselves late on when substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's angled drive was turned against the far post by Besiktas goalkeeper Tolga Zengin. Despite the loss of key man Ramsey - who netted a stoppage-time winner to beat Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new Barclays Premier League season - the Gunners will be boosted by the return of German World Cup winning trio Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil, who could all feature for Saturday's trip to Everton. England midfielder Wilshere said: 'Having won the World Cup can have an impact, but the Germans have got a fantastic mentality anyway. 'Last year, you saw that - they are great characters to have in the dressing room. 'We are looking forward to getting them back and it is going to make our squad even stronger.' Oxlade-Chamberlain also feels there are plenty of reasons for Arsenal, who beat Manchester City to win the Community Shield at Wembley, to be positive. Livewire: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had an excellent cameo off the bench in the latter stages . Passionate: Slaven Bilic got in trouble with the referee and was sent to the stands . 'It is early in the season and you could argue not everyone is at their peak fitness yet, understandably, but that will come soon and we will get better from here,' he said.

The Reds were in the hunt to end a title drought dating back to 1990, only for a defeat at home to Chelsea and a draw at Crystal Palace to hand the initiative to Manchester City, who went on to pip them by two points. It was a devastating end to a campaign when for the majority of the last two months the feeling was that the club stood on the verge of something extra special. But Sturridge stressed the squad had put that behind them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch New signings excellent - Rogers .

'We were heartbroken at the end of last season but we are refreshed this season and mentally ready for a long season, especially with the Champions League,' he said.

It is not easy to get over things like that but everyone is over that now and we look forward to the future and hopefully bringing success the club.' While Liverpool's 2-1 win over Southampton was far from impressive, they are at least off and running, but following the £75million departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona their chances of finishing in the top four have been written off by many critics.

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association Sport . The Premier League's top sides must not be allowed to 'bypass' fair play rules by setting up global feeder clubs, according to former Football Association chief executive Ian Watmore. Watmore believes UEFA will be 'all over clubs like a rash' that aim to avoid Financial Fair Play regulations by loaning top stars from overseas satellite outfits to cut transfer fees. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger earlier this month questioned Manchester City's loan capture of Frank Lampard from New York City - a club also owned by Sheikh Mansour. Hardline: Former FA chief executive Ian Watmore has spoken out about transfer fair play rules . Fair? Arsene Wenger  questioned the loan deal that took Frank Lampard to Manchester City . Ex-FA boss Watmore reckons Manchester City were within their rights to recruit former Chelsea midfielder Lampard on loan, but thinks the European governing body may review similar processes in the long run. Watmore called on England's top clubs to invest in home-grown talent through sending more youngsters on extended loans to lower-league clubs. 'You've got to be careful of clubs negotiating the constraints of top European competition, and I'm sure UEFA will be all over clubs like a rash,' Watmore told Press Association Sport. Feeder: Watmore has questioned Watford's relationship with Udinese that sees players loaned back and forth . 'The governing bodies need to monitor this very carefully, because you do not want people bypassing European rules by doing deals elsewhere then loaning players back. 'There have been half attempts at this over the years with clubs in Belgium and the Udinese model with Watford. 'We should be able to use the wealth of that Premier League locally - not to try to dislodge the likes of Thierry Henry, who lift the standard, but the bog-standard average imports that we can do without. 'The real cream of English football still rises, but where we lack is strength in depth, and that's been squeezed out. Controversy: FA chairman Greg Dyke  proposed a B team system for Premier League clubs . 'And that's the area where we should be using our money to strengthen, not spending it abroad.' Watmore has assumed an unpaid, non-executive board role with north-east football agency Quantum Sport, to specialise in helping youngsters fulfil their potential. His son Duncan is now thriving at Sunderland, but only after being released from Manchester United's academy and dropping into the non-league ranks. The Black Cats snapped up the 20-year-old from Altrincham, before sending him on loan to Hibernian last season. Loaned out: youngsters like Chelsea's Gael Kakuta have been farmed out to clubs across Europe . Watmore said his experiences helping his son have given him fresh insight into the battle for young English talent to succeed at Premier League level. He warned chairman Greg Dyke and the FA commission not to alter English football's league structure, but to fight for an increased and extended loan system instead. 'I think the commission that Greg started was a good idea and has come up with a lot of good ideas,' said Watmore, who was FA chief executive between 2009 and 2010. Back then: Former FA chief executive Watmore was in charge during Fabio Capello's reign as England manager . 'It has got this unfortunate headline of the 'B teams', and I'm just not there with that. I don't think we need to do that at all. 'Clubs need to send more of their academy players on extended loans, where they can play regularly in real pressure situations. 'Clubs have to realise and recognise when it's the right time to let their young players move on in order to secure regular football. 'Otherwise players hit 22 and can't secure a post-under-21 contract, and find themselves squeezed out by youngsters coming through the system.'","Ian Watmore has spoken out against Premier League teams setting up feeder clubs .

On Tuesday, her devastated family said their goodbyes as they made the agonizing decision to switch off her life support and donate her organs. Loss: Kristina Chesterman, pictured right in her nurse scrubs, has died after being hit by a drunk driver .

"By . David Tyrer . Mario Balotelli is set for a sensational £16million move to Liverpool, returning to the Premier League after an explosive spell at Manchester City. We asked David Tyrer of Kopite-tinted website Live4Liverpool to explain why he wants the madcap striker at Anfield. A few weeks ago, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers spoke quite plainly when asked about the possibility of signing Mario Balotelli, saying 'He is a wonderful player, but an AC Milan player, I just gave my opinion of him, but doesn’t mean I will be signing him.' This, of course, followed some pretty pointed praise for the Milan player but Brendan could not have made his intentions any more clear. How things can move so quickly though. As of Thursday morning there are reports that Balotelli's agent is on the way to England for talks with the club after a fee was agreed. All this in barely 24 hours. VIDEO Scroll down for Pirlo appears unfazed by Balotelli's brilliant freestyling skill . On the floor: Signing the controversial Balotelli could be a risk for Brendan Rodgers' men . Things to come? Our mocked-up picture of Balotelli shows him celebrating in the famous Liverpool shirt . As for Balotelli himself, it's a tough one to fully make a decision on. He's a superb player with unlimited potential and still only 24. For a striker of his ability, record and potential the £16million fee is a snip. But even the most ardent fan would have to admit that there is a very tangible reason why Liverpool would become his fifth professional club of his career - he's often more trouble than he's worth. How else would Italy's No 1, top-class striker be available for less than £20million? From setting off fireworks in his home to training ground fracas, nothing is ever straightforward with Balotelli. One minute he's taking the opposition by storm, the next he's getting sent off. In many ways, Liverpool fans can see parallels between Luis Suarez and Balotelli and depending on how you feel about him that is either a bad thing or enough of a reason to buy him. Personally, I'm torn. On the one hand, he is a star of near endless potential with personal issues, in much the way Suarez was when we signed him. At the time, many had similar reservations, considering he had not long entered a ban for his first biting incident. Parallels: There are similarities between Balotelli and Luis Suarez . Stats: Balotelli's Premier League record (via Opta) On the other hand, Brendan Rodgers has fostered a very unique dressing room atmosphere at Liverpool. One which, only just last season, bore its first fruit when the club challenged for its first title in years. If Rodgers can't get a handle on Balotelli from day one, he could very well cause the club to implode. You also have to consider how young the Liverpool squad is, how many personalities there are that a player like Mario could potentially influence. But does this necessarily have to be a bad thing? Of course not. While I'm torn, there's no denying he's a more attractive option than Samuel Eto'o or Wilfried Bony, both as a player and financially. And while my head says Radamel Falcao is a better option, he is also 28 and for the reported loan fee of £10million for 12 months we could almost fund a permanent move for Balotelli. Perhaps we could take a leaf out of Barca's book and add a clause similar to their reported (although farcical, if true) 'no more biting' clause? Regardless, most Reds seem delirious at the thought and, I admit, as the rumours grow I'm becoming more enamoured of the idea, particularly as he'd still represent a top striker and more importantly a signal of intent.

"By . Chris Foy for The Mail on Sunday . There was not enough of an off-season break — there never is — but Dylan Hartley did his best to escape from rugby on the family farm during the summer, despite Kiwi attempts to keep his mind on the day job. In the aftermath of England’s tour-ending capitulation against the All Blacks in Hamilton in June, Hartley retreated to Rotorua to catch up with relatives and unwind. But New Zealand is not a place to get away from the game, especially on the back of an absorbing Test series. ‘I stayed in New Zealand after the tour to spend time with my family,’ said Hartley as he geared up to lead Northampton’s defence of their Aviva Premiership title in the forthcoming season. Scroll down for video... Saints alive! Dylan Hartley is looking forward to the new Aviva Premiership season with Northampton . Early shower: Dylan Hartley and Luther Burrell (R) give Saints Ben Foden the Ice Bucket Challenge . ‘It was nice to go back to my parents’ farm. Some days I didn’t even leave the farm. I helped out. Every morning you have to feed the cows and stuff like that. ‘For my parents it’s probably a chore because before they can do anything they have to tend to the animals. But I enjoyed it. ‘It was funny because they have this rugby channel in New Zealand and every time I turned the TV on they were playing that last Test (which England lost 36-13). It was on all the time. I kind of avoided that!’ Despite the emphatic nature of that result in the series finale at Waikato Stadium, Stuart Lancaster’s team made a profound impression on the Kiwi rugby public by the manner in which they stood toe-to-toe with the world champions in the first two Tests. Hartley was enthused by the response of people he spoke to after the tour. ‘What was nice for me was when I stayed out in New Zealand, the amount of positive feedback I got from Kiwis,’ he said. ‘I think we raised a few eyebrows out there. Everyone was so complimentary about the way we conducted ourselves and the rugby we played — I think we put them under a bit of pressure. The most disappointing thing was that we did not get a result; not one Test win. If we want to go up the world rankings we need to close games out. ‘That was the review from the summer. We look forward to the World Cup. It is a year out now. It’s crazy, it is all going to happen pretty quickly.’ Humbled: England captain Chris Robshaw (L) talks to Dylan Hartley after the capitulation to New Zealand . For Hartley and the rest of Northampton’s large England contingent, the more pressing priority for now is the defence of their Premiership title, dramatically secured in the last minute of extra-time at Twickenham in May. Soon after that glorious occasion, the hooker and several of his club mates were on their way to Auckland, so there was precious little time for reflection. ‘It all went so quick,’ said Hartley. ‘I didn’t get to enjoy the final as much as some of the other lads because we had to get on a plane and shoot off.’ The time for looking back with satisfaction has surely passed, for now. Hartley returned from New Zealand via California to catch up with the same friends who had provided a haven for him when he was stewing on the ban last year which shattered his Lions ambitions. Fighting spirit: England were commended for how they took the game to New Zealand in the opening two Tests . Since then, an annual trip to the V Festival by Hartley and a group of Saints players served as the ‘last hurrah’ before club hostilities resume against Gloucester at Franklin’s Gardens on September 5. Northampton have opted to consolidate rather than recruit, but the skipper backs that strategy. ‘We are stable and I don’t think we played our best rugby last season,’ he said. ‘There are no excuses about new players coming in.

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . Cheryl Fernandez-Versini is having an easier time of it on this year's X Factor so far - and she's got one woman to thank, Sarah-Jane Crawford. The TV presenter, who is starting her first term on the ITV talent show has become the latest punching bag for the programme's boss, Simon Cowell. The stars have spent the last few weeks together scouring the country for new talent at auditions and Simon has been winding down during breaks from filming... by winding Sarah-Jane up. Sarah-Jane Crawford at the X Factor launch in London earlier this week . Sarah-Jane, 29, said: 'He clocked it immediately - I'm very similar to Cheryl in the sense that it really doesn't take much to wind me up. 'He loves to joke around. 'That's the reason he goes for her too - it doesn't take much to get a reaction. 'My funniest point so far has been when he was pressing my buttons by telling me that even his two dogs Squiddly and Diddly were more popular than me with the general public. 'He did a test by putting a shout out to me on Twitter to all of his followers. 'Then he immediately put a photo of his two dogs  on there and said we'd judge how popular we both were by how many responses they got. 'After a couple of hours when I next bumped into him, he was like, 'So my dogs got this many thousands of favourites and re-tweets, and you got just this many, hmmmmm.' 'It's all good fun though, he has got a great sense of humour and he doesn't mind you joking around back. 'I also get teased over my boyfriend because I'm punching above my weight, the rest of the crew enjoy that one. Running the show: Simon Cowell at the launch of his latest X Factor show at London's Ham Yard hotel on Wednesday . 'Ross (Hardland) has come down onto set a few times and they love him on there, they like to try and wind me up by saying that he's way too good looking for me. 'It's just like a big family there, everyone teases each other and just messes around, but at the same time they are incredibly professional, it's amazing how hard everyone works.' Sarah-Jane has a busy few days ahead of her - as well as preparing for the first X Factor show this weekend, she has to record her BBC Radio 1Xtra show. She is also the face of the new Coppafeel! campaign manithon that is taking place all of today in the capital. Simon Cowell regularly posts pictures of his two dogs Diddly and Squiddly on Twitter . 20 manicure stations have been set up by Birchbox, in partnership with Models Own nail polish, in London's Soho Square. A team of therapists are offering express manicures to the public from 10am-7.30pm - cash goes toward the Coppafeel! charity. And despite having barely enough time to breathe right now, Sarah-Jane signed up to front the event because the cause is close to her heart after being on the end of a breast cancer scare earlier this year when she found a lump in her breast. Fortunately, it turned out to be benign and after an operation to remove it, she is in good health. Sarah-Jane Crawford with her long-term boyfriend Ross Harland at the Chiltern Firehouse in July . But it gave her a scare and made her realise the importance of regular breast checks. She said: 'I would never have even noticed it if I hadn't been asked to pose up checking my boobs for the Coppafeel campaign's Check Em Tuesday - I did that and then I found the lump. 'After tests and an operation, I am now fine and very lucky that it wasn't something more serious, but I want to show girls how important this issue is. Sarah-Jane Crawford taking part in the Birchbox mantihon in aid of Coppafeel! in London's Soho Square today . 'The week I found that lump was one of the most emotionally strained ever because in the same three days I found it, I also went to go and see Simon Cowell to have my first chat about this X Factor job. 'My mum and I were just talking last night about how crazy it is that all happened only a few months ago, now that everything has worked out ok. 'But it just goes to show how important it is to check for lumps - I would never have done it otherwise and if it had been more serious, it could have been much worse for me right now.'

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . Showing off their shoulders in strapless frocks and revealing acres of leg in their micro skirts, the ladies of York proved that they are more than a match for the chilly northern weather today. Despite the odd downpour and the mercury barely touching 13 degrees, racegoers arriving for Ladies Day at York Races had pulled out all the stops as they went for a win in the style stakes - goose bumps or not. But while the short skirts and strappy tops might have proved less than practical, the gorgeous array of hats bedecked with silk blooms and ribbons on show certainly helped to brighten things up. Scroll down for video . Enjoying the day: Four beautifully dressed racegoers show off their style nous courtesy of pretty shift dresses and huge hats as they arrive in York for the races . Colourful: A lady arrives in a cheerful buttercup yellow and aqua blue ensemble while another plumps for pretty summer florals accessorised with delicate pearls . Hats you win: The vogue for elaborate hats has spread beyond the borders of Berkshire and proved just as popular with racegoers at York as it did at Ascot . York is currently hosting the Yorkshire Ebor Festival, one of the biggest events on the racing calendar, which attracts vast amounts of prize money and some of the best horses, jockeys and trainers in the world. Like its southern counterparts Ascot, Cheltenham and Goodwood, the meet also includes a Ladies Day with a top prize of a short break for two in the Emirati city of Dubai for the best dressed racegoer. As a result, the local ladies pulled out all the stops, with colourful shift dresses in summery apricot, peach and crimson, and sky high platform heels among the most popular choices. Others opted for short and sweet ensembles, with one lady plumping for a bright pink dress cut daringly low at the front and accessorised with a pair of bright white platform shoes. But while goose bumps were the accessory most frequently spotted, beautiful hats weren't far behind with top titfers bedecked with glamorous silk roses and impressively large plumes in evidence. Bold choice: A lady arrives wearing an ensemble composed of sunset hues such as delicate shimmering apricot and punchy cerise on her day out at the York races . Daring: Some of the racegoers arriving opted for more daring ensembles, despite temperatures of just 13 degrees, among them this lady in her pink frock . Different choices: Monochrome, a perennial favourite, was very much in evidence at York (left) as, indeed, were summery brights - a racing season staple this summer . Stylish: A pair of glamorous racegoers demonstrate their eye for a good hat, with one opting for delicate silk roses, while the other plumps for an eclectic mixed bouquet . Although racegoers watching from the paddock aren't required to follow a set dress code, those enjoying the races from the County Stand are encouraged to dress up by race organisers. Like the Ascot style police, those at York say that gentlemen should wear 'a jacket, collared shirt and tie' and complete the look with 'smart trousers and formal shoes'. Ladies, meanwhile, are only advised to avoid jeans and trainers, although organisers do warn that 'common sense restrictions' and 'taste and decency' apply to all areas of the racecourse. With none falling foul of York's style police, racegoers had plenty of time to devote to watching the action while doing their best to keep warm and dodge lurking showers. On the course, highlights included the Pinsent Masons Lowther Stakes, which was taken by Irish filly Tiggy Wiggy, and the Clipper Logistics Handicap, the favourite for which was Russian Realm, a horse educated by the Queen's trainer, Sir Michael Stoute. Dazzling: A lady goes for gold in a statement black hat and a cream frock lavishly embellished with sparkling rhinestone beads, accessorised with a pair of huge earrings . Striking: A racegoer in a bold ensemble of a royal blue shift dress and a contrasting mustard hat enlivened with feathers arrives for the races in York . Pink ladies: A racegoer is glamorous in a dusty pink ensemble and enormous hat while another opts for pretty summer florals and a sensible pashmina shawl . Good time: A pair of racegoers brave the chilly 13 degree weather as they arrive sporting strappy dresses, fascinators and lashings of fake tan on their day out at York . Aintree might have the world's biggest race in the shape of the Grand National but York is just as prestigious and like its Liverpudlian competitor, has plenty to offer in the style stakes. Both Aintree and York offer relatively relaxed dress codes compared to Ascot, which has become famous in recent years for its exhaustively detailed style guides, and Cheltenham. As at Aintree, York is a hotbed of northern glamour with short skirts and sky high heels regularly spotted in and around the paddock. Colourful hats are a more recent innovation, although as today's event demonstrates, the ladies of York know a thing or two when it comes to buying hats. Indeed, with the majority of ladies arriving dressed to kill, organisers have decided it is male racegoers who require a bigger nudge, with most of the rules in the brief style guide applying to them . 'Racegoers at York like to make it a . special occasion and choose to dress accordingly,' it reads. 'Gentlemen are required . to wear a jacket, collared shirt and tie in County Stand. Most . gentlemen would choose to wear smart trousers and formal shoes to . complete the look. 'So whilst there is no formal restriction on wearing . jeans and trainers, these are rarely seen in the County Stand. In a . similar vein, whilst we encourage a sense of style in the County Stand, . if gentlemen believe the weather warrants shorts then there is no formal . restriction to them being worn. 'In Grandstand and Paddock and . Course Enclosure the dress code is more relaxed - shorts and t-shirts are . worn by racegoers enjoying  the sun. The only common sense restrictions . would be those of taste and decency which would apply to all areas, for . example regarding style and slogan t-shirts. Bare chests are not . acceptable.' Dressed for the weather: While the majority of racegoers opted for delicate ensembles that looked rather cold, others came prepared in warm coats and jumpers . Dressed . to the nines: Bright colours and high heels proved popular choices . among the ladies flocking to York for a day of racing at the Yorkshire . Ebor Festival . Stunning: The Ebor Festival has already seen some of racing's hottest names appear on the course, among them Australia who took victory on day one .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . These hypnotic flashes over Italy are unlike any lightning storm you’ve ever seen before. The stunning Vine was captured by astronaut Reid Wiseman as he looked down on Earth from his 150 mile (250km) vantage point on the ISS. It shows the awesome power of the storm lighting up the country and, according to the post yesterday, left Wiseman ‘speechless.’ Vine is a mobile service that creates short looping videos which are six seconds or less. In an interview last year with MailOnline, former Commander of the ISS, Chris Hadfield said that lightning shows were one of the best parts watching Earth from the ISS. ‘Imagine you’re lying in bed, with your eyes closed, and there is this tremendous light show coming through your eyes that keeps exploding,’ he said, describing an immense storm over Indonesia. ‘It looked as if someone with a fat paint brush was swiping it over the Earth for about 500 miles, this great bright light, and it was continuous, back and forth…If there had been gravity, my jaw would have dropped.’ In June, the 38-year-old made history by becoming the first ISS crew member to send a Vine from space. The short timelapse condensed a 92-minute orbit into the span of around six seconds showing the space station hurtling around the planet at 17,500 mph (27,600 km/h). The sun never sets in the Vine because the space station's orbit comes into alignment with something known as the day and night ‘terminator’ line. But it seems lightning is one of Wiseman’s favourite phenomenon’s to film as he looks down on the planet.

"By . James Chapman . and Becky Barrow . Updated: . 12:33 EST, 29 November 2011 . Ed Miliband today repeated his refusal . to condemn strike action, despite describing their action as causing . 'terrible' disruption. The Labour leader's refusal to denounce the strikes follows last week's revelations that almost 90 per cent of his party's funding now comes from unions. But in the strongest ministerial attack on the unions for a generation, Education Secretary Michael Gove blamed the strike on ‘militants’ who were ‘itching for a fight’ – and warned more than nine in ten schools will be closed as a result of tomorrow’s walkout of up to two million workers. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, left, refused to condemn public sector workers set to stage walk outs  over cuts to pensions and services. Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove, however, blamed the strike on 'militants' Hardline trade union leaders were . yesterday accused of a deliberate attempt to sabotage the economic . recovery as they threatened a programme of industrial action to continue . throughout next year. ‘They want scenes of industrial strife on our TV screens, they want to make economic recovery harder, they want to provide a platform for confrontation just when we all need to pull together,’ Mr Gove said. Officials confirmed that troops and uniformed police officers will be drafted in to help maintain the security of Britain’s borders when immigration staff join the walkout over public sector pension reforms. Miliband said today he 'hated' the . effects of the strike, including closed schools and cancelled . operations, but would not condemn the action. Referring . to a headteacher he had seen on ITV Daybreak, Mr Miliband said: 'He and . many of his colleagues feel that they have been put in an impossible . position by the Government because the Government has stopped . negotiating over these public sector pensions. 'They . are imposing - and I don't think most people recognise this yet - a 3 . per cent tax rise on some of the lowest paid workers in the country, not . actually to help them with their pension but to help pay off the . deficit. 'Of course we have to pay off the deficit but to target public sector workers in the way that they have been doing is not fair. 'So the disruption is terrible but I am not going to condemn those who have taken this decision.' Airlines have cancelled some flights in and out of Heathrow tomorrow in anticipation of queues of up to 12 hours at passport controls. Dave Prentis, leader of public sector trade union Unison, said there was ‘absolutely no chance’ of reaching a deal in the next few days, claiming: ‘It could be the biggest action since the 1926 General Strike.’ Everybody out: Workers march through central Bristol this summer. Public sector workers have been warned that a pensions offer will be withdrawn if there is no agreement by the end of the year . As David Cameron warned union leaders . their protest was futile, Mr Gove said he did not know of any pension . scheme in the private sector that would match the deal being offered to . public sector workers. He . said it was ‘unfair and unrealistic’ to expect taxpayers to keep on . footing the bill for pension schemes of which private sector workers can . only dream, warning: ‘If we don’t reach agreement, then change will . have to be imposed.’ ‘Among those union leaders are people . who fight hard for their members and whom I respect. But there are also . hardliners – militants itching for a fight,’ Mr Gove said. ‘They want families to be . inconvenienced. They want mothers to give up a day’s work, or pay for . expensive childcare, because schools will be closed. 'They want teachers . and other public sector workers to lose a day’s pay in the run-up to . Christmas.’ Mr Gove singled out Mark Serwotka, . head of the biggest civil service union PCS, and Unite’s Len McCluskey . and Andrew Murray as union leaders for whom ‘militant is a badge that . fits’. He also signalled the Government is . considering changes to strike laws to give headteachers more notice of . whether they would be able to keep their schools open. At present, individuals are not . obliged to inform their school that they intend to join the walkout . until the day of the industrial action. Mr Prentis said tomorrow’s action . would be the start of a devastating series of walkouts, with ‘further . action in the new year’ if the Government does not back down. In all, 29 unions are taking part in the one-day walkout, having balloted about 2.6million members. But any further action could escalate . if the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing . decide to take part. Their members are not taking action tomorrow, but . both unions have suggested strike ballots remain an option. A PCS spokesman dismissed government claims made on Monday that leader Mr Serwotka had not engaged properly in negotiations. Public . sector pensions amount to a risky ‘Madoff-style pyramid’ because they . are unfunded to the tune of billions of pounds, a think-tank warned last . night. U.S. fraudster . Bernie Madoff was jailed for a scheme which paid investors out of money . given by future investors, rather than money that had already been . earned through profit. In . an article in the journal of the Association of Consulting Actuaries, . the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) described the public sector pensions . framework as a pyramid scheme similar to that run by Madoff because not . enough money is coming in to cover the sums due to go out. A . CPS study forecasts the gap will be £8billion by 2014-15 and will rise. Author Michael Johnson said: ‘With what is on the table, the 20 per . cent of the workforce in the public sector will continue to enjoy . certainty of income in retirement – that does not exist for the other 80 . per cent.’ Prime Minister David Cameron's . official spokesman told reporters at a regular daily press briefing: 'Our position throughout has been . that to go ahead with a strike when talks are ongoing - and they are . ongoing - is irresponsible. 'Our view is that the offer we have . put on the table is a good one and a fair one, both for public sector . workers and for taxpayers.' Widespread disruption is expected. The spokesman confirmed that a message . has been sent out to Whitehall civil servants - including staff at 10 . Downing Street - asking them whether they will be able to help provide . cover for striking border officials at airports and ports, but declined . to go into details about what the response was. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said it was increasingly . clear that militant union leaders had ‘set off down this path months . ago’ and were determined to press ahead regardless of what the . Government offered or the miserable turnouts in strike ballots. He . said: ‘This is a very irresponsible set of strikes. Britain, at a very . fragile time in its economy, is going to be dealt a serious blow if . these strikes go ahead in the way that has been described. ‘What . we’ve said from the absolute outset when we put this new offer on the . table, which is a generous offer, is that most people in the workforce . in the private sector would give their eye teeth to have a pension . scheme as good as what these will continue to be. ‘We . have said there needs to be agreement on the main elements by the end . of this year, and if there isn’t we absolutely reserve the right to take . those elements off the table.’ Meanwhile, Chancellor George Osborne accused Labour of inflaming the situation by peddling ‘misinformation’. ‘Ed . Balls was saying that people earning under £15,000 are having to pay . more. We’ve explicitly excluded people on very low salaries from paying . more contributions for their pensions,’ he said. ‘What . I am trying to do is give them a good, decent pension for many, many . years to come – much better than you could get if you were in the . private sector.’","Education Secretary says hardliners are 'itching for a fight'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida prosecutor has revealed that a friend of one of the Boston marathon suspects threatened an FBI agent and a Massachusetts state trooper with a long pole before being fatally shot in self defense . Ibragim Todashev, 27, had apparently confessed that he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the elder of the two Chechen brothers who planned the fatal bombing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, had also been involved in an unsolved 2011 triple murder. State Attorney Jeff Ashton said in a report Tuesday the agent was justified in shooting Todashev last May. Scroll down for video . Final moments: Ibragim Todashev (pictured) admitted to having been involved in an unsolved 2011 triple homicide along with Tamerlan Tsarnaev before being shot by FBI agents . Questioning: The FBI and Florida state prosecutor had remained tight-lipped in relation to the May 2013 shooting until their final report was released today, explaining the questioning of Todashev (pictured) Damage: A report released Tuesday shows the injury an FBI agent sustained during the May altercation (left) and the blood left on the agent's shirt (right) Killed: Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot and killed by FBI agents in May, more than a month after the Boston Marathon bombing . The agent and the trooper were questioning Todashev about his involvement in a triple slaying in Waltham, Massachusetts. Todashev was preparing a written statement confessing some involvement when he threw a coffee table on the officers and ran past them. The report says Todashev was searching for something in his kitchen, and he returned carrying a pole over his head. The Boston Globe reports that he was then shot seven times by the agent. The report released Tuesday was the first official filing that gives details of the killing that happened 10 months ago. The FBI agent fired three or four shots at Todashev, a mixed martial arts fighter, as he advanced on the trooper and Todashev dropped to his knees but then lunged at the officer. The FBI agent fired three or four more shots, the report said. 'The one common thread among all was the observation that he was, at his core, a fearless fighter,' Ashton said. Cleared: Florida prosecutors have chosen not to pursue charges against FBI agents involved in the killing (seen in May after his death) The brothers Tsarnaev: Tamerlan (left) died in a gunbattle with police in the days after the Boston bombing and Dzhokhar (right) faces 30 federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty . Scene: The one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing is approaching next month . Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011 . 'Perhaps on this occasion, he simply reverted to that basic aspect of his personality and chose to go down fighting.' In . the Waltham case, three men were found in an apartment with their necks . slit and their bodies reportedly covered with marijuana. One of the victims was a boxer and friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the suspects in last year's Boston marathon bombing. Tsarnaev and Todashev were friends from their days when Todashev lived in Boston. Todashev's . family have raised doubts about the account provided by law . enforcement, saying that Todashev was recovering from knee surgery and . was limping at the time he was killed. Hassan . Shibly, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations . in Tampa, which is conducting its own investigation into the fatal . shooting, said Ashton's investigative focus was very narrow. 'It's very important that this isn't whether the agent was justified in shooting,' Shibly said. 'It's . about the pattern of abuse that occurred before, during and after the . questioning. That won't be covered in a criminal investigation.'

They will use just any old blood vessel. Some will end up loosing an arm, another needs an operation, some may even lose their lives.'

No contest: A comparison of Mr de Souza's biceps muscle with those of a young passer-by . 'The women around here and in other places admire him,' said Mr de Souza's brother Adriano, 56 . Injecting site enhancement oils carry the risk of infection and of abscesses developing in the muscle. These abbesses can grow and spread within the tissue. Some users, when operated on, have been found to have arms full of pus and oil. Mr de Souza has fears for his own health and has visited a clinic for help. But medics have so far refused to operate because 'he did it to himself'. Mr de Souza said: 'If I get ill, if my arms burst, that's when I can go and see the doctor. But for me that's normal and something I've accepted.' Since he began injecting two years ago, he has become the talk of the town, to the horror of his family. His sister Marineide Gomes de Souza said the family were 'extremely worried' about him but still hoped he would settle down and have a family. 'He is a good person, not a bad person. He is really friendly and does lots of favours for people,' she said. 'But there are some people who make fun of him. There are some people who find it interesting. And there are some people who think he is from another planet.' But his brother Adriano Josi Jordco de Souza, 56, said the beefcake look is not without its advantages, especially so in its appeal to women. 'The women around here and in other places admire him. They think he looks nice,' he said. Younger days: A photo of Mr de Souza, aged 21, showing his biceps at a swimming pool in Olinda, Brazil, in 1993 .

The oil concoction Mr de Souza injected is believed to contain mostly mineral oil, which is similar to baby oil but unscented, and smaller amounts of alcohol and anaesthetic. Worryingly, he has said it can easily be bought online or under-the-counter at rogue pharmacies. And, though he has stopped using and warns others to stay away from it, he says it is continuing to sweep across body-conscious Brazil and South America. 'To get a body like mine, it is very difficult if you are not taking anything. Some people take it but won't admit it,' he said. 'Have you ever seen a guy as big as me claiming it is natural? He is lying, I tell you. At least I tell the truth. 'It stopped for a bit because it was becoming too visible. But they are still using it, only they are using it undercover.'","Arlindo de Souza risks serious infection or even death for his look .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Worms could be used to fight a range of debilitating autoimmune diseases, research has revealed. A molecule in parasitic worms may be used to fight illnesses including multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Scientists identified peptides - naturally occurring biological molecules - from the creatures that suppress a body’s immune response, and they believe it could pave the way for a new drug to provide relief from the often painful symptoms of such diseases. Scientists have identified peptides - naturally occurring biological molecules - from parasitic worms (illustrated) that suppress the body’s immune response, which could pave the way for a new drug to provide relief from the symptoms of autoimmune diseases . There are hopes that a molecule in parasitic worms could fight autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Scientists have identified a peptide from the worms to suppress the body’s immune response. Called AcK1, the peptide dampens the immune system by inhibiting a potassium channel (Kv1.3). They discovered that AcK1 closely resembles ShK, a peptide from a sea anemone, which has been shown to suppress autoimmune diseases and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. AcK1 could be an ingredient in a future ‘worm pill’. The pill could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy, which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms in a bid to force their autoimmune disease into remission. Rare autoimmune diseases affect over 100,000 people in the UK, with many more suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, for example. They occur when a person’s immune system has an abnormal response against its own cells, tissues or even entire organs, resulting in inflammation and damage. Scientists are unsure exactly what causes the body to turn in on itself, but diagnoses are rocketing in the West. ‘There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases, ranging in severity from mild to life threatening in some cases, and while some affect mainly one area or organ, others can affect many parts of the body,’ said Professor Ray Norton from Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mips) in Australia. ‘Many people believe there’s a link between the rise in autoimmune diseases and an increased focus on cleanliness in Western societies, because the immune system is no longer exposed to the broad range of infections that previous generations had to deal with. A ‘worm pill’ (illustrated) could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy, which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms to force their autoimmune disease into remission . ‘There could be some truth to this because worm infection is virtually unheard of in developed countries, yet the incidence of autoimmune diseases is high. But in developing countries the opposite is true.’ A ‘worm pill’ could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy, which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms in a bid to force their autoimmune disease into remission. The study, published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (Faseb) Journal, said that some experts think the worms have a calming effect on their host's immune systems in order to ensure their survival. A ‘worm pill’ may be off putting to some people, so the researchers have isolated the active components responsible for immunomodulatory effects - the treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response - in parasitic worms. They created a DNA library from the secretory glands of the Ancylostoma caninium parasitic hookworm.

Dr Sandeep Chhabra from the university, said the study will help in developing new drugs to treat autoimmune diseases. ‘Our research shows that it is possible to identify individual molecules responsible for this beneficial effect,’ he said. ‘The next step will be to see if we can develop this into a pill that could dampen the immune system in people with an autoimmune disease. That’s a whole lot cleaner than putting a worm in your body.’","A molecule in parasitic worms could fight autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus .

"By . Rehema Figueiredo For Mailonline . While most of us have given up on our summer diets and started layering up for the chillier months, there's no rest for Britain's fittest women, who all say exercise saved them when they were at their lowest ebb. A nationwide search by Women's Health magazine for 'The Body 2014' found women who aren't just committed gym bunnies - but also converts to the positive emotional effects of exercise. The competition was judged by Olympic Champion Cyclist Victoria Pendleton, Dancer Kimberly Wyatt, Women's Health Editor Farrah Storr and Fitness Model Nathalie Schyllert who were looking for women who had achieved their bodies in a way that was realistic, balanced and inspiring. Stevie Hartley, a beautician from Harlow, struggled with post-natal depression but discovered work out DVDs . 22-year-old Stevie Hartley, a  beautician from Harlow, also triumphed over thousands of entrants to be selected, as well as battling with post-natal depression. Stevie embraced exercise as much for its mental benefits as the physical effects. 'I wanted to pull myself out of the hole. So when I saw an advert for the Insanity workout DVDs, I phoned up immediately. At first, it was so hard – after each session, my muscles were burning.' 'But I started seeing results in two weeks. I dropped a dress size and saw amazing definition in my stomach and legs that it spurred me on. It helped to clear my mind, too.' Jennifer Prosser, a 27-year-old beautician from Didsbury, works out with her newborn baby Madison . Jennifer Prosser, a 27-year-old beautician from Didsbury, reached the final five despite gaining 2st when she was pregnant with her first child. She says: 'It was important for me to get back in shape. It took three months to lose the baby weight – but I did it gradually and sensibly.' Just four weeks after giving birth to daughter Madison she was back in the gym hitting the treadmill and says she is now fitter than she was before giving birth. Jennifer says: 'Each morning, I’ll do squats and hold Madison out in front of me – she’ll giggle while I do it. I push myself harder because I only have an hour to work out. But the payoff has been immense. My whole body is stronger than it was, pre-baby.' Marcia Copertino's whole life was chaos after her divorce but hitting the gym helped her to regain confidence . Finalist Marcia Copertino, a 32-year-old bar manager from Glasgow, found exercise helped her to get through her divorce. She says: “I walked away with nothing – no money (he’d always taken control of our finances, so I didn’t even have a bank account); no self-esteem and no idea of my future. I slept on friends’ couches while I saved enough money from the bar job I’d taken to get back on my feet.” Joining the gym helped her to regain confidence and find fulfillment. 'Exercise was what made me happy. So I hit the gym almost every day, cramming in a few hours of cardio and weights in between bar shifts. As my physical strength grew, so too did my mental health.' 'It’s taken three years to get my body looking like this – but it’s more than that. Exercise has given me a confidence I never thought was possible. It’s helped me channel all the pain I felt into a positive force. It has been my salvation.' Maya Basse, 26, had insecurities about her body as a teenager so took charge and started to love her shape . Maya Basse, a 26-year-old primary school teacher from London, was also selected as a finalist in the competition. As a teenager growing up in Australia she hated her body, which was the result of long-distance running with her father. as a teenager left Maya with a body she loathed. 'All my friends were quite skinny. They could wear anything they wanted, while I struggled to find clothes to fit. I blamed my body for that.' After moving to the UK and going through a painful break up Maya joined the gym to motivate herself. 'I hit the weights and began to balance out my shape. As my strength grew, so too did my confidence. Working out, and starting to love my shape again was the one thing that kept me sane through those first lonely months in a new country. I honestly believe I would have given up and gone home if it weren’t for fitness. It’s truly changed my life.' PR director Natalia Bojanic's lifestyle was too hectic to find time to exercise but now she even chooses her holidays based on her fitness routine . Natalia Bojanic, 31, struggled to fit in exercise when her life became a haze of drinks, parties and long hours due to her work in communications. 'I tried to fit in exercise when I could, and eat on the hop, but I found it tough. Two years ago, my dinner and canape-filled lifestyle finally got to me, so I got back in to my fitness and rejoined a gym.' Even her holiday choices and social life are dictated by her new found enthusiasm for exercise. 'When I go on holiday, I choose somewhere I can go hiking, sailing or playing beach volleyball. That way, I never lose momentum. Or if I’m working late at an event I always eat before I go, so I’m not tempted by the delicious – but unhealthy – food on offer and I’ll have just one glass of champagne and savour it.'

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Updated: . 18:29 GMT, 23 February 2012 . A sensitive debate over gay sex in India was thrown into farce today after a government lawyer urged the Supreme Court to ban it - only for the Home Ministry to quickly issue a contradictory statement hours later. Television channels reported that the lawyer may have gotten confused and read out the wrong statement in front of the Supreme Court which reflected an old government opinion. Additional Solicitor General PP Malhotra told the court that 'gay sex is highly immoral and against social order and there is high chance of spreading of diseases through such acts,' the Press Trust of India reported. Conflicting views: Additional Solicitor General PP Malhotra initially told the Indian Supreme Court (above) that gay sex was 'highly immoral' but was quickly contradicted by the government . But the Home Ministry was forced to . issue a clarification saying it accepts a ruling by the Delhi High Court . in 2009 which struck down a colonial-era law making sex between people . of the same gender punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The . statement said that the Cabinet had decided not to challenge the ruling . and that the ministry 'has not taken any position on homosexuality'. Conservative . groups have asked the top court to overturn the lower court's order, . and Supreme Court judges are currently hearing opinions from a range of . people - including conservative groups and gay rights activists. Gay . rights activists celebrated the 2009 ruling, hoping it would be . followed by courts across the nation and end widespread police . harassment and lead to gradual acceptance for homosexuals in this deeply . conservative country. Chaos: Homosexual rights supporters take part in the Gay Pride Parade in New Delhi in 2010. Many will be left confused by today's events in which the government appeared to announce differing views on laws allowing gay sex . The high court had said that treating consensual gay sex between adults as a crime was a violation of fundamental rights protected by India's constitution. Sex between people of the same gender had been illegal in India since the 1860s when a British colonial law classified it as 'against the order of nature'. While actual criminal prosecutions were few, the law frequently was used to harass people. Over the last decade, homosexuals have slowly gained a degree of acceptance in some parts of India, especially its big cities. Many bars have gay nights, and some high-profile Bollywood films have dealt with gay issues. The last two years have also seen large gay pride parades in New Delhi and other big cities, including Mumbai and Kolkata. Still, being gay remains deeply taboo in most of the country, and many homosexuals hide their sexual orientation from friends and relatives.",Home Ministry forced into rapid clarification .
"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . and Bianca London for MailOnline . Many men shy away from the yoga studio, dismissing it as 'too feminine and spiritual'. But a new, 'manlier' form of the exercise loved by Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has just launched to help British men tone up by practising it alongside their regular fitness regimes. 'Yoga is not just for girls,'  its creator Matt Miller, a college American football star turned bodybuilder and nutrition expert, tells Men's Fitness magazine. 'Every athlete needs to incorporate elements of stretching and lengthening into their programme.' Broga creator Matt Miller says broga works for every athlete and helps incorporate stretching into their fitness regimes . Miller learned that the hard way, dealing with injuries from years of running, colliding and lifting that left him with what he calls a 'severely limited' range of motion. He discovered yoga after signing on as an ambassador with clothing brand Lululemon - and soon started to wonder why he'd never done it before. Combining his studies with his own personal training experience, he created broga, a style designed to counteract everything from your desk hunch to your sofa-slouch - while emphasising moves that build upper-body strength and stability. It's now being taught at locations around southeast England, with more trainers and locations being created on a near-monthly basis. And no, it isn't only for men. 'We get quite a few ladies at the classes,' says Miller. 'Most of them are looking for a no-nonsense style that will build strength alongside flexibility.' And that's where this plan comes in. It's designed to work alone, but can also be incorporated into your regular regime - after all, flexibility is everything - and can be done up to four days a week. Progress at your own level, and resist the urge to go for the hardest possible version of each move on the first go. This is about preventing injuries, not chasing them. Side triangle: Start in a lunge with your back foot at a 45 degree angle and all the weight on your front foot, with your front knee directly over your front foot - this is great for your back . After the strength portion of each workout, you'll move on to stretches that open up the areas you've just worked. Don't skip them. 'Try to progress further each time,' advises Miller. 'You'll learn to establish connections that open up typically tight areas like the chest, hips, and hamstrings.' Most importantly, give it time to work. Broga isn't designed as a quick fix - you've spent years (or possibly decades) creating imbalances in your body, so expecting to fix them with a week's worth of downward dog is optimistic at best. Stick with the plan for a month and you should find you're more flexible than ever - and more than equipped to try your hand at a class if you want to. And no, you still don't need to buy any patchouli oil. Personal trainer Jack Braniff added: 'Broga helps with your mobility, flexibility, strength, core, balance and also an increased blood flow to your muscles, all which can help with weight loss. 'Increased mobility, in particularly hip and shoulder will see a marked improvement in your big lifts, full ROM (range of motion) squats, deadlifts, overhead press etc and especially the Olympic lifts. All tools to get massive. 'Likewise, certain sequences and asanas are great for warm-ups and cool downs before training. 'Pro cycling teams for instance, use sun salutations before their rides, something I also use before my sessions. 'Although the breathing and chanting does have it's place to help calm, you take what you want from yoga, and in my case it's a more structured way to improve my mobility and help with my other gym activities, not to meditate.' MATT MILLER'S TOP BROGA MOVES (the first two in each section are the exercises and numbers three and four are the stretches) Enjoy! BACK . 1. One-leg updog/split .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Three University of Purdue students have been accused of hacking into their professors' computers and changing their grades - even improving one A grade to an A+. Roy Chaoran Sun, an electrical engineering student, and Mitsutoshi Shirasaki, an aeronautics and astronautics major from Japan, allegedly boosted dozens of grades between 2008 and 2012. A third student, 24-year-old Sujay Sharma, a nuclear engineering major, has been accused of changing one of his grades and acting as a look out. Arrested: Roy Sun, left, allegedly changed nine F grades to As after hacking into his professors' computer accounts. Sujay Sharma, right, allegedly changed one grade, while another student changed 24 . 'This was… students who were very smart, . who decided to take their knowledge and their wisdom and used it for . things they shouldn't have used it for,' Purdue Police Chief John Cox . told the Indiana Journal and Courier. 'Obviously, there will be consequences for that.' Sun, 24, allegedly changed his grades from May 2008 until he graduated in 2010, according to the affidavit. His grades were changed from nine Fs and one incomplete to straight As. Shirasaki, also 24, allegedly changed 24 grades between May 2010 and December 2012, changing some from fails to As and Bs. Bizarrely, he even changed two As for classes in Japanese and aeronautics and astronautics . engineering to A pluses. Sharma allegedly changed just one engineering grade from a D to an A, the affidavit states. Scene: The students were caught after a professor discovered his passwords had been changed . The Journal and Courier detailed the intricate plot the men allegedly carried out in order to boost their grades. Shirasaki told authorities that Sun taught him how to access the accounts; they broke into the offices overnight and switched keyboards with identical ones, according to the affidavit. The switched keyboards contained key logging devices and when the students allegedly swapped them back again, they were able to figure out the professors' passwords. Their alleged plot was discovered when an engineering professor contacted the IT security services department as his password had been changed. It happened in November and again in December. IT officials learned that the professor's account was used to change a student's grade and they contacted police in January. Plot: The men allegedly switched their professors' keyboards with others fitted with key logging devices. When they switched the keyboards again, they were able to figure out the passwords . Shirasaki was identified as the suspect as he was logged into the university's wireless network under his own . account when he allegedly hacked into the professor's account to change a grade. Sharma and Sun have been arrested but Shirasaki is in Japan, Harrington said. They face a string of charges including conspiracy to commit computer tampering, conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to commit computer trespass. Sharma posted a combined $5,000 surety and $5,000 cash bond. Sun remains in jail on a combined $125,000 surety and $125,000 cash bond. He is now a graduate student at Boston University and police are contacting officials there.

'There has . been a lot of people speculating but I hope in the end the police find . who was responsible.’ Zaid was questioned by detectives at a . Surrey police station yesterday after being arrested at his flat in . Chessington at 7.30am. The arrest is the first significant . development in the inquiry. Around 100 police officers in Britain and . France have been tasked with investigating the killings, and they have . focused on three lines of inquiry: Saad’s work as an engineer, his links . to his native Iraq and the alleged family feud. Zaid was questioned by French police . in March over the alleged inheritance dispute. The men’s father, who was . Iraqi, died in Spain two years ago, leaving several properties and . hundreds of thousands of pounds in the Geneva account. Saad had hired lawyers to block the . will until the dispute had been resolved. Mr Maillaud, Annecy’s public . prosecutor, claimed Zaid had attempted to fabricate his father’s will in . his favour. ‘It looks like he tried to take the . fortune for himself,’ Mr Maillaud said. ‘Formal and written evidence . leaves no doubt about the very violent family dispute that pitted the . two brothers on the issue of the inheritance of their father.’ Statement: French prosecutor Eric Maillaud confirmed the arrest of Zaid Al-Hilli but said, 'It does not confirm his guilt' Peaceful spot: Walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of Chevaline where the Al-Hillis were murdered . Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, were laid to rest in the same grave last year . Mr Maillaud said the ‘family dispute . is so colossal’ it would take investigators two years to go through the . legal papers, in English, Arabic, Spanish and Swedish. ‘Based on letters we found and . conversations he [Saad] had, he feared for his life,’ Mr Maillaud . added. ‘In these letters he expressed his worry for his life due to his . desire to recover his father’s fortune and the conflict it caused with . his family. That fear was there.’ Saad Al Hilli kept a Taser at his home in Claygate, Surrey and had . changed the locks of the £1million property (pictured) Funeral: Zaad Al-Hilli (pictured centre with his palms open) with mourners at the funeral of his brother in Queens Park, London last year . Saad reportedly kept a Taser stun gun . at his £1million home in Claygate, Surrey, and changed the locks before . he went on holiday. The extent of the alleged feud was . laid bare in a letter Saad wrote to a childhood friend a year before his . murder. He said he and his brother were no longer speaking, adding: ‘He . tried a lot of underhand things even when my father was alive. He tried . to take control of father’s assets.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Zaid Al-Hilli was today held by Surrey Police in connection to the shooting .

"By . William Turvill . A German biathlete and an Italian bobsledder have been thrown out of the Winter Olympics after both testing positive for banned substances. Italian officials announced that . bobsledder William Frullani tested positive for the substance . dymetylpentylamine, also found in nasal decongestants, and has left the . village. The head of Germany’s Olympic body, meanwhile, announced tonight that former two-time Olympic gold medalist Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle was removed from the team after testing positive for a banned stimulant in two samples. German biathlete Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle (left) and Italian bobsledder William Frullani (right) have been thrown out of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, after both testing positive for banned substances . She blames the test on a nutritional supplement, saying she never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs. Michael Vesper, chief of German Olympic body DOSB, said the news rocked the German Olympic team. ‘Of course we were shocked by the news and the mood in our Olympic team was clearly very bad. We are absolutely in favour of team sport and against any kind of manipulation,’ he said. ‘This is why - before the games and during the games - we took action. We also acted quickly and decisively now in accordance with the athletes' agreement, an agreement that we have concluded with Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle.’ Italian officials, meanwhile, said they had got the green light from the International Olympic Committee to replace Frullani in their four-man bobsleigh team with the competition starting on Saturday. ‘The Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) now needs to sort out the composition of the bobsleigh team which Frullani was part of, to make it back up to four,’ CONI said in a statement. ‘They have requested that the athlete be replaced with the reserve Samuele Romanini and clearance for this has been received from the IOC.’ Flavio Roda, the president of the Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI), condemned Frullani for showing a ‘lack of respect to his team mates’. This photograph shows Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle in action at the Sochi Games this month . ‘It is a great disappointment because these are things that shouldn't happen in sport and also because our federation has always condemned doping,’ he said. ‘We still have to see what exactly happened. It is a bit premature to give a judgement, but what is for sure is that what is being done by this athlete is unacceptable. ‘I don't know exactly what this product is. It is a product which doesn't enhance your output so it is even more annoying because it makes me think “how stupid”. ‘If someone looks for something that is not natural to enhance their ability we need to condemn this in any way we can, and as a federation we can only condemn what he has done.’ Until Friday, Russia's first Winter Games had not had a positive doping case.","Italian officials announced that bobsledder William Frullani tested positive for the substance dymetylpentylamine and has left the Olympic village .

"'It is truly dreadful,' says etiquette expert Gill Harbord . By . Sadie Whitelocks . While you're busy in the kitchen slaving away over a hot stove do you ever wonder what your dinner party guests are doing in the room next door? Well according to new research they could be busy sifting through your worldly possessions in a bid to find something they were never meant to see. One in ten of those surveyed admitted to snooping through personal goods belonging to a friend while waiting for food to be served. A scene from the British TV show Come Dine With Me - a contest to see who can throw the best dinner party . Experts now believe that British etiquette is in danger of a becoming lost art as poking around uninvited wasn't the only offense committed. More than a quarter (28 per cent) said they regularly turned up at friend's house without a gift, 17 per . cent took to swearing in front of their host and 13 per cent lit . cigarettes, despite not smoking in their own homes. Just 15 per cent of men admit they offer . to wash the dishes when visiting a friend or family member, while over a . quarter of women (27 per cent) were more than happy to help out where they could. As a result of poor behaviour, seven per cent of hosts revealed that they had fallen out with friends. If you have been invited to a dinner party make sure you RSVP promptly (mentioning any dietary requirements you may have). If you can't make it you'll be giving the host plenty of time to find someone else. If you have to cancel, give as much notice as possible.Never arrive early to a dinner party. A few minutes after the time stated on the invitation is polite; if you are going to be more than 15 minutes late phone ahead and warn your host.It is polite to take a gift; chocolates, flowers, or a bottle of wine are all good choices. Take a couple of bottles if there are two of you. Always write a thank you note as soon as possible after the event; phone call is also fine for casual evenings. A reciprocal invitation should follow where appropriate. SOURCE: www.debretts.com . Gill Harbord, etiquette expert and . Ladette to Ladies headmistress, said: 'The idea that guests set out to . go on a self-guided tour of their guest’s home is just awful behaviour. 'If guests want to see the house they should always ask their host first and never engage in an uninvited snoop. 'It is truly dreadful that a quarter . of British people have turned up to a dinner party without a gift and it . shows a clear lack of manners in today’s society. 'Guests should remember that they do . not need to spend a fortune but should always bring along a small token . to show appreciation to their host'. But guests are still making demands . of their hosts - almost a third (31 per cent) said they expect hosts to . hang up their coat when they arrive and three quarters (76 per cent) would find it rude if they were not asked if they wanted a drink or a . bite to eat. Jacky Brown, at Sheilas’ Wheels insurance which commissioned the survey, added: 'It is clear from the . research that old fashioned British etiquette is in danger of becoming . extinct. 'As a nation we are well known for . taking care of our castles so we would advise that hosts plan ahead and . make sure they put away expensive and fragile items to prevent any . accidental mishaps from happening.'","28 per cent .

"By . Chris Cutmore for MailOnline . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . It's the sight you never thought you'd see. Tiger Woods dumping a bucket of ice and water on his head all in the name of fun and charity. Well, Rory McIlroy dumping a bucket of ice and water on his head to be precise. Fresh from their appearance together on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, golf's two current superstars are among the latest big names to brave the craze sweeping the world's sporting celebrities: the ice bucket challenge. VIDEO Scroll down to watch all the best Ice Bucket Challenges from the world of sport . Double trouble: Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods introduce their ice bucket challenge . Brrrrrr: Woods is the first to get soaked as McIlroy drenches his friend and rival . Revenge: Woods then strikes back, dumping his ice bucket right on McIlroy's head . We have a winner: Unlike on the course recently, Woods won the contest with McIlroy left totally soaked . It is fast becoming an internet phenomenon and the clue is in the name: participants must dump a bucket of ice over their heads before nominating three others to take up the challenge. It is all in aid of raising awareness of motor neurone disease and anyone not completing the challenge must donate money to the ALS Association, according to the rules of the game. Once upon a time the prospect of Woods taking part in the challenge would have been unthinkable. Famously a lone wolf, Woods never showed any public signs of being anything other than the steely-eyed, fist-pumping golfing machine that has racked up 14 major titles and shattered records at every turn. But, if ever there was a sign that times have changed, here it is. Woods and McIlroy, seemingly heir to Tiger's crown as the world's most brilliant golfer following his wins at The Open and the US PGA Championship this summer, were game contestants and laughed heartily at their discomfort. And, unlike events on the course recently, if there were a winner from this contest it was certainly Woods, who left his friend and rival utterly soaked and shivering, while McIlroy somehow managed to fill up Woods's bucket with even more water during his attempt. Fellow golfers Justin Rose and Ian Poulter were among the first sports stars to freeze themselves in the name of charity last month, and Poulter laid down the challenge to Woods then. It seems the former world No 1 has finally accepted. We will wait with interest to see whether McIlroy's nominations accept his challenge. They are Wayne Rooney, actress Meghan Markle and George W Bush. Yes, the George W Bush.

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . Terrorists have struck behind the front lines in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, and the Kuridsh-controlled city of Kirkuk, killing almost 50 people. Three bombs in Kirkuk, to the north of Iraq, killed 19 civilians while blasts in Baghdad killed eleven people. Between them the bombings also wounded 136 people in the two cities. Scroll down for video . Destruction: Rescuers dash from the scene of car bombings in Kirkuk, part of Kurdish-controlled Iraq . Deaths: 19 people were killed in the northern city - above one of the victims is carries away . Wrecked: The bomb caused large amounts of damage in the city, which is a Kurdish seat of power . Investigation: Emergency services personnel inspect a wrecked car near the site of one explosion . Smoke rising: The strikes in the city are another example of violence behind the front lines with IS . It came as the conflict in the Middle East rumbled on, with Syrian warplanes launched further attacks on the Islamic State's (IS) power-based in Raqqa. It was not clear whether the Islamic State, which now controls vast swathes of the country, was behind the bombings, or one of the other religious and political sects in the country. The bombs today in Kirkuk exploded in a crowded commercial district, causing the 19 deaths and wounding another 112, according to police. A witness said: '[I heard] an explosion between the cars, and then we started carrying out the dead bodies from there while people were burning inside the shops and cars.' In Baghdad, a suicide bomber had earlier drove an explosives-laden car into the gate of the intelligence headquarters in the city's Karrada district. Six civilians and five security personnel were killed, while 24 other were wounded. Bombings in and around the capital are common - on Friday a Sunni mosque in a town 70 away from the capital was bombed, killing more than 60 people. Syria: Meanwhile the Islamic State's capital, Raqqa, came under continued aerial assault - pictured is a hospital . Seat of power: Raqqa is the city where IS exerts most power and influence - but it is often bombed . Death from above: This grainy image of warplane, from Thursday, was taken near Raqqa . Blast: The city is also being shelled by ground forces - below a man rides his bike past scenes of destruction . Since early this year, Iraq has faced an onslaught by the Islamic State extremist group and allied Sunni militants, who have seized large areas in the country's west and north. The group took over Iraq's second-largest city Mosul in June, and has since declared an Islamic state, or caliphate, in territory under its control in both Iraq and neighbouring Syria. However, it continues to war with the forces of the Syrian regime, led by president Bashar Assad. While it has captured large parts of Syria from Assad's forces, even in their centre of power, Raqqa, they are under attack from Syrian air power. A hospital in the city lay in rubble today, which locals say was destroyed by Syrian bombs, while footage from the city has shown IS fighters dashing for anti-air guns regularly as planes soar overhead.","Three explosions in Kirkuk killed 19, while 11 people died in Baghdad .

Stunning vistas: The coastline of Washington state provides footage for an aerial video captured by drone . Take off! The remotely-piloted aircraft takes flight from a rocky beach in Washington . Hello there: Will Good and Gabriel Ng constructed this DIY drone, the DJI Phantom 2, in their home . The video begins with the two men putting together the drone - the DJI Phantom 2 - itself. Drones are remotely-piloted aircraft - but don't get this homemade fare confused with military grade UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) or RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems). These DIY creations are about the size of a remote controlled helicopter, but unlike toy planes, you don't need a lot of knowledge to control them. City sunset: The drone captured this beautiful footage at dusk during the team's month-long project . They even have the capacity to fly a pre-programmed flight path, customisable through a programme known as 'electronics prototyping software.' Aspiring videographers can then attach their cameras to the drone to ascertain footage from an otherwise impossible to reach position. Good and Ng took their project to all new heights, navigating their little drone above seemingly never-ending forests, along the majestic coastline, and even hundreds of feet above one couple's special day. Say cheese! The camera even managed to capture this couple's special day . Green with envy!

And it's not just the Great British seaside which youngsters are missing out on. Research by train company First Great Western also reveals 80 per cent have never been to iconic ancient site Stonehenge, and the majority of children have never visited the Roman baths in Bath (85 per cent) or the Tower of London (73 per cent). Can we come here every year please mum? One in nine UK children have never been on a British beach . Beside the seaside: Children enjoy donkey rides in Somerset. A survey has revealed fewer parents are taking youngsters to UK beaches . 36% have never made a sandcastle53% have not  fished for crabs38% have not eaten ice cream on UK beach 43% have never held a shell to their ear to 52% have never skimmed stones in the sea12% of parents 'forgotten UK's good points'80% have never been to Stonehenge85% have never been to the Roman Baths73% have never visited the Tower of London 54% haven’t been to a farm . The research revealed 65 per cent of the UK’s Generation Z – those born after the millennium – have never been beside the sea in Cornwall, and 68 per cent have never been to play in the sand in Devon. Both destinations are home to some of Britain's best beaches, including Watergate Bay in Cornwall, Porthcressa in the Isle of Scilly and Dawlish in Devon. One of the problems, Great Western says, is that a quarter of parents (26 per cent) now believe that overseas holidays are cheaper. The survey showed that modern day four to 16-year-olds are missing out on traditional seaside fun. One in three youngsters have never made a sandcastle (36 per cent) and more than half have not been crabbing (53 per cent). Sadly, most children have never skimmed stones over the surf (52 per cent) or held a shell to their ear to listen to the sound of the sea (43 per cent). These simple joys are now being neglected despite 69 per cent of parents fondly recalling trips to the seaside when they were children. King of the castle: A third of children have never made a sandcastle, the research reveals . The good . old British weather also plays a big part in decision-making, with . almost half of parents (45 per cent) choosing to take kids abroad . because of the rainy climate.

Working with locals across the UK, including celebrities such as Daisy and Pearl Lowe from Somerset, Rick Stein from Cornwall and Alex James from The Cotswolds, the company has launched a Facebook app to help families discover what the country has to offer this summer. Nearly half of parents surveyed said they liked visiting castles themselves when children (45 per cent) and a third admitted having fun on camping holidays (35 per cent). But sadly, one in eight parents (12 per cent) said they had simply 'forgotten about the good things we can do in this country'. In addition, many now choose to go abroad in the belief it's cheaper (26 per cent) and to avoid the poor British weather (45 per cent).","Children are missing out on activities such as skimming stones and crabbing .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . The debate over whether there should be tougher rules or an outright ban on electronic cigarettes on planes has been reignited in the US after one of the devices was blamed for a small fire. A JetBlue plane at Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts was evacuated this month after baggage handlers smelled smoke and extinguished a smouldering bag as they prepared the aircraft for take-off. The e-cigarette was packed in a passenger’s checked luggage and burned a small hole in the bag, said Ed Freni, director of aviation with the Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates the airport. Fire hazard? An e-cigarette is being blamed for starting a fire in a passenger's checked luggage . Logan airport officials are asking US aviation authorities to consider classifying e-cigarettes as hazardous materials. Freni told the Associated Press: ‘If that aeroplane had taxied out and got airborne it might have been a very different story.’ But a US Department of Transportation spokeswoman said the agency is not currently considering further restrictions for e-cigarettes, and the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services said the cause of the fire has not been officially determined. E-cigarettes, typically powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, are designed to mimic cigarettes by turning a liquid nicotine solution into a vapour that is inhaled by the user. Baggage handlers smelled smoke and located a smouldering bag as they prepared a plane for take-off . Under existing rules, e-cigarettes are considered personal devices – meaning they are treated like laptop computers, mobile phones or other battery-powered devices – and can be carried onto a plane. They cannot be activated, however, and their lithium-ion batteries must be protected from damage or accidental activation. Spare batteries cannot be stored in checked luggage because of fire risks. Lithium-ion batteries have been linked to previous crashes or fires involving planes, but there have been very few reports of fires caused by e-cigarettes. In 2009, a shipment of e-cigarettes was blamed for a fire on a plane at Minneapolis-St Paul airport in Minnesota. Cynthia Cabrera, executive director for the e-cigarette trade group the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, told the Associated Press she would expect the industry to take a closer look at fire safety if the investigation determines an e-cigarette was the cause of this month’s fire in Boston.","Baggage handlers smelled smoke while loading a JetBlue plane in Boston .

Demand for water escalated on Colonsay when the charity craze took off on the Inner Hebridean island, which has a population of around 135. Meanwhile a branch of Tesco in Simonside, South Shields, admitted running out of ice with fundraisers rushing to buy bags of it to take part in the challenge. Scroll down for video... Demand for water escalated on Colonsay, pictured, when the Ice Bucket Challenge took off on the Inner Hebridean island . The Tesco in Simonside, South Shields (pictured) ran out of ice on Saturday amid a rush of fundraising . In Colonsay, the water system stops automatically as part of moves to cut wastage on the eight mile-long isle and needs to be turned back on afterwards. David Johnston, from the Colonsay Brewery told The Sun that water engineers had to come out five times over the weekend. The 60-year-old told the newspaper: 'The challenge spread round the island like wildfire. It hit a peak on Sunday evening. 'The water system must have thought there was a burst main.' Engineers were called out five times on one weekend after the water system shut off with large numbers of islanders taking on the Ice Bucket Challenge (file picture of someone taking on the charity challenge) A spokesman for Scottish Water said water had been shut off during the weekend but added that residents were still able to use stored supplies on the island. Staff at a Tesco in Simonside, South Shields, admitted selling out of ice on Saturday. Daniel Smith, duty manager of Tesco, said: 'We sold out on Saturday and we nearly did on Sunday as well. 'We don't usually sell so much ice at this time of year - it's usually only this popular when big events like the World Cup are on. 'It seems like everyone is taking part in the challenge and getting behind the charity to raise money and quite a few of our staff have taken part too. 'It's great to see so many people taking part, but before the next big craze, we'd love a bit of warning so we can stock up on whatever it is people need.' The Ice Bucket Challenge involves dumping iced water on someone's head before the participant nominates another person to have a go. In Britain, people take part in the challenge to support the Motor Neurone Disease Association. The craze has gone viral on social media websites in the last two months.","Colonsay left without water when Ice Bucket Challenge spread on island .

Sir Bradley Wiggins, who made a silver-medal return to the track in the Commonwealth Games on Thursday, must wait until March to resolve his long-running management dispute. A High Court date has now been set for the multi-million-pound case brought against Wiggins by agents MTC, whom the cyclist left to join Simon Fuller’s XIX Entertainment. Wiggins revealed in February 2013 — after his glory year when he won the Tour de France, Olympic gold and BBC Sports Personality of the Year — that he was joining the likes of David Beckham and Lewis Hamilton in Fuller’s all-star set-up, sparking a complex legal fight. VIDEO Scroll down top watch Bradley Wiggins disappointed with Commonwealth silver . Legal proceedings: Sir Bradley Wiggins, pictured here after wining silver in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games, will face a High Court hearing in March . MTC claim to have negotiated Wiggins’s most lucrative contract with Team Sky as well as Fred Perry and Oakley sponsorships and an autobiography. The Wiggins camp allege the agency deal only involved commercial contracts and not his riding agreement with Sky, and that some contracts were arranged by Wiggins’s wife Catherine and friends. However, Wiggins has never been able to attract the number of endorsements enjoyed by his fellow cycling knight Sir Chris Hoy. Still smiling: Wiggins waves to the crowd inside the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome after defeat to Australia . Prince Imran, the jolly Malaysian president of the Commonwealth Federation who threatened to blow the climax of the opening ceremony when he took ages to extricate the Queen’s message from a baton, disarmingly deflected criticism on Thursday by saying it had been a ‘great comedy act’. It didn’t seem funny at the time. Meanwhile, the video wall that took up the whole of the south stand at Celtic Park seems to be a game-changer for opening ceremonies, after it so greatly enhanced what was going on in the stadium. ............................................................................................ Team England and the Commonwealth Games organisers remained remarkably sanguine when Mo Farah, one of the few A-list track and field stars due to compete in Glasgow, withdrew from the 5,000 metres and 10,000m on the opening day of the Games. Farah, who missed a big pay day at the Anniversary Games last week to give himself a chance of running in Scotland, suggests there was nothing untoward in his no-show. But it is odd the BBC, who monopolise the Commonwealth Games, spent six months attempting to expose something untoward in Farah’s training methods without finding anything. ............................................................................................ There is consternation at the BBC that a job advert for the position of sports editor suggests the successful candidate can choose to live in London or Manchester, when virtually the whole department have had to up sticks to Salford. The blurb also intimates broadcasting skills can be learned on the job, pointing to another appointment from newspapers. ........................................................................................... ECB’s crowd trouble . The poor crowds forecast for the Southampton and Manchester Tests against India are exercising minds at the ECB just as much as the team’s struggles on the field. England captain Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores are under the closest scrutiny, but England boss Paul Downton and chief selector James Whitaker will feel the heat too if the defeats continue and the cash cow that is Test cricket in this country starts to diminish. Certainly Downton, who sits in on selection meetings and mingles with players at practice and before matches, is a lot more visible than his successful predecessor Hugh Morris. Staying away: Poor attendances have been forecast for England's upcoming Tests against India . Security arrangements for the Commonwealth Games are proving baffling.

"By . Carol Driver for MailOnline . 'I thought it was a joke': Karen and Aidan Price were heading to New York when the incident happened . A mother was left mortified when police hauled her off a flight to New York because a passport had been reported stolen - by someone with the same. Karen Price, 50, from North Wales, was horrified when she was taken from her friends and family as officers escorted her through tunnels at Birmingham Airport to a nearby police station to question her about the document. But, after just half an hour, officials realised a bungling Passport Office staff member had caused the alert - marking Karen's passport down as stolen instead of her namesake's. It transpired that it had taken them three years to note the mistake, in which time the mum-of-two had used the passport five times. Karen, from Abergele, who was flying to New York with her husband Aidan and friends, said: ‘It was supposed to be my 50th birthday present. ‘I was just a bit shocked really, I went through check in and everything else no problems. ‘It was only when we went to board the plane it was then they took me aside and told us there was a problem. It was just a bit embarrassing. ‘The stupid thing is we had used the passport five times since it had been reported as stolen, we'd even been to Tunisia where they signed it to say that we had been let in, which proved there was no problem with the passport then. ‘I honestly thought it was a joke they were playing on me, I just couldn't believe it, I thought it was a wind-up.’ Karen tried to board the United Airlines plane on June 1 from Birmingham to Newark, New Jersey, to celebrate her birthday. Despite clearing check in and security with no problems, and waiting in the departure lounge for two-and-a-half hours Karen was only stopped as she stepped on to the plane. Waiting police swooped in and demanded the NHS worker followed them to the station for further questioning. Airport drama: Karen Price was pulled off a flight to New York at Birmingham Airport . On holiday: The couple, pictured in New York, were forced to cut their trip to the States short . The couple were forced to abandon their friends, who boarded the aircraft as normal, without an explanation and were led through a series of tunnels to the airport's police station. After half an hour officers revealed the mistake and said the pair needed to attend the Passport Office to rectify the problem. Karen and her husband Aidan were booked on a flight two days later in a hope they could still enjoy part of their six-day holiday. ‘They said we could fly Tuesday but we had to get our passport sorted out by then,’ Karen said. ‘We were ringing every hour to see if the Passport Office had a cancellation. ‘We finally managed to get an appointment at 11am on Monday so we shot straight to Liverpool to get everything processed. ‘While we were there they said another Karen Price had reported her passport stolen in January 2011 and it had only been put on the system in April 2014. Karen was taken off a United Airlines flight to New York at Birmingham Airport (file photo) ‘The only problem was it was against the wrong Karen Price. ‘I'm flabbergasted they didn't do more stringent checks to deal with the cancellation of a passport. ‘What if someone else had picked it up and had tried to use it? I'd used my passport five times.’ Karen was finally issued another passport and boarded another flight to the States. Aidan, 49, added: ‘We had stayed with some friends ready to get to the airport in plenty of time. ‘It was a big deal, we had friends coming over to meet us and we had booked helicopter rides and excursions for the whole trip. ‘It was a once in a lifetime trip really, the whole situation was an absolute nightmare.’ Aidan added: ‘We had just a few days left when we arrived so we had to fit everything in in such a short space of time. Birthday break: The couple were heading for a holiday in New York to mark Karen's 50th birthday . ‘We missed the helicopter ride to had to book another one as well as another trip up the Empire State Building. ‘We had to cram so many excursions into two days everybody was knackered. It was a complete nightmare.’ Karen added: ‘Well my birthday trip will never be forgotten that's for sure. ‘Every time I go to the airport now I will be scared to death until I get on the plane. I won't be able to relax until then.’ A spokesman for Her Majesty's Passport Office said: ‘We apologise to Miss Price for the inconvenience caused. ‘It is extremely rare for passports to be cancelled in error. If a mistake does occur it is fully investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.’","Karen Price was travelling with friends on a birthday trip to New York .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Students from West Africa arriving in the U.S. to study could be subject to extra health checks in a bid to stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. College administrators are keen to insulate their campuses from the worst outbreak of the disease in history, which has claimed the lives of more than 1,500 people so far. The virus is continuing to spread in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria and with the expected arrival of thousands of students from these countries, authorities are on alert. Scroll down for video . Dr Robert Palinkas, director of the McKinley Health Center at the University of Illinois, where extra health checks will be carried out on students arriving to study from West Africa, where the deadly Ebola virus is spreading . 30 Nigerian students expected at the University of Illinois will be pulled aside for a temperature check and private Ebola discussion when they arrive at the health centre, pictured . While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued no specific recommendations for colleges, some state health departments, including those in South Carolina and North Dakota, have told administrators what symptoms to look for and how to react. Elsewhere, universities are drafting their own precautionary plans against the often-fatal fever, which causes weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, internal bleeding and sometimes bleeding from the nose and ears. The American College Health Association recommends its members update emergency plans, find out where patients have traveled and use isolation exam rooms when available. Several colleges are also checking the temperatures of students arriving from affected countries and continuing to monitor for fever until any risk of contagion has passed. People gather around the body of a man in the street in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, who is suspected of dying from the Ebola virus . The deadly Ebola virus has continued to spread in West African countries such as Liberia, pictured, where nurses wearing a protective suit escort a man infected with Ebola to hospital . U.S. universities count 9,728 active students from Nigeria, 204 from Liberia, 169 from Sierra Leone and 95 students from Guinea, according to the federal government. The 30 Nigerian students expected at the University of Illinois will be pulled aside for a temperature check and private Ebola discussion when they arrive at the health center for mandatory immunisation paperwork and tuberculosis screening, said Dr Robert Palinkas, the centre's director. The plans have been reassuring to the handful of parents who have called wondering whether their child's placement with a West African roommate should give them reason to worry, he said. He added: 'Parents are comforted to know that there is a screening process, that we are alert for it, that we are prepared for it. 'We're doing everything we can without infringing on the rights of anybody to make sure their son or daughter is going to have the lowest risk possible.' Similar screenings are planned at the University at Buffalo, Mercer University in Georgia, Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and the University of Akron in Ohio, the campuses said. The World Health Organisation warned the current outbreak of the deadly virus could grow six times larfer and infected as many as 20,000 people . Alma Olson, director of Student Health Services at the Akron University, said students are being asked to keep tabs on their temperature for up to 21 days, the length of time it can take for symptoms of Ebola to appear following exposure. 'At the end of the 21-day period they'll come back and we'll check them and send them on their way,' she said. 'There's such a low level of worry' because Ebola doesn't spread easily but we really have to be on top of any communicable disease,' she added. Universities in the United Kingdom also are on alert with the expected arrival of thousands of Nigerian students there. Universities UK, which represents universities, has circulated guidance from Public Health England advising administrators on how to recognize and react to possible cases. Ebola has spread to major cities in four countries, provoking unrest as whole neighborhoods and towns have been sealed to the outside . It comes as the World Health Organisation warned the current outbreak of the deadly virus could grow six times larger and infected as many as 20,000 people. Ebola has affected Africa for 40 years, but previously struck in remote villages and was contained fairly quickly. However during this outbreak, it has spread to major cities in four countries, provoking unrest as whole neighborhoods and towns have been sealed to the outside. It is spread through direct human to human contact. An experimental vaccine developed by the U.S. government and GlaxoSmithKline will be tested on humans starting next week, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced on Thursday. The NIH trial will use healthy adult volunteers in Maryland, and British experts will simultaneously test the same vaccine in healthy people in the UK, Gambia and Mali.","Students coming to U.S. could be made to undergo additional health checks .

"By . David Kent . Dylan Hartley will join England's tour of New Zealand with 12 months' of Aviva Premiership final red card trauma at an end, according to Tom Wood. Northampton's club captain returned from two months of shoulder trouble for the Saints' extra-time 24-20 Premiership final victory over Saracens at Twickenham on Saturday. Hartley will lead the glut of Premiership finalists heading out to New Zealand on Monday, with Saracens duo Owen Farrell and Billy Vunipola easing off knocks to make the plane too. Champions: Dylan Hartley (left) and Tom Wood (right) celebrate Northampton's victory over Saracens . Victory: Northampton defeated Saracens 24-20 in the Aviva Premiership Final . Â . The 28-year-old was sent off in last season's 37-17 Premiership final defeat to Leicester Tigers, costing him his place on the summer's British and Irish Lions tour. England flanker Tom Wood hailed Hartley's resolve for exorcising last season's bad memories as Northampton claimed their first-ever Premiership title, a week after scooping the Amlin Challenge Cup crown. 'It's fantastic for Dylan to have achieved this after last year, everyone is delighted for him,' said Wood. 'This time last year we were so disappointed, and no one took it harder than Dylan. 'But he's been the life and soul of our group, never let it beat him, and now he's come back to pull this off, and he can move forward. 'He's got last year off his back now.'

"Poorer Australians are out of pocket hundreds of dollars more than high and middle-income earners as a result of the federal government's budget, Treasury figures reveal. When the government handed down its widely criticised budget in May, they were aware cost cutting would hit poor families harder, according to a Freedom of Information request from Fairfax.

Scroll down for video . When the government handed down its widely criticised budget in May, they were aware cost cutting would hit poor families harder, according to a Freedom of Information request . Budget measures do not take into account changes like the $7 Medicare co-payment or inflation and therefore understates the negative impact of budget measures on poorer income households. The analysis was one of several provided to the government, but the Treasury failed to release more than one detailed model ahead of the budget. A spokeswoman for Treasurer Joe Hockey said average low-income households would still receive $12,604 in 2016-17 in cash transfers like family benefits. The Treasury numbers show spending cuts have cost lower income families an average of $842 a year, while high income households only lost $71 and middle income families are out of pocket $477 .

"By . Press Association . and Associated Press . and Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Airlines are on high alert after Iceland raised its aviation alert for the restless Bardarbunga volcano to red. Seismologists say magma is moving under the Vatnajokull glacier but so far has travelled horizontally at a depth of 3 to 6 miles. The volcano will erupt if the magma melts the ice above. Thousands of small earthquakes have rattled the volcano deep in the past week, with activity picking up today after a lull. Scroll down for video . Sky high: The UK is monitoring fall out from a volcanic eruption in Iceland after vulcanologists issued a red alert . The red alert is the highest warning on the country's five-point scale. A 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokul volcano produced an ash cloud that caused a week of international aviation chaos, with more than 100,000 flights cancelled. Aviation regulators since have reformed policies about flying through ash, so a new eruption would be unlikely to cause as much disruption. Scientists had planned to fly over Vatnajokull later today to look for changes on the surface but it was not clear if that would still take place. Earlier this week authorities had evacuated several hundred people from highlands north of the glacier as a precaution. The area is uninhabited but popular with hikers. A spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said that air travel would not be affected until an eruption actually breaks the ice. 'The (UK) Met Office will be monitoring what's occurring. They will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air,' he said. 'If the eruption does occur we will issue what's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions. It's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly.' Melissa Pfeffer, a vulcanologist with the Icelandic Meteorological Office, said the amount of ash produced would depend on the thickness of the ice. 'The thicker the ice, the more water there is, the more explosive it will be and the more ash-rich the eruption will be,' she said. Thick smoke: A 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokul volcano produced an ash cloud that caused a week of international aviation chaos, with more than 100,000 flights cancelled . A spokesman for NATS, the UK's air traffic  control  organisation, said: 'NATS is monitoring the situation and working in close collaboration with the Met Office, Department for Transport and our safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, as this dynamic situation develops further.' She added that NATS will help determine what impact the eruption will have for operations in UK airspace and advise airline customers accordingly. A spokesman for budget airline easyJet said it is putting its contingency plans into action following the red alert, using specialist technology to ensure any ash created by the eruption is detected and chartered. 'EasyJet will use this and other data provided by the authorities to determine what, if any, changes it should make to its flying programme,' he said. 'As things stand there are no changes to easyJet's flying programme, including flights to and from Iceland.' He added: 'The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority.' Iceland sits on a volcanic hot spot in the Atlantic's mid-oceanic ridge. Eruptions are frequently triggered there when the Earth's plates move and when magma from deep underground pushes its way to the surface.","Magma is moving deep beneath a glacier but has not broken the surface .

Missing and found: Madeleine McCann vanished on May 3, 2007 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal while police are appealing for help identifying this blonde girl, known only as Maria, who was found on a gypsy camp in Greece after she was allegedly abducted . Ben's mother Kerry, whose son was just 21 months old when he vanished on the island of Kos in 1991, says she always believed her . son, from Sheffield, was taken by gypsies. She . told ITV: 'My family and I are extremely delighted at the news that a . four-year-old girl has been found in a gypsy camp in Larissa, Greece. 'We . have always believed that Ben's abduction was gypsy-related and have . had a long ongoing inquiry in Larissa. We hope that the investigation . into Ben's disappearance will now be looked at again.' Ben vanished after travelling to Kos with his mother and grandparents Eddie and Christine, who were renovating a farmhouse in the village of Iraklise. Eddie Needham also told ITV's . Calendar News: 'We've always been told over the years it's impossible . for gypsies to hide a European child, well this proves that it's not. 'What I want now is for the British police to contact Larissa police and have those people questioned regarding Ben.' Ben's . sister Leighanna Needham, 20, said the discovery of Maria in the gypsy . camp was welcome news for her family's fight for answers. 'It's given us great hope,"" she told Sky News yesterday. Who is she? The four-year-old sparked one of the officer's curiosity as she is pale skinned and bore no resemblance to the other children or the couple who claimed to be her parents . 'Obviously, . it's been a strong belief of myself and all my family that Ben was . taken by gypsies for child trafficking or illegal adoptions and this . case just shows that they can be found.' Maria was found after a . police officer attending the camp noticed she bore no likeness to her . supposed family and investigated further. DNA tests confirmed his suspicions. Miss Needham said the same technology could help find her long-lost brother. 'I . think that would be a brilliant thing to get our DNA out there, even if . it's not actually Ben but any siblings or any children maybe of Ben . (that are found) then that could hopefully lead us to him,' she said. A . witness who visited the grimy camp near Farsala, central Greece, has . said he saw a child matching Ben Needham's description among the . gypsies. Ms Needham is now calling on the British Government to urge Greek authorities to investigate the claims. The . discovery of 'Maria', who police believe may be from . northern or eastern Europe, has also given hope that Madeleine McCann . may be found alive. Last . night, the girl was safely playing with other . children at a house run by Greek charity The Smile Of The Child, which . is caring for her. The authorities are sure she does not . belong to the adults she was living with, and her nationality and the . circumstances under which she left her real family remain a mystery. Maria . was found last Wednesday in a Roma settlement in Farsala, central .

Ben Needham disappeared on the holiday isle of Kos in 1999 aged just 21 months, sparking a huge but ultimately unsuccessful police hunt. He was seized within moments of him going to play outside a farmhouse, which his grandfather was renovating in the village of Iraklise. His mother was working as a waitress on the island at the time. Investigators suspect the blonde-haired child was abducted by a gypsy gang, and sold to the highest bidder for adoption. But a bungled police inquiry – which was heavily criticised by Ben’s family - failed to track down the culprits. Despite a number of possible sightings and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the youngster has ever been found. ‘We are shocked by how easy it is for people to register . children as their own,’ he told Greek television. Police believe up to ten more children found at the camp may be the victims of a trafficking ring. Delphine . Moralis, secretary general of Missing Children Europe, said: ‘This case . is very unusual in that we’re looking for the child’s family, rather . than the child.’ She said . The Smile Of The Child, a member organisation of Missing Children . Europe, have several houses in Greece where they take children ‘who have . nowhere else to go’. Maria’s . discovery gives fresh hope for other British families with missing . children, including the tragic case of Ben Needham, the Sheffield boy . who went missing in Kos in 1991, aged 21 months. Ben’s sister, . Leighanna, said the discovery was ‘very significant to Ben’s case’. ‘It . gives us great hope that one day this will be Ben. Child trafficking . and illegal adoption in Greece has been pretty high and that’s exactly . what they thought had happened to Ben – that he was taken for a . childless family and passed through gipsy camps,’ she told the BBC. Maria . was found just days after the Metropolitan Police revealed the results . of a major review of the investigation into the disappearance of . Madeleine McCann. Comparison: The case bears a disturbing similarity to theories about the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann, who went missing on a family holiday in Portugal on May 3, 2007 . Breakthrough? Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured on a BBC Crimewatch appeal) said they are 'genuinely hopefully' that police can make progress in the investigation . Roma gangs have been accused of trafficking hundreds of children to and from countries including Britain to mug and steal as part of an ‘international criminal network’. Boys and girls as young as 10 are being used to make more than £2000 a month each, through crimes organised by Fagin-like bosses. Around 200 children are though to be involved, with much of their tax free income being smuggled back to Romania to buy property. Details of the sinister 'family' network emerged during an appeal last year in Paris against a five-year-prison sentence by Remus Stoian, a 40-year-old Romanian national. He was found guilty alongside Palos Constantine, a compatriot also aged 40, of organising an ‘international criminal network which aimed to bring minors to France to commit theft.’ Both men were based with their ‘extended clan’ at an illegal Roma campsite in the St Denis suburb of Paris, and regularly 'trafficked' children between ‘France, Romania and even England’, a judicial source told Le Figaro. The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris said Stoian and Constantine had been wire tapped as they discussed the successes of their operation, which is still being run by relatives. The conversations reveals that children were ‘selected by hand’, with Stoain saying at one point: ‘You need four to five people who can work for you, and each can bring in between 100 and 150 euros a  day. You can bring in 3000 euros a month.' The young criminal gangs are taken to top tourists spots, including central London to steal from people. The reason for keeping the children moving between different countries is so that they can not be 'traced' to the adults exploiting them. Another Romanian in the gang said he had 11 children working for him personally, with a 'clan chief' ultimately being responsible for the whole operation.","Ben, from Sheffield, disappeared in 1991 and would now be 24 years old .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A shocking 40 percent of Americans will develop diabetes sometime in their lifetime, according to new estimates and it will jack up the price of already high healthcare costs, most of which will be paid for by the government . The recent study was conducted by Edward Gregg, chief of Edward Gregg chief of the epidemiology and statistics branch for diabetes research at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As the lifespans for humans continue to increase so does the risk for type two diabetes, says the study published on August 13 online for The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. On the rise: At least 40 per cent of Americans will develop diabetes some time in their lifetime . 'We weren't necessarily surprised that it increased, but we didn't expect it to increase this much,' Gregg said to CBS. 'Forty percent is a humbling number.' The odds of those developing diabetes is even worse for certain minority groups. Half of black women and of Hispanic men and women are predicted to contract type 2 diabetes during their lifetime. The American Diabetes Association released research last year saying that the costs of those diagnosed with diabetes have risen to $245 billion in 2012 from $174 billion in 2007 when the cost was last calculated. Of those with diabetes, 62.4 per cent are getting funding from Medicare, Medicaid, and the military. Type 2 diabetes happens when the body does not produce enough insulin or is resistant to insulin, the hormone needed to take sugar and turn it into fuel for the cells in the brain and the body. While many believe that obesity is the sole cause behind diabetes, genetics also play a role . There is no denying that diabetes type 2 and obesity go hand in hand, however. Doctors have come up with the term 'diabesity' to exemplify the relationship between unhealthy habits and diabetes. Since the 1980's, the risk of someone getting diabetes in their 20s increased from 27 percent to almost 40 percent. Due to advancements in medical care and due to better treatment for diabetes, those with diabetes will live longer than ever before but it will take a toll on medical costs. Health costs: Since more and more people are living longer with diabetes it will increase the cost of healthcare, most of which is government funded . 'Even after people develop complications of diabetes that used to increase risk of death, there are so many ways to keep people alive longer these days,' Gregg said. A doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City Minisha Sood says, 'It's rending people incapable of enjoying a good quality of life. It's raising health care costs at an alarming rate. And frankly, there aren't enough health care professionals to deal with what's coming down the pike,' Sood said. 'We're looking at clogging up a health care system that's already stretched to its limits.' There's no quick fix solution to the situation either. 'The thing that's going to have the biggest effect is if people with multiple risk factors can make sustained changes in their lifestyles,' Gregg said. 'Weight-loss surgery is an option for some and it is highly effective, but that's not going to be the solution for the large number of people at risk for diabetes.'","As the lifespans for humans continue to increase, so does the risk for type two diabetes says Edward .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Her first foray into adult literature has left critics underwhelmed. So news that JK Rowling will be returning to more familiar territory will be welcomed by fans. Her latest release, Casual Vacancy, set entirely in a world of Muggles, received mixed reviews, with some fans hankering for Rowling’s magic touch. New ideas: JK Rowling's latest release, Casual Vacancy, set entirely in a world of Muggles, received mixed reviews, with some fans hankering for her magic touch . But the popular author’s next book will be for children ‘slightly younger’ than Harry Potter age, she has revealed. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the world-famous writer said she has several new projects in the pipeline, but a book for young children will be the first to be published. The revelation first came when a child at the festival asked the popular author when she expected to release another children’s book. She replied: ‘Being the writer of Harry Potter gave me an absolute horror of committing myself. ‘It felt like every tiny thing I said became magnified and came back to haunt me. But I think probably the next thing I write - or the next thing I publish - will be for children.’ She later added: ‘If the next book I publish is the one I think it will be, I have told my children about it and they really like it so that was quite encouraging. ‘It is for slightly younger children than Harry Potter was.’ Massive success: Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in the 2004 film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . Another novel for adults is also in the pipeline, she said. The Casual Vacancy has been described as a ‘sexually explicit tale of ruthless snobbery and bourgeois hypocrisy’. 'Being the writer of Harry Potter gave me an absolute horror of committing myself. It felt like every tiny thing I said became magnified and came back to haunt me' JK Rowling . Set in the parochial West Country town of Pagford, it begins with the unexplained death of a member of the parish council. It also touches on dark themes of prostitution, drug addiction and rape. The novel has soared to the top of fiction charts, with 2.6million copies sold before it even hit the shelves. But it has divided critics, who have denounced it as ‘unadventurous’, ‘bland’, and full of ‘mean, graceless people without a trace of magic’. Rowling, who began penning the Harry Potter novels as a penniless single mother writing in Edinburgh cafes because she had no money to heat her house, spoke at Saturday’s event of her personal battle with depression. Small beginnings: Rowling (pictured with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) began penning the Harry Potter novels as a penniless single mother writing in cafes because she had no money to heat her house . The best-selling author has admitted to suffering from depression throughout her career and last month revealed that she had undergone therapy several times to help her cope with adjusting to her fame and fortune. 'I do have a tendency to walk on the dark . side sometimes. I have suffered from depression, I know how that feels, . I have an innate inclination that way. Writing does help with that' JK Rowling . She said: ‘I do have a tendency to walk on the dark side sometimes. I have suffered from depression, I know how that feels, I have an innate inclination that way. Writing does help with that.’ The author also said that the ‘proudest moment’ of her life was participating in the London Olympics opening ceremony in July, when she sat on a grassy mound inside the Olympic Stadium and read an extract from JM Barrie’s Peter Pan. ‘Walking out on to the hillock at the Olympic ceremony was extraordinary,’ she said. ‘I think I will see it on my death bed. It was breathtaking and I felt extraordinarily proud to be in it.’","Latest release Casual Vacancy set in real world and received mixed reviews .

"By . James  Nye . The filmmaker father of virgin killer Elliot Rodger sells erotic black and white photography of naked women's behinds. While his son produced numerous videos and a 140-page manifesto plainly spelling out his raging hatred of women, Peter Rodger has composed a rather more tasteful, albeit risqué portfolio, as Showbiz 411 has revealed . Rodger, who was the assistant director on Hollywood smash, The Hunger Games, even asked one of his nude models to pose at that monument of eternal love, the Taj Mahal - built by an Indian emperor in memory of his beloved wife who died. Scroll Down for Video . Erotic: These are some of the $1,250 prints of naked women on sale online produced by Peter Rodger, the virgin killer's father . Twenty of the British director's photographs are on sale at the website of the respected Saatchi Gallery and cost as much as $1,250. Rodger's artful images have been taken all over the world, from the romantic streets of Paris and Cannes to sultry retreats in Marrakech. The limited edition prints feature suggestive images of women's derrieres in a seedy New York hotel room and freely walking across the snow in Aspen, Colorado. The sexually provocative photographs produced by Peter Rodger are a stark contrast to his son's aggressive, emotionally stunted attitude to women that led him to murder six people on Friday in Santa Barbara and injure 13 others. Filmmaker: Peter Rodger is seen in public over the weekend for the first time since his son, Elliot, went on a stabbing and shooting rampage on Friday in Santa Barbara . 'Retribution': Elliot Rodger posted a video to social media in which he outlined his plan for 'retribution' for being rejected by women . Dystopian fantasy: Elliot Rodger (seen left) is the son of Peter Rodger, assistant director for The Hunger Games (seen second left), about an annual televised death match. Elliot Rodger is seen here at the film's 2012 premiere with Sylvester Stallone (right) In one particularly chilling video that he posted online, Elliot Rodger explains that he is a 22-year-old virgin, who despises women and the men who they sleep with. He promises to kill them all for slighting him and for denying him the attention he thinks he has been denied. The Rodger family and photography have a deep connection. Peter Rodger is the son of George Rodger, the legendary British war photographer who was one of the founder's of the Magnum photo agency. George Rodger was one of the first men to document the horrors of the Bergen Belsen concentration camp and passed away in 1995. His son, Peter, is best known in Hollywood circles for his role in the production of The Hunger Games in addition to the documentary, Oh My God, which he directed, wrote and starred in - and which featured, Hugh Jackman and Ringo Starr. College terror: Police investigate the bloody scene . Chase: Rodger crashed his BMW after he was pursued by police . His Saatchi Art profile describes him as growing up looking through a camera lens, assisting his father. He studied at Maidstone College of Art and has shot print and commercial advertising campaigns in more than 40 countries. On Sunday it was revealed that Peter Rodger had read his son's chilling manifesto and were frantically trying to stop their son carrying out his plan when they heard of the massacre on the radio. Elliot Rodger emailed the 140-page document to his father and mother, Lichin Rodger, just hours before he went on his shooting rampage. Family: Elliot Rodger (right) with his father (left) and a younger sibling, posted many videos to his YouTube account reminiscing about his happy childhood . Lap of luxury: Elliot Rodger used his Facebook page to show off, sharing images of fancy trips and outings . In high gear: the 22-year-old boasted about his luxury vehicles, including his black BMW involved in the drive-by shootings . End of the road:  The shooter's crashed car is seen from the driver's side, where Elliot Rodger ended his life with a bullet to the head . Path of destruction: Rodger's BMW with the windshield shattered after he ran over a bicyclist who landed on the hood of the car . Lichin Rodger, the suspect's mother, reportedly received the email at 9.17pm and immediately went on to her son's YouTube page where she found the newly uploaded video titled 'Retribution' which describes his plan of 'slaughtering' women at a sorority house at the University of California at Santa Barbara. According to CNN, Mrs Rodger then alerted her estranged husband, Peter, and after he watched the video she called 911. The former couple then set off from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to try find their son. Later that night, their worst fears were confirmed when they were told their son was behind the massacre that left six victims dead and 13 injured.","Peter Rodger sells black and white images of naked women for $1,250 through the famed Saatchi Gallery .

Hyndman, a grandson of former FC Dallas coach Schellas Hyndman, made his debut last month with Fulham in the Championship. Tim Ream, a 26-year-old defender who failed to make this year's World Cup squad, came on at the start of the second-half to play his first international game since October 2011. On target: Alejandro Bedoya wheels away after scoring the winner in the US' 1-0 defeat of Czech Republic . Beaten! The US youngster scored past Chelsea keeper Petr Cech (R) towards the end of the first-half . Brad Guzan played the first-half as he took over as the Americans' No. 1 goalkeeper from Tim Howard, who is taking a year off from the national team. Guzan, who turns 30 on Sept. 9, was the oldest player in the U.S. starting lineup. The only U.S. player over 30 was goalkeeper Nick Rimando, 35, who made several excellent saves in the second-half, including stopping Daniel Punil's point-blank shot with his leg in the final minute. The U.S. was coming off its first consecutive appearances in the World Cup's knockout rounds; the Americans were eliminated by Belgium after a 2-1 defeat in extra time in the round of 16 on July 1.

Forward Jozy Altidore made his first U.S. appearance since injuring a hamstring as the Americans opened the World Cup with a 2-1 win over Ghana. Altidore captained the Americans for only the second time. Klinsmann told NBC Sports before the game his goal was to make the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup - a round the Americans last reached at the first tournament in 1930. 'Once you get out of the most difficult group in the World Cup, you should go further than just (the) round of 16,' he said. 'This is our goal going towards Russia, not to stop at the round of 16, maybe not to stop at the quarterfinal, to say clearly, listen: We have four years to prepare this cycle. Our goal is going into a semifinal in a World Cup. And that means a lot of work, a lot of competition, a lot of grind.'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . An amateur astronomer has captured incredible images of space - from his garden shed. Tommy Bowkett, 31, took advantage of several rare clear nights to peer into the night sky using his telescopes. He took a number of images, captured over four days, and was amazed by the stunning pictures that emerged. Astronomer Thomas Bowkett took photos from his home in Barnwood, Gloucester over the course of four days. Among the images was the Pelican Nebula (pictured), that looks as it was taken by a Nasa probe . Mr Bowkett, from Linden, Gloucestershire, said: 'It is not very often I use my telescope because we do not get very many clear nights here. 'I use the equipment at my parents’ home in Barnwood for better views. 'It can take four nights to capture one image. The raw data then goes onto the computer and using different software it [is translated into one large] photo.' Mr Bowkett captured stunning pictures of the Pelican Nebula, California Nebula, Pacman Nebula, Elephant's Trunk Nebula and the moon during his all-night viewing using several of his Skywatcher Equinox telescopes. Desolate: The photographer also captured an incredibly detailed image of the moon (pictured), revealing its incredibly pock-marked surface . Star struck: This image of the Pacman Nebula was taken from Tommy Bowkett's parent's home in Barnwood, Gloucester. The Pacman Nebula, meanwhile, is located about 9,200 light years from Earth and, remarkably, almost 1,000 light years above the plane of the galaxy .

The nebula is located within the same spur of the Orion spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy as Earth. The Pacman Nebula, meanwhile, is located about 9,200 light years from Earth and, remarkably, almost 1,000 light years above the plane of the galaxy. This gives astronomers a nearly unfettered view of the star formation within it. Another image of the Elephant's Trunk Nebula shows an elongated dark globule within the constellation of Cepheus. This nebula is thought to be around 2,400 light years away from Earth.

He said: 'Ever since I was small I wanted a telescope, then one day I decided to buy one. 'It cost £400, which was expensive at that time. Since I bought it three years ago I have had five different ones. 'I was a little bit disappointed when I first bought one as the views were not very clear because of light pollution.

Borussia Dortmund fans are well-known for their impressive vocal displays during matches, and they proved their reputation once again as they joined in a superb rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone at Anfield on Sunday. The German club were on Merseyside for a pre-season friendly, but the 1,000+ fans who made the journey were determined to make themselves heard. Having taken the Anfield anthem to their hearts in recent years, the noise before the game was sensational, and it was captured in the ground by Borussia Dortmund's official Instagram account. Unfortunately for the travelling fans, however, the result did not match the support as Dortmund went down 4-0 to a rampant Liverpool attack. Daniel Sturridge opened the scoring after 10 minutes, before Dejan Lovren netted from a corner just a few minutes later. Phillippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson then added to the scoreline after half time, but it did not dampen the German fans spirits, who sang right through until the end.","Over 1,000 Dortmund fans travel to Merseyside for Liverpool friendly .

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Spargo For Mailonline . The driver who struck and killed a fellow racer just three weeks ago is set to return to the track this weekend. Tony Stewart will return to Sprint Cup competition Sunday night at Atlanta Motor Speedway, ending a three-race hiatus taken after he struck and killed fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. during a dirt-track race. Stewart, 43, will also speak to the media for the first time since the incident this Friday. Scroll down for video . Tony Stewart, 43, will return to the track to race this Sunday, just three weeks after killing a fellow driver . The three-time NASCAR champion has not raced since his car hit  Ward at an Aug. 9 sprint car event in upstate New York. Stewart pulled out of the NASCAR race at Watkins Glen the next morning, then skipped races at Michigan and Bristol Motor Speedway. Stewart, who was described by police as ""visibly shaken"" the night of Ward's death, has been in seclusion ever since. His only comment since the crash was a statement the day after  in which he said, 'there aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.' Ward had climbed from his car after it had spun while racing for position with Stewart. The 20-year-old walked down onto the racing surface waving his arms in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart. Authorities said the first car to pass Ward had to swerve to miss hitting him. The front of Stewart's car then appeared to clear Ward, but Ward was struck by the right rear tire and hurtled through the air. He died of blunt force trauma. Kevin Ward Jr (right) was pronounced dead after being struck by NASCAR racer Tony Stewart's sprint car in Canandaigua, New York on Aug. 9 . Spectator video shows the tragic moment Kevin Ward Jr (pictured) was hit by NASCAR driver Tony Stewart while angrily approaching him after the champ spun him around on the track . There is still a decision pending on whether Stewart will be charged in Ward's death. Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said Thursday the investigation is still ongoing. NASCAR released a statement saying that Stewart was eligible to return because he 'has received all necessary clearances required to return to all racing activities.' The racing organization then added that they would have no further comment until President Mike Helton speaks Friday afternoon. Stewart, who has 48 career Cup wins in 542 starts, is one of the biggest stars in world of racing, and most of his peers have been protective of him as questions emerged in the aftermath of the crash. Racer Paul Kinney, however, said while he didn't witness the shocking crash in New York on Aug. 9, he did drive past Ward moments before he was hit by Stewart and could 'clearly' see Ward on the track. Driver Paul Kinney (pictured here with his girlfriend) said you could clearly see Kevin Ward Jr. on the track . Since Ward's death, NASCAR has announced a rule that prohibits drivers from exiting from a crashed or disabled vehicle — unless it is on fire — until safety personnel arrive. Last week, Denny Hamlin crashed while leading at Bristol and stayed in his car until safety personnel arrived.","Tony Stewart, 42, is set to race again after killing Kevin Ward Jr. on Aug. 9 .

"A teenager believed to have been killed . by a human trafficking gang may have had her foot sawn off while she was . still alive, it emerged today. Carina Saunders' dismembered body was found dumped in a duffel bag in Bethany, Oklahoma City, last October. A witness told police that one of the men charged with Carina's murder . beat her, tied her to a table and tortured her by sawing off her left . foot, documents revealed today. The suspect then tried to cut off the 19-year-old's right foot before the saw broke, it was claimed. Scroll down for video . Brutal crime: Luis Ruiz, left, has been charged with killing and dismembering Carina Saunders, right, in Oklahoma City . Horrific find: Saunders' remains were discovered inside a duffel bag in a field behind a Homeland grocery store . Authorities believe Carina was murdered to scare female witnesses so they would cooperate with a drug and human trafficking ring that the suspects were allegedly involved in. The revelation came after two men held in connection with her killing were yesterday formally charged with first-degree murder, NewsOk reported. Luis Enrique Ruiz , 37, and Jimmy Lee Massey Jr, 33, of Oklahoma City, had been identified as suspects in the case and have been in custody in the Oklahoma County jail for almost three weeks. According to a probable cause affidavit filed with his charges yesterday in Oklahoma County District Court, Ruiz planned and carried out the torture killing. In the affidavit, a woman named Michelle Hanshaw told police she went to a house in the city with Saunders and witnessed Ruiz 'physically beat Carina Saunders and then tie her up'. Ruiz then dragged Saunders to an upstairs room and tied her to a small table with rope and twine before using the saw on her feet, Hanshaw told Bethany police investigators. Hanshaw, according to the probable cause affidavit filed with the murder charge against Massey, 'jumped out a window to escape' after witnessing the killing. Elusive link: Police never revealed the supposed relationship between Saunders, 19, and Ruiz . Stephanie Howard, Ruiz's girlfriend . in October 2011, told investigators that on two occasions she and Ruiz . had to 'baby-sit' a girl Howard later learned was Carina Saunders, . police reported. Ruiz said Saunders was going to be 'dealt with', Howard told investigators. Another woman was at the house with . Saunders and Hanshaw, but left soon after, police reported. Tia Downour . said she had been told there was a video of the homicide on the phone, . and the phone belonged to Ruiz, the affidavit shows. Downour told investigators she shared . a room at the Bel-Aire Hotel with Ruiz in May, and when he went to the . bathroom, she viewed the video, police reported. 'Downour said she watched for a few . seconds until Saunders began to scream,' Bethany police Lt. JR Jencks . wrote in the affidavit, adding that she told investigators she . recognized Ruiz 'as the person in the video cutting off the foot of . Saunders'. Possible link: Ruiz's younger brother said Ms Saunders resembled a white woman that his brother used to 'hang out with' Caught: Ruiz was arrested on a larceny charge after allegedly trying to steal clothes from a Sears store . Another person interviewed by . detectives said Ruiz told him he 'had been the one that planned the . entire incident which resulted in the death of Carina Saunders', . according to the affidavit. Ruiz was arrested July 5 on a murder complaint. He and Massey are being held without bail in the Oklahoma County jail. Neither District Attorney David . Prater nor Bethany Police Chief Phil Cole would comment yesterday on . charges being filed in the case. Massey, while jailed on drug charges, . shared details of the slaying with two detainees, according to a . probable cause affidavit filed with his murder charge. He told the first detainee that he . participated in the homicide and said 'they cut the girl's arms and legs . off,' the lieutenant wrote in the affidavit. House of horrors: In December 2011, police found blood, hair, and a blood-stained knife inside an apartment where they believe Saunders was tortured and killed . Suspects: Police arrested Jimmy Massey, top left, Alejandro Rojas, top right, Michael 'Monster' Knight, bottom left, and Luis Soto, bottom right, on drug charges possibly related to Saunders' murder . The second detainee told police Massey 'gave handwritten statements in the form of passed notes' describing what parts of the woman's body were dismembered and 'perhaps more importantly,' how the body was wrapped before disposal,' the lieutenant wrote. 'Those same notes have been compared to known samples of Jimmy Massey's hand writing and appear to be from the same person on initial examination,' Jencks wrote. Downour, who told investigators she left the house shortly after Saunders and Hanshaw arrived, said Massey, who she also knew as 'Country,' was there when she left, according to Massey's affidavit. A confidential witness told police she was kidnapped and forced to watch as members of a human trafficking ring tortured and killed Saunders to send a message to others to cooperate with their illegal activities. Neither prosecutors nor police would comment on that aspect of the killing. According to court records, Massey admitted to kidnapping a woman and making her watch as Saunders was tortured and killed October 9. Massey also described how Saunders' body was dismembered and left in a field behind the Homeland grocery store 15 miles away from her home in Mustang.","Documents reveal witness claimed Carina Saunders was tortured .

Less than half of the adult population is now married, figures confirmed for the first time yesterday. The watershed for marriage is the . culmination of 30 years during which cohabitation has become the norm . and successive governments have ceased to offer tax breaks, legal . privileges or state approval to the married. Figures from the Office for National . Statistics showed that 21.6million of the 44.9million adults who live in . England and Wales are married – 48.4 per cent of the population. The number of those who have never tied the knot has doubled since the 1970s. The statistics also highlight the rise of the so-called freemale, revealing that almost one in three women have never wed. Nearly eight million women live the . single life or opt for informal cohabiting relationships rather than . have a husband and family. The ONS said many of the freemales were women . in their 20s and 30s, who have achieved a better standard of education . than boys and have gone on in ever greater numbers to pursue careers. Married people first appeared to fall . into a minority three years ago, but ONS analysts insisted the numbers . were misleading, saying they failed to take into account large numbers . who marry abroad. A graph shows how those who are single, divorced or widowed are now outnumbering the proportion of married adults in England and Wales . Further data shows that the number of adult females who are widowed has increased at a much higher rate than males . The new count, however, which sets out . the married population in the middle of last year, does include . estimates of those who married before migrating to Britain, or while . living as expats abroad, or as tourists away on holiday. The ONS presented the decline of . marriage as less swift in England than elsewhere. ‘The proportion of the . adult population of England and Wales who are married is one of the . highest in Europe,’ it said. The estimates said 21,643,000 are . husbands or wives, while there are just under 16million single people . who have never married and just over 3.1million divorcees. The remainder . is made up of widows or widowers. The combined count of never-married . and divorced people amounts to nearly 46 per cent of the population and . at current rates will overtake the married population within a few . years.

'I was quite angry about his mannerism and... that he was on my side of the road and it seemed somehow disrespectful.' 'I am only 22 and, not generalising about 22-years-olds or anything, but you sometimes just tweet things you don't actually mean.

"By . Harriet Cooke . Ditched: Martin Clunes, 50, is no longer advertising Churchill Insurance after racking up a series of speeding offences . Actor Martin Clunes has been dropped from a car insurance campaign after being disqualified from driving, it emerged today. The Men Behaving Badly and Doc Martin star had featured in Churchill Insurance's television adverts alongside the company's trademark nodding dog for almost a year. But it is understood the 50-year-old, who lives with his family in Dorset, was deemed no longer compatible with car insurance advertising. The decision was taken after he informed the company he had reached 12 points on his licence for speeding offences and was banned by magistrates under totting up rules. A spokesman for Churchill said: 'We have worked with Martin Clunes in a brand advertising campaign since December 2011. 'Martin Clunes recently informed Churchill Insurance that his driving licence has been suspended after he accumulated penalty points for four speeding offences. 'Churchill Insurance currently has no adverts with Martin Clunes on air and will be moving forward with new advertising in the New Year.' It is not clear where the offences happened or how fast Clunes was travelling. His agent, Independent Talent Group, has not responded to requests for comment. During a 2004 appearance on the Star In A Reasonably Priced Car feature on the BBC's Top Gear programme, Clunes was described as an 'incredibly brave' driver with 'no experience of track driving'. At the time he said he was driving a BMW 6 Series but that his real love was for campervans. According to Marketing Magazine, the ads were part of a marketing exercise thought to cost in the region of £50 million. Clunes and an animatronic version of the Churchill dog travel together on a Triumph motorbike and sidecar through the English countryside, helping out neighbours in trouble. Referring to Clunes, marketing director Amanda Walker told the magazine: 'He is highly credible and consumers have grown up with him, so he lends extra trust to the campaign.' Scroll down for video .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Britain has dodged a triple-dip recession and is finally on the road to recovery, a leading international watchdog declared today. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said the UK economy grew at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. That is the equivalent of just over 0.1 per cent on a quarterly basis and enough to avoid another recession following the 0.3 per cent slump in the final three months of 2012. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 . Pier Carlo Padoan, deputy general secretary of the OECD and its chief economist, said the situation 'is still fragile' but 'improvements are beginning to be seen'. The Paris-based think tank said growth would pick up to an annual rate of 1.4 per cent in the second quarter of the year as Britain emerges from the economic doldrums. It came as official UK figures showed the crucial services sector grew by 0.3 per cent in January - its strongest rate of expansion for five months. The Office for National Statistics said output in the sector, which makes up three-quarters of the economy and includes pubs, stock brokers and hairdressers, was 0.8 per cent higher than a year earlier. It bolstered hopes that Britain has avoided a triple-dip recession despite the freezing weather and the crisis in Cyprus. The ONS will publish the official number for the first quarter in late April. Mr Padoan said: 'The situation [in the UK] is still fragile. I think the policy course, both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, is going in the right direction and improvements are beginning to be seen.' While the unemployment rate has fallen, a sign of an improving economy, the depseration of jobseekers was laid bare today when 4,000 people turned out hoping to find work at a new shopping centre. Long queues started to build two hours before the jobs fair at the Solent Hotel, in Whiteley, Hampshire, got under way, drawing in people from all walks off life clutching CVs and laptops in a bid to make the right impression. A one-in-one-out policy was operated as queues mounted for a jobs fair at the Solent Hotel, in Hampshire . Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The 0.3 per cent rise in services output in January is very good news for hopes that the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013 and dodge a triple dip. 'The odds are swinging towards the . economy avoiding another GDP fall in the first quarter as long as the . latest bout of snow does not have a significant distorting impact.' But . other analysts were less confident. Alan . Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said: 'It's a close call but my . feeling is a triple-dip recession is more likely than not.' Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: 'The economy is flatlining. 2013 will probably be a write-off.' The OECD forecasts will be a welcome boost for Chancellor George Osborne . Britain is trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century and the economy is still more than three per cent smaller than it was before the crisis struck in 2008. A third recession since then would be a further setback for George Osborne in the wake of last week's gloomy Budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed in half its growth forecasts for this year to just 0.6 per cent and said the deficit-reduction plan has stalled. But it predicted growth of 0.1 per cent in the first quarter - indicating that there will be no triple-dip - although the Bank of England has warned the chances of another recession are 50-50. Britain has already been stripped of its AAA credit rating by international agency Moody's and rival Fitch has warned that the country faces another downgrade by the end of April as the Chancellor struggles to deal with the soaring national debt. It is feared that another downgrade could sent the pound tumbling and drive up borrowing costs for the government, businesses and households. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: 'Stronger growth in the services sector at the start of the year has greatly reduced the risk of the UK falling back into a triple-dip recession. 'The country is not out of the woods yet, with much depending on how the economy has coped with adverse weather conditions in recent months, and the indications are that any growth is still disappointingly weak. 'Even if the political embarrassment of a triple-dip recession is avoided, the underlying weakness of the economy still has the potential to trigger further credit rating downgrades, putting selling pressure on gilts and sterling.'","OECD says that the worst of the economic gloom has passed .

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . and Associated Press . The United Nations refugee agency says the civil war in Syria has forced a record three million people out of the country, an increase of one million from almost exactly a year ago. With about one of every eight Syrians fleeing across the border, and 6.5million others displaced within the country's borders, the Geneva-based agency says over half of all those uprooted are children. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a statement Friday that the Syrian crisis has become 'the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era' with almost half of all Syrians forced to abandon their homes and flee for their lives since the conflict began in March 2011. Scroll down for video . A resident carries a wounded child injured by what activists claim was a car explosion in central Douma, eastern al-Ghouta, near Damascus, in July . Syria had a prewar population of 23 million. The Islamic State group, meanwhile, is taking violence against civilians in Syria 'to a new level,' threatening the cross-border humanitarian aid operations recently approved by the Security Council, a top U.N. aid official said. The U.N.'s deputy humanitarian chief, Kyung-wha Kang, told the council that both the extremists and the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front are advancing on border crossings with Turkey 'and could hinder additional cross-border operations.' The threat comes as U.N. humanitarian officials reported the first bit of improvement on getting aid to hard-to-reach people inside Syria. Crisis: Newly-arrived Syrian refugees carry their belongings as they walk at Azraq refugee camp near Al Azraq area, east of Amman, August 19, 2014. The camp, which has a capacity to accommodate 50,000 people, has so far received around 10,498 refugees, according to the United Nations . Displaced: The civil war in Syria has forced a record three million people out of the country. Pictured is the Azraq refugee camp near Al Azraq . Getting aid to Syrians trapped in the more than three-year conflict has been a challenge, with the Syrian government insisting it approve any shipments. In July, the council unanimously approved a resolution authorizing cross-border delivery of aid to Syrians in rebel-held areas without government approval through four crossings with Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. Now the Islamic State group's fighters are threatening two of the three that are operational, at Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa, Kang said. She also expressed alarm at the group's 'horrific atrocities' in central Syria. She cited local sources as saying that up to 700 members of a tribe accused by the Islamic State group of apostasy have been killed or kidnapped over the past two weeks, 'some beheaded or crucified.' The Islamic State group, also known as Isis, seeks to establish a caliphate in the Middle East and has moved with ease between Syria and neighboring Iraq. U.S. officials have said President Barack Obama is considering whether to expand the U.S. military effort against the group to include airstrikes inside Syria. Kang said the past month showed improvement in humanitarian access for the first time in half a year. The U.N. has sent nine shipments of aid into Syria since the council resolution in July through the crossings with Turkey and Jordan, including food assistance for about 69,500 people. All of the shipments crossed into Syria without incident, Kang said. Challenges remain in getting more aid into the country, and British Ambassador to the U.N. Mark Lyall Grant told reporters after Kang's briefing that the number being reached with the new cross-border delivery options 'is relatively small.' In a statement, the U.N. representative of the opposition Syrian Coalition, Najib Ghadbian, said: 'To bring security and governance to Syria, comprehensive action by members of the Security Council is needed to stop the consequences of the current crisis - the rise of terrorist groups like Isis - and eliminate its root cause: the Assad dictatorship.'","About one in every eight Syrians have now fled the country, the UN said .

Messages flowed in from friends, family and supporters for the father-of-one, expressing their heartbreak at hearing the news. One person wrote: 'Words can't summarise what I'm feeling right now. All the inspiration you brought to so many will never be forgotten Rome. You are a beautiful soul. You will be missed brother. Roll on'. Another said: 'RIP Rome.. Even though I've never met you in person, I have followed your journey and progress for some time..Your strength and determination has forever inspired me and my family (my husband and father both have cancer)..Thoughts and prayers go out to Rachel and the Torti family'. Earlier this year Rome made the heartbreaking decision to give up his battle to spend whatever time he has left with his young family and said moving forward he was going to embrace each day he has left with wife Rachel and son Ryder. The tribute spoke of his positive attitude and strength throughout the ordeal . The photographer had been battling cancer for the same amount of time he was married to wife Rachel and the entirety of his son Ryder' life . 'Rome has been battling his guts out for the past five and a half years... He has constantly been juggling medicine, treatments, supplements, therapies and operations,' a post on his supporter Facebook page said. 'Rome recently had a big fight for his health and came through with miraculous results. At the end of that battle, he also made a big decision. That decision was to switch from fight to peace.' Mr Torti underwent major surgery two days before Christmas last year so renowned surgeon Dr Charlie Teo could remove the Giloblatoma Multiforme Grade 4 malignant brain tumour and buy the young father some time. But the tumour, which had begun to wrap around Mr Torti's brain stem, was one of the worst Dr Teo had seen and the operation left him with paralysis. Mr Torti, a well known skate photographer on the Gold Coast, had already tried chemotherapy, radiation, natural therapies, supplements, oxygen therapy and even an expensive experimental German treatment called oncothermia, which he planned to try once more this year in Germany. 'He and his family have spent all their free time and energy fighting against a tumour that was supposed to take him years ago,' the Facebook page post said.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . The four-inch valve which Herr Geier believes was part of the orange juice machine . Corporate fast food giant McDonald’s is being sued by a man who claims he was speared in the throat by a piece of machinery. Klaus Geier, a German national, went to a San Fernando Valley McDonald's in April 2012, where he used the drive-through to order a chicken sandwich, chips and a large orange juice. Herr Geier says that because there were no straws available he took the lid off the drink and began to drink according to the website tmz.com. As he drank he claims that felt something catch in his throat – a four-inch valve which he believes was part of the orange juice machine. Herr Geier says that he put his fingers in his mouth to retrieve the valve and ‘the serrated spear on the tip deployed and fired into his oesophagus’. He pulled out the piece ripping his throat in the process. He now says he is left with two options: surgery which could cause him to lose his voice or live with an affected raspy voice. Herr Geier’s lawyer Anthony Liberatore told MailOnline he was unable to comment. MailOnline has contacted McDonald’s for a statement. Klaus Geier went to a San Fernando Valley McDonald's in April 2012, where he used the drive-thru to order a chicken sandwich, chips and a large orange juice.

In 1994, they were sued by 79-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled hot coffee in her lap while sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson's car. She sued the corporation claiming that the drink was too hot. The jury found that McDonald's was 80 per cent liable and Mrs Liebeck 20 per cent and awarded her more than $2million, The suit was finally settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.","Klaus Geier went to a San Fernando Valley McDonald's in April 2012 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 19:16 EST, 7 March 2012 . A mother who put the seven-year-old boy she adopted on a plane to his native Russia with a note saying she no longer wanted him, has been sued for unpaid child support. Torry Hansen, a 34-year-old nurse, has repeatedly failed to appear in court and at depositions involving the care of Artem Saveliev, now nine. Circuit Court Judge Lee Russell in Tennessee ruled that she must pay child support for the boy whom she sent back to Russia alone in April 2010. Rejection: Torry-Ann Hansen, from Tennessee, plays with her adoptive son Artem at the Vladivostok orphanage. She sent him back in Moscow alone in 2010 with a note saying she did not want him . A lawsuit filed by the adoption . agency demanded child support and other damages that will be held in a . trust for Artem, who now lives in a group home in a Moscow suburb. Hansen took the little boy from an orphanage and gave him a new life with her in Shelbyville in 2009. Less than a year later, she decided she did not want the child anymore and packed him on a ten-hour flight to Moscow with a note 'to whom it may concern' saying: 'I no longer wish to parent this . child'. She claimed the child was 'mentally . unstable' and that his problems were hidden from her by Russian . orphanage officials before she adopted him. Heartbreak: Artem now lives at a group home in Moscow. The director of the orphanage says he 'tries to forget' about his life in the U.S. 'He . is violent and has severe psychopathic issues/behaviour. I was lied to . and misled by the Russian orphanage workers and director regarding his . mental stability,' Hansen wrote. The adoption agency, World Association . for Children and Parents, had sued Hansen for breach of contract and child support for the boy. At an earlier court appearance on . February 23, attorney Larry Crain said Artem was still an American . citizen and Hansen was still legally his mother under U.S. law - although . the adoption was revoked in Russia. The judge will hear arguments in May as to how much money Hansen should pay to the child she rejected. The adoptive mother was never . criminally charged in the case that sparked outrage and caused a near . diplomatic row between Russia and the U.S. Hansen has moved to California, although her exact whereabouts were unknown, the court was told. Unwanted: Artem Saveliev is led away by authorities after being rejected by his adoptive American mother . She has refused to talk to investigators since April 2010 when she sent Artem, then known as Justin Hansen, alone on the ten-hour flight with a backpack full of candy and coloring pencils. Artem has been living for the past few months at SOS Village in the Moscow suburb of Tomilino, according to village director Anatoly Vasilyev. Although technically an orphanage, it provides a home and family environment to children who have lost hope of being adopted. Children aged from seven to 16 are watched over at the centre by a woman who also doubles as a teacher. Mr Asilyev said Artem 'tries to forget about his life in the States', and that was the reason why the orphanage was not allowing the media to see him. He added that he gets along well with other children and has almost forgotten English, preferring not to speak it. Torry Hansen's mother Nancy recently said she did not believe Artem was traumatized by being sent home alone on the flight to Russia. Mrs Hansen said: 'All I can say he was very happy when he was on the plane. 'Witnesses have said that he was running all around and he was happy. There were stewardesses watching over him.'","Torry Hansen, 34, put boy on flight to Moscow in 2010 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The appointment of a new CEO by the company that makes the Firefox Web browser has prompted board members to quit, a Twitter frenzy and a push back from a leading dating website because he supported California's former gay marriage ban. Mozilla, the nonprofit maker of the Firefox browser, infuriated many employees and users last week by hiring co-founder Brendan Eich to lead the Mountain View company. In 2008, Eich gave $1,000 to the campaign to pass California's Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that outlawed same-sex marriages in California until the U.S. Supreme Court left in place a lower-court ruling striking it down. The contribution was publicly reported and drew some negative attention two years ago, when Eich was Mozilla's chief technology officer. But when he was promoted to CEO last week, his support of the ban took on more gravitas. Scroll down for video . Prop 8: Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, supported California's proposed ban on gay marriage . Three of the Mozilla Foundation's six board members have quit, according to a Wall Street Journal blog, and thousands of employees and community members weighed in on Twitter over the weekend. On Monday, New York-based dating service OkCupid.com replaced its usual home page for users logging in with Firefox. 'Hello there, Mozilla Firefox user. Pardon this interruption of your OkCupid experience. Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, is an opponent of equal rights for gay couples. We would therefore prefer that our users not use Mozilla software to access OkCupid,' the message says. OkCupid President Christian Rudder said he and the firm's three other co-founders decided to post the message after discussing Eich's appointment over the weekend. Boycott: OKCupid posted this note to users on its website on Monday, urging users to boycott Mozilla . He said 12 percent of OkCupid's approximately 3 billion monthly page views come through Firefox, while 8 percent of the site's users are gay or lesbian. 'We don't think this was the right thing for people to donate money to, and this is someone we do business with so we decided to take action,' Rudder said. Mozilla, which is promoted with the slogan, 'Doing good is part of our code,' responded Monday with an emailed statement saying the company supports equality for all, including marriage equality for gay couples. Inequality: California's Proposition 8 essentially banned same-sex couples from getting married until it was deemed unconstitutional . I am deeply honored and humbled by the CEO role. I’m also grateful for the messages of support. At the same time, I know there are concerns about my commitment to fostering equality and welcome for LGBT individuals at Mozilla. I hope to lay those concerns to rest, first by making a set of commitments to you. More important, I want to lay them to rest by actions and results.A number of Mozillians, including LGBT individuals and allies, have stepped forward to offer guidance and assistance in this. I cannot thank you enough, and I ask for your ongoing help to make Mozilla a place of equality and welcome for all. Here are my commitments, and here’s what you can expect:    -Active commitment to equality in everything we do, from employment to events to community-building.    -Working with LGBT communities and allies, to listen and learn what does and doesn’t make Mozilla supportive and welcoming.    -My ongoing commitment to our Community Participation Guidelines, our inclusive health benefits, our anti-discrimination policies, and the spirit that underlies all of these.    -My personal commitment to work on new initiatives to reach out to those who feel excluded or who have been marginalized in ways that makes their contributing to Mozilla and to open source difficult. More on this last item below. I know some will be skeptical about this, and that words alone will not change anything. I can only ask for your support to have the time to “show, not tell”; and in the meantime express my sorrow at having caused pain.Mozilla is a movement composed of different people around the world, working productively together on a common mission. This is important to our ability to work and grow around the world.Many Mozillians and others know me as a colleague or a friend. They know that I take people as they come and work with anyone willing to contribute. At the same time, I don’t ask for trust free of context, or without a solid structure to support accountability. No leader or person who has a privileged position should. I want to be held accountable for what I do as CEO. I fully expect you all to do so.I am committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, economic status, or religion.You will see exemplary behavior from me toward everyone in our community, no matter who they are; and the same toward all those whom we hope will join, and for those who use our products. Mozilla’s inclusive health benefits policies will not regress in any way. And I will not tolerate behavior among community members that violates our Community Participation Guidelines or (for employees) our inclusive and non-discriminatory employment policies.You’ll also see more from Mozilla under my leadership in the way of efforts to include potential contributors, especially those who lack privilege. This entails several projects, starting with Project Ascend, which is being developed by Lukas Blakk. I intend to demonstrate with meaningful action my commitment to a Mozilla that lives up to its ideals, including that of being an open and inclusive community. 'No matter who you are or who you love, everyone deserves the same rights and to be treated equally,' said the statement. 'OkCupid never reached out to us to let us know of their intentions, nor to confirm facts.' On his personal website, Eich posted a note titled 'Inclusiveness at Mozilla,' in which he promises an 'active commitment to equality in everything we do.' Mozilla says about half a billion people around the world use Firefox, which has free, open software written in part by volunteers. Firefox has been losing market share to Google Inc.'s Chrome browser in recent years.","Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich has caused several of the company's board members to quit .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Los Angeles has a plan to save its fading movie and television industries. That’s right, the entertainment industry in Los Angeles is fading. With most big-budget films and television shows now being filmed on location outside of Tinsletown as they gobble up tax credits elsewhere, newly elected mayor Eric Garcetti wants to expand the state’s incentive program and create the position of film czar in an effort to keep entertainment industry employment from falling any further into a state of 'emergency.' Of this summer’s highest-budget films, Iron Man 3 was shot in North Carolina, The Lone Ranger in New Mexico and Utah, and the Great Gatsby was shot in Australia, according to Variety. The state’s share of hour-long network dramas fell from 89 per cent in 2005 to only 39 per cent last year. Tinseltown landmark: Though the Hollywood sign is still there, many of the entertainment industry jobs it looked over have disappeared from Los Angeles . Big and small-screen productions fleeing to locations with higher tax incentives have caused production and other industry-related positions in Los Angeles to drop from a high of over 136,000 in 1997 to just under 116,000 in 2011, according to Variety. That number is up from a low of just over 94,000 though, which was during a recession. This loss in jobs doesn’t just affect the people in the industry it also has an impact on support business such as equipment suppliers and caterers, Garcetti told Variety. This, in turn causes a trickle-down effect that hurts the economy as a whole, leading to what Garcetti calls an 'emergency.' Man with a plan: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti wants to expand tax credits to the industry to save jobs . Over 40 states, Australia, Canada and the UK now offer credits that are chipping away at Hollywood’s bread and butter. The state’s current incentive program is limited, but popular, according to Variety. In order to qualify for incentives, a movie must have a budget between $1million and $75million, small beans compared to the $200million blockbusters filming elsewhere. Despite this, it has been so popular a lottery system has been set up to fairly dole out the credits. This too has been met with criticism, with producers complaining the uncertainty makes it harder to budget features, according to Variety. Old school: movies are increasingly filmed on-location and less on sound stages in lots owned by large studios . The first step to solving this problem, Garcetti told assembled media short . ly after he was elected, is appoint a movie czar similar to what New York has between city hall and the industry. This would help producers cut through all the red tape and get to work sooner, Garcetti argued. The mayor also believes the tax credit program should be expanded, but not given a blank check. ‘It is not in some people’s interest to see California win,’ Garcetti told the magazine, adding ‘they may benefit from this competition being in as many places as possible, because it has been a race to the bottom. And I certainly won’t lead a race to the bottom.’ Garcetti believes that the state’s $100million tax incentive program isn’t enough, but it shouldn’t be unlimited, he told Variety. New York has a program just over $400million, Variety noted. Symbolic: Garcetti fears that the city's title of 'movie capital of the world' will largely become symbolic if something is not done . Incentives: Garcetti believes a film czar, like the one employed in New York, and tax credits will lure movies and television dramas back to Tinsletown . The sometimes actor – Garcetti played the mayor of Los Angeles in a few episodes of ‘The Closer’ before he was actually elected to the job – argues that for every $70million spent on tax incentives, $5billion in economic activity is created. Those numbers come from the worst-performing study, Garcetti noted to Variety. ‘Some studies have shown, at worst, some small debit to the state treasury, which is then multiplied many times over in economic activity,’ said Garcetti. Another idea would be to provide credits to commercial shoots. Though not the big-time productions movies and television shows require, they would at least preserve the infrastructure and the jobs, according to Garcetti. A $15million bill for those incentives stalled in the California State House earlier this year. ‘We are going to fight a lot of fights,’ Garcetti told the magazine. ‘I know we are not going to win every single one of them. But if we don’t put a lot of strength toward winning a couple of battles in this war, we are just going to continue to be left behind on the battlefield.’","Entertainment industry jobs are plummeting, hurting the economy and eroding the infrastructure the city has to support the industry .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Whistleblower Chelsea Manning says the military is continuing to deny her sex change treatment one year after she was jailed for handing secret documents to WikiLeaks. The former US army private, sentenced to 35-years under the name Bradley, revealed she is being forced to live as a man at Fort Leavenworth prison, Kansas. Manning says the Defense Department has not followed through with its promises after defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, approved a treatment plan that includes allowing her to dress as a woman. Scroll down for video . Chelsea Manning, formerly Bradley, says the military is continuing to deny her sex change treatment . She is now prepared to sue the military over the failure to carry out any recommendations, except 'lip service'. 'Unfortunately, despite silence, and then lip-service, the military has not yet provided me with any such treatment,' she wrote in a letter to broadcaster NBC said. 'For example, in my daily life, I am reminded of this when I look at the name on my badge, the first initial sewed into my clothing, the hair and grooming standards that I adhere to, and the titles and courtesies used by the staff. 'Ultimately, I just want to be able to live my life as the person that I am, and to be able to feel comfortable in my own skin.' Manning was sentenced to 35-years in jail after being convicted of leaking nearly 700,000 documents to the site WikiLeaks. The documents revealed a 38-minute video of an American airstrike in Baghdad that killed two Reuters journalists and wounded children, as well as embarrassing diplomatic cables. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel approved a treatment plan for Manning (pictured) that includes allowing her to dress as a woman, but the former US army private claims she has only received 'lip treatment' Manning (left) was sentenced to 35-years in jail after being convicted of leaking nearly 700,000 documents to the site WikiLeaks, under Julian Assange (right) Shortly after the sentence was handed down, Manning went public with her gender dysphoria - the sense of being a woman in a man's body. And the former intelligence analyst asked for a treatment plan that would consider three measures: dressing and living as a woman, hormone therapy and possible surgery. Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, said that the military has failed to carry out the recommendations and that he is prepared to sue. 'The military's failure to comply with the treatment recommendations and protocols for Chelsea's diagnosed gender dysmorphia violates her well-established constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment,' he said. The Army declined to say when treatment might begin. The October 2010 release by Wikileaks of hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and a video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed civilians, was the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. Following the documents' publication Manning was arrested and the Wikileaks site closed down. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange recently announced that he will 'soon' leave Ecuador's embassy in London, where he has been holed up for two years to avoid extradition. Police have been stationed at the compound since Mr Assange requested political asylum from Ecuador in June 2012, ready to arrest him if he sets foot outside. In September last year, Manning requested a presidential pardon for handing U.S state secrets to the WikiLeaks website because it was done 'out of a love for my country'.

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . New lord of the manor: Nicholas Johnston, an old Etonian chum of David Cameron, the Prime Minister, has bought an entire coastal village in Devon . An old Etonian chum of the Prime Minister has been revealed as the mystery buyer of an entire coastal village in Devon. Nicholas Johnston, 42, fought off a rival bid from the National Trust to snap up the Bantham Estate in Devon, which was on the market for £11.5million. His family already control the Great Tew Estate in Oxfordshire, where he hosts the annual Cornbury music festival, regularly attended by David Cameron and nicknamed 'Poshstock' for its moneyed attendees. Until now the identity of the Bantham Estate's new owner had been shrouded in secrecy, with the sellers only speaking to deny rumours the buyer was a Russian oligarch or an investment firm. The current owner is Evans Estates, a family-owned company formed by the descendants of Lieutenant Commander Charles Evans who began buying up Bantham in 1918. Today the 728-acre estate includes of a village shop, a golf course, a mooring, a thatched boathouse on the River Avon, an oyster farm and the grand-sounding Lordship of the Manor of Bigbury, the Sunday Telegraph reports. It also includes ownership of Bantham beach, various properties in and around the village of Bantham, and is responsible for managing the Bantham harbour facilities. The National Trust had put in a bid for part of the land in an attempt to protect its coastline. Barbara Tucker, who runs the village shop, told the Sunday Telegraph she was relieved to learn Mr Johnston would be the new lord of the manor. 'I have heard of the Tew Estate and it's pretty well run, so it sounds like we won't have to worry,' she said. 'If he has run an estate nicely and properly maybe that will be better for us - maybe he will put those ideas into practice here.' She added that she will have to look him up so she would be able to recognise him. Picturesque: The village of Bantham, which includes a number of properties owned by the Bantham Estate . Unspoilt: The countryside around Bantham. Locals had feared the estate would be bought by a Russian oligarch . Beautiful: The estate also boasts the ownership of Bantham beach. These dramatic cliffs are nearby . Mr Johnston's enterprises at Great Tew include a farm, a quarry and a large property portfolio. External firms also use the estate's 4,000 acres to offer shooting classes and rally driving lessons. Each year Mr Johnston and his wife also host the Cornbury Music Festival, which you may not have heard of but is almost-annually haunted by the Prime Minister, his family, and other members of the well-heeled Chipping Norton set including Jeremy Clarkson and Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of the News Of The World. Last year Mr Cameron raised eyebrows with his choice of attire as he walked around the site barefoot and appeared to be sporting a pair of fake Ray-Ban sunglasses after enjoying a private lunch with the Johnstons. The festival boasts music across four stages and also has an exclusive VIP area. On the festival’s website, the 'eclectic and eccentric' event is described as a 'dynamic summer festival disguised as a country fayre - a lovingly crafted, top notch, very English open air party, tailor-made for the whole family'. The site adds: 'Like the best of England, Cornbury is eccentric, charming and irresistible - a homespun melting pot where music-lovers share pies and a glass of champagne with superstars, toffs, rockers, crooners, Morris dancers, farmers, urbanites, fashionistas, gourmet chefs and the little old ladies who make exceptional cakes.' Poshstock: Girls sell flowers at The Cornbury Festival in Oxfordshire, which is hosted by Mr Johnston . Actress Tina Hobley - formerly of TV drama Holby City - was also spotted among festival-goers. The Bantham Beach website says the ethos of the current owners 'has always been to allow Bantham to remain a place of outstanding beauty, with the village’s old thatched cottages portraying an image of unchanging charm and the beach and its surrounds staying as wild and natural as can be.' It adds: 'Evans Estates has consistently set its face against commercialisation of the beach. It is determined that families should continue to enjoy a peaceful day out in an unspoilt environment.' A source with knowledge of the sale, which is yet to be signed and sealed, told the Sunday Telegraph 'obviously different owners will do different things' but denied Mr Johnston was pursuing any of the 'mad ideas' that have circulated as rumours in the locality. The sale is being handled by Strutt & Parker, which declined to comment on Mr Johnston's plans for the estate.","Nicholas Johnston fought off rival National Trust bid for the Bantham Estate .

"By . Sara Malm . Defense giants Lockheed Martin is stopping all donations of the Boy Scouts of America as a result of the organizations continued ban on homosexual leaders. The company said is will no longer support any nonprofit organizations that do not align with its commitment to diversity or corporate policies on equality. Aerospace manufacturer Lockheed follows companies such as UPS Inc., Merck & Co. and computer-chip maker Intel in withdrawing support for the Boy Scouts over its anti-gay policy in the past two years. Boy scout ban: Lockheed Martin is ceasing all financial support for the Boy Scouts over its continued ban on homosexual Scout leaders . Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has not disclosed how much it has contributed to the Boy Scouts over the years. ‘We believe engaging with and funding an organization that openly discriminates is in conflict with our policies,’ Lockheed Martin spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Thursday. ‘While we applaud the mission of the Boy Scouts and the good things they do in our communities, their policies that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and religious affiliation conflict with Lockheed Martin policies.’ This year, the Boy Scouts of America revised its policy to allow homosexual young men to participate in Scouting, however, it maintained the ban on gay leaders. The change drew criticism from both side, as several of the century-old organisation's sponsors are relatively conservative denominations - notably the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Southern Baptist churches. Making a stand: Lockheed Martin follows companies such as UPS and Intel in withdrawing support for the Boy Scouts of America over its anti-gay policy . Voice for equality: Lockheed Martin, who introduced the 100th F-35 fighter in Fort Worth, Texas, last Friday, has pulled its donations as Boy Scouts of America did not follow the company's commitment to diversity . The Boy Scouts's overall 'traditional youth membership' - Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers - is now about 2.6 million, compared with more than 4 million in peak years of the past. It also has about 1 million adult leaders and volunteers. Of the more than 100,000 Scouting units in the U.S., 70 per cent are chartered by religious institutions. Other companies who have made pro-equality statements have found themselves banned by organizations claiming to be 'supporting marriage' Cookie brand Oreo found themselves boycotted by anti-gay campaigners after a photograph of a rainbow stacked cookie was posted onto to company Facebook page during Pride month. General Mills, who owns household staple brands such as Betty Crocker, Cheerios and Green Giant, found themselves boycotter by the National organization for Marriage when they opposed the Minnestota Marriage Amendment. Levi's upset Republican groups in 1992 when they pulled their funding over the Boy Scouts's 'Three Gs' rule, which welcomed anyone as long as they are not 'gay, godless or a girl'. Clothing chain American Apparel saw a Washington, D.C. store vandalized by anti-LGBT protestors when they put a 'Legalize Gay' t-shirt in their window in 2009. They responded by promising tshirts to all gay rights groups in the state. Source: Huffington Post . Mr Johndroe said Lockheed Martin was pleased to see the Boy Scouts revise its membership policy but opposes the continued ban on gay leadership. The company's review of its philanthropy came at the end of the year as it reevaluates priorities for 2014, he said. ‘We're taking a close look at all nonprofit organizations we support to ensure they align with our company's core values,’ Johndroe said. Deron Smith, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts, said Lockheed Martin was not a national sponsor but has had a positive impact by supporting Scouting in local communities. ‘We respect the company's right to express its own opinion and appreciate its recognition that Scouting is a valuable organization,’ he said in an email. ‘Scouting believes that good people can personally disagree on this topic and still work together to accomplish the common good.’ As well as the lifting of the man on gay members, the recent appointment of a new Boy Scouts of America president has been hailed as a step in the right direction. In October, the Boy Scouts of America announced that former Defense Secretary Robert Gates will serve as its next president to lead its national executive board for two years. Gates was an Eagle Scout. As defense secretary under President Barack Obama, Gates helped change the military's ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell’ policy banning openly gay soldiers. He also served under President George W. Bush. Gay-rights groups have praised the appointment of Gates and called on him to push the organization to end discrimination against gay adults.","Defense company pulls Boy Scouts donations over anti-gay policy .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Playboy covergirl Brandi Brandt has been jailed for more than three years for conspiring to import cocaine on planes bound for Australia. Brandt, best known for her failed marriage to Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx, was involved in a brazen US-Australia cocaine importation syndicate that hid packages of the drugs in toilets on Los Angeles passenger planes bound for Sydney in 2007. She pleaded guilty to conspiring to import more than two kilograms of the drug and transferring more than $70,000 into bank accounts over the sale. Scroll down for video . The former wife of Motley Crue basist Nikki Sixx was jailed for six years for her role in conspiring to import cocaine from the US to Australia . Claims to fame: Brandt was married to Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx (left), the father of her three children, and was Palymate of the Month for October 1987 (right) In sentencing the mother of three on Friday, Judge Peter Zahra told the Sydney District Court that her role in the criminal enterprise was 'substantially lower' than her co-accused, including former lover and stuntman Rusty Setser. He could not be satisfied, he said, that she ever touched the drug packages or was aware of the quantities involved. Mr Zahra said the 45-year-old's childhood had been beset with drug use. Her mother, Maria 'Brie' Darling, was a musician and as a child Brandt was surrounded by drugs. He said by the time she was 12 or 13, Brandt herself had begun to abuse drink and drugs, and went off to live with her father. While she was sober during her marriage to Sixx, the court heard the relationship's breakdown saw her return to drugs and alcohol.

Her subsequent relationship with Setser was marred by violence and heavy drug use, with Brandt telling a psychologist he was a 'ticking time bomb' and that he encouraged her to 'use more'. She was found guilty for conspiring to import cocaine for a brief period in November 2007. By 2009, Brandt was aware that authorities were interested in her and the fear of arrest was a 'significant emotional burden', Judge Zahra said. She was finally extradited from the US to Sydney in 2013 to face charges for her role in the cocaine-trafficking syndicate. Judge Zahra said she had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to reoffend. She will be eligible for parole in November 2016.","Playboy covergirl Brandi Brandt was jailed for six years in a Sydney Court .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Updated: . 17:04 GMT, 10 January 2012 . Out-dated teaching in mosques is behind a dramatic rise in the number of young Muslims going to prison, a top cleric has said. Ahtsham Ali, an adviser to the Prison Service, said that mosques in the UK fail to engage with the young men that come through their door because they use imams from overseas who are unable to preach in English. He said that more needs to be done to understand problems in society like family breakdown, arranged marriages and drugs. Mosques need to move with the times if they are to stop young Muslims from becoming disillusioned, Prison Service adviser Ahtsham Ali has said . He also said there was a difficulty with the absence of good male role models and too much emphasis on religious rituals. Mr Ali said: 'It is a tragedy. I have seen youngsters, the next generation, just totally switch off from it. This is dangerous. it allows others to take advantage to take up the vacuum.' Over the past year the Muslim prison population has reached 10,600, according to the Times, and accounts for 12.6 per cent of all prisoners - a huge over representation considering that just three per cent of the UK is Muslim. The rise over the past 20 years has been phenomenal with a jump from 1,957 inmates in 1991. Mr Ali says he works with some of the best imams in Britain with 55 full-time, 59 part-time and 96 running sessions in prisons. He said that they are able to get through to the under-30s, the group that is most likely to commit crime, because they approach them differently. 'Make religion fun,' he said. 'Have a pool table in the basement of the mosque, that kind of thing.' Muslims account for three per cent of the UK population, but 12.6 per cent of prison inmates . Mr Ali added that the emphasis needs to move away from the length of someone's beard and religious rituals. 'Prison imams will play five-a-side football, will go around and chat,' he said. 'Ask how was the film last night. That kind of relevant bonding is good.' He added: 'I have had prisoners say to me ""Tell me why do I have to go to prison to get a good imam?"" That is a sad state of affairs we have.' Mosques in the UK operate independently, according to Mr Ali, and many import imams from abroad. The lack of an ability to speak English is also compounded by a problem with imams not being able to relate to young Muslims, many of whom have been brought up in the UK and have a different outlook on the world. Inayat Bunglawala, chairman of Muslims for UK, said that one of the problems is that imams are poorly paid so there is a problem with recruitment.","Mosques use overseas clerics who cannot speak English and have different outlook, warns cleric .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Amish couple from Ohio who were sent to prison for hair-cutting attacks on other followers, have revealed how prison life gave them new experiences. Farmers Raymond and Kathryn Miller, who were part of a breakaway sect put on trial in 2011, have been introduced to public transport, fitness classes and even Mountain Dew soda. And although their Bergholz property has no electricity, the couple have even had a phone line installed so they can keep in contact with their probation officer. Changes: Kathryn and Raymond Miller were exposed to new experiences while in prison . Different world: Before prison, the Millers had not been exposed to pool, public transport, or Mountain Dew . Raymond Miller said that while in prison he developed a taste for Mountain Dew soda, got his . GED, and wonders if he should get a pool table after learning to play in . prison. Kathryn, who had never ridden a public bus before boarding one . last year to go to prison for forcibly cutting the hair of her . relatives, was introduced to yoga and step classes while behind bars. The . Millers . are trying to settle back into life at home after being exposed in . prison to a world their religion is focused on locking out. The Amish shun modern technology and regard beards for men and uncut hair for married women as sacred. A temporary exception to this rule has had to be made for 29-year-old Raymond Miller, who must make daily calls to his probation officer and wear an electronic ankle monitor while harvesting hay. 'I’m ready to get rid of it,' Raymond said of the telephone installed in his home. 'We get salesman calls about electric bills and they don’t believe that we don’t have an electric bill.' Trial: The Millers were among members of an Amish sect, some of them pictured above during the trial, who were charged with hate crimes after cutting off men's beards . The . couple, who were recently released after spending nearly a year in . prison, were part of a group of 16 Amish from Bergholz who were . convicted in 2012 of hate crimes for the hair-cutting attacks. The victims included Raymond Miller's parents. Prosecutors . said the attacks were intended to humiliate and were carried out in . retaliation for personal and spiritual disagreements that Bergholz's . bishop and leader Sam Mullet had with Amish in other groups. Mullet, who was portrayed as extremely authoritarian, is serving 15 years as mastermind of the attacks. His followers were sentenced to one to seven years each. Defense lawyers did not deny the hair-cutting took place but said that hate crime charges were over-reaching. One thing both of the Millers had to get accustomed to in prison was the concept of free time, something the Amish do not have a lot of at home. 'I read, played softball and played pool. I liked pool and I was pretty good at it,' Raymond said. 'I think we could get a pool table at Sam’s,' he said, referring to Mullet's home, which has a large meeting room for church services. 'I think it would be all right.' Kathryn, 25, who also learned the game, shook her head 'no' in the background. 'I like to play pool but we are not allowed to play pool here,' Kathryn said. 'The girls in prison gave me a hard time that I was gambling.' Changes: Laundry dries outside the Millers' farm. They have no electricity but since being released from prison on probation they have had to install a telephone line . Trade up: A buggy the couple use to get around. Kathryn's first experience of public transport was when she took the bus to prison . Raymond lost weight in prison because he did not like the food, but says he did develop a liking for Mountain Dew. Kathryn had to leave her three young children in the care of her mother while she was in prison. Her now nearly three-year-old daughter sometimes calls Kathryn's mother 'mom' even though Kathryn has been home two months. 'She still asks for my mom a lot,' she said. Kathryn said she wore a smaller head covering than her typical Amish bonnet while in prison, along with long brown dresses. She uses prison slang and referred to fellow prisoners as 'cellies' and 'bunkies' and talked about the SHU, or solitary housing unit. 'I didn't feel like I was Amish,' she said. Knowing that she would be returning soon to her family kept Kathryn going. She also discovered yoga and step classes. The Millers said they do not regret going to trial, but do not believe it was fair and are appealing their convictions. 'We really didn't have a jury of our peers,' Raymond said. 'They don't know about the Amish, the lifestyle.'","Raymond and Kathryn Miller have been released after a year behind bars .

The Pope has today told Ukraine's Prime Minister he will 'do everything possible' for peace in the country, amid the first invasion of Russian forces into the ex-Soviet country's airspace. It comes as Ukraine's acting defence minister said if Russia sends 'peace-keeping forces' into the country, Kiev's military will fight them.

The Ukrainian PM is cutting short his visit to Rome amid tensions mount in eastern parts of the volatile nation . Pope Francis and the Ukrainian premier spent 18 minutes behind closed doors, with the head of the Catholic church, who had urged the international community to 'prevent violence' in Ukraine in his Easter Sunday message. At an exchange of gifts, Yatsenyuk presented Pope Francis with a photograph of Maidan square in Kiev on New Year's night. 'This is where Ukrainians fought for their freedom and rights. Millions of people,' he said. The pope in return gave the Ukraine leader a pen, saying 'I hope this pen will sign the peace', to which Yatsenyuk replied 'I hope so'. As the two leaders parted, Francis put his hand on his chest and said 'I will do everything possible' for peace. Ukrainian acting defence minister Myhailo Koval said the nation's military will fight if Russia sends in troops under the guise of a peace-keeping operation, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported. 'The United Nations has given no such (peace-keeping) mandate to the Russians,' Mr Koval said. 'Everybody is already fed up with Russia's games with peace-keeping. If they come, they'll get what's coming to them: we will conduct combat operations.' Russian military aircraft repeatedly crossed into Ukrainian airspace overnight, Prime Minister Yatseniuk said from the Italian capital. He said: 'Russian military aircraft today at night crossed and violated Ukrainian airspace seven times. 'The only reason is to provoke Ukraine... and to accuse Ukraine of waging war against Russia.'

Ukrainian government troops in the town of Svyitohirsk near to Slovyansk. The country's acting defence minister said if Russia send troops into Ukraine under the guise of a peace-keeping mission, Kiev's military will fight back . The Group of Seven rich countries have agreed to slap new sanctions on Moscow as early as Monday amid fears in the West that Russia could be about to invade. Nerves frayed after pro-Russian rebels holding a group of international OSCE observers in the area earlier Saturday accused them of being 'NATO spies' and vowed to continue detaining them. The U.S. deployed 150 paratroopers to Lithuania  today, part of efforts by Washington to reassure its eastern European allies, worried by events in Ukraine, that NATO would offer protection in the face of face Russian aggression. A total of 600 U.S. troops are to be deployed to Poland and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for infantry exercises. They are expected to remain in the region on rotation until the end of the year. 'As threats emerged, we see who our real friends are,' Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said as she greeted the troops at the Siauliai air base. 'The Baltic states and Poland are on the border of NATO, so more security measures are urgently needed. This U.S. troop addition is very timely and very necessary,' she said. Without mentioning Russia, she said the presence of U.S. troops would 'repel those who encroach on stability in Europe and peace in the region', as an invasion of Lithuania would now entangle the Americans. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko says Ukraine 'must be a member of NATO' in order to protect itself from Russian aggression. Tymoshenko, who is running in the May 25 presidential election, said that while only a minority of Ukrainians supported NATO membership previously, Russia's aggressive actions in the country's east had forced a ""fundamental change"" in public thinking. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko says Ukraine 'must be a member of NATO' in order to protect itself from Russian aggression . She says 'with his war against us, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was able to change the mentality of Ukrainians and turn us in a different strategic direction. NATO is the best choice for Ukraine'. While Tymoshenko hadn't previously backed NATO membership publicly, she and other Ukrainian politicians have ramped up the tough rhetoric as pro-Russia militias seized police stations and government buildings across eastern Ukraine. The U.S. today deployed troops to Lithuania's Siauliai air base, to participate in NATO manoeuvres as tensions escalate in neighbouring Ukraine . 'The numbers are not important. If just one of our guests is harmed, this would mean an open confrontation, not with Lithuania but with the United States of America,' Grybauskaite told reporters. Additional to the U.S. paratroopers, from the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Italy, NATO has said it will triple its usual number of fighter jets patrolling over the Baltics next month to enhance its eastern European defences. The Baltic states have been members of NATO since 2004, but have not had a persistent presence of foreign troops on their soil before, partly to avoid antagonising Russia. NATO prepared plans for their defence only in 2010, after Russia invaded Georgia, according to U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks. 'I don't think the deployment of troops is meant to be a message to Russia,' Richard C. Longo, Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe, told reporters in Siauliai. 'It's a message to anyone who will listen, and the message is that the United States of America will honour its commitments to Lithuania. 'Let me make this clear: should Lithuania need NATO, I guarantee NATO will be there,' he said.","Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk cutting short Rome trip .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Death: Robert Goold, 69, pictured when he was on the Liverpool Care Pathway before his death . A hospital which put an elderly patient on a controversial end of life 'pathway' without telling his family was criticised by a coroner yesterday. Robert Goold, 69, was taken to hospital after a fall down the stairs left him with a fractured neck, back and skull and bleeding on the brain. The pensioner, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2009, was taken to Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertforshire, and then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. After two weeks there doctors made the decision to place him on the Liverpool Care Pathway - without informing his family. His daughter Susan Phillips, 50, said her father was then left to slowly deteriorate for a week without food, water or oxygen before he died. She claimed after six days on the pathway a nurse offered to reverse the programme but it was too late. Mr Goold, from Stevenage, was in Addenbrooke's for two weeks before he was put on the LCP on February 17. His family were told his prognosis was not good and medics wanted to remove his ventilator to see how he responded. Susan said the family believed removing his ventilation would give her father the 'best chance' of survival. But a day later she went to the hospital to find her father flailing about trying to breathe with 'sheer terror in his eyes' and then discovered he had been placed on LCP without her permission. He died on February 25 without being able to say goodbye to his wife of 51 years because she was too traumatised. Susan said doctors and nurses could not explain to her why her father had been put on the LCP because nothing had been recorded in his notes. At home: Robert Goold pictured hours before he fell down the stairs, leading to his stay in hospital . The inquest, at Huntingdon Coroner's Court, Cambridgeshire, heard that Mr Goold died from bronchopneumonia, a head injury from his fall and a pulmonary thromboembolism with Alzheimer's, rather than because he was on the pathway. Coroner David Morris said Mr Goold, from Stevenage, had been given 'appropriate symptomatic relief' and the hospital was not at fault over his death. The coroner described the decision to put Mr Goold on the LCP as a 'valid clinical decision'. But he said the 'breakdown of liaison and engagement with his family are matters of justifiable concern.' And he added that 'lessons should and indeed have been learnt from Mr Goold's death.' Charlotte Skouby, a lawyer who represented the Goold family at the inquest, said the relatives are 'considering their options' over potential legal action against the hospital. Inquest: The hearing was told staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, pictured, were justified in putting the 69-year-old on the end-of-life plan but there were concerns over the fact they did not tell his family . She said: 'This is an incredibly sad case of a family being denied the opportunity to be involved in end of life care decisions concerning a much loved husband, father and grandfather. 'The Coroner was clearly critical of the Trust for the shortcomings of their end of life care consultation process, which caused Mr Goold's family great undue distress. 'Whilst the Liverpool Care Pathway has now been phased out, NHS Trust and unit specific end of life care pathways are still in operation, meaning that this remains very much a real issue for patients and their families.' The LCP, designed by the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's Marie Curie Hospice, aimed to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person's life. Doctors can withdraw fluids and drugs from patients or be put on continuous sedation if they are deemed close to death. Phased out: The hospital used the care pathway 252 times in the first seven months of last year . But the plan has been criticised by some experts and presented as a cost-cutting way to bring about the premature deaths of elderly patients. The government decided in July last year to end the LCP but in December there were reports it was simply being rebranded and not abolished. A Cambridge University Hospitals spokesman said: 'We recognise that although we did have discussions with the family we could have communicated more effectively, and we apologise to them for that. 'We have since changed our processes in terms of next of kin communication in these difficult situations. 'We offer our condolences to Mr Goold's family and we appreciate that this must be a very difficult and upsetting time for them.' Addenbrooke's used the controversial pathway 252 times between January last year and July, when the government announced it would be phased out. Since July last year it has not been used once, a hospital spokesman told MailOnline.","Robert Goold, 69, was treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge .

The flow of oil to the pipe was remotely shut down shortly within 10 minutes of the burst being detected, but the leak continued for another 45 minutes. A 20-inch oil pipeline is medium-sized by industry standards and would generally transport about 200,000 barrels per day based on average rates. There was no immediate information about the specific capacity or throughput of the line. 'This oil comes from the Bakersfield area, this is a pumping transfer station and pumping transfer station then transfers the oil to a storage facility in Long Beach,' Batallion Chief David Spence said. Four workers at the nearby Baxter industrial plant were reportedly evaluated for general illness and respiratory concerns, with two of them taken to hospital, according to NBC Los Angeles, . Oil was seen shooting towards the sky and on to a nearby strip bar, The Gentlemen’s Club at around 1am local time. The Gentlemen's Club was subsequently evacuated, Los Angeles Fire Department said. Four other commercial businesses are known to have been affected after LAPD completely shut down the Atwater Village area. Location: The oil escaped after a break in an above-ground pipeline outside 5175 West San Fernando Road in the Atwater Village suburb of Los Angeles. It is covering a half mile area - including the ground outside The Gentleman's Club strip bar. Atwater Village is located in the northeast region of the Californian city . Hazardous material specialists are working at the scene in the Los Angeles suburb amid concern that the massive spill could cause an environmental disaster . Release: The oil escaped after a break in an above-ground pipeline. The flow of oil to the pipe was remotely shut down shortly after the burst was detected . Covered: The LA Fire Department says the ruptured oil pipe has caused about 10,000 gallons of crude oil to spill on to the streets of Los Angeles . Burst: Four workers at the nearby Baxter industrial plant were reportedly evaluated for general illness and respiratory concerns, with two of them taken to hospital . Several blocks near San Fernando Road and West Broadway have been evacuated, with Department of Transportation understood to be assisting with the build up of traffic in the Greendale suburb. Hazardous material specialists are also working at the scene amid concern that the massive spill could cause an environmental disaster. Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott says there's no 'visible evidence' that the oil has entered storm drains, which empty into the Los Angeles River, but he says it's possible that oil has seeped under manhole covers. The department initially said one million gallons of oil had spilled, but subsequently revised the estimate down to 50,000 gallons and then again to 10,000. Workers clean up the oil from the pipe that burst causing about 10,000 gallons of crude oil spill onto streets in LA . A crew member helps sob up the  crude oil in the Atwater Village section of Los Angeles on Thursday . 'We are on hand vacuuming up the spilled oil, mopping up what's left behind and pressure washing the area with a soap solution,' said Captain Jamie Moore, a public information officer with the Los Angeles Fire Department . 'The responders are mopping what's on the ground with absorbent diapers,' he added. The cleanup is expected to take 24 hours. Atwater Village is a neighborhood in the 13th district of Los Angeles. Located in the northeast region of the city, Atwater borders Griffith Park and Silver Lake to the west, Glendale to the north and east, and Glassell Park to the south. Almost half the residents were born outside the U.S. - a high percentage for the city of Los Angeles. A geyser of crude spewed 20 feet high over approximately half mile into Los Angeles streets and onto buildings early Thursday after a high-pressure pipe burst . The 20-inch above-ground pipe was located next to a strip club called The Gentleman's Club (workers seen cleaning up on Thursday)","Oil covers a huge area near the Atwater Village suburb and is said to be knee-high in many places .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . British courts should be ‘more ready’ to ignore human rights rulings made by European judges in Strasbourg, the UK’s top judge has said. Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, said British judges had been too keen to follow decisions made by the European Court of Human Rights – even when the decisions were ‘inconsistent’ and made by junior legal officers. He claimed judges were beginning to see that such an approach would not be appropriate. President of the Supreme Court Lord Neuberger claimed that British courts had been 'too ready' to accept Strasbourg's rulings . Lord Neuberger, in a speech to lawyers in Australia, admitted that it was controversial for British courts to be bound by decisions made in Strasbourg, France. At a conference at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne he said: ‘UK judges have, I suspect, sometimes been too ready to assume that a decision, even a single decision of a section of that court, represents the law according to Strasbourg, and accordingly to follow it. ‘That approach is attributable to our common law attitude to precedent and to our relatively recent involvement with Strasbourg. ‘I think we may sometimes have been too ready to treat Strasbourg court decisions as if they were determinations by a UK court whose decisions were binding on us. ‘It is a civilian court under enormous pressure ... and whose judgments are often initially prepared by staffers, and who have produced a number of inconsistent decisions over the years.’ Hate clerics Abu Hamza (left) and Abu Qatada (right) repeatedly avoided extradition from the UK using human rights laws . He added: ‘I think that we are beginning to see that the traditional common law approach may not be appropriate, at least to the extent that we should be more ready not to follow Strasbourg chamber decisions.’ Lord Neuberger said, in some respects, the UK had ‘much to learn’ from mainland Europe. But he said the UK had ‘just as much to offer’.","President of the Supreme Court says judges too keen to follow Strasbourg .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Colin Fernandez . and Richard Hartley-parkinson . Updated: . 12:41 GMT, 6 January 2012 . Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott was threatened with the sack yesterday after she was accused of making racist comments. The Shadow Minister for Public Health dived disastrously into the Stephen  Lawrence debate – claiming that ‘white people love playing divide and rule’ with the black population. Miss Abbott, the first black woman MP, was later forced to apologise for the comments posted on Twitter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . An unrepentant Abbott takes a call from Labour leader Ed Miliband who tells her to say sorry or she’s fired . But Miss Abbott hit back saying criticism of black leaders was effectively playing into the hands of whites. ‘I understand the cultural point you are making,’ she told Miss Adewunmi. ‘But . you are playing into a “divide and rule” agenda. White people love . playing “divide and rule”. We should not play their game.’ Abbott's comment about 'divide and rule' caused a Twitter storm and led to calls for her resignation . The full conversation between Diane Abbott and freelance journalist, Bim Adewunmi following the sentencing of Stephen Lawrence's killers . Miss Abbott responded, saying that her comment had been 'taken out of context' She then accused white people of peddling a ‘tactic as old as colonialism’. Miss . Abbott immediately faced calls to resign. Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said if . a white politician had made similar comments about blacks they would . have had to quit. Sophy Ridge: Can you understand the consternation that your tweet has created? Diane Abbott: Well I was actually referring to the nature of 19th century European colonialism, but that's a bit much to go into 140 characters . SR: But if you look at it out of context, saying 'white people love to divide and rule' is a pretty controversial remark if people don't see it in context. Do you accept that it was not a wise thing to put out there? DA: I think the tweet was taken out of context and some people have interpreted it maliciously . SR: Well, explain to us then, and for our viewers who are talking about this and there's a lot of Twitter activity going on, explain to us what you actually meant by it . Abbott's phone had started ringing and, indicating to Miss Ridge, she said 'Can I just...' before walking off camera. ‘It is . outrageous,’ he said. ‘If this was reversed I guarantee you a white . politician would have to resign their frontbench  position or be sacked . and I think she should do the honourable thing and go. To hold views . that white people play games of divide and rule is  blatantly racist.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg dismissed her comments as ‘stupid and crass generalisation’. But . Miss Abbott, who has a  history of making racially-charged statements, . initially refused to back down. In a Twitter message and a brief TV . interview she insisted her words had been ‘taken out of context’. The . unrepentant MP even sought to claim she was talking about the ‘nature of . 19th century European colonialism’ rather than modern Britain. But . while she was on camera, she took a phone call from Mr Miliband, who . told her she had let down both him and the Labour Party and he demanded . that she make a public apology. Minutes . later she issued a new statement saying: ‘I understand people have . interpreted my comments as making generalisations about white people. I . do not believe in doing that. I apologise for any offence caused.’ A . Labour Party spokesman said it was ‘wrong’ to make such ‘sweeping . generalisations’ while Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘The . contents of the tweet were clearly unacceptable’ A . senior Labour source said: ‘If we thought she really believed what was . in the tweet, she would be off the front bench, but she doesn’t and she . has apologised. Ed made it clear that unless she apologised she would . have been fired.’ Marc . Wadsworth, an executive at black newspaper The Voice said: ‘She could . have phrased what she said better by saying that some white leaders have . played divide and rule.’ Miss . Abbott’s views on race issues have upset the Labour leadership before. In 1988 she told a black studies conference in Philadelphia that ‘the . British invented racism’. And in 1996 she attacked her local hospital for employing ‘blonde, blue-eyed’ Finnish nurses. The . daughter of West Indian migrants, she escaped her working class roots . through an education at Harrow County Grammar School, where she acted in . a play opposite Michael Portillo, the ex-Tory MP who ended up as her . sparring partner on BBC1’s This Week show. Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi took to Twitter to say that Abbott should resign or be sacked by Ed Miliband . Former shadow minister Paul Goodman also called for Abbott to stand down or face the consequences . Duncan Bannatyne said that he believes Diane Abbott's displayed a lack of common sense . How empire builders used divide and rule . Today's Twitter storm is the latest in a number of blunders made by the MP who positioned herself as an anti-racism campaigner, once claiming that Britain had 'invented racism'. In 2010 Abbott called David Cameron and Nick Clegg 'two posh white boys', sparking claims of racism on the BBC's internet message boards. One wrote: 'I am sure that if a posh white person sat on this programme and mentioned a colour comment like that, there would be uproar.' The same year, she was criticised . over remarks she made on BBC's This Week over her decision to send her . son James to a private school. Andrew Neil quoted her saying that 'West Indian mums will go to the wall for their children'. Mr Neil responded by asking: 'So black mums love their kids more than white mums, do they?' Furious Abbott said: 'I have said everything I am going to say about where I send my son to school.' Previously, Abbott face accusations of racism suggesting that the 'blonde blue-eyed Finnish girls' working in her local hospital were unsuitable as nurses because they had 'never met a black person before'. Abbott has positioned herself as an anti-racism campaigner and once claimed that Britain had 'invented racism'. The latest row follows a previous race controversy on the same show, fronted by Andrew Neil, last year, after he compared Abbott to a chocolate HobNob biscuit.","Abbott walks off mid-interview to take phone call in which she received 'severe dressing down from Ed Miliband'

"By . Lydia Warren . A teenager who was forced to hand over her Facebook password by school officials so they could check her private messages has been awarded $70,000 in damages. Riley Stratton, now 15, was just a sixth grader in Minnewaska, Minnesota when she gave staff the sign-in details - an incident that left her so distraught that she is now being home schooled. Minnewaska Area Schools have agreed to pay $70,000 in damages and rewrite its policies after a lawsuit claimed officials violated Riley's constitutional rights by viewing her online accounts. Riley was just 13 when she posted to Facebook two years ago that she hated a school hall monitor because she was mean, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported. Embarrassed: Riley Stratton was forced to hand over her Facebook password to school officials after a mother called the school and said she had had a sexual conversation online with her son . The school was alerted and she was given an in-school suspension for what she had said, even though the comments were made out of school time. Afterwards, she went on Facebook and asked who had told on her - a move that could have been seen as threatening to students, school officials argues. 'I was a little mad at whoever turned me . in 'cause it was outside school when it happened,' Riley told the Star Tribune on Tuesday. Her attorney, Wallace Hilke, who took the case pro bono with the American Civil Liberties Union, said she had been punished for doing what school students had been doing for generations. 'She wasn't spreading lies or . inciting them to engage in bad behavior, she was just expressing her . personal feelings,' he said. Following that incident, she was hauled before school officials again after a parent complained that Riley had engaged in a conversation of a sexual nature online with her son. Support: Her attorney, Wallace Hilke, said Riley was punished for things children had been doing for years . 'I was in tears,' she said. 'I was embarrassed when they made me give over my password.' As a deputy sheriff looked on, school officials looked through her Facebook page. Her mother, Sandra Stratton, said the school had called her about the complaint but that she had not been told that her daughter was expected to hand over her password. 'It was believed the parent had given permission to look at her cellphone,' Minnewaska Superintendent Greg Schmidt said. But Schmidt said the district did not have a signed consent from the parent, which is now a policy requirement, he said. After the incident, Stratton fell behind on schoolwork because she was too distraught and embarrassed to attend school, according to the lawsuit. Scene: Minnewaska School did not have written consent from her mother to read the messages . The new rules state that electronic . records and passwords created off-campus can only be searched if there is . a reasonable suspicion they will uncover violations of school rules, the Star Tribune reported. Schmidt, who was not superintendent at the time of the incident, said that they wanted to make children aware that their actions outside school can harm them. 'The school's intent wasn’t to be mean or bully this student, but to really remedy someone getting off track a little,' he said. Stratton released a statement about the settlement decision, saying: 'I am so happy that my case is finally over, and that my school changed its rules so what happened to me doesn’t happen to other students. 'It was so embarrassing and hard on me to go through, but I hope that schools all over see what happened and don’t punish other students the way I was punished.'","Riley Stratton was just 13 when she wrote online that she disliked a teacher's aide for being mean - and she was suspended from school .

Two female British doctors drowned while trying to rescue their children who were caught by a freak wave on a Tenerife beach. Barathi Ravikumar, 40, and Uma Ramalingam, 42, who were on holiday together with their families, got into difficulty after wading into the sea off rocks at Playa Paraiso. Dr Ramalingam’s husband, Palanichamy Chandra, a 49-year-old consultant gastroenterologist, dived in after them but could only save their ten-year-old son Hari. Tragic: Dr Uma Ramalingam a consultant obstetrician from Altrincham in Cheshire - was pronounced dead at the scene after getting into difficulty at the Playa Paraiso resort . Scene: The group of five were washed out to sea after a large wave knocked them from a rock on this beach in Tenerife at about 6pm yesterday . The other child, a girl of 14, was rescued but both mothers were declared dead at the scene.A helicopter plucked one of the bodies from the sea. Paramgsi . Kumar, 45, a friend of Mr Chandra, said: ‘I spoke to him and he is . completely heartbroken to have lost her. He told me, “I saw it all . happen. I went in after them but I couldn’t save her”. ‘He managed to save his son but couldn’t get to his wife in time. He is devastated.’ Hari, . who attends Manchester Grammar School, was taken to hospital with . hypothermia while the 14-year-old was treated at the scene for cuts and . bruising. A third woman, who was part of their group, was saved by hotel workers and fishermen in Sunday evening’s tragedy. Victim: Dr Ramalingam (pictured) registered as a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology in November 2009, according to the General Medical Council . Rocky: The group got into difficulties off the resort of Playa Paraiso in the south west of the island . Adam . Cramer, a 49-year-old British father of three, rescued the girl. ‘She . told me I had saved her life,’ he said last night. ‘As I got her out on . to the rocks I could see that they had pulled a body from the water. ‘What . they had been doing was standing on the rocks looking at the waves . crashing in. 'Unfortunately one of those waves was so big it crashed in . and swept them out to sea. 'The girl I rescued wasn’t even in swimwear, . she was in shorts and a T-shirt.’ Dr Ramalingam lived in an £800,000 . house in upmarket Bowdon in Greater Manchester and worked at the Royal . Oldham Hospital women and children’s unit. Rescue: Tourists, hotel workers and local fishermen dived into the water and were able to save the lives of both children and one of the women .

Her son Hari is very bright and bubbly.’ The . Indian-born obstetrician suffered tragedy seven years ago when her . first husband, Dr Kannan Palaniswamy, was killed in a car crash near the . Dundee hospital they both worked at. Dr Ramalingam’s close friend and former neighbour Graham Meade, 62, said: ‘She was quite simply a lovely woman. ‘Her . parents and brother, who is also a doctor, would visit from India and . we all knew each other because our street was a new-build development . and everyone was very close. Location: All of those involved in the tragedy are believed to have been staying at Playa Paraiso in south west Tenerife. The resort is about five miles west of the popular Playa de las Americas complex . 'She suffered tragedy in losing her first husband and for this to happen is just unbelievable. ‘My thoughts are with her son and her immediate family. ‘She moved away from Dundee to work in Cheshire as a fresh start and for this to happen now is just heart-breaking.’ Dr .

"By . Helen Pow . Billionaire: Richard B. Cohen, pictured, is the third generation owner of supermarket supplying giant C&S Wholesale Grocers . One of America's richest men has managed to escape the spotlight so much so that even people in his small New Hampshire town don't recognize him. Richard B. Cohen, third generation owner of supermarket supplying giant C&S Wholesale Grocers, lives with his family on a street in Keene, where the average residence costs just $294,000. He goes to work everyday at a nondescript office that was slated to house a county jail and the truckers who deliver goods from the company's 54 distribution centers drive in unmarked trucks to avoid attention. 'We're the biggest company no one has . ever heard of,' Bryan T. Granger, a company spokesman, told Bloomberg. And its CEO is even more under the radar. Cohen, who goes by Rick, . has a net worth of $11.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg index, and C&S - the largest grocery wholesaler in the world - had sales . of $21.7 billion last year, distributing more than 95,000 products to . 4,000 supermarkets from Maine to Hawaii. Its customers include Safeway, Target, A&P, Stop & Shop, Ralphs and Foodtown. The company, which Cohen solely owns, is valued at $11 billion, according to a Bloomberg estimate. As . well as the Keene home he shares with wife Jan, which, at $1.5 million, is the most . valuable single family residence in the town, Cohen owns real estate in . Ogunquit, Maine, and Jackson, Wyoming, according to local property tax . records. Happy family: Rick Cohen, left with wife, Jan, center and daughter Rachel, right, is a hidden billionaire . But he isn't flashy, and is not in the . least interested in being famous, giving his last formal interview a . decade ago and shying away from the media since. 'You'll . run into Rick and Jan at the grocery store in Keene and at a show in . the Colonial Theater downtown,' said Keene Sentinel executive editor Paul . Miller, who previously coached one of Cohen's daughters at soccer. Cohen is one of the 100 richest people in the world and the wealthiest man in New England after Connecticut hedge-fund manager Raymond T. Dalio, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. However, he's never appeared on an international wealth ranking. Daughters: Cohen has a number of daughters including Perry Cohen, right, who now works at C&S, and Jill, left . Humble: Richard B. Cohen, pictured left with wife Jan, lives on a street in Keene, New Hampshire where the average residence costs just $294,000 . The 61-year-old's grandfather, . Israel, created C&S in Worchester, Massachusetts in 1918 and . following a devastating flood in 1929, he opened a new warehouse twice . the size a few blocks from the city's Blackstone River. Cohen's father, Lester, later expanded the business to supply military bases following World War II. Cohen went to the prestigious Deerfield . Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, graduating in the class of 1970. He then attended University . of Pennsylvania's Wharton school where he gained a degree in accounting, . and joined the family business in 1974. Some 15 years later, in 1989, Cohen became CEO and chairman, when his father retired. By focusing on . efficiency, he has made a huge success of the . company in the small margin game that is grocery wholesaling.

"By . Sean Poulter . Fish protein found in the diet of Greenland’s Inuits could help women battling hair loss. A study has shown that those taking the supplement in a tablet described as ‘Botox for hair’ could reduce thinning within weeks. Researchers tracked 72 women suffering from hair loss due to stress, poor diets or hormonal reasons. Some women took the protein tablets, while others took placebos. The fish protein that was found in the diet of Inuits (pictured) could help stop people's hair thinning . Those taking the tablets from hair-care firm Viviscal – containing the protein AminoMar C – every day saw their hair loss reduced by a fifth after three months. There was a 7 per cent increase in hair thickness after six months. Viviscal’s dermatologists have hailed its products as ‘Botox for hair’. They claim that the tablets reverse the process endured by many women going through the menopause, who see their youthful, thick follicles become wispy and brittle. The brand, which also has products for . men, is a favourite with celebrities including actress Kate Hudson, who . suffered hair loss after pregnancy, and Sex And The City actress Cynthia . Nixon, who shaved her head for a Broadway play. It has also been . recommended by Lady Gaga’s stylist. Professor Glynis Ablon of the University of California, who led the research commissioned by Viviscal, said: ‘In the hair-loss industry, where it is estimated almost 99 per cent of products are completely ineffective, this research is an exciting development. ‘The results from this trial show a statistically significant improvement in the Viviscal group and may represent the first robust clinical trial to see hair growth in women associated with the use of a nutritional supplement.’ Details of the study were revealed at the World Congress for Hair Research in Edinburgh. They will be published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology this month. AminoMar C was discovered by a Scandinavian dermatologist who was studying the Inuit population of Greenland. He observed their thick, healthy hair, which  he linked to the protein now used by Viviscal. Its tablets cost £49.95 for one month’s supply. Nutritionist Angela Dowden said: ‘Healthy hair comes from a balanced diet that is nutrient-dense. ‘Because hair is mostly protein, this is an important area of your diet, and other ingredients, such as essential fatty acids, iron, silica, biotin and zinc, are important for hair growth and preventing brittle, unhealthy-looking hair. ‘The perfect diet is difficult to achieve, so supplementing with Viviscal – which combines these ingredients with AminoMar C – is useful.' Allergan has asked us to make clear that it owns the trademark in the name Botox and that its product is a specific pharmaceutical product that is controlled by extensive regulation and legislation. The Botox product can only be obtained on prescription, unlike the over-the-counter oral supplement for thinning hair made by Viviscal.","Study shows that the Botox for hair’ could reduce thinning within weeks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Concerns: The family of retired finance executive Lee Newman are deeply concerned about the health of the 85-year-old (pictured) who is being detained in North Korea . The desperately worried wife of an 85-year-old Korean War veteran and beloved grandfather detained in North Korea has spoken out for the first time in a plea to get him home by Thanksgiving. Merrill Newman, of Palo Alto, California, traveled to the country last month but was taken off his plane by a North Korean officer as he was about to fly back to the U.S. on October 26. The grandfather, who has a heart condition, hasn't been heard from since and his family are concerned about his health and status. His wife Lee Newman, who hasn't seen her husband in six weeks, and son Jeffrey made an emotional appeal on the Today show on Monday morning. A tearful Mrs Newman said 'It's hard for his grandchildren, it's hard for his whole family.' Mr Newman's family has tried to to get heart medication to him through the Swedish ambassador in Pyongyang, as the . U.S. has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. But his deeply concerned relatives have no way of knowing if the pills have actually reached him, or had any contact at all. 'When you don't know where your husband . of 56 years is, you don't know his health, you don't know when he will . be home with us, it's not an easy situation. He needs to be back at . home,' his wife said. Merrill's son, Jeffrey Newman, believes the whole episode is a 'terrible misunderstanding.' They had only one small indication that there might have been trouble on the horizon. 'There was a conversation that took place about the Korean War and my dad's service that might have had some tension in it,' Jeffrey said. Emotional: 'When you don't know where your husband of 56 years is, you don't know his health, you don't know when he will be home with us, it's not an easy situation. He needs to be back at home,' his wife, Lee Newman, said . Happier times: The Newmans are pictured before his trip. It's hard for his grandchildren, it's hard for his whole family,' a tearful Lee Newman said . Jeffrey Newman said his father was a . constant traveler but had always wanted to visit North Korea, and took . lessons in the language before leaving on the nine-day trip. 'This has been a lifelong dream of his,' he said. Mr . Newman said he believed the desire for the trip came from the three . years his father spent as an infantry officer in the Korean war, but he . said Merrill Newman never talked about his service. 'We have no idea that how with the guides and the visas and the paper and the itinerary that there could be anything that could've gone off track,' Lee Newman told ABC News. As Merrill was about to fly back to the U.S. on October 26, a uniformed North Korean officer came on the plane, asked to see his passport, and then requested he be removed from the flight, his son said. 'My dad got off, walked out with the stewardess, and that's the last he was seen,' the younger Mr Newman said. Desperation: The family have had no news from the grandfather since he was captured. His son, Jeffrey Newman, (left) said he believed the whole episode was a 'terrible misunderstanding' Newman went with a tour group based out of Beijing, China. His traveling companion, former Stanford University professor Bob Hamrdla, was allowed to fly out of North Korea. Mr Hamrdla later also told ABC News that it must have been a 'terrible misunderstanding.' 'I hope that the North Koreans will see this as a humanitarian matter and allow him to return to his family as soon as possible,' he said. The U.S. Department of State has declined to publicly confirm Mr Newman's detention, only saying that the agency has updated its travel warning for North Korea, recommending that Americans refrain from traveling to the Communist country. 'U.S. citizens crossing into North Korea, even accidentally, have been subject to arbitrary arrest and long-term detention, ' the DOS said. Jeffrey Newman said he'd received . postcards from his father saying the trip was going well, but on the . last day of the tour, according to Mr Hamrdla, Merrill Newman met with . North Korean officials and he came away with some uneasy feelings. Globe trotter: Newman arrived in North Korea on a valid tourist visa with a group based out of Beijing, China . 'We think that the conversation was difficult at times,' Mr Newman said, but did not know details. A state . department official told the San Jose Mercury News that the Swedish . Embassy in Pyongyang has been acting as a go-between in matters . concerning Americans who find themselves in trouble in North Korea. The . Swedish ambassador also delivered his father's heart medication to the . North Korean Foreign Affairs Ministry, but it's unclear whether he had . received it. Pyongyang's secretive, authoritarian government is sensitive about foreign travelers, and tourists are closely monitored. The North has previously accused Seoul, Washington and other outsiders of working to sabotage its system -- statements that analysts see as a way to strengthen domestic support for young leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea's official state-run media has yet to comment, and South Korean officials said they couldn't confirm media reports. Merrill Newman has lived in a retirement complex with his wife, Lee, since 2011 in Palo Alto, where he's a big part of the alumni community at nearby Stanford University, his son said. Golden years: Newman retired from finance in 1984 and has been living with his wife, Lee, in this 10-story retirement home in Palo Alto called Channing House . Jeffrey Newman said he believed North . Korea would eventually release him after realizing that all they have is . an 'elderly traveler, a grandfather with a heart condition.' 'We . don't know what this misunderstanding is all about,' Jeffrey Newman . said. 'All we want as a family is to have my father, my kids' grandfather, returned to California so he can be with his family for . Thanksgiving.' Merrill Newman is a retired finance . executive for technology companies. Following the war, Mr Newman earned a Master's degree in education from . Stanford University while working as a high school teacher. For 50 years, Newman volunteered for the American Red Cross, teaching CPR and first aid, according to San Jose Mercury News. Since . his retirement in 1984, Newman and his wife have become avid travelers, . going on sailing adventures and visiting countries throughout South . America. According to a . newsletter put out by their upscale senior complex, Channing House, Mr Newman took Korean . language classes in preparation for the trip and was reportedly traveling on a . valid visa. Jailed: Kenneth Bae, a 45-year-old tour operator and Christian missionary, was arrested last November while leading a group of tourists in the northeastern region of Rason in North Korea and has been detained for the past year . His neighbors . at the retirement home were bewildered by the news of his detention, one . of them saying that Mr Newman was simply going on a 'fun' trip and had no . ulterior motives. The detention comes about a year after . North Korea detained another American. North Korea has detained at . least six other Americans since 2009. Korean-American . Kanneth Bae, a 44-year-old Christian missionary, has been incarcerated . in the country for the past year despite a campaign launched by his . family pressing for his release. Bae was accused of planning a religious coup and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Since January 2009, four U.S. citizens have been arrested for entering the country illegally, and two others who entered on valid visas were arrested on other charges. North Korea lately has been relaxing its restrictions on U.S. tourists. Several small travel agencies have sprung up in response to the growing interest in North Korea among Westerners. However, North Korean News reported that tour operators are often inexperienced and lack the necessary knowledge to keep their customers safe.","Merrill Newman, 85, was pulled off a flight back to U.S. on October 26 following a 9-day guided tour .

"By . Sarah Johnson . A public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal 'homosexual propaganda' and bring a fine of up to £10,000 if a bill that comes up for a first vote this month becomes law in Russia. The legislation being pushed by the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church would make it illegal to tell minors information that is defined as  ‘propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, . bisexuality and transgenderism.’ It includes a ban on holding public . events that promote gay rights. The Orthodox Church in Russia has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.  Picuttured: Officers detain gay right activists during a protest in Moscow . The bill is part of an effort to promote traditional Russian values as opposed to Western liberalism, which the Kremlin and church see as corrupting Russian youth and contributing to a wave of protest against President Vladimir Putin's rule, Fox News reported. Other laws that the Kremlin says are intended to protect young Russians have been adopted in recent months, including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print publications that are deemed ‘extremist’ or unfit for young audiences. Denis Volkov, a sociologist with the Levada Center, an independent pollster, says the anti-gay bill fits the ‘general logic’ of a government intent on limiting various rights. But in this case, the move has been met mostly with either indifference or open enthusiasm by average Russians. Protest: Russian police officers detain a gay rights activist during an attempt to hold a gay pride parade in Moscow in May 2012 . Levada polls conducted last year . show that almost two thirds of Russians find homosexuality ‘morally . unacceptable and worth condemning.’ About half are against gay rallies and . same-sex marriage; almost a third think homosexuality is the result of . ‘a sickness or a psychological trauma,’ the Levada surveys show. Russia's widespread hostility to homosexuality is shared by the political and religious elite. Lawmakers have accused homosexuals of . decreasing Russia's already low birth rates and said they should be . barred from government jobs, undergo forced medical treatment or be . exiled. Orthodox activists criticised U.S. company PepsiCo for using a ‘gay’ rainbow on cartons of its dairy products. An executive with a government-run . television network said in a nationally televised talk show that . homosexuals should be stopped from donating blood, sperm and organs for . transplants, while after death their hearts should be burned or buried. The anti-gay sentiment was seen . Sunday in Voronezh, a city south of Moscow, where a handful of gay . activists protesting against the parliament bill were attacked by a much . larger group of anti-gay activists who hit them with snowballs. A man dressed in a bridal gown screams out of a police vehicle after he was detained . In a gay rights protest in December, Pavel Samburov, founder of gay-rights group the Rainbow Association, was pelted with eggs by militant activists with the Orthodox Church seconds after he and his boyfriend kissed. He was arrested by police, fined £10 and detained for 30 hours first in a frozen van and then in an unheated detention centre. The Orthodox activists were also rounded up, but were released much earlier. Those behind the bill say minors need to be protected from ‘homosexual propaganda’ because they are unable to evaluate the information critically. The bill reads: ‘This propaganda goes through the mass media and public events that propagate homosexuality as normal behavior'. Russian cities started adopting anti-gay laws in 2006. Only one person has been prosecuted so far under a law specifically targeted at homosexuals: Nikolai Alexeyev, a gay rights campaigner, was fined the equivalent of £100 after a one-man protest last summer in St. Petersburg. In November, a St. Petersburg court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trade Union of Russian Citizens, a small group of Orthodox conservatives and Putin loyalists, against pop star Madonna. The group sought £6.7million in damages for what it says was ‘propaganda of perversion’ when Madonna spoke up for gay rights during a show three months earlier. The federal bill's expected adoption comes 20 years after a Stalinist-era law punishing homosexuality with up to five years in prison was removed from Russia's penal code as part of the democratic reforms that followed the Soviet Union's collapse. Most of the other former Soviet republics also decriminalised homosexuality, and attitudes toward gays have become a litmus test of democratic freedoms. Russian special police forces arrest a homosexual activist. Homosexuals are subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia . While gay pride parades are held in the three former Soviet Baltic states, all today members of the European Union, same-sex love remains a crime in authoritarian Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In Russia, homosexuals have been subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia. There are no reliable estimates of how many gay men and women live in Russia, and only a few big cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg have gay nightclubs and gyms. Even there, homosexuals do not feel secure.","New legislation is part of an effort to promote Russian traditional values .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Animal rights group Peta has released an undercover video allegedly showing cruelty to race horses in a yard belonging to a top trainer. The video, filmed over four-months by a Peta investigator, claims to show Steve Asmussen and his yard hands giving horses pain medications and joking about jockeys use electric shocks to make the thoroughbreds run faster. The animal activist group also claimed the yard uses undocumented workers who are provided with fake papers. Scroll down for video . Medicated: Peta claims horses at the racing yard were given medication whether they needed it or not . During the video, the unnamed investigator filmed as tranquilizers were allegedly given to horses whether they needed them or not. One vet was also filmed saying all the horses in the yard were given a performance-enhancing drug. In another recorded conversation, between Asmussen, his assistant Scott Blasi and a farrier, the men discuss how racehorse Nehro, who came second at the 2011 Kentucky Derby, had damaged his legs to the point where his hooves were ground into nubs. The horse remained in training despite the injury, and during the conversation the men discuss how they tried to fill a hole in his hoof with superglue, Gawker reported. They state on the film that the injury was caused by part of the hoof rotting away under the Z-bar shoe that is fitted to racehorses. 'His foot is a little bitty nub,' the blacksmith can be heard saying. 'He lost Z-bars on both feet many times until he had bloody holes in the bottom of his feet.' Damaged: Scott Blasi talks about the damaged hooves of Nehro, above, who came second in the Kentucky Derby . Extreme: The undercover investigator films marks left from a freeze firing treatment to deaden pain in horses' legs . Nehro continued to race through the injury, up until his death at a race track a year later. The cause of death was said to be colic. Blasi described the horse's last moments on film, saying: 'I've seen a lot of s***. That is the most violent f****** death I have ever seen.' Peta claims its footage, filmed by an investigator working in Louiseville, Kentucky, and Saratoga Springs, New York, also shows the callous disregard horse trainers and owners have towards the thoroughbreds. In a shot filmed at what appeared to be a dinner party, trainers and jockeys joke about how everyone uses buzzers to administer electric shocks to the horses to make them run faster. Peta has filed complaints with federal and state agencies in Kentucky and New York, claiming Asmussen 'forced injured and/or suffering horses to race and train'. Allegations: Peta has filed complaints against race trainer Steve Asmussen . Clark Brewster, a lawyer for Asmussen and Blasi, told the New York Times: 'It is certainly a surprise to Mr Asmussen and Mr Blasi that anyone would deceptively get a job and keep surveillance and their notes on their conduct for the agenda of others. 'They will reserve comment with regard to any accusations until they have had the opportunity to fully review them. Then they will respond factually.' Kathy Guillermo, senior vice-president of Peta, said the organization went undercover to check on the treatment of horses at racing stables. 'It was devastating to see sore, exhausted, drugged horses every single day. Some were in so much pain it hurt them even to stand, yet they were trained and run anyway,' she said.","Four-month investigation carried out by Peta in New York and Kentucky .

Dr Bobbi Lancaster credits golf with helping her as she struggled with her identity before having gender reassignment surgery in 2010. The 63-year-old doctor, born Robert Lancaster, will be the first transgender player to take part in a tournament since the LPGA's historic vote just over three years ago. Drive: Bobbi Lancaster will be the first transgender player to take part in a LPGA tournament . After a tough season in which Dr Lancaster felt under scrutiny from fellow players and spectators, the golfer said she is mentally prepared for the tournament. 'I really feel like I'm in a much better place emotionally now where I can bring my best game and compete,' she told ABC News. Her optimistic outlook shows how much . Dr Lancaster has overcome. For decades she fought her instinct that she . was a woman, and even married and had three children. Dr Lancaster was six when she first started to feel like she wanted to be a girl. 'I was confused and I didn't know why I had these feelings,' she told 12 News. 'I didn't know who to talk to about it.' Despite her feelings, Dr Lancaster met and fell in love with her second wife Lucy. The couple married but a few years later Dr Lancaster fell into a depression and even considered taking her own life. When her wife found a suicide note . written by her husband, Dr Lancaster finally had the courage to move . forward with her life - and had the support of Lucy throughout. Past life: Golf was still an important part of Bobbi's life when she was still Robert Lancaster . New start: Bobbi Lancaster had gender reassignment surgery in 2010 . 'Nothing really changed. I still have the same heart,' Dr Lancaster said. The golfer admitted that at 6ft tall, and 63 years old, she stood out on the green among her young competitors. But when she submitted medical test results to the LPGA it showed her hormone levels were in the same region as other women competitors. The adjustment process after her surgery has also reduced muscle mass, again leveling the playing field, AZ Central reported. The golf association has also been supportive. After the relevant paperwork and laboratory results were handed in, it never became an issue. Its senior vice-president, Heather Daly-Donofrio, has also been supportive of Dr Lancaster. Now it just falls to Dr Lancaster to prove herself on the green, after qualifying for the association's developmental Symetra Tour 2014. Prepared: Bobbi Lancaster says she is emotionally ready for the competition . '[I] feel I have made great strides and am excited about the 2014 competitive year,' she told USA Today. She added that as her story became well known, she received a huge response from hundreds of people who were inspired by her experiences. 'This was the best part for me. I felt I was making a difference and healing in many situations,' Dr Lancaster said.","Golfer had gender reassignment surgery in 2010 .

He was quoted by Russia's RIA news service as saying: the bill 'would offer the president and government opportunities to defend our sovereignty from threats'. He added that lawyers were examining whether the confiscation of foreign companies' assets, property and accounts would comply with the Russian constitution but said such steps would 'clearly be in line with European standards'. The economic sabre-rattling came as new Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said Russia's deployment of forces in the Crimea region is having an 'extremely negative' impact on the country's economy.","Helicopter gunship carrier tests come as West prepares sanctions .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . An offshore worker died today after falling into the sea from a North Sea oil platform. The employee suffered fatal injuries from the fall at about 4am off the BP Unity rig, which is a pumping station based in the Forties pipeline system almost 100 east of Aberdeen. The incident was reported to police at around 4.40am and the Health and Safety Executive said it was liaising with police, who confirmed they had been ‘made aware of a death offshore’. Death: The employee suffered fatal injuries from the fall at about 4am off the BP Unity rig (pictured), which is a pumping station based in the Forties pipeline system almost 100 east of Aberdeen . The man was part of a team carrying out routine maintenance on the platform when he fell off it. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘The incident occurred on the Unity platform and enquiries to establish the circumstances are on-going.’ BP later confirmed that the man who died was an offshore worker employed by the firm Cape, adding that it was ‘deeply saddened’ and confirming that the man’s relatives have been told. His age is not yet known and no other personal details have been released at this stage. A BP spokesman said: ‘BP is deeply saddened to confirm that an offshore worker has died following an incident on the Unity platform. The next of kin have been informed. Unity rig: The incident was reported to police at around 4.40am and the Health and Safety Executive said it was liaising with police, who confirmed they had been 'made aware of a death offshore' ‘The offshore worker was an employee of Cape. BP is working with Police Scotland, the HSE, Cape and other relevant organisations to support those affected and ensure that the incident is fully investigated. ‘The company extends its deepest sympathies to the deceased’s family and employers and will provide them with every support it can.’ A Cape spokesman said: 'It is with deep regret that Cape confirms the death of an employee following an incident this morning. 'The deceased was part of a Cape team carrying out routine maintenance onboard BP's Unity platform. Our thoughts go out to his family, to whom we will be offering every support. 'The deceased's co-workers are obviously shocked and saddened and we are working alongside BP to ensure they receive the support they need.' The death comes around six months after an oil worker died after falling from an offshore platform into the North Sea. George Bartlett, 62, from Shotts, North Lanarkshire, fell during maintenance work on the Taqa-operated Harding platform, about 198 miles north-east of Aberdeen, on February 27. RMT regional organiser Jake Molloy said it was difficult to comment on the latest incident when details of what happened are not clear. He added: ‘It's coming so soon after the Harding (incident) when another man ended up in the water in the early hours of the morning, so there's obvious questions about how he came to be there.’ A phoneline has been set up for any relatives’ inquiries and can be contacted on 0808 1000 333. A Health and Safety Executive spokesman said: ‘We are aware and are liaising with Police Scotland.’","Employee suffered fatal injuries from fall at about 4am off BP Unity rig .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A dangerous trend has seen more than a dozen women in Venezuela die from botched plastic surgeries involving injecting synthetic silicone into their buttocks. At least 40,000 women in the South American nation have undergone a procedure where they have a gel-like substance called a synthetic . biopolymer shot into the butt cheeks. As opposed to a silicone implant, the synthetic substance flows like an injection and spreads uncontrollably through tissue, leading to deformities and sometimes death. Warning: Graphic images -- Scroll down for video . Implant issues: Venezuelan plastic surgeon Daniel Slobodianik examines a patient who had paid to have liquid silicone injected into her buttocks which has travelled up to her lower back . Thus goes body worship in Venezuela, where undergoing plastic surgery is as common as going to the dentist and beauty pageants are like a religion. Eager to resurrect her failed . marriage, Mercedes dreamed of having a shapely rear end. A risky, . potentially deadly, silicone injection technique beckoned. She said yes. Now she rues that day. ‘It . hurts so much I cannot sit down for even five minutes,’ said the . 45-year-old, her voice quivering. She is so embarrassed she won’t give . her last name. Two years ago Mercedes received 560cc of the stuff in each buttock. It was a low point in her life when she was desperate to rekindle her marriage and win back her estranged husband. ‘I did no research on what it was. I just wanted to know who did the best job,’ Mercedes says while waiting at a clinic. Her dream is to get the silicone out of her body. Playing with fire: Dr Slobodianik consults three female patients who have all undergone the dangerous amateur injections . Taking action: Maria Carolina Parejo, right, tries on a body corset before undergoing surgery to remove liquid silicone removed at a clinic in Caracas . Getting ready: Maria Carolina Parejo stands in front of a friend as she prepares to undergo surgery . Devastating results: Women with cosmetically enhanced behinds stand in the waiting room, some in too much pain to sit down . Saviour: Dr Slobodianik explains to patient Keiser Cuello how the removal of the synthetic biopolymer from her body, a procedure which costs up to ten times what she would have paid for the original injection . Damaged goods: Blanca Castellano shows the deformation caused by an illegal lip injection . The original operation cost the equivalent of $800 (£498). Days later, she started feeling an intense pain. She has learned to live with it, as she has with stinging criticism from her family. ‘I ask God and the Virgin for forgiveness so I can get out of this. This is no way to live,’ she said, her eyes clenched shut. Astrid de la Rosa, who underwent the same procedure only to see the gel migrate to her lower back and hips, created a support foundation in 2011. It is called the ‘No to Biopolymers Foundation’ and has recorded 15 deaths so far from complications resulting from this beauty enhancing technique. The foundation has knowledge of 40,000 people who opted for the procedure, and the number is growing even though in November of 2012 the Venezuelan government banned the use of use of stuffing-like materials such as the synthetic biopolymers for aesthetic purposes. The authorities have brought charges against some doctors and beauticians who continue to offer the service. ‘There are even recent cases of parents who give their daughters the biopolymer butt and breast treatment for their 15th birthday and now they regret it,’ said De la Rosa. Omar Guerrero, a 35-year-old trainer at a gym in the western city of San Cristobal, shot the gel into his pecs to look more buff and is now an utter wreck. Finally: Dr Slobodianik plans the incisions on patient Evelin De Aguilar, 30, before she has the industrial silicone removed from her body . Fingers crossed: Dr Slobodianik looks at the x-rays of Evelin before the procedure, which is done at great risk as there may not be any improvement at all . Horrifying end: Dr Slobodianik holds up a ball of liquid silicone removed from a patient who had paid to have it injected into her buttocks  to increase its size . Surgeons remove damaged tissue and silicone from Evelin's butt which had travelled around her body after the illegal injection . The polymers migrated to muscles between his ribs, tightening his thorax and limiting his breathing. He’s been flat out in bed for two years. ‘I cannot do exercise. I cannot run. I am a living dead man,’ said Guerrero. With his artificially toned up muscles, he said, people shun him in hospitals and treat him as if he were HIV-positive. He went to one of two doctors known to be offering a technique to try to rid people of the stuff they pumped into themselves. One is a Caracas plastic surgeon named Daniel Slobodianik. In the waiting room of his office it is standing room only. He says that since 2011 he must have seen about 400 patients with this problem. The legion of walking wounded in his clinic includes: a 60-year-old woman who can barely move she is in so much pain; two cousins who had the procedure done at the same time and while not yet smarting, are scared by what they are hearing; and a woman who is trying to get pregnant and is worrying what the silicone in her body might do to a fetus. The best they can do: Maria Carolina Parejo is being cleaned up after surgery, although the swelling will go down, there is no guaranteeing a success . On the other side: Evelin recovers a day after her surgery, eagerly awaiting the results . Doctors put a body corset on patient Maria Carolina Parejo after she has had the results of a botched butt implant reversed . The final result: Evelin De Aguilar,  shows off her giant scar during her recovery from the surgery . Slobodianik withdraws the silicone in a $6,000 (£3,730) operation that is still considered experimental by the Venezuelan Society for Plastic Surgery, as there is no guarantee of complete recovery or even improvement. Jesus Pereira, president of the society, said the only time it endorses the procedure is when the gel is actually at the point of bursting out of the body. ‘It is a special situation that can cause septicaemia and with it, death,’ he said. A better approach is to treat the problem with steroids, which gives pretty good results, he added. But Slobodianik said he has already operated on 50 women and three or four men. Still, some of the gel will always remain in the body, he said. ‘It is an incurable disease.’ As for Mercedes, she got her husband back but can no longer have sex and even refuses to take her clothes off in front of him because her rear is so bruised. And she can no longer even have sex.","At least 15 women have died in Venezuela from bad butt implants since 2011 .

"By . Tom Worden . and Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Distressing footage has emerged of the moment Spanish police restrained a British tourist who died of a suspected cardiac arrest shortly afterwards. The 30-second clip is believed to show former Rugby League player Luke Rhoden, 25, screaming as three officers grappled with him after he fell from a first-floor balcony in Ibiza. Another tourist who witnessed the incident said it appeared that officers later stamped on Mr Rhoden's head - a claim which has sparked calls for an inquiry but is denied by Ibiza's police. Scroll down for video . Distressing: Footage has emerged which is believed to show the moment police detained Luke Rhoden, 25, outside a hotel in Ibiza. He died shortly afterwards. A witness claimed it appeared officers later kicked him . Evidence: The 30-second clip shows the man screaming as he grapples with three officers in the street . Tragic: Luke Rhoden died in Ibiza after an altercation with police. He had fallen from a first floor balcony . The footage first emerged on social media and was filmed by a tourist who said they witnessed the tragic incident. A source in Ibiza's Civil Guard said officers believed Mr Rhoden may have taken drugs on Tuesday night before he fell from the balcony at the popular Ibiza Rocks hotel, in Sant Antoni de Portmany. He picked himself up and ran through the hotel screaming 'someone's trying to kill me', the police source claimed, before officers from the Civil Guard restrained him and put him into an ambulance to be sedated. But a British tourist who witnessed the incident gave a distressing account to his son. The 58-year-old asked not to be named, but phoned his 33-year-old son John Morrison from Poole, Dorset, after the incident unfolded. Mr Morrison said his father was 'still very shaken up', adding: 'They are staying in an apartment pretty much opposite Ibiza Rocks. He heard police sirens underneath their balcony. He went out to the balcony and the police cars came round. Anger: Mr Rhoden's father Norman has called for an investigation into the actions of the Spanish police . Mr Rhoden's father said: 'The feedback we have been getting on social media is suggesting something more untoward has happened as they were trying to contain him. That's what I want to get to the bottom of' 'He saw this guy backing out from the bar by Ibiza Rocks. He was backing off and there were a few police guys in front of him. 'He had gone to run away and that's when they started giving him a real pasting with batons. 'There was four or five of them. It was sustained. Tragedy: A police source claimed Mr Rhoden, 25, died from a suspected cardiac arrest . 'Dad said he managed to roll away on the floor and got to the other side of the road and that was when it looked like police started stamping on his head - two of them. 'By that time there was a crowd getting up and they were getting restless and that's when they stopped kicking the guy.' Today Mr Rhoden's father Norman called for a full investigation over the police's part in his son's death. 'The feedback we have been getting on social media is suggesting something more untoward or sinister has happened as they were trying to contain him,' he told the BBC. 'I'm not disagreeing that his behaviour may have been erratic, but what force have they used to subdue him? That's my concern, that's what I want to get to the bottom of.' Mr Morrison said according to his father, it was around half an hour before paramedics arrived. They then worked for around 45 minutes to revive the man in the street before the Civil Guard arrived and his body was removed, the tourist claimed. 'Dad was really shaken up,' Mr Morrison added. 'He messaged me and my brother and said ""never ever come to this place"".' Mr Rhoden, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, played prop forward as a junior for Wigan Warriors and for England's under 17 side. He also played for Oldham Roughyeds. Police are investigating the circumstances around his death and the results of an autopsy, which would determine whether he had taken drugs, have not yet been released. A police source insisted yesterday: 'Our officers do not beat people up. They restrained him for his own safety and helped him into the ambulance where he was sedated.' The source added: 'He was acting wildly and from his behaviour we believe he may have been taking drugs. Sportsman: Mr Rhoden (third right) with Wigan Warriors Academy Under-18s and Wigan Reserve Grade players in 2007. He later went on to play semi-professionally with Oldham, a club spokesman said . Probe: An autopsy will determine if Mr Rhoden took drugs, but its results have not yet been released . 'Our officers restrained him for his own safety and put him into an ambulance so he could be sedated. 'The paramedics tried to revive him but he died in the ambulance. An autopsy will reveal the cause of death.' Popular: Mr Rhoden enjoying a night out with friends . Formerly called Club Paraiso Mediterraneo, the 368-room hotel opened in 1998 and was renamed Ibiza Rocks in 2008. A spokesman for the venue denied police had been involved in the death. She confirmed there was a 'balcony incident', that the man did not die 'on impact' and his death happened outside the hotel. She said: 'We can confirm there was a fatality in Ibiza last night and our sincerest and heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of the individual concerned at this very difficult time. 'We continue to assist the Spanish Police with their investigation and cannot make further comment about the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident until a full enquiry is complete.' A source at the hotel added: 'Several of our staff witnessed him being restrained but nobody has reported seeing the police use excessive force or beating him. 'He had fallen from a balcony and then made his way through public areas of the hotel acting very strangely. 'He made it out into the street where the police took over.' Mr Rhoden's former club Wigan Warriors paid tribute to him, saying: 'Wigan Warriors are saddened to hear of the death of former youth player Luke Rhoden. 'Having come through the club's scholarship system Luke played for the Warriors academy in 2007 and 2008 before moving on to play semi-professionally at Oldham.' A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it had been informed of the death and was providing assistance to the man's family. She said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'","Distressing clip believed to show Luke Rhoden, 25, screaming in street .

"By . Elsa Mcalonan . I have to confess I am not a fan of celebrity fragrances. I have never found one I liked since the launch of the most successful celebrity perfume of all time - Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds Eau de Toilette (£53 for 100ml, Debenhams) Elizabeth Taylor created White Diamonds in 1991. With top of notes of neroli, lily and tuberose; middle notes of orris and amber and the base of sandalwood, patchouli and oak moss – it remains a glorious scent and is still a best seller – even after 23 years! Since then we have seen the launch of dozens of celebrity scents. Mostly I find them too sweet, too cloying and with an annoying tendency to linger on your skin a tad longer than you want them to. Chic: Cheryl recently launched her fragrance, Storm Flower, which has a sweet scent with fruity notes . Understated: The bottle is pretty and cute - like Cheryl herself . When the latest celebrity fragrance lands on my desk to try, it is unlikely that it will end up on my bathroom shelf, let alone on my wrists. So the news this week that our love affair with celebrity fragrances is cooling off, is strangely timed - especially as this week two new celebrity scents hit the shelves and another launches in the next few weeks. Such is the excitement surrounding Cheryl Cole's first ever fragrance, Storm Flower, that Superdrug have brought forward the on sale date by a week. It will be stocked exclusively at all stores from today - Friday 22nd August - until 8th September, before the fragrance is available nationwide. Superdrug is hugely optimistic, expecting to sell 30,000 bottles of Storm Flower by Cheryl in the first month - almost 1,000 bottles a day. So what's it like? First impressions are promising. It is not what I expected. The Eau de parfum comes in a rose gold box, with a classy looking purple border. And unlike the One Direction fragrance, which has the boys' pictures plastered all over the box, this simply has the name of the perfume on the box, with the name CHERYL in capital letters underneath. Third scent: One Direction launch their latest perfume, You & I, which comes in an Art Deco style bottle . The effect is understated and chic, but I found the fragrance had a powerful kick. There are top notes of mandarin and nectarine, with the addition of vanilla, white musk and precious sandalwood. It is very sweet and certainly long lasting. I could still smell this 12 hours after first spraying it. The best thing about this perfume is the bottle. It is really pretty and cute - like Cheryl herself - with a beautiful rose gold lid in the shape of a golden flower. The bottle will appeal to all ages, but suspect what’s inside it will appeal more to younger fans. Cheryl joins a long line of celebrities to have launched their own perfumes. Superstar Beyoncé has sold more than half a million bottles of fragrance at Superdrug since launching Heat in 2010, and her latest fragrance, Rise, has proven itself the best-selling celebrity fragrance of 2014 to date. Other celebrity fragrance winners included Jay Z, whose GOLD Jay Z fragrance came second in sales only to his wife's. Britney Spears, whose fragrances have been consistent best sellers since the launch of Curious in 2004, rounds off the top three with Fantasy Naughty & Nice Remix. One Direction's Our Moment still a top five best seller a nearly a year after release. With the fragrance selling 1.5million bottles over last Christmas period, the boys will be looking to repeat the success with their latest offering, You and I, which went on sale on Wednesday. I reviewed One Direction's first fragrance 'Our Moment' when it launched. It was officially the fastest-selling celebrity perfume of all time following record-breaking sales in its first week of release in August 2013. At the time, I wasn't very kind about it, but the legions of One Direction fans obviously didn't agree and bottles flew off the shelves. Top scent seller: Could Cheryl knock Beyonce off her perch with her new fragrance? You & I by One Direction, £19.50 for 30ml EDP (Superdrug) is the third addition to One Direction's popular perfume collection. It combines bright splashes of mango and refreshing grapefruit with a heart of creamy osmanthus, exotic orchid and soft peony. I found it quite similar to their first fragrance. If anything, this is a subtler, a little more grown up and certainly not as overpowering. When I sprayed it at first I found it far too sweet, but as it settled down a bit I actually found myself liking it. What a surprise! It comes in a striking glass bottle, which somehow does not match the fragrance - it is elegant and sophisticated with an Art Deco style lid. This will definitely please all of One Direction's fans who love everything they do. There isn't one of these bottles that I wouldn't be happy to display on my dressing table. The real secret of a successful celebrity scent is in the design of the bottle recent years Nicki Minaj's scents have become collectors' items - because of the exquisite bottles that look like works of art. The original Nikki Minaj Pink Friday fragrance launched in April 2013 and was the third biggest selling women’s fragrance, beating everything except Chanel No 5 and Coco Mademoiselle. Quirky: The new Nikki Minaj ONIKA fragrance, on sale in September . Fans will no doubt be flocking to buy the new Nikki Minaj ONIKA fragrance, £28.50 for 50ml EDT (The Perfume Shop) when it hits the shelves on 17th September. This new bottle doesn't disappoint and I think could be my favourite so far. The new fragrance is bold, with fruity notes of pear and mandarin with the floral scent of water lily and orchid with and a tiny touch of sweet sugar cane and musk. I have tried this one too - and was pleasantly surprised. Not too heavy or sickly, as a light scent for early autumn days it fits the bill perfectly. But with the news this week that the celebrity scent market has lost its gloss, with sales down thirty percent of some names including Justin Bieber's fragrance, are the stores getting worried? Michael Hume, senior fragrance buyer at Superdrug says: 'Celebrity fragrance really resonates with shoppers as it lets fans buy a little piece of their icon. While some celebrity fragrances may have lost their sparkle in recent months, the right star and the right fragrance will always succeed. 'We've long expected Cheryl to launch her own, and we're predicting big things. With X Factor in the pipeline and her latest single topping the charts, she's truly on top of her game and fragrance is the next logical step.' I have heard that Lady Gaga is also rumoured to be bringing out a new scent… let's hope she has the bottle to do it.

"By . Associated Press . A man who spent almost a quarter-century behind bars for murder has been freed and cleared of a killing that happened when he was 1,100 miles away on a Disney World vacation. Jonathan Fleming, 51, was in tears as he hugged his lawyers and family in a Brooklyn courtroom today. Relatives said, 'Thank you, God!' after he was freed. 'After 25 years, come hug your mother,' Patricia Fleming said, and he did. Scroll down for video . Exonerated: Jonathan Fleming, 51, hugs his mother Patricia Fleming in Brooklyn Supreme Court earlier this month after a judge declared him free. Mr Fleming's mother had always maintained his innocence . Free at last: Mr Fleming with his ex-wife Valerie Brown at Brooklyn's Supreme court. The court dismissed his conviction in the 1989 shooting of his friend after evidence emerged which put him 1,000 miles away . Defense attorneys and prosecutors asked a Brooklyn judge to dismiss Fleming's conviction in the 1989 shooting. A key eyewitness recanted, new witnesses have implicated someone else and a review by prosecutors turned up a hotel receipt putting Fleming in Florida hours before the killing, defense lawyers Anthony Mayol and Taylor Koss said. 'I feel wonderful,' Fleming said outside court. 'I've always had faith. I knew that this day would come someday.' Asked about his plans: 'I'm going to go eat dinner with my mother and my family, and I'm going to live the rest of my life.' From the start, Fleming told authorities he had been in Orlando, Florida, when a friend, Darryl 'Black' Rush, was shot to death in Brooklyn early on August 15, 1989. Authorities suggested the shooting was motivated by a dispute over money. Emotional: Jonathan Fleming (pictured in purple shirt) hugs his attorney Anthony Mayol while his other attorney Taylor Koss claps in Brooklyn Supreme Court following his exoneration . Walking free: People cheer as Mr Fleming (right, in purple shirt) leaves Brooklyn Supreme Court with his arm around his mother Patricia Fleming, after spending 25 years in jail for a murder he didn't commit . Reunited: Mr Fleming (centre) hugs his mother Patricia Fleming (left) and ex-wife Valerie Brown (right) outside Brooklyn Supreme Court after he was cleared of murdering his friend nearly 25 years ago . Fleming had plane tickets, videos and postcards from his trip, his lawyers said, but authorities suggested he could have been in New York at the actual time of the shooting, and a woman testified that she had seen him shoot Rush. The eyewitness recanted her testimony soon after Fleming's 1990 conviction, saying she had lied so police would cut her loose for an unrelated arrest, but Fleming lost his appeals. The defense asked the DA's office to review the case last year. Defense investigators found previously untapped witnesses who implicated someone else as the gunman, the attorneys said, declining to give the witnesses' or potential suspect's names before prosecutors investigate them. 'I feel wonderful!' Jonathan Fleming (center) is surrounded by friends after leaving Brooklyn Supreme Court. Mr Fleming said the first thing he wanted to do was to have dinner with his mother and family . Free man: Mr Fleming speaks to the media after his exoneration, 25 years after he was sent to jail for the killing . And prosecutors' review produced a hotel receipt that Fleming paid in Florida about five hours before the shooting — a document that police had evidently had since they found in Fleming's pocket on arresting him, Mayol and Koss said. Patricia Fleming, 79, was with her only son in Orlando at the time of the crime. She testified at his trial, but the jury evidently didn't believe her. 'I knew he didn't do it, because I was there,' she said. 'When they gave my son 25-to-life, I thought I would die in that courtroom.' Still, she said, 'I never did give up because I knew he was innocent.' Making changes: Brooklyn District Attorney (DA) Kenneth Thompson (left) replaced longtime DA Charles Hynes (right) in January with a campaign focused on wrongful convictions on Hynes's watch . The exoneration, first reported by the New York Daily News, comes amid scrutiny of Brooklyn prosecutors' process for reviewing questionable convictions — scrutiny that comes partly from the new DA Kenneth Thompson himself. He unseated longtime DA Charles 'Joe' Hynes last year after a campaign that focused partly on wrongful convictions on Hynes' watch. Hynes had created a special conviction integrity unit to review false-conviction claims, but some saw the effort as slow-moving and defensive. Thompson took office in January. In February, his office agreed to dismiss the murder convictions of two men who had spent more than 20 years in prison for three killings, saying newly discovered evidence had raised substantial doubts about their guilt.","Jonathan Fleming, 51, exonerated by a Brooklyn judge today .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and William Turvill . An ancient human ancestor known as ‘Nutcracker Man’ lived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts, worms and grasshoppers, according to research. Scientists believe this diet explains why the ancient hominin relative, called Paranthropus boisei, which lived in East Africa between 2.4 and 1.4 million years ago, had such distinctively powerful jaws and large, flat molar teeth. There have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors, but this latest study from Oxford University claims to have finally settled the debate. Ancient humans survived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts, left, worms, right and grasshoppers, according to new research from from Oxford University. There have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors but this latest study claims to have finally settled the debate . Paranthropus boisei was an early hominin that roamed East Africa between 2.4 and 1.2 million years ago. Remains of the species were first discovered by anthropologist Mary Leakey in 959 in Tanzania. The well-preserved jaw gave our ancient ancestor the nickname 'Nutcracker Man'. It is widely considered to be the first hominin species to have used stone tools. The breakthrough, published in Plos One, came after archaeologists compared the remains of the ancient hominin relative with baboons in Kenya. Both were found to have large flat molar teeth and powerful jaws, and both sets of teeth showed similar signs of wear and tear. Tiger nuts are grass bulbs that are still eaten in parts of the world today, and are sold in health food shops. Hominins roamed East Africa between 2.4 million and 1.4 million years ago, foraging for the edible grass bulbs still eaten in some parts of the world today. Academics have debated why this early man had such strong jaws, indicating a diet of hard foods like nuts, yet their teeth seemed to be made for consuming soft foods. Damage to the tooth enamel also indicated they had come into contact with an abrasive substance. Previous research, using stable isotope analysis, suggested the diet of these hominins was largely comprised of plants like grasses and sedges. However such high-fibre foods would not have been high quality to sustain the large-brained, medium-sized hominin. Researchers compared remains of a hominin called Paranthropus boisei, replica remains pictured left, with baboons in Kenya, similar to the one pictured right. Both were found to have large flat molars and powerful jaws. Both sets of teeth also showed similar signs of wear and tear, suggesting their diets were the same . By studying the diet of the Kenyan baboons, Dr Gabriele Macho from the university discovered they eat large quantities of tiger nuts. This food would have contained sufficiently high amounts of minerals, vitamins, and the fatty acids that would have been particularly important for the hominin brain. Dr Macho said: ‘I believe that the theory - that ‘Nutcracker Man’ lived on large amounts of tiger nuts- helps settle the debate about what our early human ancestor ate.’ He added: ‘Tiger nuts, still sold in health food shops as well as being widely used for grinding down and baking in many countries, would be relatively easy to find. ‘They also provided a good source of nourishment for a medium-sized hominin with a large brain. ‘This is why these hominins were able to survive for around one million years because they could successfully forage - even through periods of climatic change.' The research also claims that our ancestors would have eaten invertebrates to get the protein they needed for brain development.","Study compared remains of an ancient hominin known as 'Nutcracker Man' with Kenyan baboons .

He is a unique character but he can galvanise the club and has the potential to be a real success at Liverpool. VIDEO Scroll down Mario Balotelli: I see expectation from Liverpool fans . Intelligence: Mario Balotelli boasts clever movement and a cool head in front of goal . Footballing intelligence . England needed to look after him at the World Cup but they failed because of his clever movement. He looks to pull off the shoulder and get in behind defenders, and he did just that when he drifted off the back of Gary Cahill to head in for Italy at the far post. Handful: Striker Balotelli is strong in the air and good with both feet . Striking mentality . We all know about his problems off the field but he can’t let them affect his game on it. If he keeps his focus he is deadly. He is cool in front of goal — he has scored 17 out of 19 penalties for club and country — but he is susceptible to being wound up. In Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool have the perfect coach to get the best out of him. Sometimes it doesn’t matter if your team-mate is wearing crazy clothes or setting off fireworks in his bathroom — as long as he does the business on the pitch you put up with it. Relaxed: Balotelli gets to grips with fellow Italian Fabio Borini during a training session on Friday . Deadly technique . Often Balotelli relies on raw power to beat his man but he still has excellent technique. He is strong in the air and good with both feet, particularly his right. If he can get in behind defenders in that right-hand channel then more often than not the ball will end up in the back of the net . Threat: Balotelli scores against England at this summer's World Cup . Time for some team-work . Balotelli is not an out-and-out striker, but he never wants to wander too far from that central area where he can score. He may have to adapt at Liverpool. Luis Suarez was forever popping up all over the pitch and, though Balotelli is not a direct replacement, he has to be prepared to rotate. Hard to handle: Defenders have to stand up to the physical challenge with Balotellli . Pure power . England failed to get a grip on Balotelli and a large part of that was because of his raw power. He is so strong and, combined with his pace, it makes him a fearsome striker. VIDEO Scroll down 10 Facts about Mario Balotelli you maybe didn't know... Maverick: There was never a dull moment when Balotelli was at Manchester City . How I'd mark him . When a player has so much pace and power, you have to show him your own strength.

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A mother-of-three says losing a massive 16st in weight has ruined her life. Kim Wall, 40, suffered crippling pain, nausea, fatigue and low self-confidence after undergoing a gastric bypass operation. She is now warning other women who are considering undergoing bariatric surgery to think carefully before committing to life-changing procedures. Scroll down for video . Kim's surgery saw her drop from size 24 and 24st (left) to 8st and a size 6 (right) Miss Wall, of Rochdale, said: 'I had the surgery because I dreamed of being more energetic for my children, but it didn't work out that way at all. 'I've gone from being too fat to move to being weak and undernourished. I thought the operation would give me the life I'd dreamed of - but it turns out I couldn't have been more wrong.' Miss Wall, a former hairdresser who has three children, Jack, 16, Tia, six and Theo, three, reached 24st after she turned to food for an emotional crutch after she lost a baby when she was 18 years old. She said: 'I turned to comfort eating and it got the point where I didn't know how to say no. 'Having my first two children and experiencing the weight gain and cravings just made the situation worse. I could eat a multi-pack of crisps without even thinking about it.' By her late thirties, Kim was classed as clinically obese and started to experience mounting health problems . Kim turned to food as a comfort after losing a baby when she was 18 and used to eat huge amounts of junk . By her late thirties, Miss Wall was officially classed as clinically obese and was starting to experience mounting health problems. She said: 'The children had loads of energy, but I struggled even to get out of a seat. Even the gentlest movement would leave me gasping for breath. 'I wasn't unhappy with my build, but I was devastated every time I couldn't join in with an activity the kids were doing. I felt guilty to see their disappointment.' Kim at her largest, when she was a size 24 . At an appointment in the spring of 2008, her doctor made it clear that unless she changed to her lifestyle, she would become seriously ill. Miss Wall said: 'My GP said he was really worried - that I would need to start losing weight as a matter of urgency. He referred me to a consultant who recommended that I have a gastric bypass through NHS funding. 'I knew it was a drastic step, but I'd tried every diet under the sun without any success, so the idea of being able to make a lasting change was very appealing. 'I thought of myself running around in the park with the children, and was drawn to the idea.' Miss Wall asked advice from her mother Muriel and her partner Marley, 40, a painter and decorator. She said: 'My mum warned me to have a serious think about. She said she would prefer it if I didn't go through with it, because she knew it was a major operation which carried major risks. 'Marley was unsure too. He'd met and fallen in love with me when I was at my biggest, and was happy with the way I was. He said all he cared about was whether I was happy, so if I really wanted to do it, he would support me.' After weighing up her options, Miss Wall went under the knife in April 2008. Within two months she had lost 3st. She said: 'I could barely eat any food. Whatever I did manage to swallow made my stomach turn. I felt sick all the time.' Following the surgery Kim, pictured here during her weight loss, found the weight dropping off at great speed as she was barely able to eat at all and felt uncomfortable full all the time . Kim, pictured here (L-R) with Tia, holding Theo, Jack and her partner Marley, says her dream of losing weight giving her more energy has been shattered and she more exhausted than ever after the surgery . In the summer of 2010 Miss Wall discovered that she was pregnant with her third child. She said: 'Carrying a child having been through the operation was a huge challenge. Marley and I were ecstatic but it was a really tough pregnancy and I was sick morning, noon and night. 'Instead of being full of life I was tired all the time. I tried my best to carry on but it was extremely tough.' Following the birth of Theo in April 2011, Miss Wall calculated that she had lost a huge 10st - and the weight loss showed no signs of slowing. As she settled into her new figure, Miss Wall began to struggle with the permanent effects of the surgery. She said: 'All I could manage was the tiniest portions at dinner time. Marley was concerned - he thought there was no way I could eat as little as I was and still be healthy. 'There were times when all I could manage was sucking on a ice-cube because I felt so unnaturally full. 'My energy dipped to practically zero and simple pleasures, like spending time alone with Marley and chasing around after the children, became a huge chore. Kim says she has been left barely able to eat anything and has no energy to play with her children (right, pictured with son, Theo) 'I used to love having hot baths, but I had shrunk so much that lying in the bath became too uncomfortable as the enamel pressed against my spine. Sitting on hard seats was excruciating.' Now weighing just over 8st and having shrunk from size 24 to a tiny size 6, Miss Wall has found that she struggles to buy clothes which properly fit her. She said: 'I buy a few bags of ice cubes and eat a pint of them throughout the day. It's the best compromise I can find to keep my mind off food, since most food makes me feel extremely nauseous. 'I can't go out for meals with Marley any more and worst of all, my dream of being active with the children seems further away than ever.' Doctors are currently reviewing Miss Wall's situation and she is hopeful that she will one day find a solution to allow her to each proper meals again. She said: 'It's important that people realise that gastric operations come with significant risk. My life has changed out of all recognition. 'I completely regret having the gastric bypass. I wish I'd never done it. It's just such a shame that I had to get to this point to realise that I was happier when I was overweight.'","Kim turned to food as a comfort after losing a baby when she was 18 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Pro basketball’s first openly-gay player has yet to be signed by an NBA team. No NBA team has signed Jason Collins, 34, despite a solid 12 year career spent with six different teams, most recently the Boston Celtics, and he doesn't understand why. The seven-foot-tall center told the New York Times that three teams have contacted his agent, but ultimately went in a different direction. He will not consider playing in Europe, he said. A 12 year veteran: Jason Collins has played for the Nets, Hawks, Grizzlies, Timberwolves, Wizards and Celtics . Mr Collins announced his sexuality in the May 6 issue of Sports Illustrated, on the cover. ‘I'm a 34-year-old NBA center,’ he wrote. ‘I'm black. And I'm gay.’ A free agent at the time, there were some grumblings Mr Collins might not be signed by an NBA team by the beginning of this season. Training camps have opened, but the respected player is without a team. Despite championship experience at every level he’s played – two state championships in high school, the NCAA’s Final Four and two NBA Finals across nine playoff appearances – many worry he will not suit up again. Championship-caliber: Jason Collins, #35 of the New Jersey Nets, drives to the hoop during Game Six of the 2007 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals (left), goes for a dunk during his 2013 season with the Celtics (right) At 34, the Los Angeles native is no longer in the prime of his career. Though considered a reliable bench presence, his career statistics of 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds per game are hardly earth shattering. As a 21-year veteran, Mr Collins can not sign for any less than just under $1.4million, per the contract agreed upon between the player’s union and team owners. Younger players with upside potential can be had for less. But is that the only reason? ‘You don’t want to speculate — I don’t go there,’ Mr Collins said to the Times. Admitting that his name isn’t going to be the first called off any team’s bench, he still doesn’t understand why he isn’t on an NBA roster. ‘I feel there are players in the league right now that, quite frankly, I’m better than,’ he added. Both out: NBA player Jason Collins and former Major League Baseball player Billy Beane throw out the ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium on September 27 . One of the teams that kicked the tires on Mr Collins, the Detroit Pistons, ended up signing third-year player Josh Harrelson for $900,000, he told the Times. Other teams, including the Brooklyn Nets, for whom he played when they were still in New Jersey, were also considered landing spots, the Times noted, but luxury cap penalties this year made that impossibility. Despite having previously played with current Nets coach Jason Kidd, any contract he could sign would be penalized at four times his salary because it would put the Nets over the league salary cap, the Times explained. ‘It shouldn’t be about that,’ Mr Collins told the Times. ‘The N.B.A. is for the best players, not for the most affordable players.’ Active offseason: NBA Basketball Players Baron Davis (left) and Jason Collins (right) attend the  2nd Annual GameOn! fundraiser Sept 29 in Culver City, CA . The league office told the paper it does not feel the former Atlanta Hawk, he played three seasons for the team, is unsigned because he is gay – one team official disagreed though. ‘Some teams just might not want to deal with it because of the media implications,’ a general manager who refused to be named told the paper, echoing comments about the circus surrounding NFL player Tim Tebow’s every move with both the Denver Broncos and New York Jets. Many feel Jason Collins being on the court after coming out is just as important as him going public about his sexuality. ‘I do think it’s important for him to be in the league as a visible symbol,’ activist Richard Lapchick told the Times. ‘If he makes this courageous stand but then disappears from the locker room, it would not do it justice.’ Mr Lapchick did acknowledge to the paper that the new salary cap penalties may make it difficult for Mr Collins to find a fit. ‘The decision to sign him rests with individual team owners’ gay athlete advocate Hudson Taylor said to the Times, ‘one of them has to step up.’ Award-winning: Collins speaks onstage after receiving the Inspirational Athlete of the Year Award at the 28th Anniversary Sports Spectacular Gala on May 19 (left) and poses for a picture at the GameOn! Fundraiser (right) Former Boston Celtics Coach Doc Rivers, now at the helm of the Los Angeles Clippers, is open to signing the veteran big man – but only as an insurance policy should one of his guys go down with an injury. ‘Let me put it this way: if one of my bigs goes down and he’s not signed, I’m signing him,’ said Mr Rivers. ‘I’m not signing him because he’s gay. I’m not signing him because it’s a story and it brings us attention.’ ‘I’m signing him because he has a value to help us win,’ the coach added, ‘I do have the advantage that I coached him, and I know what type of guy he is, how tough he is.’ Despite having no roster to call home, Mr Collins remains upbeat. ‘This is not an unprecedented situation, as far as being a veteran and not joining a team until later in the season,’ Collins told the paper. ‘So there are a lot of ways that this can play out.’ Will he ever suit up again?: C.J. Watson #32 of the Chicago Bulls draws a foul from Jason Collins (center) Asked whether he would consider playing abroad, as many fringe players do, Mr Collins immediately shot down the notion. ‘’I’m an N.B.A. player. I want to play in the N.B.A,’ he told the Times. ‘I just have to stay in this mode of handling this test, of having patience. You know, I have faced worse in my life.’ It remains to be seen whether he will be signed by an NBA team this season, anything can happen. Kenyon Martin signed with the New York Knicks so late last season he only played 18 games – but played an integral role. Already wealthy from his playing career, Mr Collins does not need to worry about money. As he wrote in Sports Illustrated, he just wants to play the game. ‘I've reached that enviable state in life in which I can do pretty much what I want. And what I want is to continue to play basketball. ‘ .","Jason Collins announced he is gay this past May in Sports Illustrated .

"By . Alex Greig . A new report on the Canine Special Detail of the LA Sheriff’s Department (LASD) shows that police dogs bite a disproportionately large number of minority suspects. According to the Police Assessment Resource Centre (PARC) report, the number of Latino people bitten by LASD dogs went up 30 per cent between 2004 and 2012 and the number of African Americans bitten rose 33 per cent. Most disturbingly, for the first half of 2013 100 per cent of individuals bitten by LASD dogs have been black or Latino. Targets: A new report shows that LASD police dogs bite disproportionately high numbers black and Latino people . PARC is a non-profit devoted to 'advancing effective, respectful and publicly accountable policing.' The report's writers say the 2013 statistics for police dog bites to minorities is 'a troubling and unacceptable figure.' Also noted by the report is the low or non-existent incidence of dog bites in affluent areas with smaller minority populations. 'Crime rates are lower in these areas, but the stark disparity leads us to wonder why canine deployments seem to occur disproportionately in less affluent areas with larger minority populations,' stated the report. Closely monitored: The report recommended that the department tracks the incidence of bites from individual dogs and their trainers . Between 2004 and 2012, the largely black or Latino areas of Century, City of Industry, Compton, Lakewood and South LA/Lennox had more dog bites than all of LASD’s 21 other areas combined. It's not the first time the LASD has received criticism for racial profiling. According to The Independent, in the 1980s some Los Angeles police officers would refer to black youths as 'dog biscuits'. A recent Department of Justice report found that the LASD singles out black and Latino people for stops, seizures and excessive for a higher rates than other races 'in violation of the Constitution and federal law'. Race row: The LASD's police dogs appear to be racially discriminatory . The report found that 'African Americans, and to a lesser extent Latinos, are more likely to be stopped and/or searched than whites, even when controlling for factors other than race, such as crime rates.' The authors of the Parc report recommended that the LASD collect data going forward on the factors that drive canine call-outs to understand the disproportionate numbers of bites to racial minorities - or impose a moratorium on the use of dogs. They also suggest that the department employ alternative uses of force and that it tracks the incidence of bites for individual dogs and trainers.","Los Angeles Sheriff's Department has come under fire due to police dogs biting large numbers of minorities .

"By . Richard Spillett . Works by some of the biggest names in modern art went on show today ahead of a sale that is expected to make more than £200 million. More than 30 works, including a painting by Francis Bacon and an Andy Warhol print, have gone on show at Christie's in London, before they are transported to New York for the sale in May. Among the stand-out lots is Bacon's Three Studies For A Portrait Of John Edwards which dates from 1984 and is valued at £47 million. Another of the celebrated works to go under the hammer is Jeff Koon's 'Jim Beam-J.B.Turner Train stainless steel and bourbon', valued at £20million. Christie's Brett Gorvy said the Bacon work was one of the 'greatest paintings' from artist's late period. He said: 'Three Studies For A Portrait Of John Edwards, executed in 1984, was the centrepiece of the artist's retrospective at the London Tate Gallery in 1985-86, and a work that the artist himself ranked amongst his best works.' Last year, another of Bacon's paintings - Three Studies Of Lucian Freud - became the most valuable work of art ever sold at auction when it fetched almost £90 million after just six minutes of frenzied bidding. American artist Jeff Koons' 1986 work 'Jim Beam J.B. Turner Train' is expected to make around £20million. The train is filled with Jim Beam bourbon . Koons said of the work: 'You can drink it and enjoy the bourbon, but you have killed the work of art because you've destroyed the soul of the piece when you break the tax-stamp seal' Francis Bacon's 'Three Studies for a Portrait of John Edwards' is expected to make around £48 million. Christie's Brett Gorvy said: 'It shows an incredible tenderness and harmony that was prompted by Bacon's paternal relationship with the sitter, and this period of contentment elicited a confidence of style that has been compared to late Matisse.' Andy Warhol's 'John Lennon - Red' is one of a number of works by the pop artist going up for sale in New York in May . 'Race Riot' by Andy Warhol, which is expected to fetch £30million, uses photos from 1963 unrest in Birmingham, Alabama .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters . Police in Italy and New York broke up a major trans-Atlantic mafia ring on Tuesday, arresting 24 people accused of plotting to move hundreds of millions of dollars in drugs between South America, Italy and the United States. The sting operation involving undercover agents and wire taps offered more evidence the Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta had overtaken its Sicilian cousin, the Cosa Nostra, and was trying to make inroads in the United States by forging ties with one of the traditional New York mob families, the Gambinos. FBI and Italian agents jointly carried out 'Operation New Bridge' simultaneously just after midnight in Brooklyn and just before dawn in Italy, American and Italian officials told a news conference in Rome. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gambino associate Franco Lupoli was one of 24 alleged mobsters busted in early morning raids in both the U.S. and Italy . Brooklyn: Charles 'Charlie Pepsi' Centaro, a Bonanna family associate, was arrested in Brooklyn just after midnight .

Busted: U.S. and Italian authorities busted a billion-dollar cocaine deal between the Gambino crime family and Italian mobsters . FBI and Italian agents jointly carried out ""Operation New Bridge"" simultaneously just after midnight in Brooklyn and just before dawn in Italy . Those arrested were accused of international drugs trafficking, money laundering and membership in organized crime. The clans of the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, a version of the Sicilian Mafia on the southern mainland, and members of the Gambino Mafia family in New York, were in the advanced stages of plans to smuggle some 500 kg (1,000 pounds) of pure cocaine from Guyana in South America to the port of Gioia Tauro in Calabria. Italian investigators estimated the street value of the cocaine after cutting at about $1 billion. The drugs, supplied by Latin American drug cartels, were to have been sent to Italy hidden in shipments of canned fruit. Some of it would then have been smuggled to the United States. 'The 'Ndrangheta determined to move deadly narcotics across international boundaries, attempting to build a bridge of criminality and corruption to stretch from South America to Italy and back to New York,' said assistant U.S. attorney Marshall Miller. Gotti: The Gambino crime family was once headed by notorious New York mobster John Gotti and later by his son John Gotti Jr. The Gambino crime family is one of what is widely referred to as 'The Five Families' of Italian organized crime operations in New York City and other parts of the United States. The Gambino's rise to become one of the most powerful mafia families in America started in 1957, when the family's namesake, Carlos Gambino - an Italian immigrant - orchestrated the murder of Albert Anastasia, who had organized a collection of Italian gangs into what now would be considered a 'crime family.' Gambino headed the organization until 1976, when he handed power over to his brother-in-law Paul Castellano. Like other mafia families, the Gambinos took their methods from the crime families in Italy - La Cosa Nostra - and were involved in illegal activities like loan-sharking, extortion, prostitution, gambling and money laundering - as well as the frequent assaults and murders associated with those types of business ventures. In 1985, Gambino 'capo' John Gotti orchestrated the murder of Castellano to become the most publicized boss of the family. Gotti's reign came to an end when his underboss, Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano agreed to testify against him and other members of the family in a 1992 RICO trial. Since Gotti's downfall, the Gambinos - and other mafia families - have lost much of the power they once had over politicians, judges and labor unions. It is believed that the family is now headed by Domenico Cefalu, who lives in Brooklyn. He told reporters at a news conference at the headquarters of Italy's anti-Mafia investigators with other U.S. and Italian investigators that the operation struck at 'the heart of international organized crime.' The operation began in 2012 when investigators detected a plan by members of the Ursino clan of the 'Ndrangheta to smuggle large amounts of drugs. An undercover agent was dispatched to Italy and was successful in infiltrating the clan. An undercover agent was also involved in the handover of 1.3 kg of heroin in New York as part of the infiltration operation. They said the plan involved 'Ndrangheta members in both Italy and New York who had forged an alliance with the Gambino family of the U.S. Mafia. The FBI and Italian investigators intercepted email messages between mobsters in Italy and the New Socco Enterprise fruit canning company in Georgetown, Guyana. During the investigation police wire taps . indicated the group was also considering arms trafficking on a . considerable scale but that plan never moved beyond the initial stages. 'Rat': Mob turncoat Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano helped put a dent in the Gambino crime enterprise, but it still exists today . Investigators say that in recent years 'Ndrangheta clans have made inroads in criminal activity in northern Italy and elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Germany and now want to expand in the United States. 'What we see here is 'Ndrangheta attempting to gain a foothold in the New York area and the United States,' Miller said. 'We also see efforts to forge cooperation between the 'Ndrangheta and the Cosa Nostra,' he said.","Authorities arrested 24 alleged mobsters in both Italy and New York .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A huge population of wild monkeys is sweeping across Florida after being introduced during the filming of TARZAN. There are now thought to be 1,000 Rhesus monkeys roaming the sunshine state - all descended from three males and females released together in the late 1930s. The 'couples' were brought to America and marooned on a small island near the Silver River by tour operator Colonel Tooey. The six original monkeys were marooned on an island near Silver River as a tourist attraction during the filming of Tarzan Finds a Son . The entrepreneur who owned the monkeys didn't realise they could swim and so they escaped . Some tour guides say he wanted to capitalise on the success of the 1939 hit Tarzan Finds A Son, which filmed nearby, to promote his jungle tours. However the bungling businessman didn't realise the species could swim and they quickly escaped from 'Monkey Island' and started breeding. Nearly 80 years later some have been seen as far away as Jacksonville and Sarasota - more than 100 miles from Silver River State Park, near Ocala. Eighty years after they were accidentally introduced the monkeys have been seen up to 100 miles away from Silver River . Despite their numbers the monkeys have had no obvious impact on the ecosystem . Florida State's policy is usually to eliminate any feral species - as seen with the well publicised hunt for Burmese pythons in the Everglades. But, in an ironic twist to Colonel Tooey's original plan, the monkeys are now attracting tourists across the state. Local tour operator Captain Tom O'Lenick, 65, said: 'Everybody who comes on the river for a tour wants to see the monkeys. The monkeys prey on insects and are particularly fond of long-jawed orb-weaver spiders . The macaques have also become prey for foxes, owls, bobcats and alligators which leap out of rivers to grab them . 'From my point of view, as a naturalist, I think the planet changes naturally and species do move around, whether that is by man or other means. 'Change is the way the planet works - so I would just keep them.' He said the monkeys do not seem to have an obvious impact on the ecosystem and have even become prey for foxes, owls, bobcats and alligators - which leap from the river to snatch them out of trees. Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan starred as Tarzan and Jane in the 1939 film Tarzan Finds a Son which was filmed in Florida . British wildlife photographer Graham McGeorge, 42, is among those who have travelled to Silver Springs to see the monkeys. He said: 'Some of the macaques are braver than others, usually the males. Nursing females and babies tend to keep further away. 'The balance of their diet is made up of dirt, insects, and they love spiders. Long-jawed orb-weaver spiders are common along the banks of the river, and the monkeys eat them like candy.' He added: 'They are not a pest to people - people are pest to the macaques. People feed them and this is not cool. You should never feed wildlife. 'Just like any other wild animal you need to give them space.' State officials have caught more than . 700 of the monkeys over the last 10 years and found that most tested . positive for the herpes-B virus. It . is because of this disease, which is often lethal to humans but rarely . contracted, that some consider the monkeys a public health hazard. However, . there was controversy in 2012 when the Tampa Bay Times reported . suspicions that the state catcher had sold captured monkeys on to . research laboratories.","Three 'couples' brought to America and marooned on 'Monkey Island'

In a week of unusual detente in the sometimes strained world of Anglo-Russian relations, Prince Charles warmly greeted media magnate Alexander Lebedev at the opening of an extraordinary exhibition which sees the return of 70 masterpieces from Sir Robert Walpole’s art collection to the magnificent Palladian mansion originally built to house it. Mr Lebedev is standing trial in Moscow on charges of ‘hooliganism motivated by political hatred’ arising from an incident in which he punched fellow businessman Sergei Polonsky during the recording of a television programme in Moscow in 2011. However, he was given special dispensation by the judge to attend the event at Houghton Hall, near King’s Lynn, Norfolk, home of the 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley. Warm: Prince Charles greets media magnate Alexander Lebedev during a visit to Houghton Hall, Norfolk, for the opening of an exhibition of Sir Robert Walpole's art collection . On trial: Mr Lebedev is standing trial in Moscow on charges of 'hooliganism motivated by political hated' arising from an incident in which he punched fellow businessman Sergei Polonsky . The charges are inspired by a desire within the Kremlin to punish him for funding investigations into official corruption and for his co-ownership of Novaya Gazeta, an investigative newspaper in Moscow. Mr Lebedev is a patron of Houghton Revisited, a unique opportunity to view the art collection of Britain’s first Prime Minister. It includes works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Frans Hals, Velazquez and Veronese, displayed in their original setting for the first time in 230 years. After Walpole’s death, his collection was sold to Catherine the Great of Russia to settle his dissolute grandson’s debts. Back home: Houghton Hall, the Norfolk home of the Marquess of Cholmondeley, was built to house  Britain's first prime minister Sir Robert Walpole and his art collection . They have been kept ever since in St Petersburg’s Hermitage Museum, which has lent the paintings for the exhibition. Mr Lebedev told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I am very happy to be a patron of this amazing event where the cultures of my country and Britain are brought together in spectacular fashion. ‘Next week I will be fighting for my liberty in what I feel is one of the most unjust trials imaginable. I only hope common sense will prevail.’ lHoughton Revisited: Masterpieces From The Hermitage opens on Friday at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, and runs until September 29.

The past is the past and we have to move forward so thank you. I sincerely, sincerely appreciate what you've done.' In November last year Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine 'probably in one of my drunken stupors' but said he had hidden his drug and alcohol problems. The scandal-hit mayor was coaxed from his seat by a performer singing Bob Marley in the council .

The 46-year-old from Denver, Colorado, said: 'I had stopped by a farmer's canal where I normally photograph ducks and kingfisher. 'I was hoping at first to find the kingfisher who frequents the area but I noticed someone had cut down a few trees and the bird was gone.

The American kestrel, also known as the sparrow hawk, is a small falcon and the only kestrel found in the Americas. They are found in a wide variety of habitats, but are most common in lowland areas and open country with sparse trees which provide roosts when it is foraging. At just 19cm to 21cm  long, they also the smallest falcons in North America. The American kestrel hunts by hovering in the air with rapid wing beats or perching and scanning the ground for prey. Its diet typically consists of grasshoppers, lizards, mice, and small birds. American kestrels only mate with one individual, forming a strong and permanent bond. The females can demonstrate aggressive behaviour when competing for a mate .","Project manager Kurt Bowman spotted the birds fighting  in Colorado .

He had fallen from a first floor balcony . Cause of death: Rhoden, 25, pictured with an unnamed female, died from a cardiac arrest after being restrained by officers . He then picked himself up before running through the hotel screaming 'someone's trying to kill me', a police source said. Officers from the Civil Guard restrained him and put him into an ambulance to be sedated. Rumours circulated on Twitter that Mr Rhoden had been beaten up by police before his death. But a Civil Guard source said: 'Our officers do not beat people up. 'They restrained him for his own safety and helped him into the ambulance where he was sedated.' Paramedics spent 40 minutes trying to revive Mr Rhoden but he died at the scene. Police were called to the hotel after Mr Rhoden plunged from the balcony at around 10.30pm last night. Keen sportsman: Mr Rhoden (third right) with Wigan Warriors Academy Under-18s and Wigan Reserve Grade players in 2007 . The police source said: 'He was acting wildly and from his behaviour we believe he may have been taking drugs. 'He was a guest at the hotel. He jumped from the hotel balcony onto a patio below, then picked himself up and ran through the hotel screaming like a madman that someone was trying to kill him. 'Our officers restrained him for his own safety and put him into an ambulance so he could be sedated. 'The paramedics tried to revive him but he died in the ambulance. An autopsy will reveal the cause of death.' The autopsy will also determine whether Mr Rhoden had been taking drugs. Mr Rhoden, from Wigan, played prop forward as a junior for rugby league side Wigan Warriors and for England's under 17 side. Staff from Ibiza Rocks were today comforting friends and family at the hotel. Probe: An autopsy will also determine whether Mr Rhoden had been taking drugs . A source at the hotel said: 'Mr Rhoden's a big, big guy and it took a lot to restrain him. 'Several of our staff witnessed him being restrained but nobody has reported seeing the police use excessive force or beating him. 'He had fallen from a balcony and then made his way through public areas of the hotel acting very strangely. 'He made it out into the street where the police took over.' A spokesman for the hotel said: 'We can confirm there was a fatality in Ibiza last night and our sincerest and heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of the individual concerned at this very difficult time. Popular: Mr Rhoden enjoying a night out with friends . 'We continue to assist the Spanish Police with their investigation and cannot make further comment about the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident until a full enquiry into the cause of death is complete.' Thomas Brindle wrote on Twitter: 'I am devastated to hear the news about Luke Rhoden, former team mate and top bloke. 'Very sad times. RIP.' British consular staff were today offering assistance to family members. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza on 3 September. 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' This summer tourists were warned of a dangerous new mind-bending drug circulating on the island said to send some users into a crazed rage. The drug, known as bath salts or 'cannibal', contains the powerful stimulant MDVP. His former club Wigan Warriors said: 'Wigan Warriors are saddened to hear of the death of former youth player Luke Rhoden. 'Having come through the club's scholarship system Luke played for the Warriors academy in 2007 and 2008 before moving on to play semi-professionally at Oldham.'","Luke Rhoden, 25, died from a cardiac arrest after an altercation with police .

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Aston Villa striker Andreas Weimann has vowed to win his Austria place back after being axed for the first time in two years. The striker has been dropped for their opening Euro 2016 qualifier with Sweden on Monday. Coach Marcel Koller opted to give 1860 Munich striker Rubin Okotie his first call-up in five years and leave Weimann at home. Determined: Aston Villa forward Andreas Weimann has vowed to win back his place in the Austria squad . New territory: Weimann (centre) made his Austria debut in 2012 and has been dropped for the first time . But the 23-year-old, who scored his second of the season in Villa's 2-1 Barclays Premier League win over Hull last weekend, insists he will work to reclaim his spot. He said: 'I am only on standby. I would have liked to go but the manager has tried to change it. I've been called up for the last two years every time but he just wanted to change it so I've got to keep going. 'He called me and said he thought for this game - we are playing Sweden - another player would be better suited. I've got to accept it and keep playing well here.' Weimann's omission leaves Stoke's Marko Arnautovic as the only Premier League-based player in Koller's squad. Villa's Weimann has 11 caps but is yet to score for his country since making his debut in 2012. Pointing upwards: Weimann celebrates scoring against Hull City at Villa Park in the Premier League . Goal shy: Weimann is Villa's top scorer this season with two goals but he has never netted for Austria . He is Villa's top scorer with two goals in four games in an impressive start for Paul Lambert's side. They have seven points from their first three games as Lambert begins to blood midfielder Jack Grealish. The 18-year-old has come through the club's academy and is expected to make an impact on the first team this season. He has played for the Ireland Under 21 side but is still eligible for England and is yet to decide which country to play for. 'I think he's a really good footballer,' Weimann told the Birmingham Mail. 'In pre-season he has been heavily involved with us, he has done really well. He came on against Stoke and didn't look out of place at all. He has been going well. 'He is quite confident. On the pitch, he is definitely confident. Off the pitch he likes to talk. He talks to you, he gets on with everyone and everyone has helped him when he's needed it.'

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . A British man on holiday in Nicaragua has rescued two large loggerhead turtles from potentially ending up on a dinner menu. Chris Skone-Roberts, 44, was horrified when he saw two 5ft loggerheads with their fins tied up, on their backs struggling to breathe in the garden of a bar on Little Corn Island off the east coast of the Central American country. The animals had been dragged from the sea and left to suffocate before they would have been butchered and served up as a local delicacy. Scroll down for video . The rescue team carry the two turtles back to the seas after rescuing them from a pub garden on Little Corn Island off the east coast of Nicaragua . Mr Skone-Roberts tried to throw water on the reptiles to stop them dehydrating further but a woman pulled him off, angrily shouting that they were her property. It is thought that once dead, the woman would have sold the meat on the black market. Mr Skone-Roberts rang the police to report the illegal activity, which sadly is becoming increasingly common in Nicaragua. British tourist Chris Skone-Roberts was horrified when he saw two 5ft loggerheads with their fins tied on their backs struggling to breathe in the garden of a bar on Little Corn Island off the east coast of Nicaragua . Having been given the go-ahead by the police, the rescue team put the turtles on to carts and wheeled them back to the sea . Safety in sight: At the beach the rescue team cut the ties that bind and prepare to release the turtles . Almost there: The end of their ordeal is close at hand as the rescuers prepare to return the sea reptiles  to the brine . The cart is submerged gently to allow the turtles time to acclimatise to being back in the sea . While he waited for the police, Mr Skone-Roberts rounded up a large group of tourists and divers to help rescue the dying animals . ""Sometimes you are faced with a situation so outrageous that you have no other choice than to intervene and right a wrong,’ he said. ""These poor creatures are endangered enough but to leave them to die like this was inhumane so we had to act."" Easy does it: The turtles had been left on their backs to stop them struggling and hurting themselves . The wooden carts are slowly lowered and the turtle is all but immersed in the salty water . One final maintenance check before the turtles are released into their natural habitat . The team spent 30 minutes pouring buckets of water over the animals to try to revive them. By the time the police arrived, the turtles were breathing again and the police ordered them to be released. The turtles were put on to carts and taken back to the sea. Once in the water the rescuers, with the help of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a non-profit, marine conservation organisation, eased the turtles back into swimming before cutting their ties. ""We left them on their backs to stop them from struggling and tearing their fins apart,"" Chris, a PADI Rescue Diver and former paramedic, added. ""Once we cut the ties they went off like the clappers, it was wonderful to see."" A growing trend in sea turtle meat is thought to be behind the drastically reducing numbers of the endangered species across the world. In Nicaragua it is estimated more than 35,000 sea turtles are killed each year so they can be sold at significantly high prices for their meat and eggs across the world. The turtle, freed from its restraints, flaps its fins and 'went off like the clappers' One last check and the turtle is released back into the wild .","Chris Skone-Roberts, 44, was on holiday on Little Corn Island off the east coast of Nicaragua .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Stefan Scepovic insisted Celtic had always been his first choice after finally completing his controversial on-off move from Sporting Gijon. The 24-year-old Serbia international looked to have turned his back on the Scottish champions in favour of a move to Getafe despite passing a Celtic medical in Paris and agreeing terms on a move to Glasgow. But after the Parkhead club had made their disgust known at Scepovic’s change of heart, suddenly the £2.2million deal was back on again amid claims that Spanish financial play rules had sunk the move to Getafe. Remember the name: Stefan Scepovic signed for Celtic from Sporting Gijon amid Getafe interest . As he was unveiled on Tuesday night on a four-year deal, Scepovic vowed to work hard to win over the fans. But he flatly denied messing Celtic about and even challenged his detractors to prove anything other than Ronny Deila’s side were always his preferred option. ‘My first choice was always Celtic,’ insisted the striker. ‘I never said I didn’t want to come here. I don’t know why people say things like that. When I spoke with my family and friends, I always said my choice was to come here. Yes, there were some problems in the deal but the most important thing is that I am here now. ‘I know (some fans might be wary). But . they can search the internet and they will never find any quotes from me where I said I didn’t want to come to Celtic. Never — because I didn’t say it. ‘I know Celtic is a big club with a lot of history and great fans. I want to prove I can play at a big club like Celtic. ‘I’ll work hard and do everything to prove I can play here and bring something different. Ball skills: The striker shows off his keepie-uppies at Parkhead . Controversial: It looked as if he favoured a move to Getafe, before FFP regulations, he then landed in Glasgow . ‘Monday was a tough day, but that’s football,’ he added. ‘I was in my house watching TV and I was really a little bit nervous because of the situation. But at the same time I was calm. I had a choice before I chose Celtic and I was happy when I knew I would be a Celtic player. ‘What made me nervous? It’s normal. I was nervous because maybe there were some problems. But I don’t want to look at what happened before. I just look to the future.’","Scepovic looked like he was moving to Getafe on a busy Monday .

"By . From Simon Murphy In Lima, Peru . Melissa Reid made the warning on the eve of her 21st birthday . Drug mule Melissa Reid has issued a stark warning – from her grim prison cell – to youngsters starting their gap year not to follow her wild, drug-fuelled lifestyle in Ibiza. On the eve of her 21st birthday – a year after being caught smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru – she has warned of the perils of having too much ‘fun’ on the Mediterranean party island. In a diary entry from her new prison, Ancon 2 – surrounded by shanty towns hours outside Lima in the Peruvian desert – Reid, who is serving a near seven-year sentence, wrote: ‘A year ago today, if someone was warning me of the dangers of drug smuggling, I would probably tell them to f*** off. And how I would not be so stupid and how it would never happen to me. But look at me now, Modulo 1, Pabellon 3B of Ancon 2 prison, Peru. So just get the word out for me and tell anyone that will listen, it’s not smart, not big and definitely not clever. ‘As glamorous as the drug lords make it out, it’s not. Our generation are always finding a new, low budget, fast-hitting drug – if it’s not Ket [Ketamine], it’s pills or coke [cocaine], and why not throw a bit of acid in to make it a real night to remember! She writes ‘it’s this crazy lifestyle’ that got her into trouble in Ibiza. ‘The island of your dreams – oh sorry, you mean the island where everyone is living in a dream. Good luck when you come back to reality is all I can say!’ She added: ‘Who knows, I might even be back in Ibiza one day myself, although with a different head on my shoulders and the only thing I would do with the line of coke you put out for me on the key to our apartment, on the dance floor of a nightclub, is blow it back in your face! 'I will also now be watching my back for years to come and double checking the door is locked every night because, as everyone knows, drugs is a big boys’ game! ‘Once you have seen a man pulling liquid cocaine condoms from his a***; a woman being sick and having diarrhoea in a hole in the ground at the same time, and a child being separated from her mother at three years old so her mother can serve a 15-year prison service, as I have, you have had more than enough!’ Melissa, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, and Belfast-born Michaella McCollum Connolly, 21, had travelled separately to the Spanish isle of Ibiza last year to enjoy a summer of partying. Ms Reid, from Glasgow, was caught smuggling £1.5m worth of cocaine out of Peru . An extract from Melissa's diary, which she has written from prison Ancon 2 near Lima, Peru, warning others of the perils of having too much 'fun' on the Mediterranean island . But they ended up flying to Lima, where they were caught attempting to smuggle cocaine out of the country in their suitcases. They claimed they were forced into the drugs run by gangsters but they later dropped that tale and were each sentenced to six years and eight months after pleading guilty. Melissa’s parents are currently in Peru visiting their daughter and last Saturday her mother Debbie took a chocolate cake into the prison for her to celebrate her 21st birthday. Her parents Debbie and Billy, both 54, have travelled to Peru to visit their daughter in prison. They took her a chocolate cake to celebrate her birthday . The 54-year-old mother of four said: ‘This time last year I thought maybe Melissa might be home for her 21st. Obviously not. I took in lots of cards from friends and family. 'We got her a sash and everyone joined in when we were singing happy birthday.’ Her husband, Billy, 54, added: ‘We’re making the best of a bad situation. The key to the door takes on a new meaning in her predicament.’ Michaela McCollum Connolly, pictured left, and Melissa Reid, pictured right, was caught in August 2013 . The duo tried to smuggle £1.5m worth of cocaine on a flight to Spain from Peru. They are now sharing a cell together in the prison, along with six other prisoners . Melissa and Michaella share a cramped cell with six other prisoners, sleeping on opposite top bunks. Locked away from 6pm to 6am, they spend their time reading and, of late, knitting. The toilet in the middle of the cell is a hole in the ground. The pair, who have been dubbed ‘The Peru Two’, are clinging to hopes of a prisoner transfer to the UK. Earlier this month those hopes appeared to have been bolstered after it emerged Peruvian authorities confirmed they had ‘accepted’ Michaella’s prison transfer request.","Melissa wrote diary entry from her new prison, Ancon 2, outside Lima, Peru .

"By . Ashley Collman . Nearly three months after his death in a fiery car crash, Paul Walker's will is finally being settled. Today, a judge in Santa Barbara court appointed the actor's father, Paul Walker Sr, as executor of his estate - just as Walker detailed in his will. Also in the will was Walker's wish that 15-year-old daughter Meadow be raised by his mother, Cheryl Walker. After the crash: Paul Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr (right),  was named executor of the late actor's estate in Santa Barabara court Thursday. The actor (left) died in a fiery car crash at the end of November . Tragic end: Walker, who became famous for his role in the Fast & Furious franchise, was in the passenger seat of a red Porsche when his friend lost control of the car and crashed . Walker's entire family was in court today, including Meadow and her mother Rebecca Soteros, but a decision has not yet been made on who will be the teen's guardian. For now, she is living with her grandmother. Left behind: Walker had just recently reconnected with his 15-year-old daughter Meadow (right), who came to live with him in Southern California in 2011 after spending most of her life with her mother in Hawaii . While it seems unconventional that Meadow would be raised by her grandmother instead of her mother in Hawaii, both the teen and her mom are reportedly OK with the set-up since Meadow wants to continue living in California. The actor, who became famous for his role in the Fast and Furious series, died at the end of November while riding in a red Prosche with his friend in Santa Clarita, California. Walker was in the passenger seat when friend Roger Rodas lost control of the vehicle and crashed. The early death was made even more tragic by the fact that Walker had just recently reconnected with his daughter. Walker had been mostly absent from Meadow's life as she grew up with her mother Rebecca Soteros in Hawaii. In 2011, Meadow moved to California to live with her father. That move had a profound affect on Walker in the final years of his life. 'She's the best partner I've ever had,' Walker told Entertainment Weekly last year. 'I've never had anything like this in my life. I've been so transient; I've been on my own since I was 16. There's a part of me who feels like I'm making up for lost time.' As evidence for how much he loved his daughter, Walker left his entire $25million fortune to Meadow in his will. Remembered: Fans of Walker set up a memorial near the crash site in Santa Clarita .","A Santa Barbara judge approved Walker's wish that his father execute his estate after the actor died in a November car crash .

The Spaniard was at fault for Manchester City's opener in the 3-1 defeat last week but he responded with a brilliant 60-yard run to score the Reds' third in Sunday's victory at Tottenham.

'When I stole the ball from (Andros) Townsend and saw a way through, all I could think about was getting to their goal and scoring. I didn't care how many metres I had to run. 'I hope it isn't my only one as I hope to dedicate many more to Liverpool's fans. 'If they didn't know me before, they will from now on thanks to my goal against Tottenham.'

"By . Paul Newman for MailOnline . Alex Hales wants to show he deserves a place at the top table by forming a 50-over opening partnership with Alastair Cook that can prove England’s captain and their one-day cricket are not stuck in the dark ages. Hales is aiming to emulate Australia’s David Warner and complete the journey from Twenty20 specialist to Test opener but first he is tasked with providing the power in England’s one-day cricket they are accused of sorely lacking. The Notts batsman faces India in the third one-day international at his home Trent Bridge ground as the flag carrier for the breed of modern big-hitting batsman that are still all too often treated with suspicion by England. Power play: Alex Hales, in the Trent Bridge nets, is relishing life at the top of the order for England . Criticism of England’s approach to the 50-over game and Cook’s role in it from Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan this week coupled with an abject performance in Cardiff means the pressure is once again back on the skipper. Hales, whose form has been transformed since he was sent out on loan to Worcestershire at the start of this season in order to get a game, is adamant he is the man to lift that pressure now he has finally been given his 50-over chance. ‘This is a dream come true,’ said Hales of his England 50-over elevation after enduring a torrid 2013. ‘And making my debut now is all the better after how last year went in first-class cricket. I’ve had to work really hard to show people I can be more than just a Twenty20 slogger and I’m really happy this opportunity has come along, even more so because I’ll be in front of my home crowd.’ His style, which is more orthodox than he is often given credit for, has the potential to complement that of Cook, who silenced those who questioned his one-day credentials three years ago by scoring four hundreds and six half centuries in his first 19 innings as 50-over captain. Now the man who has led England to more one-day victories than any other captain has to do so again. A whole new ball game: Alastair Cook spins out a pass with a rugby ball at Trent Bridge . Kicking on: Hales gives the ball a boot as he prepares to smash India around on his home ground . England (probable): Cook (capt), Hales, Bell, Root, Morgan, Buttler (wkt), Stokes, Woakes, Tredwell, Finn, Anderson. India (probable): Dhawan, Samson, Kohli, Rahane, Raina, Dhoni (capt/wkt), Jadeja, Ashwin, Kumar, Shami, M Sharma. Start: 10.30am, Trent Bridge. Umpires: Paul Reiffel (Aus) and Michael Gough (Eng). Swann on Friday repeated his view first expressed on radio that Cook should stand down from the one-day captaincy in his column in The Sun and said: ‘I think being one-day captain is a poisoned chalice for him. He just doesn’t need the job. 'The 50-over cricket England are playing is outdated and I feel it will be a painful winter. This is not a witch-hunt but I don’t want Cooky to be part of it.’ Hales, until this season a county colleague of Swann, defended his captain. ‘Everyone’s entitled to their opinion but the guys in the dressing room are a hundred per cent behind Alastair and if you look at his record in one-day cricket it’s a pretty good one,’ said Hales. ‘All the guys are backing him to lead from the front as we look to bounce back in this series.’ Running the show: Moeen Ali and Hales seem to be enjoying the sprint training . Much of what Swann and Vaughan said in a BBC Test Match Special wet weather debate was valid but it also should be said that it is surely far too simplistic to believe England could throw James Vince, James Taylor and Jason Roy into the team as well as Hales and expect them all to swim rather than sink. Taylor in particular has cause to feel hard done by, as does Ravi Bopara whose omission from this squad remains mystifying, but there remains good reasons why Cook, Ian Bell, Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were named to face India while England have not been helped by the fact that their key one-day batsman in Eoin Morgan has looked out of sorts. They have three more chances against an India side who will be without the injured Rohit Sharma for the rest of the series to prove the selectors right while Roy will be given his chance in the Twenty20 international that follows. In the centre: Chris Jordan (middle) takes a pass during the training game of rugby . If Hales, the most technically adept of the next generation, can build on his debut score of 40 in Wales which stood out in a lamentable England performance he has every chance of putting pressure on Sam Robson ahead of England’s next Test assignment in the Caribbean in April. ‘Test cricket is definitely in the back of my head,’ said Hales. ‘It always has been, even after the terrible time I had last year. It’s always been my dream to play Test cricket and that’s going to come with a lot more hard work. ‘There are people around the world who have shown what can be done. David Warner, Chris Gayle and Virender Sehwag, those guys are attacking opening batsmen. But it will take a lot of technical work and that’s up to me.’ A big performance in a series levelling win would be a start.

"By . Pa Reporter . Pakistan succumbed to their lowest one-day score in five years as a pathetic 102 all out helped Sri Lanka claim a seven-wicket victory in the series decider in Dambulla. The tourists were badly let down by their batsmen as they were dismissed for their worst total in Sri Lanka in 32.1 overs, with just three batsmen reaching double figures and only Fawad Alam showing any sort of resolve in his 38 not out. Thisara Perera took four lower-order wickets but Pakistan's batsmen only had themselves to blame for their calamity before Sri Lanka comfortably knocked off the runs with a whopping 178 balls to spare, thanks to Tillakaratne Dilshan's unbeaten 50, as they clinched the series 2-1. High five! Sri Lanka players celebrate after sealing a 2-1 one-day series victory over Pakistan . Seventh heaven: Tillakaratne Dilshan hit an unbeaten 50 to help Sri Lanka win by seven wickets . Not good enough: Pakistan players leave the field after their lowest one-day total for five years . Read em and weep: The total of 102 was Pakistan's worst ever one-day total against Sri Lanka . Their task was made ever so slightly easier as heavy rain meant the contest was reduced to 48 overs per side and Sri Lanka's victory target narrowed down to 101. Dilshan settled into his stride with three crunching fours in the second over as Sri Lanka's opening stand put on 46 to all but ensure the win. Upul Thranga, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene were all dismissed but Dilshan led the way, taking Sri Lanka past their victory target in the 19th over with his ninth four that also brought up his half-century. But Sri Lanka were earlier grateful for the type of implosion only usually reserved for Pakistan, who chose to bat after winning the toss. Bowled over: Thisara Perera took four low order wickets s Pakistan capitulated in dramatic fashion . One man team: Fawad Alam was the only Pakistan batsman to reach double figures . Hat's off! Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga dives to take a catch to dismiss Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal . Dhammika Prasad removed openers Sharjeel Khan and Ahmed Shehzad, and Pakistan had lost their top three batsmen before the eighth over when Lasith Malinga had Mohammad Hafeez trapped in front by an inswinger that would have gone on to clip leg stump. Pakistan's efforts were further undermined when captain Misbah-ul-Haq found himself well short of his ground after attempting a quick single - with Angelo Mathews' throw from point condemning his opposite number to the third run-out in his last seven innings. Umar Akmal's needless slash to mid-on gave Perera the first of his four scalps, while Shahid Afridi fell in characteristic fashion, caught on the off-side aiming a big heave off Seekkuge Prasanna. Champions! Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews (C) celebrates with his teammates and the trophy . An hour's rain delay meant Sri Lanka had to wait to polish off their opponents but there was to be no wag in the tail from Pakistan, with Fawad left stranded following a resolute 73-ball innings that contained three fours. It was Pakistan's lowest total in an ODI since they crumpled to 75 all out against the same opposition in Lahore in 2009 and ultimately handed victory to Sri Lanka.

"By . Ben Nagle For Mailonline . Graeme Swann has repeated his call for Alastair Cook to relinquish his place in England's one-day side, likening the team's current methods to a 'two-litre diesel in a Formula One race'. Swann, who retired from cricket during England's miserable winter tour to Australia, earlier this week urged captain Cook to give up his limited-overs place and allow the likes of Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Vince and James Taylor the chance to show what they can do in a more exciting and attacking line-up. Swann believes England's current 'outdated' ODI approach and tactics means they have no chance of winning next year's World Cup. Cook (left) and Swann (right) were teammates until Swann's retirement in December 2013 . Cook, opening the batting for England against India on Wednesday, has been urged by Swann to stand down as one day captain . Cook responded to his former team-mate's comments after England's crushing 133-run Royal London Series defeat to India on Wednesday by saying: 'I don't think it's that helpful - especially from a so-called friend' - but Swann is refusing to back down. He wrote in his column in The Sun on Friday: 'Real mates are honest with each other. I'm no longer in the England dressing room and it is my job now as a pundit to give my honest thoughts. 'I think being one-day captain is a poisoned chalice for him. He just doesn't need the job. The cricket England are playing in 50-over cricket is outdated and I fear it will be a painful winter for the team. 'I don't want him to be part of it. This is not a witch-hunt against 'Cookie' and I'm still a huge supporter of his captaincy in Test cricket. But, in one-day matches, I want England to play the exciting cricket they promised six months ago when Peter Moores took over as head coach. Swann (right) has taken up a role in the media since his retirement from cricket. 'We're happy to tootle along in a two-litre diesel in a Formula One race. 'England must change their strategy to have any chance of winning the World Cup. 'I'm 100 per cent behind him as Test captain. But, in one-day cricket, you should pick your 11 best players and choose your captain from there and I don't think he is one of the best 11 players.'

"By . Ben Nagle For Mailonline . Kevin Pietersen is enjoying some time away from cricket, by taking a breathtaking helicopter ride over the capital. The former England cricketer, whose international career finished in February when the ECB decided not to consider him for future selection, posted two pictures on his Instagram account to show his 78,000 followers the view. The first of which, taken next to the helicopter Pietersen flew in, shows the current Surrey player smiling before he boards his flight. The second photograph shows the view from the air, with Pietersen looking down over the Houses of Parliament, with stunning views across the rest of the capital. It is currently unclear what Pietersen's next permanent cricketing move will be, as the South African born batsman continues to 'freelance' playing 20/20 cricket around the world.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Former Wales and Scarlets prop Rhys Thomas is undergoing surgery on Tuesday ahead of a heart transplant. Thomas, 32, announced his retirement from rugby in April 2012 after suffering a heart attack in January of that year. On that occasion he was taken ill while taking part in a cardio session in the gym at Scarlets' ground, treated by their medical team and then rushed to hospital, where he underwent a life-saving quadruple heart bypass operation. Under the knife: Former Wales prop Rhys Thomas is having surgery on Tuesday ahead of a heart transplant . Thomas' agent Christian Abt was quoted on Tuesday by the BBC as saying: 'I can confirm he is having an operation today to prepare him for a heart transplant in the near future.' Among Thomas' former team-mates wishing him well on Twitter were Scarlets and Wales centre Scott Williams, who wrote: 'All the best with the op.' And Ospreys number eight Joe Bearman, who played with Thomas at Newport Gwent Dragons, wrote: 'Good luck big guy. Get that pump in there, our thoughts are with you mate.' South Africa-born Thomas, who won seven caps for Wales, came through the ranks at Newport, breaking into the first team in 2003 and going on to earn a place in the Dragons squad when Welsh rugby turned to a regional model. Good luck: Thomas, seen here playing for Scarlets, has been inundated with messages wishing him well . His impressive form for the Rodney Parade side saw him win his first cap as a replacement in the first Test on the tour of Argentina in 2006. But he missed several months of the following season after suffering what he has described as a 'mild heart attack', before eventually being given medical clearance to return to action. He started against Italy during Wales' 2008 Grand Slam campaign after missing out on selection for the 2007 World Cup, and left the Dragons in 2009 to join the Scarlets.","Rhys Thomas having transplant on Tuesday .
